| For the scatterplot, instead of looking at each date individually breakdown the reviews into aggregates of years or months. | We have decided to remove time as an attribute in the scatterplot.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Keep the table to 6 columns and give options for additional columns.                                                        | We have incorporated this idea and are showing less columns on the initial load.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| We were asked how a user might search for a book, if the table contains 100 rows.                                           | We added a new visualization that displays all of the book covers, and allows the users to have a better visual way of searching through the books. We also talked about adding a search box if time permits.                                    |
| Explore if there are duplicate authors.                                                                                     | From initial exploration, there is not a lot of duplicate authors. So we will not be visualizing this information.                                                                                                                               |
| Add a breakdown of the book categories. (Sci-fi, Horror, Thriller, etc.)                                                    | The dataset we are working with currently, does not breakdown the book categories. So in order for us to do this, we would need to look for this information in another source. This could be an optional feature depending on time constraints. |
| Look at the Top 10 books for genre or year.                                                                                 | We think exploring the Top 10 books by reviews would be interesting and will try to incorporate.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Ratings for books over the years.                                                                                           | We plan on having a visualization in the detailed view of each book that would explore the ratings over time.                                                                                                                                    |
| Pre-process the data so it doesn't affect the page loading.                                                                 | Once we have the visualizations worked out, we will evaluate the load time to see if we have data that can be pre-processed.                                                                                                                     |
| Use color to identity top 10 results in the table.                                                                          | Since the user will be able to sort the table, we think it is a good idea to highlight the top 10 results for each sortable column. It would help the user identify trends with so many rows.                                                    |
| Brushing on the scatterplot to interact with the table.                                                                     | We will add brushing on the scatterplot, that will allow selected points to be highlighted on the table.                                                                                                                                         |
| Only show 10-20 tables on initial load and give users the options to select more tables.                                    | Limiting the table initially might cause confusion. We think with some of the other highlighting, sorting and filtering features the user will have control to limit the dataset if the choose.                                                  |
| Show average row on top of table.                                                                                           | If we do allow for filtering, it might be helpful to add context to the filtered rows by showing averages for the whole dataset on top of the table.                                                                                             |
