It is always interesting to read an old Cyberpunk novel and see what the author got right and what he got wrong.  In Stephenson’s concept of the near future, privatization has run amuck and governments are weak.  Stephenson’s version of the Internet/World Wide Web is called the Metaverse, which has an uncanny resemblance to a web site called “Second Life”.<br /> Some critics believe Snow Crash to be a satire of William Gibson’s Neuromancer, and I think it is a legitimate interpretation.  In the opening chapter, one of the main characters, actually called Hiro Protagonist, is delivering pizzas and calling himself the Deliverator.  There is also a Jerry Falwell-type character who finances his church by controlling all the fiber optic cable in the world.<br /> On the other hand, Stephenson interrupts the narrative to deliver information critical to understanding the story.  He did not have the writing skill to seamlessly insert important information in the text.  Furthermore, many of the characters are stereotypes, such as Uncle Enzo, a mafia boss, and other characters, such as Raven, an Aleutian, are motivated by ideologies, not feelings.",2015-07-27

Big businesses have gotten really big, owning neighborhoods where people are quasi-citizens of the company. They run legitimate businesses like Uncle Enzo's CosaNostra Pizza, Inc., where Hiro works. They also have political connections and, often, organized crime connections as well. The other future development is how the internet has taken off and become a quasi-reality where people have alternate versions of themselves (called avatars) and interact with others who are physically far away. Hiro spends a lot of time in this &#34;metaverse&#34; and has customized several things about his avatar and his &#34;property&#34; in cyberspace. He is a hacker after all. The story hops back and forth between the real world and the computer world.<br /><br />Things start to change when two things happen. First, on a failed pizza delivery he meets up with Y. T., a fifteen year-old Kourier who delivers messages by skateboarding from sender to receiver. She uses a magnetic harpoon to attach herself to vehicles so she can deliver items swiftly. She becomes an ongoing ally. Second, Hiro's friend Da5id dies when he sees a certain image that makes his mind melt. There's a virus called Snow Crash that's a virtual version of the recreational drug Snow Crash which has become popular but also deadly. Hiro's investigation into the virus catapults him and Y.T. into a fantastic, far-fetched adventure.<br /><br />The set-up of the book is very interesting. The world is a fascinating imagining of the future, though bits of it are less convincing. Money in the future is highly inflated and some bills are referred to as &#34;Gippers&#34; and &#34;Meeses.&#34; That was surely hip and relevant in the early 1990s when the book was written but I doubt Millenials who read this book will have any idea to whom Stephenson is referring. The samegoes for the L. Ron Hubbard character. The story also bogs down in unnecessarily long exposition about ancient Sumerian mythology which is tied into the plot. About half-way through the book I ran out of excitement and energy as a reader. Neither came back as I continued through the rest of the book. The action picks up at the end but my emotional investment in the story was gone so it wasn't as compelling and exciting as it should have been.

On writing style and the surface level flow of the plot, it’s worthy of five stars.<br /><br />As for how he develops his plot, specifically, fair chunks of the backbone and background of the plot? It’s three stars at best, maybe only two. I could have considered 3.5 stars overall, but went for three. And now, I'll explain why.<br /><br />Stephenson does a lot of deliberate violence to some elements of philosophy and religion. And, having read his bio, he’s smart enough to have known better, that’s why I call it deliberate.<br /><br />The first big thing I noticed in this way? Stephenson gets wrong monistic philosophers. Leibniz and Berkeley immediately jumped to mind as anti-materialist monists, contra his claim that all monistic philosophers are materialists.<br /><br />Even more wrong is his Procrustrean take on the documentary hypothesis, that is the historical-critical idea that the Torah was created by material from four authors, the Yahwist (J), the Elohist (E), the Deuteronomist (D) and the Priestly author (P), with final editing most commonly presumed to be by someone in the P tradition. His idea that E was that heavily edited by D is iffy at best, and he entirely ignores the P section, which goes back to sacrificial and other Temple cultus prescriptions.<br /><br />And, I know why he ignores the P section. It entirely undercuts his idea that D was influenced by Sumerian writing and building on the linguistic virus from Sumerian writing that’s the whole cornerstone of the novel. Oops!<br /><br />But, that’s not all.<br /><br />Yeah, he was born in Fort Meade; beyond being a college computer luster, maybe his dad worked for the NSA. That’s no excuse for his forced seeing of binaries, as in coding 0 and 1, where they don’t exist.<br /><br />He also is wrong on tie-ins or riffs on memes and NLP. I’ll cut him slack on memes based on the date of his writing, as they were more scientifically respectable then than now? But NLP? It was known to be pseudoscience 15 years ago.<br /><br />As for philosophy? If he didn’t knowingly botch monism, then he’s an example of a scientismy type who ought to actually talk to some philosophers.<br /><br />If other novels of his have as good of writing, or nearly so, and better thought processes and intellectual honesty, I’d be glad to read them. If not, this taste was enough.e then than now? But NLP? It was known to be pseudoscience 15 years ago.<br /><br />As for philosophy?

But does it fully deserve the hype?","Review Originally Posted At: www.FictionForesight.com<br /><br />Let’s start off easy…Snow Crash is full of awesome concepts: Badass mixed-race sword fighter and hacker Hiro Protagonist? Check. Plucky sidekick girl who skateboards for a living? Check. An ominous antagonist who carries a nuke in the sidecar of his motorcycle? Uh – CHECK. The future US is ran not by the government but by franchises and corporate mafias? Obviously. Fast-paced action inside a shared computer universe called the Metaverse? Yes please. A mysterious computer virus incapacitating the top hackers around the world? You know it.<br /><br />Stephenson’s third full-length novel brought him to the forefront of science fiction, and it’s easy to see why. In Snow Crash, he showed an uncanny ability to extrapolate actual technologies into very robust, believable, real-world applications. The Metaverse is an interconnected virtual social space, which we see an echo of in today’s social media and MMO gaming. Stephenson also popularized the use of the word “avatar” to describe a virtual body or character. In addition, we see several technologies in the novel that are still coming into popular usage – the skateboarders use something eerily similar to the “Hovding Cyclist Airbag”. Our main character acquires a digital library and a program that is basically Google Earth. And the Snow Crash virus – our main plot point – is, in its most basic form, an internet meme.<br /><br />The ugly side of all these fantastic things is that there hardly seems room in the book for anything else. Snow Crash is so jam-packed full of amazing ideas that the universe feels somehow incomplete, the characters are two-dimensional at best, and the ending – whew, don’t even get me started. We’ll come back to that in a bit.<br /><br />The story takes place in a future United States, where the government has become irrelevant and the country marches to the beat of a type of “anarcho-capitalism.” People live in suburban enclaves, run by franchises such as “Mr. Lee’s Greater Hong Kong,” and the American Mafia, who now makes a large profit from delivering pizza. The Los Angeles highways are still lined with lights, but they are patrolled by a private security with easily greased palms, and unless you are sponsored by one of the big businesses you have to fend for yourself.<br /><br />Life outside the sovereignty of these megacorps is the niche that our protagonists occupy – living in storage containers, hosting underground rock shows, collecting information to sell to any interested parties. Hiro’s life in L.A. is gritty, bright, and feels a little dangerous. However, when he follows the Snow Crash trail to a massive floating raft-city off the coast of Oregon, we suddenly lose all sense of place. It’s understandable that Stephenson doesn't want to bog down the narrative, especially just before the height of the action; but there’s so much he fails to mention that would give our story a setting inside a larger, complete universe. The West Coast doesn't just exist in a cell. I grew up there, and they’d like to think that the rest of the country doesn't exist, but that’s just not true. So where is it? For that matter, how does the rest of the world react to the way Mr. Lee and the Mafiosos are running the U.S.? Couldn't tell you. As it stands, the novel provides just enough explanation to get away with it, but we still feel like our characters are just moving through a space without their feet hitting the ground.<br /><br />Ah, yes, the characters. Like much of the rest of this work, they sound awesome in concept. But when it comes to creating a fully formed, three-dimensional human being, Stephenson falls short. Hiro Protagonist has little to no back-story, and his motivations for pursuing information regarding the Snow Crash virus are about as imaginative as his name. He wants to sell information about it. Oh, I guess his friend and ex-girlfriend get swept up in the plot and I think maybe Hiro goes to save them, but I don’t remember him seeming to care too much about them. The girl, Y.T., has a mother that the government captured to provide “motivation” for her, but midway through the book she gets swept up in a pointless “romance” with our nuke-toting bad guy, and becomes another damsel for Hiro to rescue. Said bad guy seems to have no real reason to be working for the evil masterminds behind the virus, other than the fact that America wronged his ancestors and his family’s lands, so…obviously America has to go. In theory, these characters have complete back-stories and complex reasons for doing the things they do, but Stephenson fails to deliver – I believe again out of the fear of getting in the way of the story (and the science behind it) itself. So instead of characters we have cardboard cutouts that move through this world simply to get us to the end of the book.<br /><br />And so, we arrive at the ending. Once we've revealed who is behind Snow Crash and why it is proving so dangerous to hackers around the world, we get to have a happy ending, right? Not particularly. Everyone who can be saved is saved, there’s a sort-of shootout where early benefactors come into play again – and then everyone just goes home. Hiro and Y.T. both remain exactly the same as they have been throughout the story, no learning, or character growth, or any sense of forward progression in their lives. Snow Crash happened to them, and now they presumably just go back to things as they were before. It’s like if the Lord of the Rings had ended with Frodo throwing the ring into the mountain and then just going home. Problem solved, right? Who cares what happened at Minas Tirith?<br /><br />For all its many shortcomings, Snow Crash is still a novel with a clear vision and where it does excel, it shines. The science behind the Snow Crash virus is interesting and well-researched, and the tech in the world is sowell thought out that even 23 years later, it is still relevant and hardly shows its age. However, the novel as whole reads like it was written by a twenty-something grad student who had a bunch of “wouldn't it be cool if…” ideas and then threw them together into something resembling a story. I think Stephenson had yet to come into his style with this book, so I look forward to reading some of his later works, like Cryptonomicon and Anathem. In my opinion, Snow Crash might be slightly overrated, but has reached a wide audience and has clearly influence today’s technology – I’d say it’s worth your time.<br /><br />Fun fact: Joe Cornish, director of 2011 feature film Attack the Block, has been signed on by Paramount Studios to write and direct a film adaptation of Snow Crash. Stephenson has warned fans that there’s no guarantee the film will ever be made.<br /><br />(www.FictionForesight.com)",2015-05-08

I've read it 13 times!","Cryptonomicon was the first book of Neal Stephenson’s that I ever read, and it got me started on a long road of fangirling. I was about ten years old. After that, I moved on to Neuromancer, which really got me into the ‘cyberpunk’ genre. Shortly after that, I continued to raid my father’s collection of Stephenson books, and that is when I discovered Snow Crash.<br />Snow Crash is sort of like The Matrix meets Scott Pilgrim meets Neuromancer. It’s so much lighter, sillier, and amusing than Neuromancer, though. Diamond Age is pretty similar in terms of writing style.<br />Knowing that Stephenson writes all of his drafts by hand makes him an even more formidable writer when you take into account the amount of detail in his novels. The amount of research he did for all of his books is positively astounding. He also includes humorous tidbits, ranging from subtle to in-your-face funny. Stephenson, for example, named his main character Hiro Protagonist.<br />The near future is a libertarian paradise. The government intervention is pretty much non-existent; the law enforcement agencies are private and actively compete with one another. This is where Hiro Protagonist comes in. In the beginning of Snow Crash, Hiro almost failed to make a very important pizza delivery to the Mafia. Fortunately for him, a skateboard courier named Y.T. shows up to save him. Her super rad skateboard makes the famous (and ever-coveted) hover-board from Back to the Future look like a broken kid’s bike with sticky training wheels that refuse to turn.<br />This crazy beginning to the story drives the reader smack into a giant conspiracy. It just gets better. Sword-fights, virtual reality, mind-altering drugs, linguistics, religion, Shumer civilization, mutants, hit-men, atomic-powered Gatling handguns, hackers, and more – This novel has it all.<br />Snow Crash was written in 1992 and, since then, there have been a lot of books, movies, and television shows that have borrowed some aspect or another from it. All of them failed, however, to truly capture the lightheartedness of the narrative. This book just does not take itself seriously.<br />The only thing that really annoyed me was the fact that the book is written in present tense. I suppose I could overlook it if there was a reason, but I could not find one. Present tense comes across clumsy and awkward to me, but this may just be my own personal issue. It’s probably not a universal reaction, so I do not take off points for that.<br />Also, while the character development and progression was great, there wasn’t nearly enough of Raven. He ranks right under Hannibal Lector and the Assassin from Serenity. (Oh, god, the feels.) He is everything a good villain should be: Sexy, intelligent, tempting, and a formidable brute of a nuclear mutant who has a penchant for ripping people to pieces with glass knives.<br />However, there was plenty of Y.T., the 15-year-old skater chick who saves the world. She is badass and a great role model. She was written with strong personality aspects, and was fun to read. Hiro was…okay. He could have used his Katana a bit more, in my opinion.<br />Regardless of this little issues, Snow Crash is the paradigmatic Neal Stephenson novel. It grabs the reader right away, thrusts you headlong into this crazy world like you’re going down the line of a Tequila Carshwash. You keep sliding along until you’re left startled, disoriented, and a buzzed when you land at a precipitous ending.<br />That may sound abrupt, but don’t let that fool you. It absolutely works. Snow Crash is probably (At least in my opinion), one of Stephenson’s most memorable works. It’s certainly a favorite of mine, and it’s definitely a lot of fun to read.

The setup and worldbuilding were almost a joke, but it was a joke that might turn into reality one of these days - who knows. The concept of the Metaverse was really interesting, especially considering the book was written when our modern internet was just coming into existence.<br /><br />It was also weird in a not-as-good way, hence the 4 star rating. I've never been much of a fan of mythology in the first place, and the fact that it was all woven into a cyberpunk story about hackers and computer viruses didn't do a lot for me. It reminded me of the First Civilization characters from Assassin's Creed and I've always thought they were really annoying.<br /><br />I probably would have never picked this book up if I just found it on a shelf somewhere so I'm glad I was forced to read it for a lit class. I totally would have missed out.<br /><br />And what is it about mafia dons always being such awesome, badass characters? This is like the 3rd thing I've read/watched/written lately starring a really cool mobster character.",2015-03-23

Stephenson's research of ancient Mesopotamian myths and religions, and of Sumer and its language in particular, may put Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code to shame. As the wild plot unfolds on a future dystopian Earth, the author introduces one after another deus ex machina to rescue the day -- all to the odd effect of making such a plot mechanism seem plausible through repetition.<br /><br />_Snow Crash_ seems to describe the world that might emerge if today's far right corporatists and those who yearn for a libertarian future where all government is a thing of the past and the most ruthless war lords rule massive global monopolies and all compete with one another intent on taking everything for themselves. As such, it is both an alien world and one you will recognize immediately in the politics of today. A chilling look at what might be, and a totally thrilling story to expound it. And Stephenson's imaginings or future pizza delivery, a courier service that skateboards freeways via cables the thrashers magna-poon onto autobahn speed automobiles, etc. add to the fun of reading the story.<br /><br />On the downside; reason and rationality, which seem to be on the rise today; lose to blind faith in the most absurd of beliefs. Magic controls reality. The most unimaginably unlikely coincidences are the rule, not the exception. And there are all those deus ex machinas that the convoluted plot could not survive without. It's fascinating reading, lots of subtle humor and puns. But the plot would serve as fuel for Douglas Adam's infinite improbability drive. In the end, that dropped the book from the 5 I thought it would be when I began reading to the three I ended up giving it.<br /><br />Review originally published by Goodreads, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1230819459",2015-03-18

Okay, laserdiscs went the way of the Sony Betamax, but they were a clear pointer to a future filled first with CDs and then DVDs and then downloadable computer files, and in the near future wearable interfaces that will give us our entertainment in holography indistinguishable from real life (a technology I saw demonstrated in the Japanese Pavilion at Expo 88 in Brisbane in 1988, minus the bit about being indistinguishable from real life and the bit about the wearable interface).<br /><br />As I wrote back in the last millennium when video files in stuttervision became ubiquitous on all forms of data storage, &#34;the written word is dead – we just haven't woken up to it yet&#34; (and that was before cameras became ubiquitous on mobile phones, indeed before mobile phones became ubiquitous).<br /><br />This is from Stephenson's steampunk period (and if you don't know what &#34;steampunk&#34; is, I refer you to an Australian reviewer of Stieg Larsson's &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34; who described the eponymous heroine as a &#34;steampunk Pippi Longstocking&#34;), and he is not completely unintelligent about the way his dystopian future might develop from our present, so the book is not without its interests for today even if it does look more-than-somewhat dated.<br /><br />And it's possibly worth reading for its thinly-disguised satire of Scientology and its founder L.

Published in 1992, Stephenson's view of the future was entirely wrong. 1992 was before the web, or at least before the web became mainstream. And it isn't foreseen by Stephenson - instead there is a virtual reality world called the Metaverse, in which distance still plays a role. Imagine if you went online and still had to travel for 10 minutes to get from Target.com to Amazon.com. Or if you wanted to see a show but still could get bad seats where you couldn't see it well. If someone wanted to communicate with someone not next to them in the Metaverse, they'd have to go offline and take a phone call. It all seems silly in 2014.<br /><br />The collapse of government, the rise of communities and an entirely new way of life ruled by immense corporations - I can see where he got this idea, but these things would take hundreds of years to happen. So was the development of the net that slow? Or the social changes supposedly that fast?<br /><br />The part about the Tower of Babel - now this was what got me interested in the book. It had some really great ideas on the origin of language, and I wanted to see where this was going. Combine it with the changes in the world and the Metaverse and you have some really interesting possibilities. I kept waiting and waiting to see what would be developed, but Stephenson didn't really do anything interesting with it. In fact, while it proved to be an important element, the entire reason for Snow Crash to exist (and thus this book) is based on a misunderstanding of programmers and the companies they work for.<br /><br />When it is revealed why the antagonist(s) would go through all this immense trouble, you are left scratching your head. At least, if you are a programmer or understand the tech industry. The &#34;big issue&#34; that drives the story is not even remotely an issue in programming. It isn't today, and it wasn't when this was written.<br /><br />So as I drew near to the end, I realized that there wasn't going to be any big reveal; that the plot really was just this nonsensical &#34;big issue&#34;.

There are numerous very basic structural problems that render it completely nonsensical.<br /><br />- Characters are literally in two places at once in some scenes: i.e. Hiro rescuing Y.T. in one part of the city, and being in his storage unit logged into the metaverse at the same time.<br /><br />- Other characters have entire arcs set up only to never be paid off: i.e. Y.T.'s relationship with Uncle Enzo.<br /><br />- Plot devices aren't even paid off: i.e. Raven's nuclear bomb.<br /><br />- In the middle of major action sequences there are huge gaps in time: i.e. Hiro finally gets to the raft only to spend weeks (?) floating in the ocean waiting to be rescued?  Or he finally makes it onto the raft, and sits down and plays on his computer for hours while guys with guns are hunting him?<br /><br />- Massive character leaps occur &#34;off screen&#34;: i.e. Hiro all of a sudden goes from a poor nobody to a rich guy with fancy gadgets literally from one scene to the next.  And at the end Hiro talks about all the hangouts and meals he and Y.T. have shared and yet in the book they've only ever even met a couple of times and barely know each other.<br /><br />- There are huge swaths of mostly unimportant dialogue that gets repeated for no reason: pretty much anything to do with the virus.<br /><br />- Strange conversations take place indicating previous interactions that have never happened: the entire motorcycle conversation between Hiro and Raven for example, which comes out of nowhere, makes no sense, and is totally pointless.<br /><br />- The end just happens: not only does the ending fail to payoff almost every major and minor character arc, but the finale involves characters that are so secondary to the plot that you couldn't care less about them.  They're essentially movie extras, and the main cast isn't even in the vicinity.  It would be like if at the end ofStar Wars instead of Luke flying down the Death Star trench with Darth Vader behind him, it was Wedge followed by Grand Moff Tarkin.  Think about how crazy that is.<br /><br />And these are just structural problems.  I'm not even taking into account how many grains of salt you would have to take in order to get past the whole ancient Sumerian verbal virus in the first place, or other outlandish jibberish.  The number of positive reviews for this are shocking, but even more unbelievable is so few people mentioning these MAJOR plot and character issues.  I can get past, and even enjoy, the intentionally cartoonish style.  I can get past the intentionally racist stereotypes.  I can even get past the absurd sexualization of the 15 year-old and her &#34;sexy&#34; rape scene.

I also really wish there was a better description of the world in which the story takes place. In and of itself, it is awesome.  Kind of like a cyberpunk, futuristic, sort of dystopian setting with dashes of nostalgia sprinkled here and there.  But there is just no explanation as to why the world is this way or how it came to be so strange and dangerous in such a (seemingly) short time. Another thing that surprised me was the importance that some side characters ended up playing in the more climactic parts.  I will say that Hiro and Y.T., the main characters, are both pretty cool and likeable.

He does this a lot: how pizza delivery works, the typical workday of a governmental employee, the mechanics of a guard dog that is more machine than flesh, the creation and adoption of different languages and how they relate to Sumerian myth and culture, etc. But there is a sense of humor that is funny enough and a way he teaches the reader that it does not hamper the story too much.<br /><br />As characters, Protagonist and Y.T. (a spunky teenage Kourier) act as great foils to one another. Hiro has had quite a bit of success in his life, but he still has that stereotypical &#34;nerd&#34; sensibility where he still has some trouble with the female sex. Y.T. is the opposite: she easily understands others but is alwayslooking to ratchet up the excitement in her life. These two work together to solve the Snow Crash mystery, though they never seem to be the best of friends. While there is not much tension between the two of them they still spend more time apart than together. One of the more touching moments in &#34;Snow Crash&#34; is when Y.T. explains to Hiro how he should actually deal with the opposite gender. As one of the villains, Raven is suitably a match in both wits and partial prowess to Hiro. Pretty much every character in the novel seems to evolve from a stereotype of some sort, but it does not ever get in the way enough to make the story less satisfying.<br /><br />&#34;Snow Crash&#34; suffers from several minor issues, however. There is a giant section of the book that can only be described as a giant info-dump about Sumerian culture. These chapters are interwoven with other sections that are dedicated to scenes that contain more action, but it got to be a bit too much for my taste. As I consider myself one of the more patient readers I know, there will probably be many people who find this to be unforgivable and never finish the book. While it helps in the understanding of the background of the story and is important in the grand scheme of the plot, Stephenson was too heavy-handed in this regard. There is also a scene near the end that reveals a mysterious connection between two characters that simply did not work. The dialogue was forced and the timing was off. The scene would have been better served earlier on when the action was not so chaotic. Finally, there is an abrupt conclusion that simply catches you off guard. It is possible to figure out most of what happens, but Stephenson really needed to include another ten or fifteen pages to help wrap everything up.<br /><br />There is a sense of irreverence that Stephenson uses during the entirety of the novel that comes across as quite charming. Despite the multitude of deaths and destruction that occurs, it seemslike this is just every day for most of these characters. I'm not sure quite buy Stephenson's premise that language of simply code and we all inherently have the ability to wake up one morning and be able to speak and read Sumerian, binary, French, Sanskrit, Hebrew, or any other of the thousands of languages that are out there in the world. I myself have taken seven years of French and still cannot speak a sentence of it. But the questions he raises concerning language's history are interesting enough to think about (just what did happen during the Tower of Babel sequence?). And while Stephenson made some minor missteps and had a little too much fun in discussing the smaller details, the story is still fun enough and the characters are interesting enough to call &#34;Snow Crash&#34; a success.<br /><br />4/5",2014-08-04

You can’t lay a Stephenson novel down for a few days and hope to come back and take up where you left off.  This is not pulp science fiction.<br /><br />In this audacious novel, Stephenson crafts a dystopian Earth near the end of the 20th century.  Most civilization has broken down and even in the United States, society has devolved into semi-sovereign “franchulates” (franchise consulates) and “burbclaves” (suburban enclaves).  A rampant form of pure capitalism reigns, with private ownership of roads and police protection.  Existing alongside this “free for all” is a Metaverse, an on-line world governed largely by hackers.  Now, dystopia coupled with virtual reality is nothing new, however Stephenson takes it up a notch, weaving Sumerian and Old Testament mythology throughout the story.<br /><br />Some may find elements of Stephenson’s world silly, and some of it is pretty far out there, but much of it comes across as biting satire and I found it enormously entertaining.  The “heroes” of the story are Hiro Protagonist, a freelance stringer for Central Intelligence Corporation (a privatized successor to the Library of Congress), a computer software designer and the greatest sword fighter in the world (in the Metaverse) and Y.T., a souped up skateboard riding 15 year old courier.<br /><br />With the help of the Mafia (Cosa Nostra, Inc.) and assorted other supremely interesting characters, Hiro and Y.T. discover a new designer drug, Snow Crash, whose purpose is to inject a virus into the deepest level of the brain, acting much the same as a computer virus.

No such thing as a perfect monopoly. Seems like you can never get that last one-tenth of one percent.” – Industrialist L. Bob Rife (Snow Crash)<br /><br />Neal Stephenson’s “Snow Crash” is a seminal work of Cyberpunk fiction set in a post-collapse America where the government has ceded power and large sections of the country to private interests. Like the Mafia. Yeah, I know dystopian futures with fragmented nations automatically sound extremely bleak, but the joy of this book is regardless of how dark the central themes seem (corporate control, organized crime as government, the rewriting of the human will), the book still manages to have some fun with itself. The early chapters contain a decent amount of profanity (with some more sprinkled around later), but overall the book is teen to adult friendly. There is an interesting cast of characters, a fleshed out virtual world, several subplots that tie up nicely and a fair bit of prescient futurism (This is the book that inspired the Google Earth program). Stephenson put years of research into this novel through a variety of subjects. It stands out as a tent pole title and a great starting point for anyone looking for a slightly lighter variety of his usually ultra-dense prose.<br /><br />Our main character is a former coder, part-time intelligence agent/sword duelist and currently full-time pizza delivery driver for Cosa Nostra Pizza. His name? Hiro Protagonist. He has a problem. Several in fact:<br /><br />1. He was just given a pizza that’s about to hit its 30 minute mark. If he can’t get it to the intended destination before the timer expires the current mafia head (Uncle Enzo) will have to fly in from Sicily and personally apologize to the customer. This would mean bad things for Hiro.<br /><br />2. Something is turning people into easily suggestible vegetables incapable of speaking any modern language. Whatever it is or wherever it’s from, its spreading through both realspace and the Metaverse (their online virtual environment).<br /><br />3. A giant immigrant fleet with the former United States aircraft carrier Enterprise as its flagship is floating its way to America and everyone on there may already be carriers for the mystery plague.<br /><br />4. A really large man named Raven leaving destruction in his wake. He may be tied to the source of the previous two problems, but neither Hiro or the authorities can touch him because he has a biologically linked nuclear warhead that he stole from a submarine sitting in his motorcycle sidecar.<br /><br />&#34;You don't respect those people very much, Y.T., because you're young and arrogant.

It's true that it's set in a near future (actually now in the past, as of the writing of this review, I believe) that operates by anarcho-corporate principles and it's heavily focused on the notions of hacking and a virtual reality cyberspace, but the tone is totally different.  This book has more in common with Umberto Eco than it does with William Gibson, all the way down to the extremely technical discussion of the historical principles underlying the plot and the whimsical tone.<br /><br />That's not to say I didn't like Snow Crash, as my rating should make clear.  The beginning was a laugh a minute, and later on, as the plot got moving, it often kept me turning the pages to see what would happen next.

It was amazingly prescient for something written before commercial internet and near-universal access, and it still doesn't feel outdated 20 years later. The story takes place in the United States of the near future. The US government isn't what it used to be. It's politically impotent but employs a lot of people doing private contracting. Where there were once states and cities, now there are privately governed franchises along various cultural and ethnic themes. Our hero and protagonist is appropriately named Hiro Protagonist, former hacker, security guard, high-speed pizza delivery man, concert promoter, stringer for the Central Intelligence Corporation (CIC), and greatest sword-fighter in the world. Hiro is currently in the information business. He collects info and sells it to the CIC.<br /><br />Hiro is joined by a 15-year-old Kourier named \\""YT\\"". She is one of many young skateboarding phenoms who work for delivery services, zooming between franchises, filling the shoes that the postal service used to occupy. When YT agrees to share information with Hiro, she couldn't imagine what she's getting into. Neither could Hiro, when he sees the avatar of his former colleague Da5id get fried in the Metaverse, a virtual world, after Da5id experiments with a new virtual street drug called \\""snow crash.\\"" This somehow scrambled his brain in the real world too, where Da5id is found in a vegetative state, babbling gibberish. It is another former programming colleague and Hiro's ex-lover, Juanita Marquez, who has a theory as to the cause: The ancient Sumerian nam-shub of Enki was a neurolinguistic virus, and someone intends to unleash it again.<br /><br />I always enjoy Neal Stephenson's wry humor. He doesn't lament the loss of the old world order in \\""Snow Crash\\""; he makes fun of the new order. In some ways, the novel is a product of its time: the early internet, the beginnings of the skateboarding craze, and all of the televangelists that were on television and in the news back then. \\""Snow Crash\\""'s villain is a reverend with a media empire.

It isn't the dizzyingly complex connections STEPHENSON makes between technology, binary codes, religion, viruses, the fall of man, the origin of myth, the disappearance of cuneiform, and convenient connects between its marginalized characters. It most startling fact is that this was written in 1992 and is mind blowingly prescient. STEPHENSON fully realizes an America in which the U.S. government is marginalized and corporate franchises and \\""Burbclaves,\\"" that act as independent city states, are the only bastion of order in a world of poverty, chaos, disorder, as well as fantastic technology. Its a bleak future, but there is some order, thusly a Neo-Dystopia. As the story unfolds you even realize that these corporate entities are benevolent, when it suits their own ends. This book, especially the first third is the very definition of good cyberpunk. STEPHENSON's intent was more parody than a cyberpunk opus, but he created one anyway. In the the first white knuckle moments we follow a courier (not an uncommon cyberpunk trope). He is armor clad, armed with a WW2 katana and driving a fast as lightening doom machine supercomputer with auto-adjusting \\""smart\\"" wheels. What is he delivering? Secret Intel, hacking codes, a government cover-up? Nope. Pizza for the Mafia, one of the most powerful corporations in the United States. America is the worst economy in the world- lawless, hedonistic place. \\""America's like this big old clanking smoking machine that just lumbers across the landscape scooping up and eating everything in sight.\\"" There are few industries the America proper does better than anyone else: \\""There's only four things we do better than anyone else: music, movies, microcode (software), high-speed pizza delivery.\\"" And this is the world we are in- ultra high-tech and humdrum. Image that L.A. becomes a hornet's nest of disputed territory fought over by the Mafia and the Narco-Columbians, high security suburban city states, Federal districts holding on the the illusion of a U.S. government despite the fact that the CIA has gone independently corporate, then the neighborhood franchises that exist as sovereign nations of Hong Kong. Then, there the metaverse, an alternative 3 dimensional internet alternative created by STEPHENSON before a decade before Second Life or any real MMO environment. One third or more of this book alternate between the Metaverse and real life; all the while our story fleshes out this strange new world, shockingly adds a proposed science in \\""speaking in tongues,\\"" religions revolutions, and subtle truth in ancient Sumerian myths. Suddenly, everything is connected- the real and material, the story of eden, a genertically ingrained binary language, words as a virus. This is a fascinating and exciting web of intrigue full of juxtapositions. STEPHENSON is unafraid of of rather didactic passages lecturing on histoy, myth and xeno-linguistics and actual science that edges outside the mainstream, while cutting back into intense sections of violence, technology, and snappy dialog. Again for 1992, this work is positively precognitive. He imagines supercomputers as small as a singular semi-conductor. He constructs fully realized 3d digital worlds, windshield \\""heads-up-displays,\\"" super-inflation of U.S. currency for preference of the Chinese economy, and cutting edge personal safety measures. It's impressive. His only fingerprint of the early 90's is outmoded \\""skater\\"" language. There is also some over explanation as the reader makes assumptive leaps in a conversation long before the participants, which should in a few blaring cases be well aware. But don't worry plenty of historically relevant and newly created pigeon languages were churned up from this work. In fact, the Sumerian word AVATAR was solidified into computer parlance as a virtual reputation as individuals in software environments. Hopeful readers note the adult language and situations- usually stated in a nonchalant, non-erotic manner- merely as a, occasional ugly, fact of this alternate (and our modern) world.This is a masterpiece in Cybepunk science fiction- Blending virtual worlds, biology, religion, linguistics, and the origins of civilization.",2013-06-26

I'm not sure though if cyberpunk is what he was going for in the book. I certainly did not feel as connected to this book as I did with William Gibson's \\""Neuromancer\\"" or Philip K. Dick's \\""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\"". But I'm not so sure if it was because of Stephenson's writing style or the overall subject material that threw me while reading. A book is good if you can put it down and pick it up later knowing exactly what is going on and have a definitive interest in what is happening to the main characters in the book. That atmosphere did not exist with \\""Snow Crash\\"". I believe he is trying to tell an interesting story but at the same time, the whole story angle is lost in the delivery method which was very similiar to looking at pieces of a broken mirror- the challenge being for the reader to put those pieces back together again. On a challenging level, I wouldn't place \\""Snow Crash\\"" anywhere near what I could consider challenging literature (re: Joyce's \\""Finnegan's Wake\\""). However, \\""Snow Crash\\"" seems to want to challenge the reader to think while they read...or at least think more while they read.

Both Gibson's Neuromancer and Brunner's Shockwave Rider are on my top 10 list of SF.  Unless you count Sterling's Schismatrix as cyberpunk, this subgenre has been very good to me.  What I love about about cyberpunk is the many ideas and how these ideas impact society and individuals.  In comparison, other SF books might have only a few big ideas.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Its just a matter of preference.  What cyberpunk does very well is combining many ideas into coherent world or framework. Anyways, about Snow Crash...<br /><br />Very fun book.  Lots of action, interesting characters, and a fast paced plot with a crazy theory in the middle.  What's not to love?  The crazy theory, Sumerian language being the ultimate basic language, gets a little too crazy at some points.  There's fine line between fantastical and nonsensical.  Neal Stephenson sometimes goes briefly over that line.  But the book is just so good I can't fault him on that.  Oh yeah, lots of humor.  Funniest SF book I read since Old Man's War.<br /><br />It's not deep, introspective work so look elsewhere if that is important to you.  In a way, Neal is parodying the cyberpunk genre.  I compare it to how Mel Brooks parodies movies in that Snow Crash is simultaneously mocking and celebrating cyberpunk.

Some of the grandiose ideas bandied about (i.e, connecting together computer viruses, linguistics, Sumerian civilization, & religion) were pretty clever, and really enjoyable to read.  Also, the description and fleshing out of the 'metaverse' concept was well-done and synched up with what is happening today when you think of online communities such as Second Life.<br /><br />However, a few things really irritated me about this book.<br /><br />First, the writing style in general wasn't for me.  The plot and characters seemed like they were pulled out of a comic book.  Some folks may see this as a plus, but it's not my thing.  The violence is implausible and over the top--I'm not squeemish, but violence loses its effect when it's done in a cartoonish manner.  The main antagonist is an impossibly powerful, bad mofo, to the extent that reading about his butt-kicking quickly got boring and predictable.  The main protagonist walks around with samurai swords.  Ultimately, the absurdity of it all just becomes  distracting.<br /><br />Also, many of the author's attempts at being cool, witty or funny just end up coming off as awkward.  Naming your hero/protagonist \\""Hiro Protagonist\\""?  Lame.  Sushi K's rap lyrics? Cringe-worthy.<br /><br />The ending is unsatisfying.  This esoteric po-mo convention may have resonated as exceptionally clever with the literati back in 1992, but at this point, it's just boring and annoying, and looks like he just gave up.  Dear authors: please finish your books...if we wanted to use our imaginations to finish them ourselves, we wouldn't have piggy-backed off of your imagination for the first 99% of the story.<br /><br />Finally, a lot of the predictions made about the near future were off, and frankly, a bit half-baked.  Since the novel was written, the Japanese economic empire has crumbled, nobody uses the word \\""Soviet\\"" anymore, South African Apartheid is dead.  These all were featured predominantly in the book, but are completely irrelevant today.  And other than the metaverse, most of the technological predictions made by the author were pretty off--we're more advanced in some respects he could've never predicted, and way, way behind on others.  This isn't the author's fault--he tried and did better than most people ever could.  However, the fact is that near-future sci-fi's usually don't age well, and that includes this book.<br /><br />Overall, I find it difficult to recommend this book; younger readers who would enjoy the over-the-top action would be put off by the now-irrelevant technological predictions.  Mature readers would be more understanding of this, and would enjoy the book's more intellectual aspirations, but would likely be turned off by its juvenile style.<br /><br />In other words, just wait for the movie...it should have some cool explosions and fight scenes.",2012-11-09

First, it heavily scattered with computer terms, which might hinder some non-geek. Second, the hilarious and sarcastic style which will offend some readers. But if you are OK with that, this is an excellent book for you.<br /><br />The story revolves around the protagonist, Hiro Protagonist (yes, that is his name), a pizza delivery man, a computer hacker, a part-time spy and a swordplay expert. You figure it out! The setting is a wholly privatized world, when the government is just another private company. And Snowcrash is some kind of digital drug within the digital world of the future.<br /><br />One of my major complains about this book is the protracted beginning. It does not go anywhere except bringing you from one hilarious scene to another. Yes, it gives you some idea about the world they are in, but still too dragging. It does not get interesting before page 200. But if you survive that, you get the gem of this book (which I will not tell you because it will spoil the fun).<br /><br />But I can tell you this, Stephenson is indeed a visionary writer. This book was first published in 1992, while most of us at that time probably knew Internet only by using email. In this book you can find the world of Second Life, when human-user can interact in a 3D virtual world called Metaverse using their avatar (yes, he used this term in this book), which is much bigger than the Earth itself.<br /><br />The second interesting thing is his bleak vision of our future, which I might comment, is not too far fetch. This makes this book a bit depressing, if not frightening. Even though this is not an apocalyptic novel (in one sense, but apocalyptic in another sense), this book really makes me doubt that our future will be a golden age.<br /><br />The best part of this book is the fresh interpretation of some mythologies: biblical and Sumerian. It really gives you food for thought.<br /><br />I give it a four instead of five because it is too action packed, and it is too comical (It is originally written for comic book).on packed, and it is too comical (It is originally written for comic book).",2012-10-03

I have so many friends who love it that I forced myself to get through to the end. Normally I'd read a book this length over the weekend, but Snow Crash took me over a month. Every time I set it down, days and weeks would pass as I felt no particular urge to see what happens next.<br /><br />There were a lot of reasons I didn't like this book. Hopefully, other reluctant readers with similar taste can see this and save some time. This is in order of how much it bothered me, but any of these would be enough alone to make me dislike the book:<br />1) The writing style was really distracting and irritating to me. It had that clunky, sloppy, slapstick style that I know other people find funny or creative. But I prefer writing that allows me to be fully engaged to the point I don't notice the words. If I do notice the words, I prefer a more graceful or intricate style. In truth, I think he's not a very good writer, but I recognize the strong possibility that I am wrong and this writing is just not at all my cup of tea.<br />2) There were really really long chunks throughout the book where one character would muse about and slowly develop some random theory (thinly disguised as dialogue). The topics ranged from religion to ancient history and more. I would love to read an essay about them in a reputable journal with sources and citations. In a novel, I found it half-baked, irrelevant, and incredibly boring.<br />3) For the most part I found the characters likable and interesting. But I wasn't really moved by them. I didn't particularly care what happened to them. Also, I was a little disturbed that the main 15-year-old girl character had so many odd relationships with men twice her age.<br /><br />There were some cool concepts too. I love the skateboard, and it's definitely interesting to see how the internet has developed compared to his descriptions. But without better writing and character development, cool concepts are not enoughfor a novel. (I often feel this way about scifi and think it's better suited to short stories.)",2012-09-21

I cannot comment about this printing.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Snow Crash is a must read for those who partake of the science fiction genre. While most certainly it is a classic, it earned that location with a bold imaging of ideas and concepts that, while now commonplace, were bold and fresh at the time of writing.<br /><br />This is a novel that has aged... interestingly. While you may most certainly feel that it dates to the twentieth century, it does so without being a hindrance. In the same way a Golden Age story will miss some very basic technological/cultural advances and far overshoot others, so does this novel (to extremely pleasing effect). However, the disconnect is not so large as to detract from the story.<br /><br />As a personal recommendation, anyone reading this review has likely viewed more than enough spoilers and plot summaries, so I will avoid those. If you would enjoy an imagining of a 1990's future this is a pleasant read. Effectively all of the subplots are well crafted and mesh with the broader story, and the way the story is woven along with its original ideas make for a requisite read. As with well-done SF, try to avoid spoilers as much as possible: the more you can submerse yourself in the story the better the experience will be. Enjoy.",2012-09-16

He said something like, \\""The main character's name is Hiro Protagonist?!\\"" and burst out laughing. Being incredulous, I grabbed the book and looked and, sure enough, that is the main character's name. The thoughts in my head ran something like this:<br /><br />\\""That is so dumb!\\""<br />\\""That sounds like something that would come from a bunch of guys sitting around drinking.\\"" You know, because they're drinking, they think it's funny.<br />\\""Stephenson must not have realized the next day that it wasn't as funny as it seemed when he was drinking.\\""<br />\\""It sounds like the kind of thing my oldest would have suggested when he was 5 and wanted to name his not-yet-born younger brother Hot-Speeder.\\"" You know, if he had known the word \\""protagonist\\"" at 5.<br />\\""That is so dumb!\\""<br />The thing is, though, Stephenson evidently did realize it was stupid, because he acknowledges within the book that it's stupid by having another character tell Hiro he has a stupid name. It didn't dissuade him from using it, though. His secondary character has a similar name in  that she's called \\""Y.T.\\"" which seems to have been used just so there can be confusion and have people call her \\""Whitey.\\""<br /><br />The second impression followed closely on the heels of the first. Hiro delivers pizzas (for the Mafia, but that's another story). Hiro is also an elite hacker and the best samurai swordsman in the world. He delivers pizzas. As I digested this information, I flashed back to an idea my oldest told me about when he was about 12: a ninja on a motorcycle, swords crossed on his back, delivering pizzas. He, at 12, thought this was a wonderful idea. At 12, it probably is. At this point in the book, I began entertaining the idea that this was just some kind of delusion from the hero, Hiro; that might have made the book interesting. But it turned out not to be; everything is supposed to be as it's presented.<br /><br />As you can see, my view of the book wasn't shaping into anything positive. But it gets worse... oh, it gets so much worse.<br /><br />See, the back of the book says the book is \\""...a mind-altering romp through a future America...\\"" A future America. And that's the hinge that broke the whole story for me, because it's not set in the future at all. Whoever wrote the back cover blurb must not have actually read the book, and that's without excuse. It is even more without excuse that that's been allowed to stand through 19 printings of the book. It makes me wonder if anyone in the publishing industry ever actually read the book.<br /><br />Let me break this down for you.<br /><br />Hiro's father fought in World War II. Not his grandfather, his father. To be at all plausible, the story can't really be taking place any later than the mid-90s. The book was published in 1992, so, really, the story was happening \\""now\\"" as it was published (because 3 years into the future is not a \\""future America,\\"" at least not as it's presented in the book). So, basically, what we're dealing with is an alternate timeline world, which would be okay if<br />1. it was presented that way<br />2. there was some reason for the HUGE differences between the world of the book and our world<br /><br />what caused the divergence (which happened sometime after WWII and, probably, after Vietnam)<br />how in the heck did the technology get so advanced (because it's decades (at least) more advanced than what we have now (two decades after the book was written)<br />Which is to say that I just couldn't buy the book from that perspective, because the world as it's presented in the book could never have gotten to the state that it was in in just a couple of decades from the divergence point. It's utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />So... I'm reading, I'm not very far in, and I'm having huge issues with the book. And it gets worse.<br /><br />The \\""partnership\\"" between Y.T. and Hiro is only there because the author decided it would be. The characters have no motivation toward it. They meet and Y.T. says \\""hey, you wanna be partners?\\"" and Hiro says \\""yeah, sure.\\"" The problem is that Y.T. is a 15-year-old girl and Hiro is a 30-something guy with no job. The relationship is never mutual, either. Y.T. just feeds information to Hiro while occasionally being bossed around. She gets nothing in return other than getting to say  he's her \\""partner.\\"" It was dumb.<br /><br />But it gets worse.<br /><br />Early in the book, after Hiro has lost his pizza delivery job because he crashed the pizza car (see, so now he's a completely unemployed samurai hacker (pun intended)), he's in the metaverse, the virtual reality world of the book, trying to get intel he can sell. Some stuff happens including Hiro getting into a fight that just happens so that we can see Hiro's virtual sword skills. But! In the middle of all of this stuff in the metaverse, we cut to Y.T. who has gotten herself thrown into \\""the Clink.\\"" She needs to be rescued, so she calls Hiro to get her out of her jam. This is pre-partnership and, I suppose, the impetus of the partnership. Anyway, Hiro shows up and rescues her, and they part ways. THEN, we go back to Hiro right where we left him in the metaverse about to have this fight. Basically, Hiro was in two places at once, because there is no explanation ever given about how these two events happened at the same time. Basically, Stephenson needed to break to the other character and never took into account the conflicting time frame.<br /><br />This is not the only time we see Stephenson have issues with keeping things like this straight, and this next bit has spoilers, so skip ahead if you have the misguided notion of wanting to read this book. Otherwise, read on!<br />1. Near the end of the book, Hiro is explaining everything to some dudes (you know, your basic telling instead of showing, but it's worse than that (but I'll get to that ina moment)), and one of the guys asks Hiro why he needs to get the clay tablet. The problem? Hiro hadn't gotten to that part yet. Basically, Stephenson just has the guy ask a question that he, supposedly, knows nothing about so that he can dump the info to the readers. It made me want to gouge the pages. First, I don't need to have stuff explained to me (especially more than once!), but, if you're going to explain to me, don't do it in a stupid way like having a bunch of guys who don't have a clue about what's going on start asking questions based on info they don't have.<br />2. During the climax of the book, the main tough dude bad guy is on a helicopter. He's been on the helicopter for a while. Except when he's suddenly needed to kill a bunch of people, he's somewhere else killing them before the helicopter arrives at the location. No explanation. Nothing. He's just already there. After Raven has killed all the dudes he needs to kill, then the helicopter with the head bad dude shows up. The helicopter that Raven had been on for chapters and chapters. I wanted to rip the pages out of the book (but I'm going to trade it in at the used book store for something that's actually good, so I refrained).<br /><br />So...<br />There are all of these specific issues of stupidity in the book, way more than I've mentioned here, but the worst thing about the book had nothing to do with those things. And those were bad enough. I mean, if I hadn't been trying to find out why the book is such an \\""important\\"" sci-fi book, I wouldn't have read it. I would have stopped at the point where I realized it was set \\""now,\\"" because, really, that was a deal breaker for me, except I wasn't to anything, yet, that was giving me a reason why it made such an impact, so I had to keep going to find out.<br /><br />The beginning of the book has a bunch of inane action that has nothing to do with anything before we actually get to the inciting incident. After that, someone shows up and gives Hiro a special computer thing, and, basically, the computer tells Hiro everything he needs to know for the rest of the book. He never does anything to discover anything. The computer just tells him the story. And, you know, it's this long philosophical discussion with the computer (that goes on for, like, 1/3 of the book) that, again, reminded me of a bunch of guys staying up late drinking and someone says \\""what if language was a virus?\\"" and they just went on and on about it thinking themselves all deep and crap and everyone wakes up the next day and realizes what a stupid idea it was. Except, well, everyone but Neal Stephenson. He wakes up the next morning and decides to write a book about it with his other stupid, drunken idea, the name of the protagonist, oh, yeah! Protagonist! And then threw in the stuff he fantasized about when he was 12, namely being a ninja hacker pizza delivery guy with a hot 15-year-old girl.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, did I mention that Y.T. is 15? Because she is. And she spends a goodly portion of the book being concerned with what a hot 15-y-o piece she is. (Yes, I know I mentioned it, but OH MY GOSH it's so constant in the book.)<br /><br />Oh! Oh, wait! So, yeah, there's this huge discussion with the computer, right, where the computer tells him everything. Blah blah blah. The whole plot is just explained to us without any action to go with it. So that's bad enough (actually, it's horrible, because, like, that's the HUGEST no no of writing: Show, don't tell, but Stephenson apparently thinks we wouldn't be able to figure it out if he showed us, or, maybe, he just couldn't figure out how to show us his deep, philosophical conversation with himself), but, at the end, he has to re-tell it all from Hiro's perspective to make sure we understood what he already told us, so we get to spend another couple of chapters with Hiro explaining the plot to people that aren't really important. Except that they are, but we never knew that until just at that moment whenHiro needs to explain everything to them so that they can take care of  the bad guy. Basically, the book spends a lot of time telling us the story with action mixed in that's only loosely related to the plot.<br /><br />The only interesting thing in the book is Stephenson's vision of virtual reality and virtual worlds. Way back in '92, I guess I can see people getting excited about what he did with that stuff, since the whole virtual world thing didn't really exist, yet. Of course, it still doesn't exist via virtual reality, but virtual worlds are virtually a dime a dozen these days (sorry for the pun but not sorry enough to take it out (see what I did there? acknowledging it but leaving it in)), and some of them are even modeled on the idea of Snow Crash. It doesn't make up for how poorly written the book was, though. It's not the worst written book I've ever read, but I think it may have been the stupidest. I mean that. It has so many plot issues and plot holes and, well... maybe I shouldn't expect more, but, yeah, I expect more from big time books from big time publishers (and, remember, this was before the breakthrough of independent and self publishing).

I was getting more and more concerned with each passing year, for this work kept receiving such accolades that it raised my expectations to what I felt was an impossible level. I mean, a science fiction novel being selected as one of the 100 books to read in English by Time Magazine? It reached the point where Snow Crash had to be one of the very best books I had ever read, if not the very best, if it had any chance of meeting those lofty expectations.<br /><br />Understandably, although it is an ambitious, intelligent, and entertaining novel, Snow Crash couldn't possibly live up to my expectations. It is a fun and thrilling read, no question. And yet, as much as I enjoyed it, I don't feel that it's the sort of literary work that lingers within your mind long after you have finished it.<br /><br />Here's the blurb:<br /><br />One of Time magazine's 100 all-time best English-language novels.<br /><br />Only once in a great while does a writer come along who defies comparison--a writer so original he redefines the way we look at the world. Neal Stephenson is such a writer and Snow Crash is such a novel, weaving virtual reality, Sumerian myth, and just about everything in between with a cool, hip cybersensibility to bring us the gigathriller of the information age.<br /><br />In reality, Hiro Protagonist delivers pizza for Uncle Enzo's CosoNostra Pizza Inc., but in the Metaverse he's a warrior prince. Plunging headlong into the enigma of a new computer virus that's striking down hackers everywhere, he races along the neon-lit streets on a search-and-destroy mission for the shadowy virtual villain threatening to bring about infocalypse. Snow Crash is a mind-altering romp through a future America so bizarre, so outrageous...you'll recognize it immediately.<br /><br />The worldbuilding is simply awesome. In a not-so-distant future, the USA has become a fragmented ensembles of smaller Burbclaves and city-states. As is usually the author's wont, the witty narrative is full of satiric social and political commentary. What's even more brilliant is the fact that Snow Crash was written between 1988 and 1991. To realize just how on the money Stephenson turned out to be regarding the information age and virtual reality, it's simply astonishing. The same thing goes for the technology now in use, both in terms of software and hardware. Truly, Neal Stephenson was a visionary.<br /><br />The characterization is well-done, especially considering that having teenagers as your principal protagonists can sometimes be quite tricky. Yet both Hiro Protagonist, the Deliverator and katana-wielding hacker, and Y.T., a pesky Kourier, are well-defined characters you just have to root for. When Hiro is involved in an accident and is about to be late delivering a pizza, Y.T. delivers the pie on time, thus earning a favor from the Mafia and joining her fate to Hiro's, though none of them are quite aware of that fact just yet. Although the narrative follows the POVs of these two protagonists for the better part of the book, they are joined by a colorful cast of secondary characters that give Snow Crash its unforgettable flavor. Chief among those include Uncle Enzo, the Librarian, and Raven.<br /><br />The pace is fluid and the chapters relatively short, making this novel a real page-turner. Indeed, there is never a dull moment. The early portions about the Sumerian myths and their importance are a bit more nebulous and hard to understand, but everything is explained later on in the book. Hence, for a while at least, you are sort of left in the dark as to what this new computer virus is all about. Be that as it may, you just need to buckle up and enjoy the ride. From beginning to end, Snow Crash remains a dense and surreal work of fiction full of humor that will make you think as much asit makes you laugh.<br /><br />As I mentioned, what is even more impressive is the fact that this novel was initially published two decades ago. Discovering just how right Stephenson was concerning everything that has to do with the information age and virtual reality will have you shaking your head in bewilderment.<br /><br />Snow Crash is a smart, cool, funny, witty, and action-packed adventure featuring a pair of unlikely heroes who must save the world from infocalypse. If you enjoy roller-coaster rides, Snow Crash is definitely for you! You will never again look at toilet paper quite the same way afterwards. . .<br /><br />If, like me, you haven't read it yet, Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash could be perfect vacation reading material for you.<br /><br />Check out Pat's Fantasy Hotlist!",2012-08-25

There wasn't a single character, hero or villan, that wasn't totally believable.  The plot was great, very rich and detailed, with a killer ending.  So, why isn't it 5 star perfect?  I'm sure Neal Stephenson finds ancient religious studies fascinating.  He must because he fills about 200 of the 450 pages of this novel with it.  I don't find reading about ancient Babylon and Sumeria particularly interesting, and to be honest, it only somewhat ties into the plot (meaning the plot could have stayed the same without all the ancient religious pretext).

If you want a darkly serious look at the future, read \\""Neuromancer.\\"" If you want a realistic future populated by everyday people, read Jack McDevitt. If you want a creative, fun look at the future that takes speculation to the extreme, read \\""Snow Crash.\\""<br /><br />PLOT:<br /><br />\\""Snow Crash\\"" has a lot of plot, and it's a confusing read for the first time.  But the unique setting, great characters, and action-adventure might make you want to come back and read it again (and again, and again).  After a couple of reads, the plot becomes clearer, and is quite clever.<br /><br />Just to help some readers get started though, I'll give a summary of the plot here:<br /><br />In the near-future, the U.S. has collapsed into anarchy and is now ruled by corporations.  The Internet meanwhile has evolved into a virtual reality called the Metaverse.  Trouble begins when someone starts to hand out a drug called \\""Snow Crash,\\"" both as a street drug in real life, and as a computer virus in the Metaverse.  \\""Snow Crash\\"" takes over the user's mind, seemingly driving them insane and making them speak in Tongues.  Since there is no government agency anymore to investigate this sort of thing, a hacker named Hiro Protagonist joins a group of other hackers and mobsters who are working to solve the mystery for themselves.<br /><br />SETTING:<br /><br />\\""Snow Crash\\"" starts with the same \\""dystopian\\"" future that many cyberpunk stories feature; the U.S. government has collapsed into anarchy, and corporations rule the people. But in \\""Snow Crash\\"" this world is not entirely dark and evil; the characters regard the corporations that rule them the way that many Americans today view their government (distrustful, but not tyrannical).  Stephenson applies humor to this corporate-ruled future, making for an outrageous setting: one corporation in power is the Italian Mafia, which controls all pizza delivery; skateboarders harpoon cars with giant magnets and ride behind, with no laws to stop them; and a new denomination of Christianity incorporates Elvis into its Trinity; just for a few examples.<br /><br />\\""Snow Crash\\"" also employs the \\""virtual reality\\"" clich&eacute; seen in cyberpunk, but again, with more humor and craziness.  Rather than resembling the Matrix, the Metaverse is more like a virtual-reality version of the internet, populated by all of the weird figures that hackers and teenagers on the web would chose to represent themselves (Barbies, dragons, giant talking penises, etc.)<br /><br />WRITING STYLE:<br /><br />Stephenson's narration sounds more like a friend on the street telling you the story, rather than a typical author narrating a novel.  Some readers complain that this makes it \\""poorly written.\\"" But others find it more engaging than traditional forms of storytelling.  It certainly makes for a more clever way of wording things.  Many of the best lines--both serious and funny--come from the narration, rather than the dialogue.<br /><br />Narration style aside, Stephenson also writes dialogue very well.  His characters speak realistically, using improper English and incomplete sentences like most of us in real life do.<br /><br />There are a ton of fast-paced action scenes, and they're cleverly written.  The characters don't just run and shoot each other tiresomely (like in so many cyberpunk books).  They skateboard under trucks, leap from helicopters,  and have sword fights that are well \\""choreographed.\\""<br /><br />The only downside to Stephenson's writing is that the two or three dull moments in the book are torturously boring and much too long.  But the excitement and humor in the rest of the book completely compensates for them.<br /><br />CHARACTERS:<br /><br />The characters are as fun as the most bad-ss action heroes, and as relatable as the every-day-men/women in sitcoms.  They are not flat Hollywood stereotypes, but neither are they the bland \\""everyday\\"" people that \\""realistic\\"" authors like to use.  Stephenson treats his characters with the same amount of seriousness, humor, and outrageous action as the rest of his story.<br /><br />The protagonist, aptly named Hiro Protagonist, is much better written than most leading characters, especially in cyberpunk.  Stephenson does not try make Hiro an \\""average\\"" person, like most authors would.  Hiro is just as distinctive in his personality, flaws, back-story, and ethnicity as any normal secondary character might be.  Even more impressive, Hiro is the hero by his own choice; no prophecy makes him the \\""chosen one,\\"" and no corporate fairy-god-father suddenly shows up to hire him for an adventurous job (as in most cyberpunk stories).  Instead, Hiro sees a problem, and decides for himself to investigate and save the day.<br /><br />The other characters stand out from others of their types, in the same way.  Hiro's sidekick Y.T., a thrill seeking female skateboarder, is as sarcastic and feisty as most action- heroines--but her personality is more realistic; she's not a dress-hating tomboy stereotype, nor a valley-girl.  Hiro's love interest, Juanita, is an average-looking woman who wears no make-up, attracting him with her brains and wit.  And the villain, Raven, is active and fearful in his own right, doing his own dirty work, rather than sitting back and letting a hoard of minions do it for him.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />\\""Snow Crash\\"" offers something that's easy to find in films, but difficult to find in books;  a serious story with ideas that make you think, and exciting escapism.gonist, aptly named Hiro Protagonist, is much better written than most leading characters, especially in cyberpunk.

I had never heard of Snow Crash prior to a few weeks ago.  I knew of a few of the, generically lumped, \\""Cyberpunk\\"" authors but I never really gave the genre a chance.  Recently I read \\""Ready Player One\\"" off a recommendation, and Snow Crash was mentioned by the author as being a big influence to him.  So I looked into it, and I'm very glad I did.  The book was written before so many of the terms, and environments, were realistic to a degree.  Before terms like \\""Avatars\\"" were common knowledge to different generations, and used in common day to day conversations of technology (Be it gaming, etc).  So reading a book that, in a way, started that phase is interesting because you expect it have a few bits of things that caught on, and a lot that is just insanely far fetched.  The thing is... the book holds up well.  Yes, a lot of the technology talked about in Snow Crash may not exist in the form described in the book but it's getting to the point where we see these as some logical steps.  The apocalyptic picture painted of the world mirror's a lot of our own fears, and thoughts.  So when you read this book you almost forget the time that has passed since it was written.  The story follow's two core people.  Hiro Protagonist, and Y.T.  You're constantly jumping between them, and sometimes it's not the cleanest or most opportune time to transition, but you honestly won't care.  You'll still be glued to the pages, and wanting to see how it ends, and where it unfolds.  I'm not going to waste your time discussing little plot points, or story points, etc, as you probably have read them a bunch of times if you're reading my review.  The synopsis will give you the basics.  What I will say is this.  You should read the book if you're a tech head, gamer, or just someone into the cyberpunk genre (again, used generically).  The story holds up, the characters are interesting, the switching of technology and history is enlightening in ways.  The whole thing was asolid read.  The author was ahead of his time with the vision he wrote into this book, and his story holds up nicely.  A sometimes tough read, but a good read.  My only gripe is the ending.  I'm left with a lot of questions on those characters I have grown to love.  I know the groundwork for a \\""you can easily construct your own vision, and probably be right with where the author was going\\"" was set, and you don't feel that you are missing that.  You just sort of end suddenly, and I would have liked a little more closure.  Other than that, when I turned that last page I was glad with taking the time to read it.  I know I have a tendency, when reviewing books, to really not focus much on the story itself in my reviews.  This is because you're going to know a bit or you wouldn't be reading these reviews.  You simply want to know if it's worth your hard earned dollars, and my thoughts on them.  So yes.  I think this book is worth that few bucks, and I hope when you're done you'll agree.",2012-02-01

It's well written in his usual style, and I actually felt less of the minor let down I felt at the conclusion of Cryptonomicon and Diamong Age. However, the mythology stuff was a little heavy handed, the scenes in the library and later at the meeting in Ng's office stretched out too long, and broke the flow of the story a little with all the history lessons. In general, the metaphor/not-really-a-metaphor with the virus felt a little ham-fisted and left me with a bit of that sour Dan Brown after taste for a few pages.  On the plus side, the skater motif was much better than it easily could have been. This kind of things runs the risk of turning into a cheesy Surf Ninjas kind of thing, but Stephenson handled it gracefully, maintaining it steadily through out the story with out over doing it.  There's nothing too surprising in the Metaverse (virtual reality) for a modern reader, but it doesn't come off overly cheesy.

Hiro is also the protagonist. Hiro is a pizza delivery person working for CosaNostra Pizza.   When he pulls up one night to CosaNostra Piza #3569 to pick up a pizza to deliver the place is on fire and when he finaly gets the distrubtor to give him a pizza to deliver it already has 20 minutes on the box. This is a problem as all pizzas must be delivered within 30 minutes or all you know what  happens. Shouldn't be a problem as he has 10 minutes to cover 12 miles. At least it's not a problem until he drives into an empty swimming pool short of his delivery spot.  Y.T. who is a Kourier who was pooning (short version of harpoon which is explained in the book) his vehicle prior to the crash comes to the rescue and delivers his pizza on time thus setting up a relationship of both people running into each other at opportune times to help each other out.  Hiro is also a computer hacker and according to himself the \\""Greatest Sword Fighter in the World\\"".  The adventure soon starts when an unknown enemy releases a virus called Snow Crash that incapacitates hackers like Hiro and turns regular people into babbling slaves.  This all ties into the millennium old Sumerian Race and Religion having to do with everyone's base memory (core memory in computer circles).  There is a metaverse where anyone with a computer can be anybody they want to be through their created avatar. In this environment Hiro lives in a posh house versus his real world digs which is a 20 by 30 storage unit he shares with a buddy.  Both Hiro and Y.T. are on a collision course with the bad guys which includes Raven (maniac with a nuclear bomb attached to his motorcycle), Lagos (fellow hacker and miscreant)  and L.

Neal Stephenson is both cyber (familiar with computers, geek culture, and the spirit of hacking) and punk (sarcastic, irreverent, anarchic, and co-opting whatever influences he likes). And he's got the literary chops to bring the two together.    Snow Crash is a novel that's equal parts messy and brilliant. Brilliant because Stephenson had an almost eerie prescience of many aspects of the future Internet, from its tawdry commercialism, to Second Life-like virtual worlds, to the divide between genuine hackers and dot-com sellouts, to the normalization of frightening levels of surveillance, to people's escape from reality into online lives and gated communities that cater to their own personal and political preferences. Obviously, no one writing from 1992 was going to get the specifics right, but the gestalt isn't so far off. And Stephenson's larger satiric vision of broken-down future America, which has outsourced all of its specialties except movies, porn, software, and pizza delivery, seems even more prophetic in hindsight. The idea of a nation parceled into corporate franchises and an ineffectual federal government, while a large chunk of the outside world slides towards piratical lawlessness (embodied by a giant flotilla of desperate refugees), could be a Tea Party dream run amok.    This book also expresses Stephenson's considerable wit and sardonic humor at its fullest throttle. Not that he didn't maintain his madcap style in later novels, but his later works tried to expand his audience beyond graphic novel-reading, DOOM-playing teenagers and undergrads. Readers looking for the less \\""serious\\"", more caffeineated Stephenson will find him here.    However, plot and character development are not strengths of Snow Crash, which lacks the maturity and depth of his subsequent books. The story races from one breathless action scene to another, mixed with somewhat forced (though interesting) discussions of a speech-transmitted brain virus called \\""snow crash\\"", which works like a computer virus and turns out to have been described by ancient Sumerian mythology. The main characters, other than a few defining Cool Characteristics, are pretty thin, and Stephenson's idea of a hip teenage female skate punk is about as painfully dated and cartoonish as Bart Simpson, right down to her catch phrases.    In my opinion, this is definitely a book to read for its audacious foresight, for its cultural impact, and for putting Stephenson on the map, but as a novel, it's not quite a masterpiece. And much of its cutting-edge-for-1992 specificity does feel quaint now, unlike the electric glow it still had when I first read it in 1997.",2011-08-23

It had a lot of interesting ideas, but had more than its fair share of problems as well.    Characters    The book follows two characters, Hiro Protagonist (yes, that is actually his name) and Y.T.  Hiro is a 30 year old hacker who is also an expert swordsman.  Hiro begins the story as a pizza delivery man for the worlds foremost pizza company, which is little more than an organized Mafia.  Y.T. is a kourier who delivers packages for anyone who needs them to be delivered.  Y.T. is 15 years old, and it shows a little in her viewpoints.  But there were also several times when she seemed older than she was.    Setting    The book is set in the U.S. in the future when our current system of government has pretty much fallen apart.  The world is run by various corporations and military groups.  A large part of this book revolves around the Metaverse, which is essentially a very advanced version of the internet.  This was interesting as the book was written in 1992 and a lot of the aspects of the Metaverse described in this book are very similar to things that we're seeing online now.    Plot    The plot was the weakest part of the book for me.  The essential goal of the plot is to prevent a religious group from getting a stranglehold on more of the world through the use of a new drug called Snow Crash.  My problem with the plot was that it jumped around a lot and didn't really get to the overall story plot until well over halfway through the book.  This may be because the book was written 20 years ago and the technology used in the book needed more explanation than it does today.  When it was first written it might not have had this problem, but 20 years later this doesn't work as well, which may just be an inherent problem with writing cyberpunk.    Enjoyment    I really liked some aspects of this book.  Some parts were really interesting, and some of the ideas were stellar.  However, I think it jumps around far too much and never really materializes into a solid story.

The only character that I found interesting is Uncle Enzo, and he shows up for about 10 pages all together.    It's kind of a shame how this story doesn't live up, because the concept is pretty interesting. While I didn't hate the Sumerian research stuff like a lot of other reviewers it was fairly unnecessary padding. The MetaVerse is a pretty cool idea, but again it's painted amateurly at best. The ending was way too rushed to be enjoyable, and readers will likely have more questions than answers when it's all said and done.    Snow Crash isn't terrible, it just isn't very good. If you're desperate for a new story to read, go ahead and pick it up. Otherwise I would recommend skipping this one.",2010-10-24

Was it everything I expected?    It could have been better.    I thought the idea of a 'Blasian' (half-black/half-Asian) hero, Hiro Protagonist was pretty cool.    The idea that the Sumerian legends had something to do with the virus of the title that is soon to be unleashed to those outside the Metaverse (which is the virtual world where characters spend time).    The major aspect that turns me off of the book are the very long Sumerian explanations that halt the book at various points.     Hiro seems to already know these legends and consults a library at one point to go over the legends and their relation to Snow Crash...then at another, while he is speeding on a motorcycle.    I do like the 15-year-old blonde Caucasian character of Y.T., as she seems to be an individual who can pretty much handle herself; her mother, a single-parent, works for a the government in a pretty strong 'by the book' environment.    The world seems to be a bit dystopian (which is somewhat of a cliche of virtual reality stories) as Hiro lives in a storage area; and, Y.T. at some point of the story even has a quick fling with a man much older than she...who turns out to be the villain of the story.    All in all, I found myself wanting to find out what happens, and when I did...I didn't find it as mind-blowing as many, but I do understand there is an audience for this book. Furthermore, I now have an interest of reading some of William Gibson's cyberpunk books.    As aforementioned, I think the areas with the Sumerian exposition could have been worked into the story, rather than devoting several pages to it; because, it seems to grind the story to a halt..especially when the reader (i.e. me) is into a certain action sequence.

In the opening pages Stephenson introduces us to our hero protagonist (aptly named Hiro Protagonist) a sword wielding, computer hacking, pizza-delivery driver.  We soon learn that the Mafia is in the business of selling pizza, that Kouriers get around by `pooning cars from their planks', that people can `jack into the Metaverse', and that California is home to numerous City-states called Burbclaves.  There are no laws and corporations run everything.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after a great opening, the novel quickly loses its edge.  The irreverent tone of the early chapters gives way to an unnecessarily detailed exploration of linguistic theory and Sumerian legends.  Stories from the Old Testament are linked to Sumerian myths and then connected to computer viruses.  These links involve some serious stretches in thinking and some pretty thin theorizing as selective information is used to tie the evolution of human language and religion to a deadly metavirus.  It all becomes an overly complicated, unconvincing mess and momentum killer.<br /><br />While the early chapters brim with wildly preposterous ideas that have just enough truth to them to constitute great satire, the `Sumerian myth/linguistic theory/metavirus idea' is tedious and bogs the narrative down.  The novel picks up speed again near the end and there is a bright spot late in the novel when a character who works for the Federal government is required to read (in 15.62 minutes) a multipage memo on `intra-office toilet-paper policies', but by then I'd pretty much lost interest.  I did enjoy this hilarious skewering of Government Bureaucracy but it wasn't enough to re-engage me in the story.<br /><br />For me, a promising start gave way to uneven pacing and an unconvincing and largely uninteresting premise.

It is not often that I feel so \\""with it\\"" as I do after being able to keep up with the rapid flow of verse, eye popping word candy and just out and out futuristic fun from another novel by Stephenson.  The first time I read anything by Stephenson, it was Cryptonomicon, a 1200 page book that went by in a very short time without any boredom at all.  So I dug up the scoop on his books and found another well liked book was Snow Crash.  When you read a Neal Stephenson novel, the take-off begins on the opening page and then it's full steam ahead for the rest of the book.  Oh, sure, in Stephenson fashion, he meanders a bit into tangential imagery and off topics looks at the weird and wild, but it's all done in nanoseconds.<br /><br />Snow Crash has been explained ad infinitum for 500+ reviews, so I will not bore you with the details, but roughly, this book takes place in the future.  All that is left of the official United States of America is a group of Federal Buildings on a campus somewhere near L.A.  The land mass known as the lower 48 in today's lingo is now a variety of little burbclaves, each with a ruling president of sorts but not like a political country, but a company/city-state mixed with business and politics.  For example, there are franchise companies/countries such as Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong, Reverend Wayne and the Pearly Gates, the Nipponese Quadrant and Uncle Enzo's Mafia among others.  Crime can be driven out by a menacing robotic/biomass dog-like creature that can move at almost the speed of somewhere-between-sound-and-light.  The Police forces have become large for profit as the MetaCops and Enforcers take different tacks to keep the peace.<br /><br />Pizza delivery is the opening segment and it is \\""a riot, Alice, a real riot\\"" to quote Jackie Gleason.  The names of the main characters should give away some of the thought process of Stephenson as Hiro Protagonist tries to keep his partner Y.T. (no, not Whitey) from getting killed.  Although as a one of the best Kouriers in the New World, she can take care of herself pretty well.<br /><br />Reality and the online world of the Metaverse have become meshed and where one starts the other leaves off has become a gray area.  Much of the analysis of what is happening was out of my reach for a long while in the book.  Then with a deft piece of writing, Stephenson brings all of the pieces together with quite an interesting proposition on about page 400.

Instead, I can honestly say that hate this book-- and I also feel bad saying that about someone's work, because it's almost like saying you hate someone's baby.<br /><br />Maybe it was all the hype I was exposed to before reading it,but I just could not shake a deep feeling of annoyance throughout 90% of this book. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot. And when I wasn't doing that, I was asking myself things like: \\""Do people really think this is the Cyberpunk cream of the crop? How many pages to go?\\""<br /><br />The first obvious problem was the prose. Apparently some people's funny bones get tickled by similes comparing military bases to boils on someone's butt, metaphors about valleys and geological oral sex, and clever wordplay like calling refugees \\""Refus\\"" (Refuse, har har har, get it?). To an elitist douchebag like me it just sounds juvenile and unimaginative. Combine all that with clunky, corny writing, and it's just downright lame. I could have also done without the \\""Unix In A Nutshell\\""-like explanations of EVERYTHING that drag down the flow of the book even more.<br /><br />The other big problem was that I did not care about any of the characters. Hiro was annoying as hell because it's obvious that he's just a nerd's fantasy of what he wishes he could do. Y.T. also got on my nerves. She could have disappeared in the middle of the book and I would not have missed her. There was nothing likeable or interesting about either of them. Ironically, among all the cartoony, shallow characters, the only ones that had some sense of deeper humanity were Ng and Raven.<br /><br />Another letdown was that the book's ideas were not that great, which did not help the plot. I just did not buy the whole \\""neurolinguistic hacking\\"" angle as it was used. People becoming brainless zombies from watching some binary code on a screen, or listening to some Sumerian \\""namshub\\""? That is so far removed from the fields of NeuroLinguistic Programming and memetics, that this might as well have been a Dungeons & Dragons novel. I get it. Brains are just like computers, so they can get viruses, binary code, 0's and 1's, blah blah blah. Seriously, I can suspend disbelief, but you can only take a metaphor so far before it starts to look stupid.<br /><br />Finally, for a book that's supposed to be a belly busting satire, the humor in this book is rather lame and nerdy. I read people talking about how this book made them howl with laughter, but almost everything fell pretty flat for me. The only section that got a half-assed 'heh' from me was the government policy on the use of toilet paper, but by the second page the joke had already become stale.<br /><br />All in all, I doubt that I will buy another book from this author. Judging from what little I've read in Cryptonomicon and Diamond Age, there is little that has changed for me to warrant another look.",2009-08-22

I found Snow Crash to be excellent cyberpunk.    Stephenson creates what is probably the most completely realized world in cyberpunk.  The vision he has of a world where the United States has become balkanized, corporations rule civilization, and the virtual world rivals that of the real world in importance is painstakingly rendered.  His prose flows off the page and makes Snow Crash a page turner.  The characters in the book are well-developed and interesting.    The book, in my opinion, has three negative qualities:    1.  Snow Crash has lots of exposition.  No, really.  Lots.  In Stephenson's defense, this exposition is very artfully handled; however, if you find long explanations tedious, be warned.      2.  The central tenet of the work, while exceptionally creative and well-researched, only holds if you don't think much about it.  All science-fiction requires suspension of disbelief, but this tenet is pretty out there.    3.  The ending is extremely abrupt.  The book actually stops more than it ends, leaving the reader without any idea of what happened to key characters.  Some ambiguity can serve a novel well if it provokes the reader to introspection, but the end of Snow Crash comes off as unfinished rather than thought provoking.    Snow Crash, is however, one of the top two or three cyberpunk books I've ever read, and it's the most ingeniously crafted.  While it has flaws, its oustanding even with them.",2009-08-01

However, like Stephenson's other blockbuster, The Diamond Age: A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer, Snow Crash goes way beyond pure entertainment.

After all, your brain is simply a biological computer itself.     This is one of the main themes in Stephenson's SNOW CRASH, a becoming-more-recognizable future where people divide their time between Reality and the Metaverse.     The other theme is more complex, but tries to draw parallels between Sumerian mythology and computer viruses. It's interesting in that it challenges the reader to alter their view of history, but the analogies are not as well drawn as they could be.     Fortunately, these two suit-and-tie topics are woven into a story that features an eccentric cast of characters and an action-packed storyline. I couldn't use the phrase \\""colorful cast of characters\\"" as some of them are literally black and white in the Metaverse!    For example there's the main hero, Hiro Protagonist. I haven't come across a name that creative since Prince S., a character in Dostoyevsky's THE IDIOT.  The sword-wielding, motorcycle-riding Hiro reminded me heavily of Cloud from the famous FINAL FANTASY 7.     Then there's the skateboarding Y.T. (not Whitey!), a 15-year old, skateboarding female Kourier that reminded me of the rebellious John Conner of TERMINATOR 2.     The locations are just as interesting, where people live in storage units or the neighborhoods of Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong, The Sacrifice Zone, Nova Sicilia, Narcolumbia, et al.    It's not exactly Mister Roger's Neighborhood either as each place has their own rules and lots of security to keep out unwanted people.     Just off the shore of the West Coast (where most of the story takes place) is a mass of ships called The Raft. Very similar to Mieville's ship-city of Armada in his book THE SCAR (written many years after this book). It is here where Hiro and gang meet up with several of the major antagonists as the novel draws to a close.     Withso many crazy ideas all into one book, it is understandable that the first hundred pages read like SNOW CRASH FOR DUMMIES, complete with laugh-out-loud humor, to make your transition into this world easier than Orientation Day at school or work.      After those first hundredish pages, the story races along like a mechanical guard-dog on a straight highway.     The mythology portions come up about halfway, but are presented by a Librarian. The best way to imagine the Librarian: What if GOOGLE could talk? or What if that stupid paperclip in MICROSOFT OFFICE actually did something useful for once?    The ending, while action-packed and exciting, is where I felt some disappointment. The last line is good, but there is not much closure on what happens to the characters and the chapters that were previously ~15 pages are rapidly narrowed down to ~5 pages--a sign of an author who can't contain his excitement at almost finishing his book.     But on the whole, I found this novel much more enjoyable and understandable than William Gibson's earlier NEUROMANCER.

Published in 1991, the book suggests a near-future America where the privization and libertarian fantasies of the Reagan years have led to America breaking up into innumerable little city states, each part of a franchise chain. The independent hacker and swordsman Hiro Protagonist pays his bills by working as a \\""deliverator\\"", conveying pizzas from a Mafia-owned pizzeria franchise to LA suburbs designed to the same general plans. When not making deliveries, Hiro is a luminary of the Metaverse, a 3D virtual environment accessed by people all over the globe. In this technological fantasy world, someone is spreaking a virus that kills hackers, and Hiro has to take down the culprit with an understanding of Sumerian myth.<br /><br />Parts of SNOW CRASH are dated indeed. The Metaverse concept seems silly now that the 1990s interest in virtual reality has faded. Stephenson's hope that hackers would be the heroes of the future has gone unrealized when the people who keep the web's most popular sites running are still considered socially inept geeks. Nonetheless, quite a bit of it is still remarkably fresh. Consider this early observation of globalization:<br /><br />\\""Once things have evened out, they're making cars in Bolivia and microwave overs in Tadzhikistan and selling them here--once our edge in natural resources has been made irrelevant by giant Hong Kong ships and dirigibles that can ship North Dakota all the way to New Zealand for a nickel--once the Invisible Hand has taken all these historical inequities and smeared them out into a broad global layer of what a Pakistani brickmaker would consider to be prosperity--y'know what? There's only four things we do better than anyone else: music, movies, microcode (software), high-speed pizza delivery.\\""<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book the first time I read it in my early teens. Nowadays, however, I see the book as incredibly flawed. Anyone with a liberal arts education is sure to be annoyed by Stephenson's treatment of linguistics and Sumerian myth, and the DA VINCI CODE-esque sensationalism on ancient religions. When Stephenson has to introduce the Sumerian element, he has no better way to do this than a long droning monologue from a librarian character. The whole hacker and super-privatized America portions of the book are great fun, but the Sumerian virus element just seems lame.

Upon reading that assessment however, I felt that you could lift that passage up, substitute \\""Snow Crash\\"" in where \\""Daniel Deronda\\"" is and you'd have a fairly good review of this novel.    The opening chapter of \\""Snow Crash\\"" is incredible. It is exciting, prophetic, funny... mostly FUNNY. After reading chapter 1 you will (mistakenly) think that the rest of the book will be the most awesome book you ever read. Do not be fooled. I am not saying the rest of the book is bad, far from it, it just doesn't um.. POP! I would have been very happy to see Chapter 1 as a short story, it would have been just as effective as the whole novel.    That being said however, the effect of having a balls to the wall action scene (as every James Bond fan can attest) makes sure that you stick around long enough to tell you what the author is really thinking about. In this case I don't think Stephenson sat down to write a novel about A pizza delivery, he wanted to work out his ideas about Sumerian culture and what he thought the internet might evolve into.     As to what the internet might evolve into, Anyone who has played Second Life or any similar themed games knows that the Metaverse is not far away, if it's not already here. Whether \\""Snow Crash\\"" was a prophetic novel or a novel that caused the internet to become what it is is a question I leave for the historians, but it is worth chewing over in your mind for a while at least.    One thing I really missed in this book (as well as all cyberpunk novels and stories I've ever read) is the idea that there probably be more than one Metaverse. This may seem silly, but where there's Windows, there's Linux and Mac OS, so why, in every story I read is there only one Metaverse? It seems to be a conceit in Cyberpunk, but in a book as rich as \\""Snow Crash\\"" with so many factions with so many agendas it just seems that that there would be parallel Metaverses where each faction could make the rules.    Lastly, I'd like to just mention in passing how influential this book actually is. I find it amazing just how many things this book has ended up being mixed up in. For example, I recently became a fan of the show Heroes and for the LIFE of me I can never remember what the little Japanese dude with the samurai sword's last name is because I just call him Hiro Protagonist. There are other examples, recently I've even seen Burbclaves starting to develop.     So if you are a fan of Cyberpunk, SF, Sumerian culture and or literature, give this one a try. Whatever I personally think of it, it is a landmark novel and, despite not living up to that first chapter, is still a fun and exciting read.",2009-03-06

Hacker Hiro Protagonist delivers pizzas for a living for the now-respectable Mafia until a mishap unites him with a fifteen-year old, futuristic skateboarder named Y.T.  Hiro falls back on what he knows best -- hacking and gathering intelligence that he can sell to the former C.I.A., now a private corporation -- with Y.T. as his eyes.  When his friend and former business partner Da5id opens a mysterious hypercard/drug called Snow Crash and becomes instantly catatonic, Hiro realizes the danger:  all hackers, this new world's most valuable resource, are vulnerable.  He sets out to stop the malicious forces that threaten to reduce the population to a babbling, unthinking mass.  As Hiro and Y.T. make their way toward the deadly Raven, an Aleut armed with glass knives and a nuclear bomb, and L. Bob Rife, a New Age cult leader (a send-up of L. Ron Hubbard) at the center of a flotilla of rafts and refugees afloat in the Pacific, they uncover the \\""truth\\"" about viruses, language, computers, mythology, and the core of the human brain.<br /><br />The most amazing aspect of this novel is Stephenson's ability to imagine in 1992 (really, before that, since that's the year it was published) what today's world has become; the cultural satire and commentary in Snow Crash has become more relevant today with the internet/World Wide Web, privatization, dependence on computers, policy-shaping religious leaders, Second Life, and a global economy.  Although Stephenson's parallels between computers and the human brain are not new, what he suggests, that our DNA contains an informational/language virus based in our Sumerian roots, is both weirdly original and thought-provoking.  His revision of mythology and religion (here, both language and religion are viruses) is rooted in research and then takes off in improbable but intriguing directions.  Like Ishmael Reed's [[ASIN:0684824779 Mumbo Jumbo]], this novel connects religion from multiple cultures, from ancient times to the present, to form the heart of a conspiracy.<br /><br />Except for the sections detailing Sumerian mythology and history, this novel moves forward at a brisk pace, with both humor and suspense.

Some of the technology described, even if slightly off-base, rightly predicts what we are using and developing today.    Something bad:  I won't delve too much on the absurdities described with a supposedly ancient \\""hacker\\"" algorithm being made to free mens' minds from the entrapment of a hypothetical space \\""virus\\"". Nor will I go into the rancid historical references used to back up this laughable proposition (there are more intelligent people than me who have detailed this in reviews here already.) But to suppose that by 2012 (this is a guess based on evidence in the story since the date isn't listed anywhere I could see) that the entire US government would be minimalized to the point of vestigial worthlessness because of over privatization, and that society would be fractured into competing commercial \\""franchises\\"", run by agencies such as the Mafia none-the-less, is just silly. Sure there's room for satire (I'm pretty sure Stephenson was not a fan of the Reagan era), but an author has to at least give a more realistic time line to work with. This is supposed to be a natural deterioration here, not even post-war, yet, somehow, all democratic society withered away in 20 years.    Something awful:  Contrived plots and silly ideas are one thing. Writing them down in such a poor and inconsistent manner is inexcusable. There are times when the characters will completely shift their narrative and their personality. Just going from the first chapter to the next couple presented such a fundamental change that I have to believe that the first was written years apart from the rest of the book.    Later in the book Stephenson can't seem to find a better way to express his largely contrived ideas than to expound upon them in a fashion that I can only relate to a Socratic dialogue (in tone if not in substance.) First there's the main character, Hiro, talking back and forth with an AI librarian for chapters at a time trying to formulate this Sumerian plot point, then later we get the same type of performance except now we have the heads of a few of these world controlling franchises playing the parts of the librarian. Stephenson couldn't think a better way to get his ideas across than to create lengthy (and quite boring) dialogues?      To conclude, I'm not sure why this book is so beloved. The writing is immature, and the ideas supporting the plot are untenable. If it wasn't for his view of an interconnected virtual world this book would be worthless.",2008-11-13

After you read that chapter, it goes down slightly in quality.    Perhaps Mr. Stephenson rewrote that chapter again and again, or perhaps he wrote it for something else. Regardless, it HUMS. And it feels different from the rest of the story. Darker, more dangerous, just as satirical, but not quite as funny.    Past that, though, the story hardly breaks down. It is entertaining throughout, very amusing in most places, and harbors characters that I will probably never forget. I had previously read a single Neal Stephenson book (The Big U), which I also loved. Every time I see one of his new books come out, I have the feeling that I should buy it. (I had this same feeling with Murakami's Kafka on the Shore, and Kazuo Iguro's Never Let Me Go...now adays, I simply listen to that little voice, obviously).    The story never gets bad, it is entertaining throughout, the characters are original and interesting, so why not five stars? Well, two reasons. First, I don't think that any of the characters develop, at all, in the course of the book. Things happen, people die, and no one changes. Not something that I ordinarily like to give five stars to. Second, while it is terribly fun, it is not terribly relevant. There is nothing here that made me think, \\""Hrmmm...\\"" in the realms of personal thought or thoughts of import. Again, not something that I like to give five stars to. If I could, I would, also, give it four and a half stars. If only Amazon would give us ten stars to use!!!

US,14401987,R1C7W2HDUMNTR7,0553380958,445913,"Snow Crash",Books,1,42,80,N,N,"practically unreadable","Sentence construction is an art that extends beyond your high school English teacher's boundaries of correct or incorrect. It's necessary, at a basic level, to ensure that a book's readable, but it can be also used as a tool, among other devices, to enrich an author's message. Stephenson's sentences in Snow Crash are so clunky, top-heavy, and distracting that it gave me a headache. The book is further weighed down by poor humor and cheap jabs.    I tried hard to like Snow Crash. I thought that maybe if I can get beyond the writing style, I'd find myself immersed into a whole new world of ideas. But after a good bit of effort on my part, I had to give up. Consider this sentence from the opening chapter, which occurs during an action sequence involving high-speed driving:    \\""He knows that when he gets to the place on CSV-5 where the bottom corner of the billboard is obscured by the pseudo-Gothic stained-glass arches of the local Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates franchise, it's time for him to get over into the right lanes where the retards and the bimbo boxes poke along, random, indecisive, looking at each passing franchise's driveway like they don't know if it's a threat or a promise.\\""    Long sentences aren't inherently bad, this one's just awfully constructed. Structurally, the bulk of the sentence revolves around the \\""when...it's time\\"" construction. The \\""when\\"" leaves the reader anticipating the next clause which will, presumably, complete the thought. But while we're waiting for the completion, we're given an elaborate description of a view of just the corner of a billboard sign. The description is given merely to add a flare of style, since it contains no content that is meaningful to the reader. All of which would be fine if the description were more precise, but instead we're given a lengthy description of these arches and the unnecessarily long name of some irrelevant franchise. Had the sentence just ended there, it would merely have been a terrible sentence. Characteristic of Stephenson's writing, the sentence doesn't end there, elevating it from terrible to excruciating, as the next clause - intended to complete the \\""when...\\"" construction - contains an even wordier description of the sort of drivers in the next lane. Not to mention the clumsy \\""it's time for him to get over into the next lane\\"", which could easily be swapped for something more efficient, along the lines of maybe \\""he needs to switch lanes\\"" - or just with anything that avoids a superfluous \\""it's\\"", which immediately takes your mind out of the action by introducing the neutral and meaningless universal subject \\""it\\"" smack in the middle of the sentence. Redundant with the previous clause, is another \\""where\\"" construction, which is then used as an excuse to dive down a second whole rabbit hole of unnecessary description and detail. Needless to say, the poking and looking actions of passengers in the neighboring lane does a fine job of burying any muddled intentions that the sentence might have had under a thick layer of fresh concrete.    All of which, mind you, is simply a thought in the character's head (i.e., \\""He knows that when\\""), and is occurring during what's supposed to be a high-speed action sequence. And all of which begs the question, how can you possibly be emerged in the action as you slide down numerous tangential clauses, or how could care about the technical intention of the sentence (i.e., what he knows) when you're thrown wordy proper nouns, and how could you simultaneously care in the least about billboard signs and retards driving cars, all at the same time?     Labyrinthine sentences like these aren't speed bumps on the road, they're 6-inch round potholes and roadblocks. And Snow Crash is filled with them on every page. In them, Stephenson throws practically everything at the reader hoping he or she might bite onto something; you might bite onto pieces of it, but it's at the greater expense of losing everything else along with blocking any possibility of literary flow. No matter how hard I tried my mind was kept at an uncomfortable distance from the text as it stumbled over mindless clauses, unnecessary elaborations, and adjectives that were more distracting than descriptive. It all resulted in a gray unmemorable mess.    It's not that Stephenson has bad ideas, it's that he can't effectively get them out on paper. Purchasing an audio version of the book might help, so that someone else has to read the sentences, but it's doesn't make up for the fact that the book's dreadfully written.    I was annoyed by other stylistic techniques throughout the book as well. Curse words are sprinkled liberally throughout the narrative to pointless effect. They're used in place of more descriptive adjectives. Perhaps Stephenson used them to give the book a pulpy feel, but even good pulp consists of more than just four-letter words.    And lastly Stephenson's humor often borders more on cheap than witty. The example that sticks out the most in my mind is his slang term - \\""bimbo-boxes\\"" - for minivans. I don't own a minivan, or particularly sympathize with those who do, it's just a very superficial brand of humor - a cheap-shot at modern society, not particularly well thought-out or clever. Certainly a timeless piece of literature - even if it's farcical - should have higher standards than calling minivan drivers bimbos merely in passing. There are bigger literary fish to fry.     This sort of humor pervades the whole book. Sometimes it serves a minor plot or thematic function, but more often it's just mentioned in passing, often replacing qualitative character- or world-building. If that's really what you're looking for then there are plenty liberal political/social commentary books, or go to a leftist protest, or check out a Michael Moore film. Just because it's in a sci-fi book doesn't automatically give this sort of humor more merit. Anyone can do it.    I'm sure that there are great ideas in the book - had I read beyondthe first eighth of the book, I probably would've come across more of them - but it got to the point where I couldn't imagine how they'd justify the work of clawing through grammatical jungles under the guise of \\""sentences\\"" and elongated portions of fluff.",2008-08-31

Enter Hiro Protagonist--hacker, samurai swordsman, and pizza-delivery driver. Young Hiro Protagonist (yes, that's the hero protagonist's name) uses his computer game wizardry and pizza delivering skills to combat a deadly new designer drug (and computer virus) called Snow Crash. He encounters a sinister computer virus that threatens to bring about a collapse of the information system. With the help of a young messenger on one of the coolest skateboards ever described, he traces the virus to its source and confronts his nemesis in person and in the Metaverse. Along the way, he explores Babylonian metaphysics and Old Testament theology. The flashy, snappy delivery fails to compensate for the uninhabited blandness of the characters.

Although I had to warm to the book at first, I eventually gave myself over to Neal Stephenson's genre-busting mix of thrilling narrative arc and thoughtful book of ideas.  The eponymous hero, Hiro Protagonist, is a winner; the evil antagonist, Raven, is one for the ages as well.  When Raven turns on someone with his glass knives in hand, the reader will take notice (or maybe even cover, if said reader be weak of heart).<br /><br />The book begins with a Mad Max-style pizza delivery scene, introducting Hiro and the strong female support, a kourier (delivery girl) named Y.T. who \\""poons\\"" cars (attaches a magnet attached to a ski-style string leading back to her skateboard-type device) for speedy delivery.  She's a 15-year-old, wise-cracking, firecracker of a foil for Hiro.  Then Raven is inserted into the mix, and before you know it, Hiro is trying to solve a mystery that involves heavy research into the ancient Sumerian culture.<br /><br />The characters move freely between real time and the Metaverse -- an Internet society populated by avatars.  Hiro is a master hacker, and he's going to need all of his talents to counter the likes of Raven. It's funny.  It's intriguing.  And it's hold-on-to-your-seat thrilling.<br /><br />Readers will appreciate the fast-paced plot and the spectacular ending, but thinkers will be fascinated by the concept of language and mythology being intertwined with viruses that can infect not only computers, but human brains.  Inventive and witty, Stephenson's prose is a muscular antidote to the MFA style writing you might be getting bored with (or even sick of) these days.

I liken Stephenson to Thomas Pynchon although he is a lot easier to digest. There are fewer digressions and he doesn't get wrapped up in inside jokes that are hard for anyone apart from PHD physicists to appreciate. At the same time, there is certainly a lot going on from a technical standpoint and some sort of background in computers is necessary to get a deeper understanding of what's happening in his breakthrough novel, Snowcrash. A basic understanding of Neuro-Linguistic programming and Artificial Intelligence will help the reader get a lot more out of the storyline than just the comic book style action. The pace can be sort of uneven and there is no real resolution or surprise ending, but still, this is a great read.<br /><br />Is it possible for a virtual world to exist in such a fashion that it gets mixed up with reality? To me this is what Snowcrash is all about and if you like the Matrix and its various sequels, than this one is right up your alley. The author's mind is absolutely brilliant and he works his way through time, much like in Pynchon's V, integrating history & Sumerian Myth with his futuristic Cyberpunk-world. There is a lot of cutting satire mixed in. In my opinion, Snowcrash continues along the lines of the Frankenstein's monster theme-the idea that man made technology can get out of control and take on a mind of its own. In a way Stephenson takes it to the next level in Snowcrash where technology creates its own parallel, quantum reality.<br /><br />The thing I like best about Stephenson is his prose, there is a lot of humor in his writings and the way he describes things. It's easy to follow and though he is does lay out some heavy concepts, he  doesn't overwhelm the reader. There's a kind of hip edge to the \\""geeky,\\"" techno-concepts brought forth in Snowcrash and Stephenson's vision of the future isn't too far off from some people's realities.

The future world that Stephenson describes (both real and virtual) has just enough level of fine technological details to be incredibly real and possible.  We don't know what's going on, but we have a feeling that this is going to be one awesome book.    Then we hit the middle.  And suddenly everything comes to a screeching halt, as we're presented with 50-page lecture on Pentecostals, Hebrews, Sumerian mythology and Kabbala.  In a sense, it is expected.  General formula of a thriller:  confuse the reader at the start, explain most of the riddles somewhere in the middle while leaving off a few of the vital pieces, then reveal these closer to the end.  In this case, however, the lecture clarifies virtually nothing.  Despite all of Stephenson's attempts to keep it lively and in a form of a dialog, it's mind-numbingly boring and has very little connection to what is going on in the actual plot.  Furthermore, its historical accuracy is questionable.  I'm not an expert on Ancient Sumer, but I know enough about Christianity to say that Pentecostals are NOT part of Orthodox Christianity and that Resurrection story was not appended to the Gospels.  The Gospels weren't even the first documents that talk about resurrection of Jesus.  Paul's letters predate them by at least 10 years.  Given how far off the mark Stephenson is when it comes to Christianity, it makes me suspicious of the rest of the information we're given.    The lecture aside, the book continues, nowhere near the speed or level of intrigue set by the opening chapters.  It also becomes very patchy.  Characters enter and leave the narration with little warning or explanation.  How does Hiro suddenly transform from a bum living in a storage facility to a fully loaded bike rider?  At which point does everybody suddenly decide that he needs to be killed?  Just what exactly is so special about a 15-year-old Kourier besides attitude-sans-limits that the Mafia  actually decides to employ her services?  All of these are either unanswered or given very fleeting and sketchy explanations.    Finally, the novel drags itself to the ending, where another lengthy lecture is given, summarizing the earlier presentation and explaining in details what is going on.  Well, as much details as can be given in a pseudo-scientific fictional book about a virus that is both computer and biological at the same time.    Then the book ends.  At least two major story lines are unfinished.  What happens to Da5id?  What about the hydrogen bomb that Raven was carrying?  Just how exactly Juanita managed to master the Sumerian language?  I could go on.    This is a truly disappointing novel.

There's not one chapter that goes by where you aren't interested.  Even the less action-packed chapters are just as captivating, not only because Neal Stephenson can write a sentence so full of satire and humor that only weeks later while standing in line at the DMV will you break out in laughter at finally understanding it completely, but because the content is just so intriguing. I also must confess to loving the parts of the book that dealt with Sumerian mythology, as well as the Raft.  Anyway, without giving any more details, I definitely stand by this book as one of the best novels ever written. Even Time Magazine seems to agree, having put it on a list of \\""All-Time 100 Novels\\""([...] So especially if you've been out of touch with a good book for a while, consider reading \\""Snow Crash\\"" by Neal Stephenson. It'll make you fall in love with literature all over again, even if you don't know for sure what Cyberpunk means.",2007-09-15

Firstly, I am intolerant of authors that end the story at the very climax, as if saying, 'well, you can figure out from here the rest of what happens.'  Sure I probably can, but if I gotta write my own epilog, why did I bother letting you tell the rest of it?    Nextly, I am offended at gratuitous eroticism.  Sure, sexuality is a part of human existence, but so are many other human functions that don't contribute to a story.  And am I really supposed to enjoy the romanticized telling of the rape of a 15 year old skateboarder by a mutant muscleman?  Why is there no outcry against this?    Also, can't our character development be a little less contrived, a little deeper?  How many times must I be reminded that our Hiro is the best swordsman in both worlds?  Must all the cardboard supporting characters continually gush about how 'bad' or 'cool' he is?    Sure it's a hard-boiled 'gumshoe' novel, but that doesn't excuse it from being a novel, with satisfying endings, tied off loose ends, free of adolescent titillations, and real characters.    And all the Sumerian myth stuff, though interesting in itself, was kind of just chopped up and dumped into a pot and mixed up with all kinds of other unrelated things (neurolingual programming, machine code, speaking in toungues, even herpes virus).

Would've made a fun animated flick, as it was apparently originally supposed to be, according to the author's afterword in my copy (from the SFBC). But as a serious sci-fi book, it's got some serious problems. Apparently Stephenson styles himself as a Hacker, and proudly wears his programming pedigree on his sleeve. I've worked as a systems analyst for twenty years, and found the whole Snow Crash virus idea silly in the extreme. The idea is this: working on programs in a third-generation language such as COBOL or C (i.e., an English-like code that must be translated by a compiler into 0's and 1's for the computer's consumption), a programmer's mind becomes altered somehow--becomes amenable to computer viruses.

Although the world was fascinating and Stephenson obviously has a gift for imagining truly off-the-wall environments, the problem I had with this novel is that it was just that: a collection of really cool, cyberpunk-like vignettes with minimal narrative linkage between them.  As such, I found that this book read more like a glorified, beefed up character study than an actual novel.  Many of the more interesting plotlines were abandoned before they had even really been given a chance to breath (examples include the Fallaballa camp, the cyberdog, and the Northern Kodiak Republic). <br /> <br />Conversely, where Stephenson did focus on the story, the plotline seemed somewhat derivative and less than solid.  After all, the main character seems to decide to go off on his quest for no real reason, risking life and limb in an amazing adventure, basically because a friend asks him to (granted there's more to it than that, but that's the gist).  The most interesting parts, especially involving the impact of language on the human brain and pysche development seemed largely unfinished and while it would appear that Stephenson had a very strong idea of where he wanted to go with it, he seemed unable to fully articulate the details of his plot and as such just sort of threw his ancient Babylonian myth backstory at the main plot and just hoped the reader would make the connection and not spend too much time trying to figure it out. <br /> <br />Likewise, there are several annoying plot holes which are never really plugged, and the reader is forced to assume that everything just happened behind the scenes (ex. how Hiro came to realize that he and Raven were linked, how and why Hiro decided to become a gargoyle, among others).  This coupled with Stephenson's tendency to drop storylines as soon as they become interesting is frustrating. <br /> <br/>This is not to say that \\""Snow Crash\\"" is not worth the read.  Considering that it was written in 1992, it has aged relatively well for an entry into the cyberpunk genre.  Stephenson seems to have more or less accurately predicted the rise of MMORPG-type environments, the continued integration of personal electronics, and the pervasiveness of the net and networking sites.  While we take these things for granted today, in 1992 these concepts were revolutionary (or at the very least ahead of the curve).

(Gibson is a push -- very different styles.) While Cryptonomicon was great stuff, friends have been shocked for years that I never was able to stick this one out, all the more so in light of the fact that I started reading him in 1984 with The Big U (his first novel, which he now all but disavows). Well, I finished it this time, and since I think White Rabbit's detailed review below is very astute, I'll just add a couple of things.<br /><br />First off, Neal often seems to exhibit signs of what some folks might call pedantry; he has the overweening pride, if not cockiness, of the autodidact (complete with occasional swipes at academics), and while I can kind of relate despite (or because of) my hard-earned degrees, he should get with his analyst and find a way to realize that this tendency to pontificate sometimes reflects rather poorly on him as an author and yes, as a human being. That is the case with the excessive Sumerian mythic components of Snow Crash (which don't add enough to the plot for the pages and pages of explication they receive, a source of complaint for many); and it is doubly true of the rambling Baroque Cycle, which few seem able to finish. That instance is all the sadder because it seems that this tendency of his is becoming worse, not better, with age. (In a perhaps related vein, he's also intensely private, even pathologically antisocial toward those of us in the faceless herd, as seems clear from the rants on his website.) One might wonder whether he needs more active editorial input, but here's a scary thought: what if these ARE the final products of intensive editing?<br /><br />Secondly, and more specifically to this novel, the over-the-top satirical elements finally get in the way of sensible storytelling, which becomes harder to take seriously the farther along in the book one gets. It just gets so overblown and silly by the end that I found it hard to stay engaged with it, whether as an adventure narrative or as social commentary. But again, Stephenson's a bright, witty, and intelligent author, one who sometimes is more profound in a single paragraph than are other genre authors over several thousand pages.

As the years passed, knowing that Snow Crash was a high-tech, cyberpunk tale set in the near future, I figured why bother? The novel's time came and went and sci-fi novels of the near future are a lot less interesting when history and technology make their premises irrelevant. But there are some novels, like those of H.G. Wells and especially Orwell's 1984, that are still great literature even if their posited futures clearly have not come to pass. Stephenson is such a well-liked author that I decided to give him a try, and I might as well try with his breakthrough novel.  I'm glad I did. Snow Crash is a rollicking good adventure that also has an intellectual undercarriage that makes you keep thinking about the book after you've read it. It is one of those books you want your friends to read so you can talk about it. <br /> <br />Also, even though the action in the novel should take place right about now, the fact that the nightmarish future created by Stephenson has (yet) to occur does not diminish the chill of recognition that a future like Stephenson paints could still happen. As with Orwell's 1984, just because that year has come and gone does not make that novel any less compelling and cautionary.  <br /> <br />Snow Crash follows two very intriguing and fun characters -- a hacker samurai and his teenage skateboarding partner -- into a mystery involving viruses, the virtual reality Metaverse, a monopolist businessman who would be king, and Sumerian myth. Stephenson pulls all these strands together brilliantly. Strip away the cyberpunk stuff and you still have a very tight, fast-paced plot and great book to read.  <br /> <br />This novel contains a lot of violence, some sexual content, and a very depressing depiction of the near future -- think of it as an R rated movie, a good one but not for youngsters. Despite the horrifying dystopia that this novel suggests that we will be living in soon, Stephensonseems to have a fundamentally upbeat view of human nature. This novel is not picaresque and nihilistic; the heroes are decent people out to do good deeds. Despite the cyberpunk sensibility, this is an epic adventure, worthy of the ancient myths that apparently inspired Stephenson. <br />",2006-09-21

I think Neal has done a great job of that in this book - not only plying his trade to create a plausible simulated reality but also allowing that reality to be reflected in changes to his characters and the societies that they live in.

The powers that be have classified it as cyberpunk, and indeed it shares the common characteristics of that forlorn subgenre: focus on computer technologies and virtual reality, decaying social structure, and fast pacing.  The success of Stephenson's book rests on three characteristics that keep it widely seperated from pervious cyberpunk efforts. <br /> <br />1. It's comprehensible; normal people can understand it.  Stephenson largely eschews stream-of-consciousness, computer speak, and excessively complicated prose.  You can read the book and grasp it in one try, without needing Cliff's Notes or a friendly Ph.D. in modern lit.  The storyline is clear, and when Stephenson does bring in high-tech jargon and references, he explains them in layperson's terms. <br /> <br />2. Humor.

One of the other reviewers said that Snow Crash had the best first chapter in any novel ever; I think Anna Karenina and the Brothers Karamazov come close, but this may be the first introductory chapter I've read. Stephenson literally invents a new world and uses the first couple of chapters to introduce the new lingo and basic concepts going along with it. <br /> <br />The vast majority of my reading deals with history or current events, and so I think what mesmorized me was the social trends that Stephenson seemed to be predicting, bearing in mind that I was reading this book in the 2004-2005 period, well over a decade after publication. Not everything is right and I don't think he literally intended it that way, but the picture of the future he paints was, I thought, really amazing for a book written 1988-1991. <br /> <br />His concept of a Burbclave, a \\""city-state with its own constitution, a border, laws, cops, everything\\"" and other substate entities taking over sovereignty was right on. Although I have long been generally aware of the localized zoning phenonemon, I didn't realize how far this had gone until I read Robert D. Kaplan's 1997 book, An Empire Wilderness, about the present and future of the United States. Had I not read Kaplan's book I would not have fully understood Stephenson here, and the way he pictures the world. <br />  <br />The Metaverse of course is quite insightful; the internet was around then, but it is much more obvious now that something like this is possible, that people might live their lives in virtual reality. I bet Stephenson thought he had been ripped off when he saw the Matrix movie, too. <br />  <br/>A similar but distinct point is regarding his Central Intelligence Corporation, and you would have to be hooked into the world of intelligence to really make the connection, in fact he may not have intended this. Stephenson doesn't use the phrase, but \\""open source\\"" intelligence is one of the big trends of the future. And there are private intelligence corporations now, Stratfor being the most prominent. <br />  <br />The way Stephenson pictures the thinness of culture has mirrors a worrying trend - like the reference to the woman who speed reads tabloids and can't control her kids, and the fact that people are so socially detatched and rootless. And the fact that Hiro is wanderer, a guy with an intense interest but fixed to no specific place, is emblematic of that. <br />  <br />When I first read Stephenson's reference to America not manufacturing things, having not read the year of publication, I did look at the copyright page, since that dates it somewhat. The early 1990s was when that was really big, and lately the hysteria has been over outsourcing. On that issue I've never bought the dire predictions. There is some truth to what he says though, especially in terms of economic global interconnectedness and globalization more broadly. Also, his emphasis on Japanese corporations is a bit dated - if he were writing the book today I'm sure that they would be Chinese. <br /> <br />So if you are looking for something new to read, and you haven't ever read Neal Stephenson, try him out.",2005-12-04

I noticed this time thru that the descriptions of The Street are becoming quaint. Advances in MMORPGs have already blasted through anything Stephenson imagined. And onlines like Second Life and the Sims, have actually created a virtual hangout that mirrors reality pretty well. The stuff about your avatars looking grainy if you have a slow connection was pretty funny too. It's ironic that he imagined everything in The Street being free just based on programming ability. <br /> <br />Most successful online worlds require an economy with scarcity, otherwise there is no challenge. Second Life may be an exception to this. I still give him alot of credit for coming up with this so long ago. <br /> <br />The first time thru, I did not realize what a libertarian Stephenson is, but this is more clear in some of his later books and interviews. The discussions of franculates and burbclaves makes MUCH more sence when seen in this light. I didn't *get* it the first time thru and missed a whole layer of subtext, just thought it was cool and futuristic. Now I see that he was extrapolating what would be the natural outgrowth of privatizing all functions of government; citizenship is something you could buy and sell and choose your own affiliations, independent of where you live. I think that alot was left unsaid however but some of the implications were well-developed. Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong providing autonomous robotic defense facilities, or the deregulated prison system (ie. The Clink). <br />He effectively blurs the lines between gang affiliations, corporate franchises and governments, which is a thought provoking juxtaposition, since each of these provides much the same role but in different sociological arenas. I understood that residential burbclaves could have their own constitutions and defense forces, but all of the other territories were private property...even the roads were private property. So do you pay rent everywhere you go? Not exactly clear. <br /> <br />Still love all of the stuff about Enki and the en and me...

It's as if Stephenson was setting things up for a sequel without having the vaguest idea as to what he was going to put into it, and so decided to leave all his options open. <br /> <br />\\""Diamond Age\\"" ended in much the same way, with a mass swim by a group of Chinese orphan girls for purposes impossible to surmise. So, after two novels of extremely spirited, uneven, and generally disconnected material, it becomes apparent that Stephenson has no idea what structure is or even that such a thing exists -- a strange characteristic for somebody so involved in cybernetics. Stephenson's method of writing seems to be a 3rd mil variation of the old pulp crank-it-out technique. He simply throws in whatever occurs to him at a particular moment, hammers it until it fits, then sends the whole assemblage rolling. When it comes time to shut things down, he grabs the most convenient plot element, tosses it under the wheels and throws his hands over his eyes until the noise stops. <br /> <br />That no editor has ever so much as noticed this failing, much less sat him down and discussed it with him, somehow comes as no surprise to me. <br /> <br />It's all a great pity, since Stephenson has beaucoup other virtues -- imagination, flair, serious knowledge beyond the level of \\""I read it the Paducah Democrat science section\\"", along with other elements not commonly seen in SF: real humor, real wit, a sense of style, and a compassion totally alien to the \\""humans are units\\"" attitude of the sciffy community in general.

This I freely admit up front.  But as a big fan of Thomas Pynchon and someone who doesn't go out of their way to read sci-fi or any other genre fiction, I merely seek to warn others of similar tastes.  So if William Gibson, Robert Sterling and Phillip K Dick are your literary gods, these comments probably won't sway you one way or another... if, on the other hand, like me, your interest in \\""Snow Crash\\"" was aroused solely through comparisons to Thomas Pynchon and the like, this review is for you.    First of all, it should be stated that Pynchon has become so synonymous with the whole tongue-in-cheek ultra-literary treatment of conspiracy theory (as well he should) that every two bit hack that chooses to incorporate secret societies into his/her work inevitably gets compared to Thomas Pynchon, regardless of their ultimate literary intentions.  Neal Stephenson may be more than a two bit hack, but - regretfully - on the basis of \\""Snow Crash\\"", not a whole lot.  The only remotely Pynchonesque aspect of the novel is the existence of a secret language based on old Sumerian lore, which is not only monosyllabic but so simplistic that it's informational content deposits directly into the core of the brain:  in other words, you have no choice over whether or not to believe it; just by hearing it the content becomes an inherent part of your belief system.  This seems entirely ludicrous but apparently has some basis in certain linguists' theories, and is particularly Pynchonesque in this regard since it involves language itself, and Pynchon's works are as much about the ways that we communicate and experimenting with those methods as they are about plot (the latter almost an afterthought in TP's work).     But here we get into the gist of the review, and why many people will feel I'm being unfair to Neal Stephenson:  I believe, with not only his fans, his publishers, and - to some extent - the author himself inviting comparisons to Pynchon, it's not entirely out of line to illustrate why Pynchon soars while Neal Stephenson fails miserably.  While I certainly intend to get into detail below, the overall failing of the book I feel is Stephenson's failure to weave this elaborate linguistic theory into a remotely convincing plot.  The details on how this Sumerian language is propagated is extremely complex and well considered (whether it happens to have any basis in fact or not), but nothing else about the plot fits this description.  Ultimately, then, \\""Snow Crash\\"" reeks of Stephenson pasting someone else's ideas into his work with little apparent motive except to beef up the perceived intellectual validity of an otherwise vapid plot.    Getting back to the Sumerian subplot, not only does the idea of this secret language echo TP (Thomas Pynchon, natch), but Stephenson (hereby NS) also interrupts the plot for a great deal of exposition, something TP also likes to do but, in my opinion, the latter enfolds it into the plot with a great deal more finesse than this author.  Another example of where a different author succeeds at this approach is with \\""Moby Dick\\"": whereas Melville skillfully creates suspense by interrupting the plot at key points in favor of \\""how-to\\"" expositions on whaling techniques, NS just switches back and forth every few pages at random, whether a break in the action or (god forbid) a temporary cliff hanger warrants it or not.      But here we are dealing with actual writing technique and, this being a work of fairly typical cyberpunk genre fiction, most people reading this are probably going to be far more concerned with the mechanics of the plot than on how it's actually laid out.  Well, have no fear:  with sketchy character development, implausible action worthy of a Jet Li movie and deus ex machina out the wazoo, there's plenty to fret over for everyone.  First of all, the main character's name is \\""Hiro Protagonist\\"".  Now, this also isthe kind of self-aware metafiction moniker TP might use, but at a much lower level of creativity: Pynchon would never go for something so obvious as \\""Hiro Protagonist\\"", but again: NS seems to be trying to appeal to people who think the \\""idea\\"" of Thomas Pynchon is a gas while finding the actual work of the man itself a bit obtuse.  Yes, if Stephenson or his publishers are going to compare themselves to TP they should call this \\""Pynchon for Dummies\\"".      So you've got Hiro, who is seemingly the world's greatest swordfighter in both the real world and a simulated virtual reality where most people who can afford to do so spend most of their time.  Not only that, but Hiro somehow finds time to simultaneously upkeep his skills as one of the greatest hackers in the world while still keeping his day job delivering pizzas for the Mafia.  Yes, in this ill-conceived post-apocalyptic world of Stephenson's the Mafia has gotten into the pizza delivery business, and if that pie isn't on your doorstep within thirty minutes flat there's going to be hell to pay.  The delivery boxes are even outfitted with a timer so that both the driver and the deliveree have a cinematic visual of the seconds ticking away (of course, people who want a free pizza would simply claim that the timers were set late to benefit the pizza company, making this expenditure a complete waste, but this kind of rationalizing has no place in Stephenson's universe).      This world of Stephenson's is barely sketched out in any sense, at one point Hiro telling another character that the Mafia would be breaking the law if there were any laws left to uphold, while that same character's mother is later introduced as working for the government in an almost completely undescribed role.  What role would a government have in a society that has decided into anarchy?  This is a good example of how NS gets bogged down in creating cheeky, \\""cute\\"" little details while letting the overall picture of his world dissipate into the ether.  It all sounds amusing as long as A) you don't think too deeply on it, and (most importantly) B) you've never read anyone who does this kind of punk rock dystopia thing better.  The problem is, if the story doesn't hold up to even the most stringent analysis it utterly fails at any kind of social commentary, which is the only thing aside from mindless action that \\""Snow Crash\\"" would seem to have going for it.      And of course I couldn't fail to mention Hiro's sidekick, a fifteen year old female courier who's the modern mall punk's wet dream:  a girl who steadfastly scorns authority while at the same time remaining eminently doable (it should be noted for adults with weaker stomachs that, despite her age, this character has consensual sex with someone of obviously adult age during the plot's... ahem, climax).      The only other thing I'd like to bring up is a common failing of sci-fi dystopias, that being the error of creating a vastly different physical world taking place well within the lifetime of those currently living/reading.  No matter how you incorporate some serious economic collapse, boom, whatever... technology may change but it's never going to be feasible to architecturally gut an entire city - let alone a country - and rebuild it's infrastructure from the ground up within a few years' time, which is apparently the case here (the chronology is as sketchy as anything else in NS' world, but one character is mentioned as having served in Vietnam while both his and Hiro's fathers are mentioned as having been fighting near Hiroshima during WWII when the atomic bomb was dropped).    Nothing in the story itself makes any sense, which leaves the enjoyment of \\""Snow Crash\\"" solely in the hands of those who brazenly advocate this brand of cyberpunk penis extension fantasy.  The book is filled with completely outlandish action sequences, nearly all of which involve technology which seems to have been manufactured solely to suit the characters' needs, not to mention the urge to make the average non-critical reader shout \\""cool!\\"" every fifteen seconds (much like the lack of consideration economics play in urban renovation, there seems to be a similar lack of consideration toward how technology develops and is made available to the public; but then, if you're the type of person to believe that military-grade defense equipment will ever be made available to minimum wage slaves - ie. a pizza delivery boy - particularly when only a small portion of the population are even able to afford a PC [as is the case in \\""Snow Crash\\""] than most likely nothing I can say will ever convince you otherwise).      Again, I do realize that most people who read this book will be exactly the type of people who go in for this sort of thing, but the bottom line is that \\""Snow Crash\\"" is guilty of being touted as some sort of literary achievement when in actuality it's nothing of the kind.  That being said, this sort of breezy plot-driven product does have it's fanbase, and if action heavy cyberpunk with minimal intellectual demands is your bag \\""Snow Crash\\"" might be right up your alley.     PS: lest anyone think I'm not giving Stephenson a fair chance, I'm in the middle of \\""Cryptonomicon\\"" right now, and it seems to be succeeding in all the ways \\""Snow Crash\\"" failed, so if he doesn't tank somewhere in the latter portions of the book I'll soon have a supportive review of that novel on the way, and from there I'll move on to the \\""Baroque Cycle\\"" rather than backtracking.  At this point I'm writing \\""Snow Crash\\"" off to authorial immaturity and assuming his later works are his best.  One way or another, I defy anyone to argue that \\""Snow Crash\\"" is anywhere close to the equal of \\""Cryptonomicon\\"", and if not why is it still worthy of 4-5 stars???",2005-08-04
US,40902019,R1OL7N2SM5XRCM,0553380958,445913,"Snow Crash",Books,4,5,8,N,Y,"4 1/2 stars- In response to some other reviews","There are a lot of references to Gibson in these reader reviews. I have enjoyed Gibson's work, but in truth he has only begun to realize the potential he displayed in \\""Neuromancer\\"" with \\""Pattern Recognition.\\""  The rest of Gibson's books have been pulpy and enjoyable but do not approach the level of creativity or insight that either Stephenson or Bruce Sterling exhibit.    Whether or not the Sumerian myth in \\""Snow Crash\\"" is 100% correct is largely irrelevant, as far as I'm concerned. Simply by combining Julian Jayne's theory on the \\""dawn of consciousness and the bicameral mind\\"", Chomskyan linguistic theory, Sumerian myth, and his own take on the pros and cons of a completely libertarian near future, and all along producing a great adventure story, Stephenson has put himself in a class by himself in regard to his fellow \\""cyberpunk\\"" authors.     Stephenson is not as much into anti-climax as Pynchon, but his novels do lack the trite \\""happy ending\\"" (or anti-happy, for that matter) scenarios that many authors rely on to clean up their messes (Gibson finally fully realized his own Pynchon-esque anti-climax with \\""Pattern Recognition\\"").    After reading another review, I am saddened to learn that anyone who makes the comparison of Stephenson (or presumably, the other cyberpunk cadre- and by the way, it's BRUCE Sterling) to Pynchon is of an inferior nature intellectually. Ah, well, life is full of these disappointments. But, in the interest of argument, I will point out that the comparison is there because science fiction, and in particular \\""cyberpunk,\\"" is about the interface between technology and humanity (and how technology changes humamity)- ala \\""Gravity's Rainbow.\\"" Secret organizations and conspiracies are much less the issue.     As far as referring to the world of \\""Snow Crash\\"" as a dystopia (and \\""post-apocalyptic\\"" is ridiculously off-the-mark- the only \\""apocalypse\\"" involved is the \\""infocalypse\\"" of Babel), that would be in the eye of the beholder. I expect a hard-core libertarian would see it as paradise. We would be significantly closer to this world right now if 9/11 hadn't happened and we weren't in the midst of an (hopefully temporary) expansion of federal powers. While some of the scenarios or situations may be somewhat extreme extrapolations of our current world and US trends (globalization and the shrinking of government), for the most part, Hiro's world is OUR world of corporate criminals, global franchises, shrinking government, de-regulation, religious fanaticism, gated communities, privatization, globalization, and information overload in some segments of the population and growing illiteracy in others, etc. AND one idea clearly stated in the book that holds pretty true now 13 years after its publication is that the United States only does four things better than anybody else: \\""music, movies, microcode, and deliver pizza in under 30 minutes.\\"" I guess you could add we invade other countries and SHOP better than anybody else. While Stephenson's statement may be a little harsh, it's not far off the mark; we export culture ONLY, these days, with varying degrees of success.    If the timeline of \\""Snow Crash\\"" seems improbable, see above paragraph, and bear in mind \\""1984\\"" done came and went, too.   In the study of history, it is better to understand the content and meaning of an event or period rather than all associated dates. Similarly, speculative fiction is about concepts and trends, and dates are more for shock value than anything else. Considering the book was written in 1992, it is entirely possible that two characters could have fathers in WWII (what year did Stephenson have in mind? 2002? 2005? 2010?- that might put Hiro and Raven in their late 30s, born late to older fathers) and have another character who had been in Viet Nam. The whole point is that this could all come to pass in our lifetimes, and as stated previously, for all intents and purposes a great deal of it has.

If you really get into it, check out \\""Zodiac\\"" to see and early example of a good work and \\""The Big U\\"" to see a very early example of a not-so-good work.    Now I think I'm going to order an extra copy of \\""Snow Crash\\"" just to make sure I have one around in case of emergency.

You can read half the book before the plot begins to develop. This would be acceptable if the first half were spent developing the characters or the setting, but I can't say that I believe it was. <br /> <br />The writing itself does not even seem to reach a professional level. I don't know if that's the fault of the author or a failure of the editor, but timeframes are not clearly stated, paragraphs have poor or awkward transitions, and the chapters have no smooth segue. The book reads clunky and lacks finesse. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I feel that this is one of the worst books I've invested time in reading. For those that enjoy the books of William Gibson, I recommend you stick to his books, or find a shorter book to read from Stephenson.

Hiro is a hacker as well, one who works better freelance.  He is half-Korean half-black and he is a citizen of Mr. Lee's Hong Kong franchise, but he lives in a U Store it.  The world he lives in is not the United States of present, but one were the United States is one of many franchises struggling to survive.  Hiro's world is technologically advanced and ethnically diverse.  This world is a very dangerous place.<br /><br />We meet Hiro as he is delivering a pizza, a pizza that looks as though it is going to be late.  Although Hiro wrecks his car, the pizza is delivered thanks to a skateboard currier name YT.  This act saves Hiro's life and indebts the Mob to YT.  This book only gets more interesting as it goes.  The central plot line of this novel is that of a virus called snow crash.  Snow crash not only infects computers but also hackers who's brains understand binary code.  There is a physical form of the virus that affects normal people as well.  Hiro's friend is infected with the snow crash virus so Hiro sets out to discover who is responsible.  YT's newly formed relationship with the mob gets her involved also.  The virus turns out to be a program that affects the bios of the brain.  It resets the brains of the people infected back to pre tower of Babel days.  Everyone infected is able to communicate in this early language.  The virus is being spread in order to control the people infected, because like a computer they can have commands written directly into their brains.<br /><br />Stephenson meticulously researches Syrian history and mythology.  He crafts a virus as unique as his world and then pumps in enough history and fact to make it all seem almost plausible.  His writing is so descriptive and detailed that it forces the reader to research the facts themselves.  Stephenson takes something as seemingly boring as linguistic theory and draws an intriguing novel out of it.  This excellent research is not limited only to Snow Crash.  Stephenson repeats this with most of his works.  Diamond Age goes deep into the theories of nanotechnology and Cryptonomicon is so bogged down with math and code breaking that it turns off many readers.  That said, the mythology presented in Snow Crash is somewhat overwhelming.<br /><br />Stephenson is known as a cyberpunk author and this book definitely falls into the cyberpunk category.  Hiro becomes a gargoyle, someone always patched into the net, and owns a house right off of main street in the Metaverse (a representation of the world wide web).  Hiro himself is half-Asian and lives by the samurai code.  The franchises are ruling the world and society is being divided into the haves and have-nots.  Orwell's 1984 is a reality, except that it is not just three nations controlling the world but three hundred.  This book brought cyberpunk back from its presumed death.  If William Gibson is the god of cyberpunk, Snow Crash makes Neal Stephenson Jesus.<br /><br />The story flows along following the perspectives of different characters.  Hiro Protagonist, as his name would imply, is the main character, but we also see Stephenson's creation through YT and other minor characters.  A well-placed view from Spot the dog is refreshing if not a little sentimental, and the misadventure of a Mob flunky adds humor to the story at just the right time.  The use of different character perspectives maximizes Stephenson's ability to cast different moods and tones in a way that would be impossible just following Hiro.  It also gives the reader a different worldview.  Stephenson is able to show how the rest of the world operates outside of Hiro's limited view.<br /><br />Stephenson does have a weakness in his endings though.  He writes such a colorful and lively story and then it just suddenly stops.  The story hits its climax and ends there.  There is no resolution.  This is a common theme with other works of his as well.  Snow Crash, Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon, and Interface (written as Stephen Bury) all have a tendency to end at the climax.  The upside to this style is that it allows the readers to finish the story themselves.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this excellent book.  You do not have to like cyberpunk to enjoy the fast-paced action of this novel.  In fact, this novel could be the launching pad to a love of cyberpunk.  It is a quick and enjoyable, high octane joy ride into an alternate present.

It's a characteristically cyberpunk dystopic view of the future, with a smile. <br /> <br />He builds delivers this vision with a wealth of detail and a population of characters matched by pretty much no other science fiction writer out there, save the master himself William Gibson.  However, after the first few chapters, I had to begin wondering, with the collapse of all central authorities in North America, just how is this society hanging together?  How is it that the plethora of nations, corporations, and in betweens do simple things without a hitch, like spend each others' money?  If we could sit down with Stephenson and has this out, maybe we could get some pretty convincing answers.  But those answers are not provided here, so the impressive wealth of detail eventually looks like a thin veneer covering we know not what. <br /> <br />Stephenson's marvelously convoluted story involves ancient Sumerian religion, a corporate chain of Pentecostal churches, viruses of the biological and logical varieties, hackers, Julian Jaynes's ideas about the evolution of human consciousness (delineated several years back in \\""The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\\""), all involved in the mysterious nefarious plottings of a Texas oil magnate who has recently purchased the decommissioned U.S.S. Enterprise at a Navy public auction.  You couldn't ask for a better premise. <br /> <br />But a great premise is only a premise.  Stephenson's handling of religions and mythologies both ancient and modern is superficial at best and quite often inaccurate, particularly with respect to the Hebrew prophets and the modern day Pentecostals.  This would all be OK since \\""Snow Crash\\"" is, after all, \\""just a story.\\""  But if Stephenson didn't intend for us to take this material seriously, he would have done better to cut the pages of ponderous dialog we get from his characters on ancient Sumerian mythology down by a factor of about five. <br /> <br />Violence is fairly pervasive in \\""Snow Crash\\"" and not terribly well done.  You really don't want your high school kids reading this book.  Stephenson seems to be going here for a literary version of the kind of hip crimson artistry you can see in the early John Woo films.  But he generally produces instead a literary equivalent of a thirteen year old's M rated video game fantasy. <br /> <br />In summary, \\""Snow Crash\\"" has its moments.  There is no doubt that Stephenson can write.  But too much blood and too much superficial cereberalism really mar the development of a promising premise.",2004-10-22

My take on it is that Stephenson wanted  <br /> to take the feeling experienced by those in places like Asia and Africa as <br /> the modern world washes over them and totally disorients them, and translate  <br /> it to America. As such the book is not a prediction --- \\""In fifteen years  <br /> the federal government will be powerless and the mafia will be running pizza <br /> franchises\\"" --- it's an attempt to illustrate the chaos and arbitrariness  <br /> of life in Lagos or Kinshasa in terms that can be appreciated by the western <br /> reader; and as such it does that fairly well.  <br /> The second half of the book goes off the rails a little as the Sumerian  <br /> mind-control plot is developed, but again, being kind to Stephenson, I  <br /> don't think he in any sense buys this idea, he simply found it  <br /> interesting.  <br /> Ultimately I think the book is less than it could have been  <br /> because it tried to marry together two very different sub-books, and in  <br /> doing so demeaned both of them. Even so, it was worth the time and even the  <br /> more lame ideas in it, like that old cliche of virtual reality, were  <br /> treated in a way that wasn't completely stupid (which is far far more than <br /> I can say for _Neuromancer_.)",2004-10-18

(Luckily, the bulk of this was on a weekend... ;-) )<br /><br /> That was maybe 8-9 years ago, and I've since found myself vehemently recommending it to friends, buying copies for them<br /><br /> (when they aren't sure if they want to spend the $6-7 on it and<br /><br /> I'm sure that I'm not going to let them out of the store without it), and keeping 2-3 extra copies of it around the house so I can loan them out on short notice without having my autographed copy get beaten up. (Thrift stores are good for this. I found a $0.25 copy once which has been passed on a few times.)<br /><br /> \\""Aha!\\"", I imagine you thinking to yourself, \\""A nutcase! A freak!\\"" But no...it's not just me. I've checked. This book really *does* have a strange effect on many of the people who read it. (Not all, to be sure, but many.)<br /><br /> Personally, I like to think it's because \\""Snow Crash\\"" is sort of a self-referential, recursive story. Sure, it's got a Sci-Fi, futuristic plot, lots of action, and is also eerily prescient about lots of things we take for granted nowadays, such as the global Internet, 3D Avatars in virtual reality-like online chat rooms/meeting-spaces/games/etc. (I think Neal Stephenson actually coined this usage of \\""Avatar\\"" [in regard to 3D online personae] as it was previously only used in Hindu mythos & the like.)<br /><br /> He also pretty well spells out the current virus-ridden state of the online world that most Windows users are suffering through, and helps paint a picture of the security nightmare that we're currently living in, while at the same time subtly teaching some good principles of computing, security, etc. And the sprawl-like, fractured, strip-mall-society of \\""burb-claves\\"" and \\""franchise ghettos\\"" that he envisions isn't *quite* full-blown (yet), but you can definitely see it coming.<br /><br /> In the story, Snow Crash is a drug...and it's a computer virus...and it's a biological virus. It's all of these, and none of them. In the real world, it's a meme. An idea that behaves like a virus, jumping from one host to the next. That's for sure.<br /><br /> I think that's the thing that I like best about it: The disturbingly subversive fact that the story is about language, and the mind, and how language can program and RE-program the mind. As you're reading (or listening) and learning these concepts, while the story unfolds, you also realize that IT'S BEING DONE TO YOU...RIGHT THEN...<br /><br /> ...and you're having so much fun that you don't care. :-)<br /><br /> Those sections about ancient Sumerian religion, culture, and the history of language (the sections that some people bog down in and don't enjoy) seem (to me) to be the real meat of the matter. That's the main course of the meal. You're learning this long chain of history and philosophy, woven into a story about language and memetics being used to program people and change<br /><br /> how they think. (And after many times through it, I still don't know how much is made up and how much is really true history. It could all be fake, or it could be mostly true. I'm not sure, and that's what makes it fun...it's somewhat plausible.)<br /><br /> We recently listened (on CD) to \\""Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883\\"", by Simon Winchester, and he does a similar thing: It seemed like we went through about 3-4 CDs, learning about the history of the Spice Islands in Java/Indonesia, including its culture, biology, geography, geology, (and many other things!), then he taught us the history<br /><br /> of planetary geology, and gave us a detailed understanding of Plate Tectonic Theory (not just what it is, but how it came about.) Eventually, we finally had enough understanding so that he could talk about the volcanic eruption that was the focus of the story.<br /><br /> That long prep-time was thorough, detailed, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I already knew the volcano exploded. There was no need to rush into it. And since he took his time, I ended up learning a whole lot of other cool things. (I now am beginning to appreciate the benefits of a classical education such as he had at Oxford & Cambridge. It shows in his speech and his work. I'm envious. :-) )<br /><br /> Coming back to \\""Snow Crash\\"", it's a similar thing. Neal takes you on these seemingly long loops of discourse, meandering through history, religion, philosophy, language, computers, networking, etc., and spices it up with occasional bouts of gunfire and violence to keep it interesting. :-) At the end of it, though, you can gain a larger understanding of the picture he's trying to paint; the chessboard that all of his characters are running around on.<br /><br /> While reading the words, or hearing the sounds, there's this little voice in the back of your head saying \\""What if it's true? What if reading/hearing this weave of words can somehow infect me?...What if it can sink down into deep, subconscious levels of my mind, nestle in, and make itself comfortable?\\"" [You can't easily turn off your hearing, or your sight. And if those are vectors of infection (as they are in the story), then how do<br /><br /> you protect yourself? Thus, the story itself, and your reading/hearing of the story, share a blurred line that makes it deliciously creepy and fun.<br /><br /> \\""What if I get hooked?\\"" The voice may ask... \\""What if I start trying to get all my friends hooked?\\"" Perhaps even \\""What if I start posting reviews to Amazon.com in an effort to expose ever more people to Snow Crash?\\"" (A far stretch of the imagination, I'm sure, but it *might* be possible... ;-) )<br /><br/> Last year, I found a used copy of the unabridged audio version in a local bookstore. I snapped it up, and was the immediate envy of my other Snow Crash-reading friends. I have recently finished my 4th straight-through listening in the past 12-14 months, as well as the various chunks that I've replayed for friends while introducing them to it. (The chapter about YT's Mom working in FedLand is priceless!)<br /><br /> The audio book is excellent for driving, and the 18-hour duration makes it *great* for road trips. (My girlfriend and I both found ourselves alert and interested, even late into the night. We were so impressed with the way it entertained us while also keeping us alert that we bought several more audio books for a longer trip this summer which we just finished. Our findings: Audio books are a hell of a lot better than commercial radio. ;-) )<br /><br /> The audio version is also fun to just read along with. Since it's unabridged, you can follow the book text while getting the added dimension of all the character voices.<br /><br /> And on the topic of voices, I'd like to praise Jonathan Davis for his absolutely superb job with the narration! He does so many voices that he manages to bring 30-50+ different characters to life and have them talking back and forth to one-another. As one of my friends noted, with awe: \\""He even does *sarcasm* in 10 different voices!\\"" I enjoyed his narration so much, I've been looking at some of his other audio works, just to hear more of his talent.<br /><br /> I found the audio presentation to be very digestible...much more so than the book. (That's why I've listened to it 4 times...so far...) I've found that it also helps me to recall specifics of scenes, dialog, etc. I've found that friends who've listened to it are able to recall and discuss particulars of the story, while friends who've read (but not heard) it have the same sort of enthusiasm that I started this long-winded post with, but they don't remember many of thedetails or scenes when I mention them. (This adds to the semi-creepy \\""Have I just been programmed?\\"" aspect that I also mention above. ;-) )<br /><br /> This was my first exposure to audio-books, and I've become hooked. I now realize why the Oral Tradition was used so successfully for thousands of years in passing down folklore and stories and tribal wisdom. It works. It works really well. Audio input seems to stick in your head better than purely written words, and it seems to cross-link and anchor itself to the memories of whatever you where doing while hearing it. (I pass various locations while driving that now seem to key certain memories of bits from the story, as does hearing certain phrases, etc.)<br /><br /> Yep...It works its way in there, nestles in, and makes itself comfortable...<br /><br /> Fnord.<br /><br /> Enjoy!<br /><br /> Patrick Salsbury<br /><br />----<br /><br />Update: June 20, 2012: I'm up to about 9.5 listens, now (the .5 is from playing bits for friends) and it's STILL AWESOME!

The interesting play use of Sumerian myth and religion created another bit of potential that was never fully realized and ultimately convoluted.  The novel slides into a contrived mess by about page 150 and spirals down hill from that point on.  The plot line is ridden with holes, and many key issues are not resolved.

The pacing is fast and furious but at times explanations of the plot line drag on (if the scheme of your villain is so complicated you have to spend upwards of 50 pages just explaining it something is wrong), and random unnecessary scenes are tossed in for no real purpose.  The whole book comes off feel like a typical cheesy campy summer blockbuster.

The one thing that this book certainly didn't lack was imagination.  The world which he has created is strange, bleak, and sarcastic -- and it's somewhat interesting, though not on any &quot;deep&quot; level.  It is full of sometimes subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle critiques about the current (meaning 1992) world and the direction in which Stephenson thinks it's heading.  There are plenty of reviews here which describe many of the critiques (franchises taking over the world, the absurb beaurocracy of the US government, etc), so I won't delve into them here.<br />The book certainly had that cool techie factor that you'd expect from a cyberpunk novel.  A virtual reality &quot;Metaverse&quot;; goggles allowing nightvision, infrared, millimeter-wave radar, ambient-sound processing.  A fission-powered, gatling &quot;rail-gun&quot;.  There's no shortage of such examples, and they're certainly fun to read about; though they're typically not fully fleshed out or justified in the reader's mind.  The tech factor isn't as sophisticated as I'd like (coming from a Computer Science background).  There are a few utterly ridiculous examples of future technology (such as the Metaverse representation of Rife's information network as a bunch of big colorful blocks with connections between them), but all in all it's enough to keep the interest of the average techie if he's willing to set aside reality.<br />Bad Parts.  Put simply, this book just isn't well written.  I'm admittedly no English guru, and I typically criticise a book more on its content than its structure, probably because I'm not familiar enough with good structure.  But if someone like me can say that a book wasn't well written, that's probably bad.  It completely lacked any sense of flow.  It's almost as if he had this story in his head and just regurgitated it onto the page (like a movie script,as some reviewers have pointed out).  The whole religious subtext was well researched, but then very sloppily (though imaginatively) laid out.  I was particularly disappointed in the end when I expected many of these creative subelements of the story to come together and tie up, and they were just severed.<br />This shouldn't throw you off from reading Neal Stephenson.  I'm in the middle of reading his (much more recent) book &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, and it seems the complete opposite of &quot;Snow Crash&quot;.  It's much more mature, much better thought out, and with less flash.  Honestly that makes it a little boring.  I'd love him to find a happy center between these two extremes, but until then I recommend William Gibson.",2004-05-23

Stephenson clearly took pains to research his material. I know this, having read one of his sources about Sumerian civilisation. But all research is useless if you are going to use it for PSEUDOINTELLECTUALISM and alas, that is exactly what you get from this book.<br />Eventually, this religion/mythology thing gets so irritating that one is glad to return to the straightforward fights and flights.

In the process he digs into Sumerian history, tangles with the merciless Raven several times, and makes his way into the core of Rife's operation. At the same time, Y.T. does a lot of dirty Mafia work, gets kidnapped, and helps Hiro from oceanic lair.<br /><br />Seriously, Hiro is the king of Dorkus. Stephenson is not just otaku, he's a Nipponphile, and Hiro's his Marty Stu: A mostly socially-clueless coder who also considers himself a great swordfighter, carrying his katana and wakizashi everywhere, he spends almost all of his time in the Metaverse, socializing with most on the outside by killing them. Y.T. thinks of him as a total dweeb, but somehow his hacker ex-girlfriend still sees something in him. I think his geekiness amused me throughout the book more than anything else, along with Y.T.'s skater ethos; she almost never loses her cool. Ultimately, it's techno geek wish-fulfillment fantasy done right, and if that appeals to you, this book is for you.<br /><br />Neal Stephenson is the master of interposing hyperdescriptive passages and digressions throughout his novels, but the words flow so well that it doesn't grate too much. They mostly fall in one of three categories: Nifty, yes I know that, and Geez I don't care!, with an occasional no way pal. The book could never quite decide whether to be treatise or thriller, but by the end I did have a (very) specific idea of how he envisioned the future, and that contributed quite a bit to the story's flair.

I think a few plot threads got lost in all that.<br /><br />And, you know, this is cyberpunk. I could take major issue with quite a few of the silly or mistaken assumptions, like the total ignoring of sustainable economies, or the fact that revivalism started here in mid-1700's in a movement called the Great Awakening, but I don't take it all seriously.

It's mostly a showcase for images and ideas, tons of them, thrown at you a mile a minute.  The breaks in the narrative, and even the Sumerian mythology dissertations, didn't distract me. I even liked those parts, and felt they gave more substance to the book than it would have otherwise had.  Granted the &quot;language is a virus&quot; riff was copped straight from William S.

Unfortunately, I don't care for anime very much.  Most anime is thinly plotted and poorly characterized, and Stephenson's book suffers from the same problem.  To be honest with you, the character I sympathized the most with was the cyber-dog.<br />Stephenson created an interesting world that I liked spending time in, but he didn't seem to know quite what to do with it, and overall &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is overwhelmed by its author's florid imagination. Sadly, Stephenson followed this tendency in his subsequent writing instead of focusing on learning how to write plots and characters. His work since &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is imaginative, but didactic to the point of being incomprehensible, and plots and characters are low on his priority list.<br />&quot;Snow Crash&quot; is by far Stephenson's best work, and because of this it remains the only one that most science fiction readers know him for.

The Mafia control pizza delivery and Hiro Protagonist a samurai sword wielding deadbeat hacker is a Deliverator of pizzas. Hiro is drawn into a complex plot to enslave people's minds when a computer virus/drug called Snow Crash is released onto the Metaverse. Trying to stop Hiro in his quest to save the world is Raven an Aleutian psychopath with razor thin glass knives and a Nuclear Weapon strapped to his motorcycle. <br />This book is responsible for bringing into public consciousness many cyberspace concepts that are now becoming commonplace. The concept of the Metaverse and Avatars is now mainstream in MMORPGs such as Everquest and The Sims Online. Also the idea that the human brain is programmable and is capable of crashing has become accepted by neuroscientists and can be seen in the science of Neuro-Linguistic Programming. <br />Stephenson demonstrates an ability here to dump a lot of information into your brain without you noticing, and although there are a few missteps along the way generally his science is sound unlike many SF writers. <br />The one failing of the book is that the over-arching threat posed by L. Bob Rife and his plan to take over the world never seems threatening enough and dwindles in comparison to the actual physical threat of Raven. <br />The world conceived of in the book is both a brilliant backdrop to the plot and a credible possible future that we may be facing. When governments lose the power to collect taxes then they cease to be of any use and citizens will seek the services of protection and education from corporations. <br />If the first 25 pages don't get you hooked then put the book down, step away carefully and go numb your mind by watching television game shows.",2003-10-01

This really drags down large chunks of the book into a longwinded mess, with theories that aren't wrapped up by the end.

The freshness of the first two-thirds is lost, as if the book turns into a product to be marketed according to very stringent customer sartisfaction regulation based on past records, the story line more or less guided by the editors of the publishing house not ready to take  unnecessary risk. Overall, definitely a very good read.",2003-01-20

The story flow is excellent, there are very few dull parts, the character descriptions and settings are reasonable, and the character development flows to the point they seem truly human.  <BR>Neal Stephenson truly knows how to write a convincing story, and I must say the plot was well-wrapped and not too blatantly obvious.  Compared to other books I have read in the same genre, this is the most plausible plot and the best developed characters.  No post-nuclear holocaust here, just an extremely advanced form of Republicanism.  The characters are described and seen through enough to provide an edge of personality to temper the realism.  There are no super-people here, no cyborgs, and no in-depth description of cyberspace (which is very much like what we have now-not the lethal playground of the advanced hackers depicted in so many other books). <BR>There are a few downsides to this book, however.  There is a very heavy correlation to ancient history dealing with religion that, for those many of us who are historically deficient mentally, is a bit overwhelming.  Also, this isn't exactly a kiddie book, with many **ahem** colorfully described scenes and scenarios, as well as prolific profanity.  For those of us used to modern society, though, this just adds to the flow and believability of the book.<BR>All in all a good read, and on a 5 star system it would get a solid 4 from me.  As an explanation for the lacking of the 5th star, I am not truly fond of the cyberpunk genre, being from the digital age.

When I got home I picked it up and read it.<br /><br />I teach SF, but hadn't read any cyberpunk before.  Wow.  It was hard putting it down to go to sleep at night.  A seriously cool book.<br /><br />What made Snow Crash if not revolutionary, then certainly evolutionary SF in 1992, was Stephenson's use of cyberspace as fictional space.  It's the virtual Librarian, coupled with Hiro's inquisitiveness - i.e., his theorizing about the meaning of certain Sumerian/Biblical myths and the origin of language, and how language itself may contain mental/behavioral \\""viruses\\"" and how that relates to the idea of a virus in relation to the vast internetwork that will be cyberspace -  that really make Snow Crash such a brilliant tour-de-force of an SF novel.<br /><br />Snow Crash is about a seemingly revolutionary Idea (and SF is, at its best, about an Idea) - the possibility that our cerebral faculty, or minds and hence our behavior, can be compromised (i.e., reprogrammed) by a destructive virus contained in language itself.

Indeed, how can a book whose main character is named &quot;Hiro Protagonist&quot; _not_ fail to utterly amuse?<br />In many ways, Snow Crash is a biting, satirical take on society.  The typical cyberpunk libertarian streak has grabbed Stephenson: the Federal government is reduced to a hyper-paranoid enclave called &quot;Fedworld&quot;; giant corporations battle each other over efficiency and speed in pizza-delivery services; competing superhighways are built to cater to the discriminating driver; and gated neighborhoods with private police abound.  Frightening for some, inspiring for others -- Stephenson sees the future, and it ain't pretty.<br />The denoument of the book is too incredible for description; and, besides, doing so would be a definite spoiler.<br />If you cut your teeth on William Gibson and grew up with Bruce Sterling, you should by all means turn to Neil Stephenson.

In a not-too-distant future, Snow Crash is a mysterious newly-emerging virus (does it affect people or their computers?  What's the difference?)

Bizarre characters inhabiting bizarre cultures in two very bizarre worlds (real and virtual) lead readers through an unforgettable adventure, filled with action, fun, and sardonic silliness.  The modest levels of sex and violence are handled with such breezy unreality that there's no shock value to upset more fastidious readers, although younger teens may find this book too long for their liking.  Some sections seem to move pretty slowly (Hiro's researches, for example), but there's so much to love about Shepherdson's 21st Century America that most readers will surely want to wade through this tome's 500-plus pages more than once.",2002-06-20

In the first 50 pages, Stephenson demonstrates his talent at creating settings that absorb you, creating a cyberpunk near future that is anarchic, chaotic, and downright fun.  It deliberately carries the hip, ubercool attitude of the genre to elaborate excess without being self-conscious about it, and at the same time avoids the nihilistic depression that dogs many similar works.<br />It succeeds because Stephenson isn't even trying to prophesy.  This book isn't about the 2010's, but instead is a nostalgia book about the 1980's.  It takes everything mildly disconcerting about American culture in the Me decade, magnifies it to the nth degree, turns it into a virtue, and shoots it in an artillery shell three decades into the future.<br />It's about strip malls and minivans, Ted Turner and the Godfather, Domino's Pizza, suburbia, and televangelists.  Of the protagonists, Hiro Protagonist is a former computer hacker turned high-speed pizza delivery man for the Mafia, while YT is a teenage skateboard courier armed with a crossbow-mounted plunger and the last word in anti-rape defense.

The idea of a Mafia pizza delivery service, and a church franchise (Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates) makes a very interesting setting for a book.<br />At the same time, I really enjoyed the author's hip writing style.  For example, the beginning of one chapters goes like this: \\""Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest .. in the world\\"".

Some of the things he told me about were so outrageous.

This book is full of action and images of an unholy world filled with mafia owned pizza companies, rent-a-storage hotel rooms, and Samurai super Hackers who seem to control the world. This might not seem like the perfect world, so many escape into what is called &quot;The Metaverse&quot;; which is basically a 3D representation of the internet, where users use &quot;Avatars&quot; (characters) to roam the metaverse boardwalk. While in the real world however, everything seems to be controlled by either the mafia, the government, sub-governments, and hackers. This may not seem like a good balance of control to the real world, but in many ways, things seem to run very smoothly. The suburbs are a very calm place in this world, however, the big city is a very hard to place to make it, so many are forced to succumb to poverty. Once you enter the city, your liable for anything, including riots, Taxi driver shootings, robotic cheetah attacks, and rampaged super-humans with chips in their heads connected to Atom bombs.

It's a different experience when you start out.  You're not sure whether you're missing some background information or a special dictionary to go through the book.  It starts off at a fast pace and uses words like Burbclaves, Franchulates, Kouriers, pooning, loglo, etc.  Our protagonist is called Hiro Protagonist, a pizza deliverer for the Mafia-controlled pizza chain Cosa Nostra, who also happens to be a hacker supreme in the Metaverse and greatest sword fighter in the world.<br />Did you do a double take on what I just said?

(Everyone's vision of the future is different.)<br />This novel will be very different from the others you've read.  It is erratically paced.  The action scenes from riding a skateboard to sword fighting are exciting and fast.  The scenes in Hiro's office figuring out the mystery of Snow Crash with the Librarian is slow and sometime downright boring, preachy and dull.  The plot is really simple.  Once the dynamic duo of Y.T. and Hiro determine what Snow Crash is, the rest of the plot is predictable.<br />The seemingly self-contradicting characters in this novel alone make it worth reading.  Y.T. has real spunk.  Her attitude is that of a typical carefree 15 year old rebel.  She delivers packages on her hi-tech skateboard while keeping it a secret from her mom (a government programmer).  Her dialogue is true to her character.  Hiro is at times a curt, savage and indifferent person, yet at other times a loquacious, compassionate and loyal friend.  His dialogue and actions display both extremes.  Raven is described as Asian, but in reality he's a giant thug.

I read it in one sitting (a very long flight), and found that I was never bored.  Still, one gets the impression that, especially at certain points later on in the book, Stephenson was virtually racing through prose in an effort to make plot elements come together, a task which he really did not accomplish.  Stylistically he often makes up for the plot defects (which with a modicum of suspension of disbelief are really not that bad anyhow), but at points the writing becomes quite uneven and the level of detail and discussion very thin.  This perhaps points to the author having bitten off more, plotwise, than he could chew.  <br />Still, I'd certainly recommend this as airplane reading.

About the only common ground that his work shares with others is that ink is applied to paper using the same letters, and then pages are bound to create a book. Much beyond that and you are in the midst of this Author's view of a given world he has modified and created. He is not only incredibly unique; his wit passes the cutting edge to the bleeding edge of razor sharp sarcasm, and irony. And when he uses words he assembles them in arrangements you have never listened to before. An important aspect that sets his work apart in this genre is that while delivering enormous amounts of information, he keeps the reader informed, he does not lose you, he ensures you stay with his wickedly fast pace by keeping you educated. Other Authors of Science Fiction are weak on this point, and it weakens their books.<br />One date to remember when reading this work is that it was first released in June of 1992 after three years in the making. This is critical, as so much of what was absolute fiction then, may now be found within the pages of Wired Magazine. There are even words he originated that are common to most people who use a computer, especially if you have ever tried what he calls the Metaverse, touring it as an Avatar.<br />One of the reasons his work is so authentic and exceptionally good is that he knows his material. If he talks about code he's qualified, as he has written it. When he is speaking of Sumerian Mythology an Author who spent years researching his material is again relating it. And when he just lets go with dialogue or descriptive prose it is mind binding for being clever, unique, and hilarious. He also has raised sardonic prose to an art form. If he were any less a craftsman, a main character named Hiro Protagonist that at one point delivers pizza for Uncle Enzo's Cosa Nostra Pizzeria, would be moronic.<br />Technology, a version of what today's society might look like one day, viruses that share traits whether attacking a human or a silicon life form, the origins of language based on Biblical text, it just never stops.

The point being that Asherah worship is a virus that is not good for people, like a disease, but that the Hebrew religion (as codified by the Deuteronomists), being the first rational religion, brings immunity from the pre-rational religions (and the pre-rational religions work by actually re-wiring people's brains). Cool concept, isn't it? This all comes about because in the book is a bad guy who created a weird Christian religion mixing Jesus and Elvis, but which, apparently, actually is a virus that spreads easily from one person to another, and which includes the speaking of tongues, but quite possibly the tongue they are speaking is Sumerian, leading back to the Asherah worship thing, and our protagonist must work to stop the virus from spreading.

Intriguing concept - but its explanation, rooted in Sumerian myth, comes off as if the author knows way too much about the subject and couldn't make it accessible to his audience (but read the novel's acknowledgments to find out the truth).  For the most part, explanations involving the application of Sumerian myth to the novel's conflict take part in long, involved passages, which equate to Hiro Protagonist having long, involved conversations with a computer program.  This literary set-up smacks of Stephenson researching Sumerian mythology, and rehashing conversations that he might have had with experts on the subject.  It is rather clumsy:  The reader will cruise along Stephenson's action-packed, cyberpunky adventure, then suddenly hit a chapter that explains why it is all happening.  Kind of like the bad guy telling you his plan before he executes you:  It's not subtle.  An essay on the possibility of verbal viruses - condensed from explanations in the novel - would be an enjoyable read.<br />On the other hand, Stephenson is at his best when he dabbles in cyberpunk pursuits rather than scholarly ones.  The idea of 'franchulates', corporate ownership, and religious fanaticism tying together in the near-future is a common one (suggest reading Palahniuk's &quot;Survivor&quot;) but pizza delivery and courier service are envisioned especially well [Stephenson takes skateboarding to an entirely new level].  Snow Crash is full of puns, and bits of irony and wit, which shouldn't be overlooked.<br />Although Hiro renders avatars with the greatest of ease in the Metaverse, Stephenson's main characters are a bit flimsy - on the whole, they give off the impression there was a labored attempt to make them three-dimensional.  Or: Characters may be introduced once, serve a purpose, then simply fade away or are very conveniently disposed of.  The characters are loosely tied together - or just ridiculously(read: the protagonist and his nemesis share a rather unlikely connection).  Characters - especially secondary characters, which there are (in my opinion) far too many of them - also tend to come off as stereotypes: hero, nemesis, love interest, boss, fiesty girl, brooding sniper.<br />The novel's structure is a bit disjointed and unbalanced.  There are many loose ends.  The first few chapters are unique; the ending is contrived.<br />(Alternative title that involves harpooning - since Snow Crash seeks to tackle many varied subjects, including references to Moby Dick: Ahab's Wife.)",2001-06-26

He lives in a storage unit with a cult-hero rockstar named Vitaly Chernobyl.  He owns a futon, two awesome Japanese swords, and a laptop computer, where he stays &quot;jacked in&quot; to the &quot;Metaverse&quot; a lot of the time, where he is the world's greatest swordfighter.  <br />Hiro witnesses a crime while interacting with others in the Metaverse.  One of his friends is deliberately exposed to a dangerous block of text, which fries his brain (in the real world), and renders him a vegetable.  Hiro and his friend Y.T. (15-year old skateboarding female, and knee-slappingly funny smartaleck) set off to find out why, and save the world in the process.<br />From the getgo this is a funny book.  Sure, the vision of the near-future is dark, a little alarming, and at times depressing (there are NO general laws in _Snow Crash_, for example, and private corporations run everything, even the police, just as an example).  That's what cyberpunk is like.  But the HUMOR is one thing that sets Neal Stephenson aside.  Hiro Protagonist?  Come on, that's FUNNY, PEOPLE!  One reviewer called it an 'odd' name.  Yes, it's odd, and it's absurd, and it's funny!  Did this author mean it is an unusual choice for a character name?  I don't know.  I hope not.  It would be an odd choice for a  character's name in a Jane Austen novel, sure.  But this is cyberpunk, or something like it.   Among this genre's leading inspirations are the works of Thomas Pynchon, and &quot;Hiro Protagonist,&quot; asa character name, would fit in perfectly among his merry bands of misfits, especially in _V._ or _Gravity's Rainbow_.<br />Repeatedly reviewers are slamming Stephenson for his use of Sumerian myth, exploration of Sumerian culture, etc. in the book... calling it inaccurate, poorly connected to the rest of the story, and, (my personal least favorite), BORING.  I tell you, besides the great sense of humor, the Sumerian-myth link is what sets this novel heads above so much other cyberpunk.  I don't care if it's inaccurate (this is FICTION, see?).  Stephenson &quot;traces&quot; computer/textual viruses and biological viruses quite nicely back to Sumerian times, and he links them to one another, biological virus to digital/informational virus (a debt to another pre-cyberpunk luminary, William Burroughs, who said &quot;Word is Virus?&quot;)-- it's all very well connected to the metaverse/here-and-now portion of _Snow Crash_'s plot.<br />This is a funny, riproaring tale.  I raced through this nearly 500-page paperback in half the time I read most books of this length.  I enjoyed it beginning-to-end.  My only complaint with the book was that, at times, it too much resembled a Hollywood action movie, what with all sorts of incredible stunts being performed, by boat drivers, skateboarders, swordsmen, etc.  <br />I say, if you like William Gibson or Thomas Pynchon, or if any of this review makes _Snow Crash_ seem a bit appealing to you, give it a chance.  I enjoyed it 10 times as much as I thought I would.<br />ken32",2001-04-30

They are happily not limited to live only in reality, but can also exist in virtuality, where one can have a totale different and sometimes more significant role than in normal life.<br />The plot revolves around a drug called Snow Crash which is available both in Virtual and Real reality. After one of his friends becomes infected by this 'drug', Hero and skate-boarding Y.T. must investigate who is behind the snow scheme and stop the onrushing Infopocalypse. Along the way they meet an assortment of characters: a psychotic Aleut who uses razor-sharp knives to fight with, a wonderful funny cybernetic dog that can run at Mach2 (and is worth reading the book for alone. Enjoy the wonderful dog - gooooood dog! Sit!!!!), a Mafia Pizza Mogul with a heart (but for whom and what ?). The settings range from the city-states of ancient Sumer to Virtual Reality libraries to a huge surplus aircraft carrier/floating city in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. <br />Why then does so many readers trash this story; Some do not believe in its bleak future (its science fiction!), some dont like that its the bleak future of USA (its science fiction!!), some dont like name of the main character ( its sc....well you know what I am going to say - ), some thought they were going to read an updated copycat Neuromancer story (ask for the money back if you dare), some just didnt like the story (but still got agitated enough so that they sat down and wrote a review), some didnt like the end (almost nothing is perfect in this world) - anyway I gave it a four and not a five!<br />If you think some of the list just above could agitate you, please stay away from this book.

I won't speculate on the reason or reasons why (although I have my suspicions), but I promise to be a good little Phrodoe this time out. Onward:<br />  Snow Crash is an astonishing, clever, funny, suspenseful work of the imagination. I've read a couple of Neal Stephenson's books (Cryptonomicon and The Diamoind Age, both of which I highly reccommend), and I still think this is his best novel. In Snow Crash, a part-time hacker, information-scrounge, and delivery boy for Uncle Enzo's Cosa Nostra Pizzerias, and full-time Metaverse (virtual reality) samurai named Hiro Protagonist (one of the best names since Billy Pilgrim!), is slowly drawn into a mystery involving a virus program called Snow Crash, which is claiming not only the computers but the minds on hackers the world over, including Hiro's best friend. Who is behind all this, and what it has to do with Sumerian mythology and the hard-wiring of the human language centers is what Hiro must find out, while at the same time he attempts to prevent the further spread of the Snow Crash virus. Along the way he falls in with a skateboard punk named Y.T., who is more instrumental to the story than might first be suggested, and who is the novel's most intriguing character, if only because her investigations are almost more revealing than Hiro's are -- in fact, Hiro comes off as a bit of a cypher compared to her. But I digress. All of these events take place in Stephenson's richly- imagined near-future, where the American government has become a tight-sphinctered, half-failed corporation, while corporations have become governments, and a multimedia mogul has cobbled together a vast fleet of refugee boats from various countries, in the most questionable act of philanthropy since Ted Turner tried to buy the UN. There are also gated communities that are not just gated but practically self-contained universes. And then there is the Metaverse...Stephenson's delightful extrapolation of the Internet, where you can be anyone you want to be, whether that person is yourself or someone else, within reasonable limits of course. The Metaverse is also as overloaded with advertising as the 'net is, and it was Stephenson's clever description of M.V. ads that really hooked me on this book for good (not that I needed much more persuasion at that point). The Metaverse, and the weird, wired world which surrounds it, are both so enthrallingly, memorably...I was going to say realistically, but perhaps a better term would be surrealistically, rendered, that reading about it is one of the novel's high points. Every moment of Snow Crash, practically, is full of mystery, intrigue, brightly-drawn (for the most part) characters, and humor. Oh, didn't I mention that Stephenson is a bloody riot to read? The man is a futurist-humorist-satirist of the first caliber...I would say worthy of Vonnegut, but that's pretty lofty company, and probably not entirely accurate. yet Stephenson comes darned close, and he, along with Kurt Vonnegut, Mark Twain, and Douglas Adams, is one of the few authors who can make me laugh right out loud, so mordantly witty is his stuff. But Stephenson is also more than a wit, as the clever premise behind Snow Crash suggests. His concept, that human consciousness and language concepts are as programmable as any computer, is as intelligently-reasoned as any science-fiction concept I've ever come across, and one which would later be revisited, reexplored, and expanded upon by Greg Bear in Darwin's Radio (see my review, he said in a shameless plug), although Bear added some wrinkles even Stephenson didn't think of. And in linking his concept back to both the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel, and to the Babylonian creation myth Enuma Elish, Stephenson creates a tapestry of invention that few writers in my experience have been able to equal, all told elegantly in Stephenson's supple, muscular prose. And if none of what I've written here convinces you to pick up Snow Crash, maybe this will: There is a tendency in science-fiction for writers to create improbable post-apocalypse dystopias (i.e., The Matrix, Mad Max, or any one of a hundred bad stories written by good writers -- even the great Harlan Ellison has written his share), and in my opinion such stories are not only ill-conceived but also a cheat. It's easy to imagine a post-apocalyptic world (where there seems to be all the gasoline, computer time, and electric energy available, no matter how wretched the rest of the world has become) -- in fact, it's too easy, which is part of the problem. Show me instead a far more difficult feat...instead of a blue-sky approximation of the post-apocalypse, show me how the world is GOING to end. That is what Vonnegut has done time and again (cf. &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot; and the novel Slaughterhouse Five), and that is pretty much what Stephenson is doing with Snow Crash. He isn't worried about the post-apocalypse...but rather, about the aptly-named Infocalypse which may be happening all around us even now, right under our noses. And that, above all else, is why I love Snow Crash so much. It is rare, unique, and a thrill to read, and I would reccommend it without reservation to anybody.",2001-01-27

This book might be the easiest introduction to Stephenson's work as it is less complicated than either Cryptonomicon or Diamond Age and a quicker read than Zodiac.

Suffice to say, this is a  brilliant cyberpunk novel.  Descended from William Gibson's genre-making  &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is an entertaining,  wild-eyed look at the near future, but is not as bleak, either in writing  style or imagination.  The three strongest points to make about the book  are its plot, characters, and pure imagination.  The first half of the book  is an introduction of the characters and the discovery of a technological  and biological virus named Snow Crash, which a person can get through  blood, exposure, or by looking at diseased data in the Metaverse, a kind of  populated, mall-like cyberspace.  The last half is a mad, action-filled  rush to the conclusion.  It has enough action to keep a thriller fan happy  but requires plenty of brains to follow the origination of Snow Crash,  which moves from Sumerian myth to populist religion in modern times.  The  idea is completely hair-brained, but somehow Stephenson makes you want to  believe in the possibility of what he writes, which belies his talent.   Secondly, his bizarre assortment of characters like the attitudinal skater  Y.T., the cool but psychotic Raven, and the familial mobster Uncle Enzo  populate a world strange enough to belong to the Twilight Zone, but  frighteningly familiar.  There's not much substance behind the characters,  including the aptly-named Hiro Protagonist, but they make up for it with  style.  Stephenson's imagination links his plot into the environment of an  imploded USA, most of which is pure fiction that couldn't happen in the  next twenty years, if not longer.  Still, what they lack in reality is made  up for in hilarity.  His look at the possibility of Mafia-run pizza  delivery and what's left of the government are hilarious!  Add that to an  image of cyberspace VR intertwined with the mall-going culture, and you  have a wild ride through a nearly-insane world.  All in all, this is a  fabulous book, and even if the characters and plot aren't so deep, the  sheer power of Stephenson's imagination and humor shoots it into the  atmosphere.",2000-08-25

Focusing on the idea of knowledge and the dissemination of knowledge through computer  technology, the basic premise of Snow Crash is that of the protagonist  (named Hiro Protagonist, no less) and his young partner, Y.T. (Yours Truly,  which she wouldn't bother to tell you unless it was in the form of a  sarcastic remark), thwarting an intended infocalypse with a little help  from the Mafia and some other unusual allies.  Along the way, the reader is  given a good look at a future that may not be so far away: one dominated by  computer technology and paralleled by a virtual reality that might question  exactly what constitutes reality, and private franchises which rule in the  place of governments.   Stephenson has a flair for vivid description of a  world just strange enough to be innovative and intriguing, yet familiar  enough that we can see its basis very firmly rooted in our own.  Despite  the outlandish nature of both Snow Crash's characters and setting, basic  principles are the same: there is the rich and the poor, the powerful and  the weak, those who survive and those who do not; the difference between  the two is that of information.<br />However, despite all these assets, Snow  Crash is little more than light entertainment.  The lofty ideas which  Stephenson explores in his book seem to be beyond his firm comprehension,  and discussions of Babel, Sumerian myth and other archaeological finds are  dry and arcane, detracting from an otherwise vibrant and fast-paced plot.   Almost all relevant information about the technical aspects of Snow Crash  is revealed in the form of cryptic dialogue between Hiro and a  computer-generated librarian, discussions that sound more like encyclopedia  recitations than believable (or understandable) dialogue.  I found myself  glossing over these portions of the book without any real effect onmy  understanding of the plot; in the end it still comes out to the same thing:  the bad guys have a dangerous weapon, and the good guys have to stop them.   The details about Sumer and the fall of man are interesting, but not  portrayed in a form that lends itself to any quick grasp of ideas that can  be retained after the book is done.  However, for those willing to take the  time to read and reread a fourth time, Stephenson poses some interesting  ideas to ponder.<br />The characters in Snow Crash never leave the reader a  moment to rest from the excitement they provide.  Outrageous events happen  one after another, and the calm manner in which they face everything from  kidnapping and murder to the possibility of destruction of society and the  world as they know it provides a great deal of amusement and curiosity  about what they might do next.  However, despite a plot that hurtles itself  ever forward and drags the reader along, forced to either keep up or drop  along the way, I found the ending both disappointing and deflating.  Hiro  and Y.T. save the world, of course, but then Hiro just drops out of the  story altogether and Y.T. appears to transform from a rebellious and wild  Kourier into mommy's little girl for little other reason than to provide  some kind of ending.  I would have liked at least for some kind of  epilogue, if not a totally different ending altogether.  In reading the  last few pages, it seemed that Stephenson rushes to tie up all the loose  ends of the story in any way possible - any way possible often equating to  dull, bland, and unsuitable when compared to other parts of the book.   After such a well-written novel containing such interesting characters and  a world whose details must be read to be believed, I was hugely  disappointed by the conclusion to say the least.

It is sweet and hopeful and has a noble sense of Honor  as &quot;pilotfish&quot; through the ugly morass of the  ALL-CAPITALISM--ALL-THE-TIME future that we are always on the very brink of  creating.<br />Thanks, Neal.

However, my cynicism leads me to be skeptical of  a lowly pizza delivery boy, albeit a Samaurai master swordsman, saving the  virtual future with the aid of his hacker girlfriend.  The aggressive  undertones of violence denoted by an occasional sword fight or two convey  Stephenson's distaste for the world's shortcomings causing him to create a  virtual realm which has been set up to compensate for these inequities.

Basicaly the book is very futuristic or at least a vision of the future.   The main character of the story is Hiro  Protagonist, who delivers pizzas for Uncle Enzo's Cosa Nostra and is a  computer hacker in his spare time.  He's basically your looser pizza boy  who spends time hacking and skateboarding.   The story is set in LA and the  Unisted States is run by the mafia and pwople are being affected by some  new drug called snow crash, where the story gets it's name.  Basically snow  drug is a computer virus, but not only does it wreck hackers' minds, but  they basically can't do hacking because they don't think straight and they  talk in gibberish.  Anyway Hiro's best friend and mentor comes down with  the virus and Hiro's off to save and protect the world from the mafia.   I  simply don't like this kind of writing and story.  The writing to me seems  to be very unfocused and therefore isn't very good.  Stephenson does write  some incredible stuff in this book, but it's not consistent.  It's almost  like he put a lot of time and effort into writing certain aspects of the  story, but not everything.  The beginning I thought was strong and I  enjoyed it, but after a 100 pages I was gone and I really didn't enjoy very  much after that point.   The story may have been fresh in '92, but I've  seen too many things that are similar for my taste.  It really reminded me  of japanamation.  Usually when I read a book I have an image of the  characters, bt the characters weren't real to me.  I sat there reading the  book and I saw a bunch of cartoons running around.  It was just annoying  because I knew the characters weren't real.  I basically thought the story  was a long script for a japanamation movie.     On the positive side, there  are a lot of people out there that like this kind of stuff, and althoughI  don't  and don't know about it I think people that are into science fiction  and japanimation would really enjoy this story.  I haven't seen a whole,  but have seen enough to know what it's about and I think this has the same  kind of jist.   In closing I'm sure most people that have read this book  enjoyed it because fans of this genre of books like stuff like this, it  seems to have a lot of common elements of stories that are similar, if fact  the date of the book indicates to me that it may have somewhat have been  innovative.  Someone like me who just doesn't enjoy works like this and it  doesn't do anything for us should stay away.

Hiro  Protagonist and his teenage Kourier partner, Y.T., join the ever-powerful  Mafia in attempting to save the world from a devastating virus that  destroys the hard drive of computers as well as humans. Once this virus  strikes, the victims are left to function with nothing more than snowy  transmissions with no possibility of recovery.   Although images like  teenagers riding bionic skateboards attaching themselves to the back of  unsuspecting motorists have been seen before, Stephenson takes his  description of this society to a higher level.  When describing something  as simple as Y.T.'s plank (skateboard), he provides micro detail all the  way down to its &quot;RadiKS Mark II Smartwheels with sonar, laser  rangefinding, and millimeter-wave radar to identify mufflers and other  debris before you even get honed about them.&quot;   Stephenson  successfully uses satire throughout the novel to make implications about  the poor values of our society.  The use of satire is obvious in his  continued return to the issue of the obliviousness of Y.T's mom.  She  doesn't have a clue about her daughter's Mafia connected, professional  Kourier livelihood filled with drug dealers, murders, and cults.   Stephenson stresses the over-dedication of Y.T.'s mom to her profession  rather than to her child.  The final pages of the story provide an  effective summary of the neglect present in one-parent homes, portrayed in  numerous portions of the book.  The most intriguing aspect of the story  comes when Stephenson connects drugs, viruses, and religion to be one in  the same.  Hiro says to Juanita, &quot;This Snow Crash thing-is it a virus,  a drug, or a religion? Juanita shrugs.  &quot;What's the difference?&quot;   Using such seemingly opposing topics throughout the plotmakes it nothing  less than captivating.   Stephenson did a remarkable job depicting a  futuristic world filled with dehumanized individuals.  Any society that  would sooner &quot;goggle in&quot; to a virtual world than interact with  other human beings has lost touch with natural tendencies.  This attitude  is further exemplified by his direct correlation between the hard drive of  a computer and the human brain.  If nothing sets mankind apart from these  machines, then what qualities do we, as humans, have to offer society?    Aside from occasional deviations in sequential order and a lack of clarity  at the conclusion of the novel, Stephenson supplies his readers with plenty  of sex, technology, drugs, and religion that no American could ever resist.

Internet and society, a very interesting  topic, if you're in a group and discussing amongst each other, though by  yourself, it is a real sleeper.  When I came across the book Snow Crash, by  Neil Stephenson, I thought I would give it a whirl.  It is a science  fiction book, so it would have to be more interesting and entertaining than  reading about Dell Computers marketing strategy.  I start out reading  the book and I see the main character, Hiro Protagonist, delivering pizzas.   My first impression was, what the hell does this have to do with  computers.  I thought that I had definitely made a mistake choosing the  longer book because it sounded interesting. As I read a few more pages  Stephenson adds a little more to the book.  For example: skateboard  couriers who harpoon cars, mafias who intern own the rivaling pizza joints,  and a virtual world known as the metaverse.  This metaverse was quite  intriguing in that you could walk, talk, and act like you would in the  normal world.  Though, it is paralleled to computers now days.  Each person  plugs into a port and uses an avatar, their virtual self, to communicate.   Depending on your computer and your ability, you can have a real elaborate  avatar or a simple avatar, denoting your poor skills and computer.  A  skilled swordsman Hiro is, in both the metaverse and the real world, we  learn that he is also a freelance &quot;hacker.&quot;  A new virus has  stepped on the seen in the metaverse, the only problem is that it also is a  drug in the real world and effects people in the real world.   It is a race  against time for Hiro and his friends to find the distributor and end this  virus known as snow crash.  To complicate things worse, Stephenson gives  the distributor of snow crash, whose name is Raven, a nuclear warhead that  will detonateif he is killed.  As I read the story, Stephenson really  made a good parallel to the way we actually use the Internet.  Many people  in Stephensons' book plugged into the metaverse for hours on end becoming  dehumanized just as people in our world get on the Internet and chat lines  and become dehumanized.  Stephenson does a good job in telling a real story  of our world and it's Internet addiction through a very stimulating science  fiction story.",2000-04-04

The characters could have been developed in  more detail, though they reveal themselves through their actions rather  completely.

It sees a world in which the US has collapsed under its own weight,  in which the Mafia controls pizza delivery, and the FBI has its own  city-state.  Electronic guard dogs patrol the Asian community and skating  is now even more firmly rooted as its own sub-culture.<br />   The main  character, the not-so-subtly named Hiro Protagonist, is a sword-wielding  freelance programmer who stumbles upon a shadowy conspiracy by powers  unknown that threatens hackers worldwide with a virus that seems to leave  them in a vegetative state.  He takes on the challenge of finding out who  is behind it and how to stop them mostly through a series of accidents.  He  is joined by a plucky young skater who has drawn attention from the local  Mafia king.  Lurking in the shadows is a dangerous Eskimo who goes by the  name of Raven and rides a motorcycle powered with a nuclear bomb in its  frame.<br />   Like I said, Stephenson has an active imagination.  His  characters are colorful but not really that broadly drawn.  We get a sense  of what they are like from what they do, but we only get snippets of  background information about them.  It was hard to really root for the  characters because I did not feel I really knew or identified with them.   Still, I really enjoyed his descriptions of the strange places they travel  to, including the Mafia and FBI states, and an aircraft character that  houses its own nation of people from every culture.<br />   As far as the  conspiracy goes, it was unclear to me what the motivations of the people  behind it weresupposed to be.  The technical aspects were also pretty hard  to follow; it gets heavy in the nature of languages and programming.  Even  as someone who has dabbled in programming languages I had trouble  understanding it.  Other than Raven, who as a villain is fleshed out pretty  well and is the most interesting character, I got the sense that the threat  was really a clothesline on which to hang Stephenson's world vision and  weird characters.  I felt unsatisfied when the conclusion rolled around,  since it is so abrupt and had little to do with the nature of the people  involved.<br />   Still, I had fun reading this book.  It has a wild and  strange vision of the future that may prove eirily accurate if things  continue to move in the direction they are in.

When I found the book in a local bookstore, I couldn't resist buying it.<br />And it was worth every penny.<br />It is one of the few books I can read over and over and, even though I know the ending, it is still suspensful.  Even after the third and forth time of reading it, I still couldn't put it down.  What I appreciated most about the book is, unlike the other cyberpunk guru's, Stephenson writes as if he himself is a product of the society he's portraying.  The metaphors used in the book are hilariously sarcastic, a tone you would probably find in his near-future America.  And the plotline is one of the most original I've ever seen.  Who would have though to interpret ancient Sumerians as biological robots!   Not only the plot but the background itself of future America makes you think about today's society, which is the entire purpose of Sci-Fi.  The Metaverse, a cross between the internet and virtual reality, which may be the future of computer tech and the world wide web (by the way, the book was written before the average american knew of the internet), the possibilities of the biological effect from computers, and an interesting look of our future from common trends.  <br />I would suggest any and all people interested  in Sci-Fi to read this book.  You won't regret it.",2000-01-06

Yes, I'm glad you know more about that than I do, now  shut up already, Neal. The whole religion thing with the boats, however,  always struck me as somewhat interesting.

I do consider it essential reading for anyone interested in Sci-fi or Cyberpunk, but that doesn't undo the fact that there are some utterly absurd elements  that undercut the aesthetic value of the book.<br />First, the good.  I have  never read some a convincing picture of the future as world-gone-bad.  Though Stephenson doesn't spend any time really explaining how society got  the way it has, the way it has become is quite powerfully presented.  His  understanding of the way in which the Internet might develop reflects a  sense of vision and insight that would have done Jules Verne proud.  On so  many things--future weapons, potential subcultural groups, lingo and slang,  technology--Stephenson hits precisely the right note.  On top of all this,  he has a wonderful assemblage of characters.  For all of this, Stephenson  unquestionably deserves 5 stars.<br />But SNOW CRASH also is one more example  of how things go wrong in sci-fi when there is any attempt to deal with  religion.  There have been, of course, many fine sci-fi novels in which  religion has served as an element.  The great classic A CANTICLE FOR  LEIBOWITZ springs to mind.  But when sci-fi attempts explain religious  phenomena or to bring it within the contenxt of imaginative analysis, it  invariably fails.  The extended and tedious discussions of Sumerian culture  and the highly speculative discussions of the history of religions were not  merely unconvincing and poorly founded on any of the historical record.  They were boring.  For this, SNOW CRASH deserves 1 star.<br />So, I recommend  this book very highly.

However, be aware that the first chapter is much more  humourous than the rest of the book.  My only real quibble with this book  is that the primary female character, Y.T., who is allegedly a 15-year old,  acts *nothing* like any real girl of that age would.  I don't have a  problem with her athleticism as a skateboard courier, after all, most  Olympic gymnasts are teenagers.  But, her sexual self-possession cannot be  explained away by the ownership of a device that makes rape impossible.   There is something about the way she acts generally that interfered with my  ability to suspend my disbelief when reading the book.  And I'm not the  kind of person to complain about characterization.  <br />My guess is that  Stephenson was trying to write the female equivalent of the typical  resourceful teenage male character that you find in these types of books,  but just plain didn't know enough teenage girls to know what they are like.   (Note, his later book, &quot;Diamond Age&quot; does a much better job with  the female characters, while in his earlier book, &quot;Zodiac&quot; his  female characters might just as well be cardboard cutouts.)<br />Anyway, read  the book!",1999-04-23

The United States' economy  has crashed and little city states pop up all over the United States.   These city states are formed by ethnic or cultural distinctions.  They all  meet in a place called the Metaverse.  They always believed that the  Metaverse is safe if you have enough &quot;medicine&quot; for your  computer.  Because of this belief they people do not believe that they can  be hurt in any way, this is were the Snow Crash virus is most virulent.   The virus only effects computer programmers because they naturally  understand the binary code, they brain is `programmed' to understand it.   They are then feed directly to the brain an overload of the binary code  which shuts down the higher reasoning sections of the brain and allows the  ancient memories to surface.

He also began working on cars and agricultural labor to his present career as  a writer.   This is the first book that I have read by Neal Stephenson and  it is definitely one of the best science fiction books I have read.  I only  wish I would have read &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; first.  I do not usually  read science fiction books, I usually stick with romance novels and  Danielle Steel.  This book was on a recommended reading list for my  Internet &amp; Society class.  I am elated that this was the one I chose  because I could not put it down.  I was warned as with others that Neal's  books do not have good endings, but I thought it was good-could have been  better though.  The beginning has this &quot;I cannot put his book  down&quot; draw to it, but during the middle it is cluttered and  distracting.  Cyberpunk is definitely a hip and happening topic now that we  are heading into the year 2000.  The plot was different from anything that  I have read before, that is unquestionably what made me keep reading until  two in the morning some nights.  His theme about the Internet plays on the  way the Internet could be in the near future.  The Metaverse is an  extraordinary idea that may happen before we know it.  The plot was  intensely interesting and unmistakably well thought out, but I have one  question; Where does he get these ideas?  Pizza delivery is without a doubt  at its best and boy do I have respect for those delivery boys working for  the Mafia.  Y.T. is undoubtedly my favorite character in the entire book.   She is fifteen and afraid of nothing.  She has an attitude and she  definitely is not afraid to use it and has a sense of what she wants and if  she wants it she will get it one way or another.  The Snow Crash virus was  a very interesting idea and brought the book together in a realistic way.   With the advancement of technology this sort of thing is not out of the  question and may be what the future will hold for computer hackers.        The down sides about the book are the really boring chapters about Hiro  doing research with the &quot;Earth&quot; and &quot; The Librarian&quot; in  his office in the Metaverse, Raven and his killing sprees with the shards  of glass, the fact that Juanita just disappears to The Raft without a trace  until the end, and what  happened to Da5id?  The names of the characters  are lame, but they bring an insightful look into the future of what  children have to look forward too.  I really hated the parts about Y.T.'s  mother.

He never once used a plot deviced that seemed impossible or illogical, which is very rare indeed.  This is in stark contrast to Gibson's Neuromancer, which although it entertained me, did not show in it's writing style that the writer had any underlying understanding of the functioning of a computer.  In fact, Gibson can be forgiven for his lack of technological sophistication only because of the fact that his work was so ground-breaking for the time at which it was written.  (Gibson has admitted he never even owned a PC or worked with a computer until after that book was written).   This book has great satiric wit, and lies within the definition of &quot;hard sf&quot;.

I've been reading science<BR>   fiction for almost fifty years, but my<BR>   experience of Cyberpunk is mostly restricted to<BR>   William Gibson, whose books I like very much. <BR>   That being so, my first reaction was that<BR>   Stephenson's book, and particularly his heroine,<BR>   was a rip-off of *Virtual Light*, though now I<BR>   gather that the publication chronology does not<BR>   permit that hypothesis.  There are a lot of<BR>   interesting and amusing bits in the book, but I<BR>   found it confusingly plotted (well, I thought<BR>   the same of *Neuromancer* the first two or three<BR>   times I read it).  I was particularly<BR>   unconvinced by Stephenson's version of virtual<BR>   reality; I really can't believe that a pair of<BR>   cathode-ray goggles would give the effects<BR>   described.  At least Gibson's simstim operates<BR>   with impulses input into your nervous system<BR>   through a jack in your skull -<BR>   uncomfortable-sounding, and hard to keep clean,<BR>   but surely more effective.<br />   The major point that I can address, though, is<BR>   related to the reason my student lent me the<BR>   book: the Sumerian connection.  Aside from the<BR>   fact that the long passages of rumination and<BR>   speculation by Protagonist and his mentor are<BR>   excruciatingly boring, the whole basis of the<BR>   historical problem addressed is purest BS. <BR>   Stephenson appears to think it an extraordinary<BR>   thing that once some people spoke Sumerian, and<BR>   then after a while they didn't any more.  Well,<BR>   around where I live a lot of people used to<BR>   speak Lenape, but now they don't.  Dramatic<BR>   historical phenomenon?  Hardly.  He seems to<BR>   think that because Sumerian is (apparently) the<BR>   earliest language we have recorded in writing,<BR>   therefore everyone in the world must have spoken<BR>   Sumerian.  Sumerian was spoken by maybe a couple<BR>   of hundred thousand people in southern<BR>   Mesopotamia in the 4th millennium BCE, and there<BR>   must have been thousands of other languages<BR>   spoken in the world at the time.  There are<BR>   traces in the earliest texts of at least one<BR>   other language whose speakers must have been in<BR>   contact with the Sumerians.  Sumerian remained a<BR>   learned language, like Latin until very recently<BR>   in European culture, but had probably been<BR>   replaced as a vernacular by Akkadian as early as<BR>   2000 BCE; Akkadian in its turn had been replaced<BR>   in Mesopotamia by Aramaic by 400 BCE or so - one<BR>   of the most normal processes in the world.

The idea is a drug called Snow Crash is being past around cyberspace that &quot;snows&quot;(reduces display to fuzzy static) user's computers and &quot;snows&quot; hackers' minds.

The story takes that cool idea even further, creating a villain seeking to destroy the ability to read computers and destroying computers ability to communicate: Infocalypse.

Dick (&#34;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&#34;), and Neal Stephenson (&#34;Snow Crash&#34;). William Gibson is that guy who wears black all the time and never talks in class, but you ran into him on a rock climbing outing and he actually seems pretty OK. Philip K. Dick is the guy down the hall who talks all the time and seems really nice, but you're kind of worried about him. And Neal Stephenson is the CS major who shows up to your party with his own bong and sits on your futon BS-ing until 3am, but you invite him to your next party anyway because the stuff he says is so random and you sort of enjoyed it in spite of yourself. His explanations for how the mythology ties in with the technology are especially ridiculous. But it's such a loopy ride and you have to give him credit for even attempting to pull together so many threads into something coherent. Stephenson's arrogance as a coder comes through pretty strongly, but in the doofiest way imaginable (programmers' brains are primed to interpret raw binary! Wahhht?) As for his prose, your mileage may vary; the first few chapters, where he's doing most of his world-building, are the most difficult in this regard. I read the sample and said &#34;Nah&#34;, but I eventually went back for the rest. Some people absolutely love his style, though; I'm not enamored, but it wasn't a dealbreaker, either. One critical error he did make was tying the book into a time; his future is already in our past. You may find this totally frustrating. It might help to approach the book from a fantasy or speculative alternate history perspective. And while the book gets fairly dark in tone at times, there's a lot of flat-out silly, Wile E. Coyote stuff throughout. Actually, I learned from the afterword that &#34;Snow Crash&#34; was originally envisioned as a digital graphic novel, and then everything made a LOT more sense. Think of it as a comic book in words, and it's a lot easier to just sit back and enjoy the ride.",2014-10-29

It's hard to comprehend how one author can write such completely different material.  A depth of change of this magnitude is something I've not experienced since I started reading Iain M Banks.  Don't get me wrong, I've loved each of the three titles, but for very different reasons.<br /><br />Snow Crash will appeal to lovers of Sci-Fi in the William Gibson (Neuromancer) or Tad Williams (Otherland) vein.  Futuristic settings with integrated Metaverse/Internet/3D Second Life type access.  If you love this stuff then Snow Crash will satisfy nicely.<br /><br />Snow Crash is not as profound as Anathem, which begged a serious indulgence in order to fully appreciate the nuances of the story.  That said, the plot is not straightforward, with multiple plot threads winding through the narrative. This keeps the reader engaged throughout.  The plot is simply impossible to anticipate - sit back and absorb it like fine art.  Let it flow over you.<br /><br />As I have explained, Snow Crash is the third novel of Stephenson's that I have read. I eagerly await the next novel which I am sure will take me into new, uncharted waters.",2012-09-07

There were some terrific ideas in here: the virtual-reality Metaverse where wealth and status impacts on your appearance; religion as a virus infecting people through a base, ancient and long forgotten language; brains as machines that can be affected by binary code. And the book was at it's best when the hero, called Hiro Protagonist, was having these ideas explained to him by a computer program librarian within the Metaverse.

Whenever an interstate road is abbreviated as, for example, I-405 this appears in the kindle text as 1-405. These are just the most frequent mistakes, there are many, many more. While it doesn't make the text unreadable it does lead to several double takes which really breaks the flow of reading the novel.

The layout is poor; lots of text that should appear different from the body text is badly presented, but the real killer is the number of typos - simply atrocious.  Literally (or so it seems) there is an error on every page - missing punctuation but also basic spelling errors.  The name of the main character, Hiro often appears as 'Hire' and so on. It reads like it was fed through a cheap OCR system and then not actually checked by anyone at the publishing house or Amazon (or whoever digitised it for Kindle).    If I was Neal Stephenson, I'd be pretty angry about by work being presented this badly.  The Kindle app is good, and Whispersync, enabling me to carry on reading from where I left off on one device, on another, is a really nice feature, but if the other titles on the Kindle store are like this, I won't be making any more purchases (and I'd like my money back for this one).",2010-06-02
