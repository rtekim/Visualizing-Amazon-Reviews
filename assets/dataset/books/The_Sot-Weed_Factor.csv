It kept popping up in lists of great novels, here and there, and always that intriguing title, THE SOT-WEED FACTOR. What the heck did that mean? Well, finally, after all these years, I got around to reading it, and I found out. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />THE SOT-WEED FACTOR is a very unusual novel, and it took me some time to finish it. It is written in the linguistic style of the Eighteenth Century, an historical, satirical novel, a parody of the 18th-century picaresque novel. Though sometimes serious, it is frequently -- no, most of the time -- hilarious, tongue in cheek, bawdy. The novel is full of mistaken identities, false identities, and the plot takes twists and turns and roundabout detours -- to the point that at times it had my head spinning trying to figure out who was who and what was what.<br /><br />The main character is Ebenezer Cooke, something of a dandy boy, a wanna-be poet. He seeks to become the poet laureate of the Maryland colony. So THE SOT-WEED FACTOR traces his journey from London to Maryland in the new colonies, and all the adventures and misadventures that befall him: kidnapped by pirates, then kidnapped by Indians, the loss of his father's estate in Maryland,<br /><br />&#34;love for a former prostitute; stealthy efforts to rob him of his virginity, which he is (almost) determined to protect; and an extraordinary gallery of treacherous characters who continually switch identities.&#34; [from back cover of Anchor Books edition]<br /><br />Well, sot-weed is what they called tobacco in those days, and a factor was a businessman, a middleman who buys something to resell. Cooke's father owns a sot-weed plantation, Malden, in Maryland, and it is Ebenezer's goal to go to Malden, and to write an epic verse praising the colony. He is given the title, Poet Laureate of Maryland by the third Lord Baltimore in London. However, once in the colonies, heis shocked by the vulgar, brutish ways of the colonists, and turns his pen from praise to ridicule.<br /><br />I should point out that Barth based his novel on a real person, Ebenezer Cooke, who, in fact, did write a poem entitled 'The Sot-Weed Factor,' which was published in London in 1708. The rest is all Barth.<br /><br />THE SOT-WEED FACTOR is very funny, very inventive, and deserved of its 'modern classic' status.",2015-06-12

The narrative is ribald and often laugh-out-loud funny, though Barth displays a disturbing tendency to regard rape as something hilarious. On the other hand, if you are the type who likes fart jokes, this is the book for youâ€¦<br /><br />It's all very impressive, but I have to wonder just what the market can possibly be for such an abstruse, elephantine narrative. It's gotta be fairly small, mostly career academics and terminal-stage English majors. I have to believe that most general readers would quickly be lost in Barth's maze of a plot, obscure references and archaisms, not to mention its sheer length, and throw up their hands.<br /><br />Even for those who get the joke, there is a fatigue factor. In know I was starting to droop around the 400-page mark. The story puts tremendous pressure on a reader to keep characters and situations straight, not easy given that characters often appear as different people to different people at different times, so keeping track of who knows who as who and what went on between them is a constant chore. Also, the background story involves an impossibly convoluted political situation in which loyalties are ever shifting and which adds a whole slew of extra names to keep in mind.<br /><br />As I read I also kept thinking, what's Barth's point here? Is it merely him showing he can do Fielding or Smollett as well as Fielding or Smollett? It doesn't help that the story is set in the same era those authors wrote about. That just makes it even more of an imitation. Perhaps if the story were set in modern times while retaining the archaic narrative style it would be different. But as it is, The Sot-Weed Factor is basically the literary equivalent of a very capable tribute band. They know all the chord changes and the lead singer really does sound like whats-his-name, but in the end it's all an artificial construct, an aping off a genuine artistic achievement where the aping, not the art, is the point.<br /><br />Despite these reservations, I still can't bring myself to give The Sot-Weed Factor anything less than a five-star review just out of sheer admiration for pulling off such a complex work so brilliantly.",2014-09-29
US,51402674,R43W1L1V5QWK6,0385240880,539488056,The Sot-Weed Factor,Books,4,5,5,N,N,"Candide in Maryland","John Barth's novel The Sot-Weed Factor came with high recommendations from my brother Craig, and that was enough to send me straight to the public library and begin reading it. It is a satirical tour-de-force with so much going on that I could hardly follow it all. The style is bawdy, witty, and often funny, a full-fledged imitation of a 17th century novel, complete with the full English vocabulary of the times, which by itself is a welcome challenge to parse. It has been described as a picaresque novel, and the main character is Eben Cooke, an over-educated and under-employed poet and virgin, a Candide-like character constantly bewildered by the world, swept along by events, too curious to make a decision about anything.<br /><br />Cooke writes his life's work, the Marylandiad, intended to be a poetical celebration of the colony of Maryland, but finds little within the actual Maryland to celebrate, so ends up re-titling the work The Sot-Weed Factor, a bitter satire of things as he found them, not as he had envisioned them. (The poem is historical:  The Sot-Weed Factor: or, A Voyage to Maryland. A Satyr, written by one otherwise obscure Ebenezer Cooke, making him in some ways the perfect foil around which to build a historical novel.  Sot-weed factor refers to a tobacco merchandiser.)<br /><br />Barth's view of history is quite entertaining: he brings out the various glosses that are routinely put on events to shape history into a narrative that serves some cause or group:  the author's own gloss is earthy and cynical and mocking of high historical narrative, as would be expected in a satire.  The author artfully immerses you both in the ordered world of 17th century middle class England and in the chaos of England's nascent American Colonies.<br /><br />The tale is also a commentary on things literary and philosophical, only some of which I was able to appreciate. For example, Barth makes implicit and explicit allusions to many novels, the most frequent being Don Quixote, which I have not read, limiting my ability to appreciate some of his literary insights.  His colloquy is not only in the language of the times, but reflects the thinking, religious and philosophical, mixing daily, often crude concerns with lofty sentiments and knowing references to classical writers, making minor characters for example of Eben's contemporaries, Newton and Hooke.  I loved Voltaire's own picaresque novel Candide, among the books lovingly mimicked by Barth's Sot-Weed Factor.  As does Candide, The Sot-Weed Factor implicitly comments on the philosophies of the time within the warp and woof of the novel:  Poor Eben Cooke's bewilderment seems to stand in for modern philosophies that provide no useful moral advice or comfort.<br /><br />The novel is nothing short of amazing, as Barth has mastered the times and the vernacular, and he wields his mastery with great sweep; and finally, alas, to excess.  One thing not mimicked in Candide was its brevity:  Barth's novel is simply too long at eight hundred pages, and in ways overly repetitive, the final slog to its end dulling for me a bit of the novel's brilliance.read, limiting my ability to appreciate some of his literary insights.

As Barth is wont to do, \\""The Sot-Weed Factor\\"" is not only the title of this book, but it is also the title of a poem in the book which is penned by the lead character, who is himself a sot-weed factor (\\""sot weed\\"" being a slang term for tobacco, and a \\""factor\\"" being an agent, middleman or dealer).  Thus Barth has described three different things with the same four words:  this provides a hint of the many layers of meaning contained within \\""The Sot-Weed Factor\\"" (Barth's book, that is, henceforth TSWF).<br /><br />TSWF rewards careful reading and rereading, and like most masterpieces it can be read and interpreted in myriad different ways.  It can be read and admired simply for the literary achievement of penning, in the mid twentieth century, a lengthy book with a fair bit of poetry in it completely in the vocabulary and style of eighteenth century educated British society.  TSWF can be read as an entertaining, bawdy satire;  as historical fiction that may or may not illustrate something about aspects of American colonial life not often captured in textbooks;  and as an intricate puzzle or game with intertwined characters that is not resolved until the end.<br /><br />But, as today's infomercials say, that is not all!  Things get especially interesting when one interprets TSWF and draws parallels to the modern world.  At its core TSWF is a story about the loss of innocence, with one person's innocence perhaps standing in for an entire country's or people's.  The good news is that this loss of innocence may not be all that bad a thing.  There are many philosophical, religious, political and legal aspects of the storyline, and Barth explores these deep issues while consistently keeping the reader entertained.  Barth appears to advocate secular humanism, and one of the many interesting aspects of TSWF is to see how these principles would be carried out in the much more rigid society of British Colonial America.<br /><br />I heartily recommend TSWF to anyone with a sense of humor who appreciates finely written literature, and who has the time to devote to a lengthy written masterpiece.  Although I think Barth could have done a bit of trimming, there is plenty of action and humor to keep the reader's interest.  Upon completing TSWF I felt satisfied, and am looking forward to reading more of Barth's works and perhaps someday rereading \\""The Sot Weed Factor\\"".",2013-10-28

For the savvy reader of the Greek and Romans, this is a bouillabaisse of parallel concepts for a very different time and culture. But, to some - myself included - many of those clever moments are lost as the amateur lessons learned by this reader of the classics made me incapable of truly appreciating that art.<br /><br />But, such a tale is worthy of calling this the Marylandiad -as the protagonist ventures to Maryland where a vast number of awkward and very unique events and adventures encounter him.

He completed the second part, \\""[[ASIN:0385240899 The End of the Road]]\\"" (a 'nihilistic tragedy') in the final three months of the same year. Encouraged by the speed with which he composed these two books, Barth embarked on the final part, convinced he would have it completed by the time he turned 26, on May 27, 1956. In the end, it took him over three years to pen the 800-odd pages of what was to became \\""The Sot-Weed Factor\\"" -- a massive and massively complex burlesque comedy, in antiquated style, which would forever after be seen as one of his greatest achievements, and the book that would stand as a timeless landmark to the brilliance of this young American writer. In deciding a subject for this book, Barth underwent something of a major crisis in a hitherto almost blind pursuit of realism in his fiction, eventually coming to a realisation that words, ultimately, can never truly convey reality, thus making realism an imperfect tool for communicating the truth of anything. In David Morel's seminal paper, \\""Ebenezer Cooke, Sot-Weed Factor Redivivus: The Genesis of John Barth's The Sot- Weed Factor\\"" (published in the Bulletin of the Midwest Modern Language Association, Vol. 8, No. 1 [Spring, 1975]) Barth is quoted as summing up his views in an interview, thus: \\""One ought to know about Reality before one writes realistic novels. Since I don't know much about Reality, it will have to be abolished. What the hell, Reality is a nice place to visit but you wouldn't want to live there, and literature never did, very long.\\""<br /><br />Rather than continue in his pursuit of realism, with \\""The Sot-Weed Factor\\"" Barth turned instead to the idea of art-as-artifice and set about writing a comic, half-farcical novel built on historical documents, imitating the conventions of the eighteenth-century novelist, and encapsulating all of the elements of the classic eighteenth-century novel: 'a hero on a journey with a nit-wit servant as his companion; a search for one's father and one's long-lost beloved; stories told along the road; tests of virtue and manliness; encounters with bandits, bawds, noblemen, and bullies; unbelievable coincidences; abundant fornication and adultery, with possible incest; and more, all woven into a plot whose complications seem designed for nothing more than to spin the reader's head' [Morel, ibid]. All of this Barth achieves in splendid style in \\""The Sot-Weed Factor\\"", taking as its inspiration an obscure and barely known poem, first published in London in 1708: \\""[[ASIN:1444453629 The Sot-weed Factor: or, A Voyage to Maryland]]\\"", attributed to one Eben Cooke (Gent) which describes in cumbersome rhyming couplets the poet's daunting experiences setting out from England to take up a new life in Maryland as a tobacco ('sot-weed') merchant. With little known about its author, authenticity or any of the circumstances under which it was written, Barth was free to construct almost any story he wished around the work and, indeed, the poet, Ebenezer Cooke. Barth being a native of Maryland, he was also ideally placed to research and weave in at length a great deal of that State's early colonial history and legend, involving native chiefs, piratical bands, slave traders, whores and assorted eighteenth century opportunists of various waters.<br /><br />The result is an absolute tour de force, which achieves all that the author set out to achieve and more, mixing fact, fantasy, and Cooke's original poetic publication into a seamless blend which creates a greater reality from the very act of its fabrication and which, with supreme irony, required the author to tone down some of the truly ludicrous historical truths in order that the book be not deemed altogether too far-fetched and fantastical. The book is a classic on many, many levels; the plot is massive and its twists and convolutions can be immensely difficult to follow, as confusion and subterfuge abound.

I could just imagine every line of dialogue spoken by Ebenezer to be delivered in a cry of hair-rending anguish.

He goes to Maryland and gets involved in most improbable adventures, in which the crucial role is played by his former tutor, Henry Burlingame, a character of many faces (in fact, almost every character is not who they were at the beginning, including Eben's twin sister or his prostitute muse).

It takes tremendous liberties with history by joyfully slandering such revered icons as Isaac Newton and Pocahontas and concocting a ridiculous plot filled with incredible coincidences that would make Charles Dickens's head spin, but that's what makes it so much fun. <br />The main character, Ebenezer Cooke, is an affluent, idle young Englishman whose only professional aspiration is to be a poet while trying to preserve his virginity for the purity of his art.  Through a series of misfortunes, he is assigned to go to America to oversee his father's Maryland tobacco plantation, Malden, but he also manages to be appointed Poet and Laureate of Maryland after getting an interview with Lord Baltimore.  Idealistic and naive, he embarks on his journey expecting everything to turn out great.<br />As expected in a novel like this, everything does not turn out great.  Danger lurks around every corner, requiring Ebenezer to enlist the aid of companions who are often more troublesome than helpful.  Accompanying him at various times are his resourceful and sly valet Bertrand and his childhood tutor Henry Burlingame, who turns out to be a man of many identities and a master of disguise.  Burlingame, orphaned young, is determined to trace his mysterious ancestry, and his search becomes an integral part of the plot.<br />Ebenezer's journey to Maryland is fraught with picaresque adventures.  He is pursued by agents of the archvillain John Coode, kidnapped by pirates, marooned, and captured by Indians.  All of these events are part of the political intrigue concerned with whether Maryland is to be predominantly a Catholic or Protestant province, and whether Englishmen will even be able to live there without worrying about being murdered by angry dispossessed Indians.  When Ebenezer gets to Maryland, he is surprised to find it a bastion of prostitution, venality, and corruption, and through circumstances beyond his control or will, Malden turns into a brothel, opium den, and gambling house -- an appropriately comic predicament which Ebenezer and his friends must rectify using all the resources at their disposal.<br />After reading this book, I felt like I had been clubbed over the head and taken on a wild ride through somebody's demented idea of a 17th-Century amusement park.  It is intended to be a parody, but Barth, who is a native of the area he writes about, obviously invested a great amount of scholarship and research in its preparation.

Widely considered Barth's best novel (I'm very much a novice with him, this being only my second book so I'm no man to judge) I can easily see why it deserves such a status.  A parody of historical novels, Barth writes the story in the style of that time so it seems like all those books your teachers made you read in high school, but better.

An attempts to summarize the plot are useless, it's too sprawling, people who want instant gratification will be at a loss here, this is a book you have to absorb over the course of a few days and get used to the style before it sinks in just how much fun it is.  The characters play everything seriously, making the jokes (and there are plenty, with the funniest of a vulgar nature and often involving the story of Captain John Smith of Pocohantus fame) come off as utterly hilarious, but at the same time Barth manages to make you care just a little bit about them, as quirky as they are, they still come across as typically flawed human beings.  Probably the best thing about the book is its sheer unpredictability, not shackled by the morals of the 16th century, anything and everything does happen, nobody is what they seem and situations shift gears so rapidly that it'll make your head spin even as you can't stop laughing.  A truimph on nearly every level, this is something a lesser writer would have only managed to turn into a stale stylistic genre exercise, something to wow the kids in the creative writing workshop . . . what Barth creates here is something lasting and no matter what century it was written in or evokes, will probably wind up being timeless.and no matter what century it was written in or evokes, will probably wind up being timeless.",2002-01-15

The story is as cleansing as an iodine soaked pad,  and its telling is as soothing as an unspiced eggplant.

Boomers want to understand rather than simply experience life,  and most have been frustrated by life's refusal to obey our expectations.   <br /> John Barth seems to have made such soul searching his life work,  and I seem to have followed him book for book, life experience by life experience over the years.  A clever &quot;academic&quot; writer (read: &quot;he writes like a dream but his wit sometimes overwhelms the story&quot;),  Barth has addressed boomer experience and frailty .    <br />Seeming to be five to ten years ahead of boomers,  his books have ranged from the tragedy resulting from a terribly botched abortion (long before we openly spoke of this horror),  through the visionary and usually misguided quest of the idealist (Sot-Weed Factor and Giles Goatboy),  the terrible pain of realizing one is an adult (the clever but exhausting Letters),  to more leisurely and accessible mid-life reassessment as protagonists take &quot;voyages&quot; on the emotional seascape of middle age (Sabbatical,  Tidewater Tales,  Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor,  Once upon a Time...).    <br />  Each five years or so,  I eagerly await his newest offering,  devour it,  and then feel frustrated when his literary games seem to detract from his story.  <br />But,  then,  each time I realize (as if for the first time),  the essential nature of his writing.  Like the age-old games from which his writings spring (the quest/redemption stories of the Iliad and Oddessy,  the &quot;doomed&quot; prophet stories of the Old and New Testaments,  the mistaken identity games of Shakespeare and thousands of authors since,  and the metaphor of story as voyage and voyage as growth from Chaucer,  1001 Nights, etc),  Barth plays his games to remind us that the act of story telling *is* the experience,  it *is* the reasonwe read: the experience of hearing ghost stories around the camp fire remains with us long long after we have forgotten the actual story.  <br />And then I remember that, as a reader,  I have no more &quot;right&quot; to expect neatness and closure in a Barth story than I have the right to expect neatness and closure in my own life.  Try as we might,  our own work,  our own story is always in progress.  And like Barth's beloved Tidewater,  the ebb and flow of our own story defies our attempt to capture to master it.  <br />In the end,  life and Barth's stories remain as delightfully cleansing as the tide itself. <br />KRH  [...]",1996-07-11
