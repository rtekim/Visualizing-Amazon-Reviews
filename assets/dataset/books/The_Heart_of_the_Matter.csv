(is) to show how ... the World gradually caught fire for me, burst into flames; how this happened all DURING my life, and as a result of my whole life, until it formed a great luminous mass, lit from within, that surrounded me... there was a gradual interplay of three universal components: the Cosmic, the Human and the Christic.\\"" (Pg. 15) Later, he explains, \\""Matter is the matrix of Spirit. Spirit is the higher state of Matter.\\"" (Pg. 35)<br /><br />He describes the faculty of \\""perceiving, without actually seeing,\\"" suggesting that \\""I have no doubt ... that it was the experience of the War that brought me this awareness and developed it in me as a sixth sense.\\"" (Pg. 31) He reflects, \\""To be completely Man, it may well be that I would have been obliged to become Christian... The fact is, fortunately for me, I was born right into the Catholic 'phylum'... I have never, at any moment of my life, experienced the least difficulty in addressing myself to God as a supreme SOMEONE.\\"" (Pg. 39, 41)<br /><br />He argues that \\""an historically incarnate God is on the contrary the only God who can satisfy not only the inflexible laws of a Universe in which nothing is produced or appears except by way of birth, but also the irrepressible aspirations of our own mind.\\"" (Pg. 54) In another essay, he suggests that \\""no religious Faith releases... a higher degree of warmth, a more intense dynamism of unification than the Christianity of our own day---and the more Catholic it is, the truer my words.\\"" (Pg. 89)<br /><br />When he wonders whether his notions of a \\""Universal Christ\\"" or \\""Divine Milieu\\"" are no more a \\""mirage in my own mind,\\"" the following three waves of evidence sweep away his fears: \\""First, there is ... the coherence that this ineffable element (or Milieu) introduces into the underlying depths of my mind and heart...

So Graham Greene wrote in 1980, three decades after his publication of 'The Heart of the Matter.'  Ever a tough self-critic, the novel has been far better received by scholars and audiences than Greene himself.  This widespread success has helped to establish Greene as one of the twentieth century's leading British novelists and, with figures such as Evelyn Waugh, Paul Claudel, and François Mauriac, as one of the greatest Roman Catholic writers in modern history.<br /><br /> First published in 1948, 'The Heart of the Matter' was inspired by Greene's life as a British intelligence officer in Sierra Leone during the Second World War.  Greene, mixing his Catholic background with immense skills in fiction, journalism, and travel writing, penned a social drama that is arguably the best of his career.  It earned the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, Britain's version of the Pulitzer, in its first impression and reached Time Magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.<br /><br /> Taking place in a Sierra Leone township during wartime, Greene draws vividly from his experiences as an MI6 official and the well-known irregularities of his love life.  He immerses us with the novel's opening pages into a hot, humid, and malaria-ridden territory of coastal British Africa; the sweat on one's arms, the constant feeling of being watched, and the sound of vultures clopping on tin roofs predominate this scene.  The locals of Sierra Leone - those of the Black underclass - are illiterate, often born out of wedlock, and fill roles comparable to slavery.<br /><br /> Against this musty backdrop, Greene paints his characters with a simple, journalistic flair.  The focal point is Henry Scobie, a deputy commissioner who is next in line to head the colony's police department.  Scobie and his wife Louise are devout Catholics who seem out of place in their African surroundings: Scobie, while regarded as an honest and efficient officer, is distrusted by his colleagues for being too above-board.  Louise is an aloof and opportunistic woman who has little in common with her husband, including a thirst for social advancement and a love of poetry.  Yet their relationship endures in this bleak setting; marriage has once again become a 'habit,' as Greene so often laments.<br /><br /> Scobie's main asset - a sympathy for those around him - is also his most glaring weakness.  Consumed by a police state where unhappiness reigns, Scobie damages his integrity by taking loans from Yusef, a Syrian gem trafficker, in order to send Louise on a costly relocation to South Africa.  While Louise is away, he falls in love with Helen Rolt, a young woman who managed to survive days at sea following a boating accident that killed her just-married husband.  Scobie discovers his faith as a Catholic, the one power he can turn to, unraveling in this chaos while at the same time galvanizing his link with the divine.  This happens while a London spy named Wilson, who holds childish feelings for Louise, keeps a watchful eye and happily reports to his superiors.<br /><br /> 'The Heart of the Matter,' written at the peak of Greene's literary abilities, is a novel with superb emotional depth and range.  Much of the story takes place as an interior monologue that follows Scobie's ensuing crises in love, faith, and the will to live.  While firmly rooted in Greene's Catholic outlook, the novel extends beyond his faith and deals with universal concepts of self-respect, compassion, and decency: how can one maintain his truthfulness, Greene asks, in a world of lies and deceit?  Should we really have intolerance for deceit when the world appears so rotten?  And is total understanding between human beings possible when compared to the definiteness of a man's spirituality?<br /><br /> Compared to earlier novels such as 'England Made Me' and 'Brighton Rock,' 'The Heart of the Matter' has better-developed characters, a more cohesive plot, and solid narration.  Greene still falls into an overuse of simile and certain events don't happen with a feeling of the inevitable, but 'Matter' still ranks as one of the best-written novels in twentieth century literature and holds a deserving place in Green's 'Catholic' cycle of novels that secured his legacy.<br /><br /> 'The Heart of the Matter' is a frequently-printed novel that can be acquired in used copies on the Internet.  Used for this review was the 1960 printing by Compass Books (C70, 306 pages), a subsidiary of The Viking Press.  More recent editions have appeared from Penguin Books and Vintage Classics.

The question was, \\""What do you think is the greatest novel written in English?\\"" He didn't think for very long before replying, \\""The Heart Of The Matter.\\""<br /><br />We academically-inclined youths borrowed Graham Greene's novel from the library and eventually conferred. There were shrugs, some indifference, appreciation without enthusiasm. We were all about sixteen years old.<br /><br />I last re-read The Heart Of The Matter about twenty-five years ago. When I began it again for the fourth time last week, I could still remember vividly the basics of its characters and plot. Henry Scobie is an Assistant Chief of Police in a British West African colony. It is wartime and he has been passed over for promotion. He is fifty-ish, wordly-wise, apparently pragmatic, a sheen that hides a deeply analytical conscience. Louise, his wife is somewhat unfocusedly unhappy with her lot. She is a devout Catholic and this provides her support, but the climate is getting to everyone. She leaves for a break that Scobie cannot really afford. He accepts debt.<br /><br />The colony's businesses are run by Syrians. Divisions within their community have roots deeper than commercial competition. There is \\""trade\\"" of many sorts. There are accusations, investigations, rumours and counter-claims. Special people arrive to look into things. There's a suicide, more than one, in fact, at least one murder, an extra-marital affair, blackmail, family and wartime tragedy.<br /><br />But above all there is the character of Henry Scobie. He is a man of principle who thinks he is a recalcitrant slob. He is a man of conscience who presents a pragmatic face. He makes decisions fully aware of their consequences, but remains apparently unable to influence the circumstance that repeatedly seems to dictate events. He remains utterly honest in his deceit, consistent in his unpredictability. His life becomes a beautiful, uncontrolled mess. His wife's simple orthodox Catholicism contrasts with his never really adopted faith. He tries to keep face, but cannot reconcile the facts of his life with the demands of his conscience. His ideals seem to have no place in a world where interests overrule principle. He sees a solution, a way out, but perhaps it is a dead end.<br /><br />For twenty-first century sensibilities, the colonial era attitudes towards local people appear patronising at best.  Perhaps that is how things were. But The Heart Of The Matter is not really a descriptive work. It is not about place and time. Like a Shakespearean tragedy, the events and their setting provide only a backdrop and context for a deeply moving examination of motive and conscience. And also like a Shakespearean tragedy, the novel transcends any limitations of its setting to say something unquestionably universal about the human condition. Forty years on, I now realise, that my new English teacher was probably right.ife's simple orthodox Catholicism contrasts with his never really adopted faith.

So many other allegedly great authors have tried to do the same thing, with very few successes. Most often you get turgid \\""prose\\"" which reeks of pseudo-intellectual showboating, turning the character in question from a flesh-and-blood entity into a cipher, which leads to a predictable conclusion that you could not care less about.     Greene avoids that lot and achieves true profundity. I was impressed almost in spite of myself, because I previously did not conceive of him as a front-ranker, and I have no truck with religious mores. I still don't think he is an all-time genius, but I DO think that there was something beyond sheer erudition and assiduity to the man...something which the gods either confer or don't.    The MLA asserts that The Heart of the Matter is the 40th best novel of the 20th century, which underrates it...at least compared to some of the books--e.g., Henderson, the Rain King; To The Lighthouse--which are ranked higher. But enough time wasted on the MLA...    The novel starts off slowly, almost prosaically--you may think to yourself \\""What's the fuss?\\"" for a hundred pages. But then comes the moment when the protagonist, Scobie, comforts a dying girl in two outstanding paragraphs...and from that point the book shifts into high gear.     Things begin to happen abruptly, but not in a manipulative, writer's-construct way--they have the patina of real life, where sometimes years of equilibrium are disturbed by life-altering events which occur in rapid succession. (Greene--mirroring life, perhaps--does leave a few loose ends.) I am as keenly attuned to factitiousness as a hog to truffles, but I never caught a whiff of artifice.
