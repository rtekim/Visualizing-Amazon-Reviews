The titular poem is written by the recluse and literary titan John Slade while the forward and commentary to the poem are written by Slade’s adoring acolyte, Charles Kinbote. What results is a strange and original work that deals with mortality, grief, hero worship, and political maneuverings. Nabokov’s language is singularly his own and truly something to be savored by any lover of words. Those unfamiliar with his work would do well to start here, but won’t want to stop after reading just one.	2015-08-17

The poem, I think is the best part, aesthetically speaking; but the commentary is also held in high regard, focusing on the &#34;editor's&#34; relationship and his own life: more of a self-commentary than poem-analysis.

I was basing my low opinion of Nabokov on some vague ideas I had about his art and personality: he seemed overly clever to me, he seemed willing to dismiss authors, bodies of thought, and philosophies with clever quips, he seemed to treat his novels as if they were puzzles or games or riddles rather than human stories, he seemed almost inhuman to me, uninterested in human emotion. It was hard for me to imagine Nabokov - or any of his characters - ever feeling sad about anything, or feeling any genuine emotion, other than a carefree delight in playing word games and constructing puzzles. I was aware that I had created a caricature of Nabokov in my own mind, but we all do this all the time. It is how we form opinions. But those subjective caricatures often get in our way and inform our perception and make us blind.<br /><br />When I first read Pale Fire I had mixed feelings about it. I enjoyed some of the humor of the novel. I enjoyed Kinbote's obvious insanity and his strange commentary on Shade's poem. But the novel seemed to confirm my impression: the whole novel was too cleverly constructed, too divorced from general human feeling, the narrator was too bizarre, too divorced from everyday life. It seemed like an academic game. Many of Nabokov's narrators - however insane they may be - seem bathed in the atmosphere of stuffy academia, and Kinbote was no exception. However, I decided to pick up Brian Boyd's book [[ASIN:0691009597 Nabokov's Pale Fire: The Magic of Artistic Discovery]] and give it a read. I did not ultimately agree with all of Boyd's conclusions about the novel but Boyd helped me to see the human story, and the emotional power in the novel, that I was missing. He cleared the fog of my preconceived ideas and I was able to discover the aesthetic beauty of Nabokov's novel.<br /><br />After reading Boyd, I consider Pale Fire to be one of my favorite novels. I came to realize that there is a human story here behind all the insanity: the story of a quiet and sad poet, who has lost a daughter, and has spent his life trying to come to terms with death. Even Kinbote became more human to me after reading Boyd. Instead of being just a literary device - a blank representative of what critics call the &#34;unreliable narrator&#34; - I began to see Kinbote's agony, his paranoia, his isolation, his loneliness, and glimpses of his hidden past. I began to see the suffering of Sybil - who lost a daughter, a husband, and then had her husband's last poem stolen out from under her by a madman. And I began to understand the pathos of the quietly brooding Hazel that led her to commit suicide. Of course, I had &#34;seen&#34; all these things when reading the novel on my own, but I was too caught up in the strange structure of the novel - its pose as a scholarly commentary on a poem - and I was trapped in my own caricature of Nabokov and what I took to be his &#34;aesthetic&#34;.<br /><br />Boyd also highlighted what I think is the major theme of the novel: the question about a hidden order behind the seeming absurdity of the universe or, put another way, the question of life after death. Nabokov discovered the perfect structure to explore this theme because he can have Shade say, in his poem, &#34;And if my private universe scans right/So does the universe of galaxies divine/Which I suspect is an iambic line/I'm reasonably sure that we survive/And that my darling somewhere is alive/As I am reasonably sure that I/Shall wake tomorrow, on July/The twenty-second, nineteen fifty-nine&#34; (69) and then have Shade shot on the 21st of July. The event immediately becomes a commentary on Shade's lines from a perspective that Shade himself can never have. He can never have the perspective that sees his composition of those lines and his imminent death together. But the reader can. I will not summarize all the interesting points Boyd makes about this theme, but the novel oscillates between the feeling that the universe is absurd, and the sense that there might be a hidden order to the universe, even in spite of all the absurdity.<br /><br />What I took away was: Nabokov was not just playing games. He did not decide to write a novel disguised as scholarly commentary on a poem just to be &#34;clever&#34; or just to do something new. It served a greater artistic vision. So, while I still have mixed feelings about Nabokov in general, I feel like I can say without any qualifications whatsoever: Pale Fire is a beautiful novel and, dare I say, a masterpiece.

At first I thought this book was an aberration from the norm just for fun; An experimental parody on the novel. So It is hard to read if you didn’t understand what Nabokov was attempting to do. Though myself and fellow reading friends “got it” right away. My take is that you must read it like a satirical commentary on works that critics neither understand nor care to understand.<br />I once read that Nabokov was a great admirer of Dickens. His similar talent with words, humor, symbolism, and creativity is so evident in this work. I particularly love the “word golf” notion and the unreliable narrator’s (Shade and Kinbote) mirrored and often ridiculous (but only superficially) comments. Flipping back and forth through pages was tedious (I won't give away why), but worth it!

But while I adored Lolita, my main impulse upon finishing Pale Fire is to go back and rewatch The X-Files's &#34;Jose Chung's From Outer Space,&#34; and then write Darin Morgan a letter telling him how much I love him.<br /><br />Aside from that, Fire leaves me amused and admiring, but hardly aflame. It's so clearly a virtuoso exercise - a novel written in an obsessed fan's footnotes to what's actually a fairly brilliant poem - presented by the author with such a wink and a nod that it's impossible not to like, but difficult to really love. All technique; no heart.<br /><br />It does inspire me in at least one other way: I now want to go dig through the David Foster Wallace archive at UT's Ransom Center to see if there's a copy of Pale Fire floating about in there, because I strongly suspect Wallace of having lifted a few of Nabokov's moves here to create his &#34;signature&#34; footnoting style.

I assume that's not a coincidence but rather a nice piece of brand extension and complementary marketing as Nabokov was no fool, and neither, I assume, was his publisher. In fact, Pale Fire is Nabokov's first true novel after Lolita as Pnin (1957) was more or less a stopgap, cobbled together from some previously published stories into a extended narrative.<br /><br />The movie would have put Nabokov's name before the public and undoubtedly raised Pale Fire's sales even though readers looking for Lolita-esque salacious stuff would be very disappointed. That's good because otherwise this very clever but rather abstruse piece of postmodern quirkiness would have had a hard go with the general reading public.<br /><br />Basically, Pale Fire is a 999-line poem written by the fictional John Shade, accompanied a very extensive set of footnotes by the mysterious Charles Kinbote, Shade's colleague at a fictional Northeastern university. I found the footnotes by far the more entertaining part, as it is there that Kinbote, in the manner of Humbert Humbert's first person narration in Lolita, seeks to justify himself and his actions even as the reader struggles to read between the lines. Kinbote is less convincing than Humbert but both are great examples of the unreliable narrator factor in full flower.<br /><br />The mystery running through the footnotes is Kinbote's identity and the particulars surrounding the death of Shade just after he finishes his poem. It all has to do with a revolution in the fictional country of Zembla and the urgency Kinbote seems to feel that Shade not only complete his poem but use as its theme Zembla's recent history. It all remains ambiguous at the end because of Kinbote's clear unreliability, giving readers a lot to think about and critics and academics a subject to endlessly pontificate over.<br /><br />To me, however, Pale Fire is an interesting experiment but is nowhere near Lolita in end-to-end brilliance, even though Nabokov's prose generally remains as witty and erudite as ever.<br /><br />NOTE: There are different approaches to reading Pale Fire. Some say you should read the poem and footnotes together, following the line citations. Others argue the poem should be read all the way through first and then the footnotes. My approach was to read each of the poem's four cantos and then their accompanying footnotes in turn.

This work is truly unique in it's style, prose and structure, and highlights Nabokov's mastery of the English language.  It is not the easiest read (none of Nabokov's work really is), but it is worthwhile all the same.<br /><br />Its not easy describe because there is nothing really comparable that I have come across, but I'll give it a try.  The book is written in three parts, an introduction written by Charles Kinbote (essentially the main character in the book), the 999 line poem &#34;Pale Fire&#34; written by fictional American poetry icon John Shade, and an &#34;analysis&#34; of the poem by Charles Kinbote.  Kinbote claims to be an acolyte of Shade's, but is essentially a crazy man and the &#34;analysis&#34; is really more the story of Kinbote's life with occasional references to the content of the poem.  It is much more than that though, and only reading the book can do it justice.<br /><br />While this book probably isn't for everybody, I consider it one of the best novels I have ever read, and I highly recommend reading it.	2014-03-22

It is certainly unique and inventive in its method of telling a story, and that's a plus. It held my attention, and that's a plus. It is satirically humorous, and that's another plus. But it is very labor-intensive to read, and after finishing, I still don't know what really happened, or if anything really happened at all.<br /><br />Pale Fire begins with a forward, which is not the usual kind that the reader can skip. This forward is actually part of the story, introducing one of the two main characters--Dr. Charles Kinbote, who is supposedly the editor of a 999-line poem written by the poet John Shade, the other main character.<br /><br />The second part of the novel is the poem \\"Pale Fire,\\" Shade's poem, which covers about 36 pages. It concerns Shade's meditations on death and the suicide of his daughter, as well as details of his daily life. Here I encountered my first problem: the poem seems mediocre to me, certainly not an authentic effort by Nabokov. It is written in rhyming couplets, much in the style of Robert Frost (he is referenced in the poem), has some arresting images, but then turns mundane and silly in spots. Not knowing whether to perceive the poem as satirical or serious really bothered me.<br /><br />The third and longest part of the novel consists of the \\"commentary\\" on the poem by Kinbote, with the customary line-references back to the poem for each entry. Now, for 230 pages, the reader turns back and forth from the poem to Kinbote's references to lines from the poem. Many times the poetry has nothing to do with the commentary, as Kinbote begins to tell his own story. He is an undependable narrator, for sure, obviously egocentric and most probably insane. But he is entertaining and it's fun to see how Nabokov leaves little clues all over as to what really happens in the book.<br /><br />But then,the reader never really knows. Did John Shade write both the poem and the commentary? Did Kimbote write both the poem and the commentary. Was the assassin (spoiler alert) really Professor Botkin? Was the assassin really Gradus, sent to kill an ex-king? Was the assassin really an escapee from a mental institution? Was Kimbote really the dethroned king of Zembla?<br /><br />I broke a self-imposed rule during the reading of this book: I never read commentary (other than the book-seller's) or critical essays before or during the reading. I want to form my own opinions, without input from \\"experts.\\" But the question of the poem bothered me so much that I googled up Wikipedia, the expert on all things. I read that more than 80 major interpretations had been written about the novel. So I figured that it was OK to be puzzled, since I surely wasn't the first. I think Nabokov wrote a puzzle-book on purpose, and probably derived great amusement from scholarly-types trying to figure it out.<br /><br />Despite the problems, I am really glad I read this. It is probably one of Nabokov's best. It is also possible that it is mainly just a very clever bit of razzle-dazzle.	2013-02-16

The author contended that a good novel that is widely read and loved is better than an abstruse literary achievement revered by a small club of acedmics and intellectuals. Great Expectations versus Ulysses.  The latter may be a work of recondite genius, but who really cares if few people read and or enjoy it.  Pale Fire is definetly one of these books.<br />Pale Fire is 300 pages long, and I really didn't start to appreciate it until about page 200.  Why did I hang in there so long -- because it is so highly regarded.  Nabakov pokes fun at academia and his literary talents are in full effect.  The book is funny in parts and the writing is sublime, but the story is difficult - actually there is no story but a 1000 line poem followed by 200 pages of discursive footnotes.

This novel really exemplifies the excessive amount of freedom within Nabokov's creative process - it is boundless, performative and very much alive. It's almost as if Nabokov makes his very own strict set of literary rules and then turns right around and breaks them for no other reason then purely enjoying smashing boundaries into infinite pieces and reworking them into a unique masterpiece. It's almost as if he deconstructs his writing himself only to let the act of reading it serve as a creative process in its own right, which then carefully reconstructs his words into something very, very special. Strange disconnects surface more than occasionally,  bobbing their heads up and down in the story - yet these are done in such a fluid, effortless manner that the resulting effect is nothing short of awesome(to borrow a favorite word of my brother, Alex).

Joyce? The foremost big-brain of the 20th Century, perhaps, but his monoliths are, to most people, as impregnable as an eighty-nine-year-old nun.    Gide? No slouch, but his chops do not enter into radar range with ol' Vladders.    Anybody? I confess, I'm stumped.    This book would, for anyone else, be the defining career magnum opus. (Anyone besides the guy who gave us Lolita, of course.) Nabokov gives us a forward, a poem, and then a narrative commentary on the poem. All are brilliantly conceived, constructed, and created. The prose and verse are nonpareil, the characterizations apposite and hilarious, and the satire superb. (Nabokov also fulfills his penchant for tweaking sexual mores of the time by making his narrator--the erstwhile king of Zembla, and current university lecturer--a randy pansy.)    This book clocks in at #53 on the MLA 100, which underrates it enormously.	2007-06-19
US	30652561	RF49JDY35C81N	0679723420	755867934	Pale Fire	Books	5	11	12	N	N	Pale Fire	At its simplest, Pale Fire is an examination of the 999-line poem in four cantos, 'Pale Fire' by respected Zemblan scholar Charles Kinbote, a friend of the recently deceased poet, John Shade. The novel becomes less simple when we realise that John Shade is a fictional poet, that Zembla may or may not exist, and that our friend Charles Kinbote is either the King of Zembla or insane, or perhaps both. <br /> <br />The novel opens, appropriately, with an introduction to the text about to be studied. Kinbote goes to great lengths to assure us that his land of Zembla and his 'great secret' are a major theme of the poem. He also repeatedly affirms his friendship with Shade, though the remainder of the text allows a severe amount of doubt as to the strength of their relationship. <br /> <br />John Shade, poet par excellence, is presented as an earthy, ugly man. Kinbote tries to exalt him to a higher plan at times, though textually we only ever see Shade for what he is - a poet, a great poet perhaps, but a poet. He isn't a God of letters or the Saviour of a nation, he is a man. But Kinbote has this to say of Shade's creative process: 'I am witnessing a unique physiological phenomenon: John Shade perceiving and transforming the world, taking it in and taking it apart, re-combing its element in the very process of storing them up so as to produce at some unspecified date an organic miracle, a fusion of image and music, a line of verse.' <br /> <br />Once the introduction has cleared, we are able to read the poem itself. It is 999 lines long: 166 for Canto One, 334 for Canto Two and Three, and 165 lines for Canto four. Kinbote tell us that the poem should in fact be 1,000 lines, with the first line of the poem repeated as the last, '...and would have completed the symmetry of the structure, with its two identical central parts, solid and ample, forming together with the shorter flanks twin wings of five hundred verses each, and damn that music.' <br /> <br />We are told in theintroduction that the poem is about Zembla, which means that when we read Pale Fire, we are searching for references and commentary on this (presumably) mythical country. Canto One and Two incite doubt, Canto Three assures us, and Canto four confirms that there will be no references to Zembla. From the first, we are unsure of our narrator. <br /> <br />To the meat of the text, then. Kinbote offers to explain verses and lines, sometimes in great detail. A number of these are purely literary in explanation. He locates references, comments upon the language used (both negatively and positively), and generally acts as a normal editor would. These comments are usually clever, accurate and informed. <br /> <br />But the bulk of the text comes from Kinbote's other comments. As we know from the introduction, Kinbote is desperate to prove a link between the poem and himself. He is so certain of his great friendship with Shade that surely it must be inspired by his majestic Zembla? A word ('Today' on one occasion, 'parents' on another) can spark a multi-page discourse on Zembla, on Kinbote, on the perceived connections. As we read, it becomes clear the lengths that Kinbote must go to prove any connection at all. At first, this seems the enthusiastic ramblings of a friend, but as we read, it becomes clear that Kinbote is not quite sane. He spies upon Shade, he creates connections that aren't there, he believes everything is stronger than it is. Why, we are unsure. Is he a fan, become obsessed with his favourite poet? <br /> <br />A third story - and we are crowded with them, it seems - is that of Gradus, a man hired to assassinate the deposed Zemblan King. As the analysis of the poem approaches an end, so to does Gradus come closer to finally killing Shade. This is not a spoiler - we are told from the start that Gradus killed Shade. But what we don't know is the motive. Was it to kill the King? Or was it case of mistaken identity with a Judge? Again, we are unsure, because Kinbote is so unreliable. <br /> <br />I say unreliable, yet he is reasonably consistent within himself. Zembla is an astonishing construct, with history, geography, culture and customs. Add to that the fact of Kinbote working at a university teaching Zemblan, and we remain unsure as to the truth of, well, everything. <br /> <br />So, a detective story. It is horribly complicated, yet at the same time completely straight forward. All of the plot lines begin at the start of the novel and are resolved in a straight forward manner. Kinbote does not reveal himself to be the exiled King at first, but that is a simple matter of reading between the lines - he goes to no real effort to hide the fact. And Shade is dead, we know that from the start. No, the 'detective' aspect of Pale Fire is that we don't know what to believe. There are multiple interpretations for everything, but the only detailed interpretation we have is Kinbote's, and his is so fantastic that it should be automatically discredited. Yet we cannot, due to the sheer confidence with which he tells his story. <br /> <br />A word on the poem. It is by turns beautifully written and evocatively plotted. The Second Canto deals with Shade's daughter's death, and is very sad. The language is impeccable, as all poems must be. 'How to locate in blackness, with a gasp, Terra the Fair, an orbicle of jasp' is lovely. <br /> <br />Similarly, the rest of the novel crackles with inspired description and wordplay. Nabokov is known for his love of language, it is quite astonishing to realise that English was his second language. We have such gems as 'Would he have crept, pistol in hand, to where a sun-bathing giant lay spread-eagled, a spread eagle of hair on his chest?'. <br /> <br />There is a lot to consider with Pale Fire. The beauty of the novel is easy to enjoy, and the plot, for what it is, works. The greatest enjoyment comes from the mystery of what is real and what is not, but a side entertainment is certainly available in the form of Kinbote's literary criticism, some of which is biting. We may assume that this is Nabokov speaking, as he was known for his harsh judgment on literature. <br /> <br />To end, Pale Fire is complicated and complex, but the rewards are great. If the idea of a novel wrapped around the analysis of a poem is not appealing, then stay away. But if beautiful language, wonderful prose and excellent literature is to your taste, by all means, read Pale Fire.	2007-01-15
US	23970004	R18LOCQOS6RL8L	0679723420	755867934	Pale Fire	Books	5	7	8	N	N	A tour de farce	Nabokov was one of the wittiest, most elegant writers of English prose of the 20th century. That's remarkable - his native language was Russian. He's probably best known to English language readers for his novel, \\"Lolita,\\" but I think that \\"Pale Fire\\" is his masterpiece. It's just plain brilliant.<br /><br />\\"Pale Fire\\" is something of a literary platypus. It isn't a novel, it isn't autobiographical, it isn't prose or poetry. It has elements of all of them while being none of them. It's completely original. It's a farce and a satire, a skewering of academia, a riff on the pretentiousness of professors, a slam of postmodernism before many people were even talking about that academic development. In spirit its closest modern relatives are Alan Sokal's fraudulent 1996 article (parody) in the journal \\"Social Text\\" and a sendup of MLA procedings in \\"Postmodern Pooh.\\" It consists of a foreward, a poem in four cantos, commentary, and an index. It's all supposedly written by an apparently demented academic, Charles Kinbote, except for the poem, written by his former colleague (and object of both child-like and sexual desire?), John Shade.<br /><br />We learn more about Kinbote in his work about Shade's poem than we learn about the poem or its author. As far as Kinbote is concerned, everything is about him - the poem, academic intrigue, revolution in his homeland, everything. His analysis of the poem is almost an exercise in solipsism - he sees and discourses on himself at every turn. And thus, I think, was Nabokov's view of American English departments - collections of talentless, naval-gazing frauds.<br /><br />This book isn't just a satire of university English departments. It's also a mystery and a puzzle, pulling us into the world of Kinbote and feeding us clues about the place so that we can form a picture of it, understand why Shade is dead and Kinbote is holed-up in a motel to finish his commentary. But it isn't a book about a mystery. It's just a really strange book, and just plain brilliant.nge book, and just plain brilliant.	2006-12-11

The style and the annotation are similar, if not identical, to how a long poem would be analyzed in a class.<br /><br />After reading the forward, where you are told that the narrator, maybe on the sly, impounds the 999-line poem written on the death bed of his beloved rhyming neighbor.  He then delivers the poem to us -- in a consistently written 10-beat rhythm -- which discusses many aspects of regicide of the late and great King of the foreign land of Zembla.  Zembla's King Charles is lost, or is he the rhyming neighbor in disguise? We are never sure.<br /><br />Line by line, a thorough review of what is meant by some of the unique passages is delivered to us by the narrator, who proclaims to know more than anyone what this epic poem is about. This is like college class. This is very entertaining.<br /><br />Poems do not move quickly, and this one is no exception.  Moreover, Nabokov's thorough usage of the English language may deliver you to the dictionary on frequent occasion as his prose is as detailed and thick as many poets.<br /><br />We are toyed with by Nabokov, but what else is new? In the end, we know little more than we did in the beginning.  But, it was fun.<br /><br />This is a book which you may want to own.  Reading it again and again is probably the correct thing to do as this novel has layers upon layers. And, that is exactly what Nabokov did on so many occasions.  He was  a master of multiple perspection, he delivered us fiction which could be read different ways on different occasions.	2006-10-17

Experimental novel \\"Pale Fire\\" is a strange, haunting, magical experience, and as different from most novels as it can get. Like a textured surrealist painting, that is hard to take in on only one reading, let alone describe to someone who's never read it.<br /><br />\\"Pale Fire\\" is a poem, 999 lines and divided into four cantos, written by poet John Shade. It's moving, vibrant and breathtaking. And it's posthumously annotated by scholar (and head case) Charles Kinbote, supposedly from the fictional Zembla (don't ask). In the \\"backwoods,\\" Kinbote overdissects and reexamines the strange poem. Increasingly he is drawn into the web of words, stuck on the poem and believing it to be about him.<br /><br />A strain of subtle, dark humor runs through \\"Pale Fire.\\" Not funny-ha-ha humor, but one that only becomes apparent if you study it. In a nutshell, the humor here pokes at critics who read what they want to see into literature. Everyone has seen a passage or a line that strikes them to the soul. The entirety of \\"Pale Fire\\" does this to Kinbote, and his obsession with making it about himself is weirdly hypnotic.<br /><br />Most unique (and funny) is the sort of analysis that Kinbote does of \\"Pale Fire.\\" It's overblown, unlikely, and tailored to his delusions. He sees what he wants to see, and tries to turn ordinary phrases into deep allusions, and even adjust the whole point of the poem. What else do literary analysts do? It's hilarious to see Kinbote bend, twist and mangle every little phrase to fit. After all, who hasn't heard that \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is about World War II or the atom bomb? Or listened to a professor pinning a mess of Freudian theory on poor Hamlet?<br /><br />The poem \\"Pale Fire\\" is the soul and core of this unorthodox novel. Perhaps only in A.S. Byatt's \\"Possession\\" does another poem so completely show the soul of a fictional character. Nabokov's poetry has the classic flavor of his prose. It's delicate and evocative without being overdescriptive. \\"I was the shadow of the waxwing slain/In the false azure of the windowpane\\" is among the loveliest excerpts, from the very beginning of the first canto.<br /><br />And Nabokov's narrative is both dizzying and madly brilliant. He takes us on a ride into Kinbote's very, very disturbed mind and makes the journey stranger as the book goes on. At the same time, he crafts this as a puzzle. Not a mystery, a puzzle.

Strictly speaking, Pale Fire is a poem of 999 lines, presented in four cantos. In a Foreword written by Charles Kinbote we are introduced to this form and given some details about Pale Fire's author, John Francis Shade. The majority of this volume is Dr. Kinbote's commentary, published after the conclusion of the poem.<br /><br />Kinbote, Shade, and others discussed in the Foreword and Commentary are, of course, inventions of the novel's author, Vladimir Nabokov. Some we meet for the first time, and others (such as Professor Timofey Pnin) we fondly remember from other works written by Nabokov.<br /><br />As a work of art, this work deserves the attention it receives. It is hugely ambitious and places some demands on the reader (as no doubt was true for its author!) but these demands are not senseless; the reader that endures will find the experience worthwhile.<br /><br />In reading through the text, I'm reminded of something Nabokov asserted in his classes on Literature: that there is no reading, there is only re-reading. Even if following Kinbote's recommendation to read the Commentary first, then to read the poem, there will still be quite a lot of read to re-read, to fix certain details more firmly in the mind understanding how they appear at various points throughout the poem and its commentary.<br /><br />Several themes emerge: one is a simple one, the personal life of John Shade, his relationship with Kinbote, his wife, and the broader University community. The larger theme is of Kinbote's native Zembla, the revolution that took place there and led to the flight of many. The similarities between Kinbote's Zembla and Nabokov's Russia are difficult not to notice when reading various details of the new government in power in Zembla, telling us such things as \\"the streak of stupidity that fatally runs through the most competent tyranny.\\"<br /><br />Pale Fire is a masterpiece, a novel whose original presentation beautifully conveys a suspenseful story of intrigue, comedy, tragedy--of timeless human truth.entation beautifully conveys a suspenseful story of intrigue, comedy, tragedy--of timeless human truth.	2006-06-08

There is a poem and the man who wrote it died, and there is a commentary to that poem written by a fellow professor at a local college. This Professor Kinbote is writing the commentary from his point of view which is rather obsucerd. Because of this, you don't know if what he tells you is true or not. By this, the reader has to come to his or her own conclusions of the stories that Kinbote tells us and the end scene. There has been much differing of beliefs between readers as to what actually happens in the novel. This element of the story makes it a must read. Another thing I noticed is that I, the reader, wasn't able to identify the plot in the beginning of the commentary section. But as stories go on and situations in the past unfold it becomes evident to the reader that all is not right in the mind of the storyteller.  <br /> <br />A must read for those who want to experience a great book that can open up the senses and observe details to the finest degree. Pale Fire is great.	2006-05-04

There's almost the feeling of euphoria like you yourself are the one responsible for  its greatness. <br />So, first things first: Is it better than Lolita? It's really pretty hard to compare the two, though it is much more engaging (literally) and out right funny than that book (if, ironically, less poetic, but that's the point, isn't it?). I never felt more certain that Nabokov really was the genius that your asthmatic literature professor professes him to be as when I finished this book.  <br />Mr. Vladimir here pulls the most amazing feat imaginable, in fact, he seemingly does the impossible: he successfully destroys whatever generic expectations and boundaries are inherent in a novel while simultaneously telling an amazing story. And he does with such ease that it almost makes one sick with giddiness. Its a book that completely enraptures and ensnares.  <br />Just a few things to consider however: firstly, don't read the Amazon review if you really find yourself wrapped up in the plot; it gives away much more than you would expect. For somehow, this novel told in the form of a commentary on a poem is gripping and compelling. But, if you do, don't worry, this is one of this handful of books where there is just as much pleasure in the words as in the plot. Secondly, and most practically, I would suggest not forgetting that, even if it is a novel, it is written as a commentary and its helpful to read it as such. I would recommend usinf two bookmarks, one for the poem itself and one for the commentary: it makes things much more enjoyable and even helps out with hiccups in the plot. Also, read it again to go back over it and notice all the little notes and jokes that are easily missed the first time through. It might be more work than your average novel, but trust me (and most of the other people on here) it is truly worth all the time and energy you give to it.	2005-12-01

The author's genius is portrayed with grandiosity in this work.  The reader can only marvel at the way in which Nabokov weaves this incredible tale.  In addition, the structure of the book is truly revealing and amazingly intricate. <br /> <br />In many ways, the book is symmetrical.  It has two distinct parts, which are nevertheless woven into one.  The book starts with a 1000 line poem.  The poem starts and ends with the same line.  It acts as a mirror, reflecting upon itself and the end is in fact the middle.  As does James Joyce in his book, \\"Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man\\" modeled on the famous portrait of the same name by Rembrandt, the book is a reflection of life and times.   <br /> <br />The protagonist is the neighbor of a great poet, John Shade.  The tale is a story of a murder, whose target is the protagonist, but whose victim is Shade.  The protagonist is Dr. Kinbote, a professor of literature at the \\"Wordsmith University.\\"  Yet again, this is only symbolic of the real `Word Smith' Nabokov.  Kinbote is in fact the King of an imaginary country, or was so, until the revolution of 1958.  At that time, it became a portion of the new Soviet Union, yet the revolution is such as to mimic the Russian Revolution itself, the Communist revolution.   <br /> <br />The book is rife with references to the Soviet Union, to the decadence portrayed in so many ways, but especially with numerous references to homosexuality, particularly pederasty.  Within the book, nothing really is as it seems, all is symbolic for something else.  And all is in fact various `shades of gray.'  The murderer is named Gradus, but is often called by the English Mr. Gray.  Mr. Gray is a member of that secret society, shielded by shadows, likened to the precursor of the KGB, which exterminated those who were not of its ilk.  Gradus comes to the United States to seek out the escaped King of Zembla, the imaginary country absorbed by the Soviet Union.  And the King is played by Dr. Kinbote, who is hiding in the Appalachians teaching literature to college students. <br /> <br />In the end, Gradus does succeed in committing a murder, but not the one he was assigned to complete.  By a variety of strokes of luck, the King is spared, but not John Shade, the poet and author of the poem on which the book is based.  Thus, the book illustrates clearly all the `Shades of Gray' that reflect ordinary and extraordinary life.  The book captures the fancy of the reader and takes it where it wants.  The novel is highly recommended for those who are well grounded in literature.  The allusions are plentiful and replete.  The character of the book is nothing less than the most extraordinary modern literature.  The reader will be entranced in the absorption of what Nabokov has to say and will be gratified upon completion as the reader sees just how life can mirror all and symbols can mirror life. <br />	2005-11-06

Regarding \\"Pale Fire\\": <br /> <br />A narrator, Charles Kinbote, who may or may not be a deposed king in hiding, proffers the reader an elliptical, line-by line commentary to an extraordinary 999 line poem, the centerpiece of the novel and itself entitled \\"Pale Fire\\", said to be authored by another character, the otherwise taciturn John Shade. Kinbote's lengthy commentary (he urges the reader to buy two copies of the book so that he may more easily refer to the poem while reading the annotations) concerns little of the actual poem but focuses instead upon an exotic northern nation, Zembla, and an evolving revolutionary conspiracy, both of which may or may not be anything more than the elaborate imaginings of his deranged mind. Meanwhile, almost disguised amongst a great variety of fantastical and artistic wanderings, one stumbles across the numerical and emotional centerpiece of the poem. These lines concern Shade's overweight teenage daughter who, rejected by a blind date, decides to go ice-walking and plunges forever into the freezing black depths of Lake Omega. Just after finishing his poem (which Kinbote fervently strains to interpret as Zemblan-inspired, but is more apparently an exquisitely prolonged biographical musing on the nature of life and death) Shade is murdered by a man who is either Gradus, an assassin attempting an ill-aimed regicide upon Kinbote, or an anonymous lunatic exacting revenge upon a judge, mistakenly thought to be Shade, who had sentenced him to a facility for the criminally insane.  <br /> <br />Finally, in the last paragraphs, with this intricate narrative edifice on the verge of total collapse, Nabokov brutally rips down the literary proscenium, abruptly revealing his labyrinthine construct as the product of a \\"healthy, heterosexual, Russian professor\\" who muses upon his next move before signing off for good, but not before supplying us with an annotated Index.  <br /> <br />The first lines of the poem read thusly:  <br /> <br />\\"I was the shadow of the waxwing slain <br />By the false azure in the windowpane;  <br />I was the smudge of ashen fluff--and I <br />Lived on, flew on, in the reflected sky.  <br />And from the inside, too, I'd duplicate <br />Myself, my lamp, an apple on a plate:  <br />Uncurtaining the night, I'd let dark glass <br />Hang all the furniture above the grass,  <br />And how delightful when a fall of snow <br />Covered my glimpse of lawn and reached up so <br />As to make chair and bed exactly stand <br />Upon that snow, out in that crystal land!\\"  <br /> <br />Fascinating in and of itself, it is equally absorbing to speculate upon the numerous ripples of post-modernist thought Pale Fire might have generated within intellectual circles of the early sixties. For example, is it possible that Nabokov had an impact upon the visual arts? The sculptor Robert Smithson published a short piece entitled \\"The Crystal Land\\" in \\"Harper's Bazaar\\" in 1966. From another Smithson piece, written about the same time, comes the following excerpt: <br /> <br />\\"Each framework supports the reflections of a concatenated interior. The interior structure of the room surrounding the work is instantaneously undermined. The surfaces seem thrown back into the wall. \\"Space\\" is permuted into a multiplicity of directions. One becomes conscious of space attenuated in the form of elusive flat planes. The space is both crystalline and collapsible. In the rose piece the floor hovers over the ceiling. Vanishing points are deliberately inverted in order to increase one's awareness of total artifice.\\" <br /> <br />Nabokov: The exquisite pleasures of the quadruple bank shot within a quadruple bank shot. The haunting impossibility of a single frame of reference, and the death of direct experience. But what a gorgeous thing he creates in their stead.   <br />	2005-03-04
US	49577356	R1UKIWKBC6PAC7	0679723420	755867934	Pale Fire	Books	5	7	9	N	N	First impressions: a personal review	Vladimir Nabokov has always been one of my favorite writers. I've read \\"Lolita\\" twice and think I'm not quite finished yet with this book. Since I like his writing and ideas so much, I thought I should try his \\"Pale Fire\\", a book that has been highly recommended to me by many people, and that looks difficult and challenging enough for me devote my time. It turns out these impressions weren't wrong.<br /><br />\\"Pale Fire\\" is brilliant, certainly one of the best books ever written in English. It is difficult. Nabokov's language, approach and style are labored enough to drive any experienced reader insane. And, despite the fact that I can't say I totally understood the book, I'm willing to tell that I loved it. Why? Because every word sounds brilliant and placed in the right place where it is supposed to be. Because his style and structure were demanding, and as a reader this is what we should look for: something different from the usual, something that would challenge our minds.<br /><br />The writer toyed with the idea of hypertext much before it was a trend. Compound of a poem and its comments, reading \\"Pale Fire\\" makes the reader goes back and forth to follow the poem and its interpretation. But, this is not the only hypertext structure, in the comments, every time the writer mentions another line etc.<br /><br />However strange it may sound, \\"Pale Fire\\" still has a plot. Actually many plots -- like any good many-layered book. One of the plots deal with the \\"Pale Fire\\" poem writer and his relationship with his neighbor, who happens to be the writer who is annotating the poem.

Not only that, he also feels no shame in making that abundantly obvious with every sentence that he writes.  Reading Pale Fire is the literary equivalent of turning around in circles until you get so dizzy that you fall over, punch drunk and hysterical.  You feel sick and disorientated, but you also get the sense that the process was somehow fun and - dare I say - worth it.<br />Whether you like this book or not - and personally, I can't say that I loved it - it is hard to deny what an amazing achievement it is.  Nabokov first writes a 999-line poem - the equivalent of T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land, in length if not in quality.  He then writes a foreword to the poem, and a line-by-line commentary, as if the poem were written by someone else.  And by means of the commentary he weaves an imaginative, suspenseful adventure that is so obviously fictitious that it immediately becomes real.  There's no denying that this is brilliantly creative and original writing.	2004-06-17

Pale Fire -- Vladimir Nabokov<br />It is arguable, and debatable, whether this title or Lolita is Nabokov's masterpiece, but what is certain is that Pale Fire is once of the tightest, best-structured books of the 20th century.<br />Pale Fire is laid out in three parts: a Foreward written by Charles Kinbote, a Poem written by John Shade, and Commentary, also written by Kinbote.<br />What is prefigured in the Foreword and then made explicit in the Commentary is Kinbote's strange relationship with Shade and his equally strange past. The story is told completely through the device of the Foreword and Commentary, and in them Kinbote paints himself as a refugee from a despotic regime in a faraway land known only as Zembla. He takes up residence in New Wye, right across the street from professor and poet John Shade.<br />Once settled in New Wye, Kinbote embarks on an obsessive, mutedly homoerotic relationship with his poet neighbor, courting him when they are together and spying on him the rest of the time. Although Kinbote has fled his native Zembla, he dearly loves his homeland with the pain of one who knows he can never return to the land he has forsaken, and it is his dream that Shade will immortalize Zembla in a poem.<br />But just as Kinbote reaches for Zembla, so does Zembla reach for Kinbote. In the Commentary Kinbote brings forth a character called Gradus, who is an assassin sent from Zembla to search him out and kill him.<br />If the Foreword and Commentary tell the story of Kinbote, then the Poem tells the story of Shade. In only 999 lines, Shade paints a vivid picture of his past, taking us through his idyllic life in New Wye, its sudden destruction one night by death of his daughter, and his subsequent coping. In more ways than one it is the ideal complement to Kinbote's text, providing a clear, beautiful counterpart to Kinbote's unsteady rants and digressions.<br />However, what takes this book from mere postmodern game and transforms it to a dynamic, engrossing title is Kinbote's unreliability as a narrator and the questions surrounding who the real author of the Poem, Foreword, and Commentary is. Does Zembla really exist and has Kinbote really fled it? Is Gradus's climatic appearance the result of a government plot against Kinbote, or just another of the strange coincidences that pervade Pale Fire? Finally, is Shade's poem really Shade's, or has Kinbote written it for his own purposes? Vice versa, is Kinbote the real creative force behind the Foreword and Commentary, or is it the work of some different, other-worldly presence?<br />Nabokov masterfully spreads the information needed to answer these questions throughout Pale Fire, yet he does so in such a way that nothing is ever made completely explicit. Just as in all of Nabokov's best books, it is up to the reader to make that final conceptual leap, to take that final step after being carried along by Nabokov's poetic narrative.<br />Thus, Pale Fire is not a book that should be read only once, or quickly. It is a book that hides hints in the strangest of places (more than a couple appear in the Index), and one which cannot be completely understood the first time through. That is not to say that the first reading will not be satisfying, as Nabokov does give us a suspenseful, well-drawn narrative, but that as the reader peers back into Pale Fire she will see the book growing deeper and deeper as new items begin to pop up, like stars in the sky as evening fades to night.	2004-06-08

Experimental novel &quot;Pale Fire&quot; is a strange, haunting, magical experience, and as different from most novels as it can get. Like a textured surrealist painting, that is hard to take in on only one reading, let alone describe to someone who's never read it.<br />&quot;Pale Fire&quot; is a poem, 999 lines and divided into four cantos, written by poet John Shade. It's moving, vibrant and breathtaking. And it's posthumously annotated by scholar (and head case) Charles Kinbote, supposedly from the fictional Zembla (don't ask). In the &quot;backwoods,&quot; Kinbote overdissects and reexamines the strange poem. Increasingly he is drawn into the web of words, stuck on the poem and believing it to be about him.<br />A strain of subtle, dark humor runs through &quot;Pale Fire.&quot; Not funny-ha-ha humor, but one that only becomes apparent if you study it. In a nutshell, the humor here pokes at critics who read what they want to see into literature. Everyone has seen a passage or a line that strikes them to the soul. The entirety of &quot;Pale Fire&quot; does this to Kinbote, and his obsession with making it about himself is weirdly hypnotic.<br />Most unique (and funny) is the sort of analysis that Kinbote does of &quot;Pale Fire.&quot; It's overblown, unlikely, and tailored to his delusions. He sees what he wants to see, and tries to turn ordinary phrases into deep allusions, and even adjust the whole point of the poem. What else do literary analysts do? It's hilarious to see Kinbote bend, twist and mangle every little phrase to fit. After all, who hasn't heard that &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is about World War II or the atom bomb? Or listened to a professor pinning a mess of Freudian theory on poor Hamlet?<br />The poem &quot;Pale Fire&quot; is the soul and core of this unorthodox novel. Perhaps only in A.S. Byatt's &quot;Possession&quot; does another poem so completely show the soul of a fictional character. Nabokov's poetry has the classic flavor of his prose. It's delicate and evocative without being overdescriptive. &quot;I was the shadow of the waxwing slain/In the false azure of the windowpane&quot; is among the loveliest excerpts, from the very beginning of the first canto.<br />And Nabokov's narrative is both dizzying and madly brilliant. He takes us on a ride into Kinbote's very, very disturbed mind and makes the journey stranger as the book goes on. At the same time, he crafts this as a puzzle. Not a mystery, a puzzle.

Let's put things straight from the start: this is a weird novel, practically a genre unto itself. It consists of a long poem (&quot;pale fire&quot;) supposedly written by a fictional american poet (John Shade) and the subsequent notes/commentary, written by an equally fictional character: Charles Kinbote, a man who claims to be a scholar from the country (fictional again) of Zembla. Now, far from being a reliable annotator, Kinbote bends every word of the poem (hilariously so because it's far too evident) so as to mantain that Shade's autobiographical poem is in fact about the story of Zembla (and Kinbote's personal tragedy).<br />This was intended as a satire against critics who, in Nabokov's opinion, tend to see in other people poems meanings and hints that are not really there.<br />While the concept immediately got my attention, I feared that it might be marred by boring execution.

One of his fellow professors at Wordsmith University, Dr. Charles Kinbote, is given the poem in rough draft form by Shade just minutes before his death and decides to publish it.<br />What follows is the story of the poem, but told in a unique fashion.  The foreward and commentary to the poem are told by Dr. Kinbote, who idolizes Shade.  He's a bit disappointed, though, because he was trying to direct Shade's thoughts, to have him write about his homeland of Zembla; instead, Shade took the poem in a different direction.  Kinbote's commentary is filled with his attempts to sway Shade with stories of King Charles II of Zembla's exile, of his preference for young men, his own interpretations of what Shade must have been thinking when writing the lines, and as the reader soon discovers, Kinbote's own secret truth about King Charles.<br />It's an interesting study into idol-worship (Kinbote's for Shade) and has some political intrigue thrown in to make it interesting and told in a unique way.	2003-12-22

The body of the book is the `commentary' on the poem, written by Charles Kinbote, a man who is so obsessed with the poet John Shade, that he moves in next door. Even a fictional `editor' provides an explanation in the forward of this book about the poem. Of course, this is all Nabokov's invention, as he uses these `non-fictional' formal devices to elaborate the depth of this intricate masterpiece.<br />Each `segment' varies in length from one sentence to thirty pages, as Kinbote, the narrator, is convinced that the poem was written for him, and uncovers a strange fictional world known as Zembla (yes, a fiction within a fiction veiled as an editorial commentary- bravo Nabokov) that reads like a myth, in which King Charles is being pursued by Gradus through intra-dimensions. Slowly readers are led to suspect that Kinbote is insane, and that King Charles is really Kinbote's alter ego. When assassin Gradus enters the `reality' of Kinbote and Shade, havoc erupts. Only Shade's wife is onto Kinbote, providing some of the funniest moments in this book. As if this isn't enough, the poem itself is another `story'-that of Shade's drowned daughter, hauntingly and beautifully written.<br />This novel deconstructs reader's traditional orientation with `fictional reality', to a level where everything is simply in the mind of some arbitrary entity- be it the author, narrator, commenter, or reader. Just about the time when readers begin asking themselves in this literary chaos how the poem was even `published', they will discover exactly who all these faces really are.	2003-12-05

Once upon a time, a judge named Goldsworth who lived in the college town of New Wye, Appalachia, sent a homicidal maniac named Jack Grey to an Institute for the Criminal Insane.  But Grey escaped, and set out to find Judge Goldsworth and take revenge on him.  <br />When Grey arrived in New Wye, Goldsworth was away on sabbatical.  Unfortunately, Goldsworth's nextdoor neighbor, a famous poet named John Shade, resembled Judge Goldsworth a bit.  At the very moment Jack Grey arrived at the Goldsworth house, Shade was on his way there.  Thinking Shade was the judge, Grey opened fire on the unfortunate poet, killing him instantly with a bullet through the heart.<br />The reason Shade was at Goldsworth's house was that the man who was temporarily renting it while the judge was away, a Russian emigre named Vseslav Botkin, had lured him there with promises of liquor.  (Shade was on the wagon, or at least trying.)  <br />Now this Vseslav Botkin was insane.  After leading a dismal life of pederasty and persecution he had retreated into a desperate fantasy in which he imagined himself to be Charles the Beloved, last king of the kingdom of Zembla.  In Botkin's paraniod world, the extremists had taken over Zembla and King Charles was forced to flee to America, where he changed his name to Charles Kinbote and found a teaching job at Wordsmith University, in New Wye.  Botkin believed that Grey was actually an incompetent assassin sent by the extremists to murder King Charles (i.e., him), but who murdered John Shade by accident.<br />The fantasies of this lunatic might be of little interest to the rest of the world, except for one thing.  Botkin had been confiding his Zembla fantasies to John Shade in the hope that Shade would bring them to life in an epic poem.  And in fact, Shade had been hinting to Botkin that he was writing a long poem, which Botkin crazily assumed would be his Zembla poem.  On that fateful afternoon, Botkin had induced Shade to bring the almost-finished manuscript of the poem to Goldsworth's house, where Botkin (as he believed) would finally see his Zembla come to life.<br />When the police had left and Botkin was alone at last with &quot;his&quot; poem, he was horrified to find that it had nothing at all to do with Zembla.  It was an autobiographical poem addressed to the poet's beloved wife, whom Botkin despised, as he despised all women.  The poem was very personal, containing many intimate details of the poet's marriage.  It is doubtful, in fact, whether Shade ever meant to publish it.<br />Undeterred, Botkin absconded with the manuscript to a motel room in a mountain town in the far west where he proceeded to write a long series of notes to the poem in which, taking off from a phrase here and a word there in Shade's poem, he detailed his &quot;Zembla&quot; fantasy.  He even managed to find an unscrupulous publisher.  <br />The resulting book -- Shade's poem &quot;Pale Fire&quot; together with Botkin's preface, table of contents, notes and index -- comprise the novel _Pale Fire_, by Vladimir Nabokov.  It is an artifact of the fictional world of Nabokov's novel, created by two of Nabokov's characters, that has somehow escaped from the fictional world into our &quot;real&quot; world.  With the possible exception of a copy of _Alice in Wonderland_ autographed by Alice Liddell herself that I once held in my hands, it is the strangest book I have ever seen in my life.  <br />It is also filled with puzzles and paradoxes.  From something as simple as the location of New Wye (somewhere in the hills of western Virgnia, judging from the butterflies that fly there), to whether the kingdom of Zembla actually exists in the fictional world of the novel (apparently not -- only where did that little Zemblan translation of Timon of Athens come from?), to the identity and motives of Shade's murderer, nothing in _Pale Fire_ is easy or obvious.  Things get so complicated, in fact, that you start to wonder if maybe Nabokov didn't outsmarthimself in this one.  I still don't know.  I do know that _Pale Fire_ is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it gets.	2003-11-04

I recently picked it up again, and noted two new aspects of interest.<br />First, the nutty Kinbote interpreting Shade's poem as \\"really\\" all about Zembla, or, more particularly, as all about the assassin Gradus!  The poet Shade was totally unaware of Gradus and makes no reference to Zembla at all.<br />But does this pattern of behavior remind you of anyone?<br />It sure reminds me of a professor of mine, who spent weeks lecturing us on \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" as the summit of Christian symbolism!  (Any extended experience of Shakespeare will convince you that Santayana was right, in noting Shakespeare's rather abnormal ABSENCE of religion.)  Or another professor who dissects Hamlet in terms of his Freudian theories.  Or present-day \\"deconstructionists\\" whomping on Homer in terms of their deconstructionist theories.  In all cases, these academics with an axe to grind manage to overlook the actual work of art completely, while bending it to fit the Procrustean bed of their theories.  No better parody of this tendency exists than Charles Kimbote's loony \\"commentary\\" on the poem \\"Pale Fire.\\"<br />If you want to see how to do literary criticism right, take a look at Nabokov's \\"Lectures on Literature\\" or his \\"Lectures on Russian Literature.\\"<br />Second: a remarkable number of similarities between Kinbote and Nabokov.  Kinbote is the exiled king of Zembla, Nabokov was a nobleman exiled from Tsarist Russia.  Kinbote's colleagues know nothing of Zembla, and Nabokov's colleagues were astonishingly ignorant of Russia.  Zembla was taken over by Extremist revolutionaries, Russia was taken over by Communist revolutionaries.  The assassin \\"Gradus\\" -- sent to assassinate Kinbote -- may seem melodramatic until you realize that Nabokov's father was in fact murdered by two Communist thugs, in Berlin.  The Communists actually sent executioners after Nabokov's father, and they shot him dead when Nabokov was just 23.  Needless to say, this was a critical point in Nabokov's life.	2003-08-02

John Updike was spot on decades ago, describing Nabokov as the grandmaster of English prose.  The story in Pale Fire, no linear tale, is told by Charles Kinbote during the course of a commentary on the poem of a renown writer, \\"close friend\\" and next door neighbor,  John Shade.  Shade's poem, Kinbote's commentary assures us, is about Kinbote's beloved Zembla, something of a fictional asylum posing as a nation-state.  Kinbote is residing in the United States while Shade is composing the 999 lines of the four cantos of Pale Fire.  On the faculty of Wordsmith College, and living at least physically proximate to Shade, Kinbote cherishes every encounter with the master poet, convinced that he, Kinbote, is implanting the grand design of what would become Pale Fire.  There is just no substitute for letting Nabokov speak for himself. Almost any page will do:  \\"The Goldworth chateau (the home at which he was staying) had many outside doors, and no matter how thoroughly I inspected them and the window shutters downstairs at bedtime, I never failed to discover next morning something sly and suspicious-looking.  One night a black cat, which a few minutes before I had seen rippling down into the basement where I had arranged toilet facilities for it in an attractive setting, suddenly reappeared on the  threshold of the music room, in the middle of my insomnia and a Wagner record, arching its back and sporting a neck bow of which silk which it could certainly never have put on all by itself.  I telephoned 11111 and a few minutes later was discussing possible culprits with a policeman...It is too easy for a cruel person to make the victim of his ingenuity believe that he has persecution mania, or is really being stalked by a killer...\\"  The perfect touch. Freud acknowledged that even paranoids can have real enemies.  Nabokov's Kinbote fits the bill. Kinbote finds conspiracies in every event, meaning in each line. And that is surely one ofthe lessons of this masterpiece:   No line is without meaning because, as Nabokov shows, we are so very good as instilling meaning in every line, finding a design in every image.	2003-06-21

Don't read the other reviews, don't read the jacket cover - if you do, you lose the sense of discovery inherent in this book.  See, Nabokov is a nut, and it takes a good 100 pages before you even realize this thing is a novel, who the characters are, and where it's going.  And when you do, the jokes get funnier, and you want to go back to read the first half again.  This is great later Nabokov.	2003-04-22

I've spoken briefly in this space about one of them, Mike Godwin, now a staff counsel for the Electronic Freedom Foundation and WELL gadfly. The other was Kathy Strong, who was married to Mike for a while. I briefly shared an apartment with Kathy, and I can easily recall the books lying around the house. It was she (along with Dwight Brown) who piqued my interest in Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe novels. But it is the other books--on tables, chairs, bookshelves, and stairs--that I'm thinking of now, books by Robertson Davies, Italo Calvino, and Vladimir Nabokov. I think back on this and wonder why is it only now that I am reading these books when they were clearly being recommended to me by someone whose tastes in literature I admired. I cannot remember, but did I try these books at that time and was not mature enough a reader to grasp their worth? Were there other authors about that I should remember today?<br />The occasion for these reminiscences is having just finished Nabokov's Pale Fire, which I can only describe as &quot;my kind of book.&quot; It is not a novel, although by the end you have pieced together a larger story that would not have been out of place in a novel. Nor is it poem, critical work, or index, although it contains all three of these elements. I guess if one must label it, it is &quot;experimental&quot; fiction.<br />Although the form is most unusual and does hold all appeal for me, the true pull of this work is the character of the narrator, a rogue and totally questionable source of information. His poor victims, the long-suffering poet, John Shade, and Shade's wife Sylvia, one must feel kindly towards, especially knowing the intensity of the dedicated fan.<br />I refrain from talking too much about the actual plot, although it is not necessarily a mystery. Instead I hasten to compare this work with Borges in that the creation of a European kingdom recalls his &quot;Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius.&quot; It also reminds me of that nation that Nero Wolfe is supposed to be from (or was that an actual kingdom? I never checked to see.)<br />This was my first go at Nabokov, and I suppose by my reaction to it, I should not stay too long from his other work. What shall it be: Ada? Lolita?

I'm sure the plot (so to speak) has been summarized many times, so I'll let that sit, but what I think is most noteworthy about this novel is its format. Nabakov has separated himself from straightforward plot, yet through the &quot;footnotes&quot; to the poem Pale Fire, we still get a complete picture of two men's lives. Pale Fire is something like the bridge between the internal investigations of Virgnia Woolf and the literary technique of the more recent post-moderns, and yet has all the signature Nabokov touches--brilliant wordplay, fascinatingly sad characters, and unapproachable beauty.<br />I would certainly recommend this novel simply for the joy of reading it, but it has value beyond the amazing abilities of the author, and that value is the insight on the human mind in modern times and how we all have come to work internally. This is truly high literature and art and I will be surprised if it doesn't become a world classic.	2003-01-24

The humor is most apparent in Kinbote's foolish efforts to spy on the poet and English literature professor John Shade and his wife and in the evil Gradus' various inept attempts at assassination.       Charles Kinbote wrote the forward, commentary, and index to the novel.  Each of these three parts is related by Kinbote in a first person narrative form.  The centerpiece of the novel is a 999 line epic poem called _Pale Fire_, which was written by the late John Shade shortly before he died. Kinbote is a colleague of Shade's at Wordsmith College and also a self-styled \\"friend\\" of Shade's. Kinbote relates that at the time when Sybil, Shade's wife, very recently became a widow, he wrangles her into agreeing to sign a contract to give Kinbote the right to publish Shade's opus.  Kinbote is extremely egocentric: in his evening walks and conversations with Shade he strongly urges Shade, in his poem, to tell about the northern European kingdom of Zembla, from which Kinbote emigrated to the United State years ago.    The poem _Pale Fire_ ,itself, is wistful, very romantic and beautifully written.  It is about John Shade's life long love affair with his wife and about the tragic death of their daughter.  Shade also muses about the possibility of an after-life.  The poem brought tears to my eyes. But, in Kinbote's commentary and to his great chagrin, Shade only mentions Zembla once in his poem.      While reading Nabokov's novel and also afterwards, I could not help compare the character Kinbote to the narrator of Dostoyevsky's _Notes From Underground_.  Dostoyevsky's great novel was done as a stream of consciousness in its first part and as a first person narrative in its second part.  However, it is clear in _Notes_ that the narrator is a severely neurotic and disturbed man.  Nabokov leads us to believe the same of Kinbote, but I am not quite so sure of that.  Kinbote's egotism and efforts to steal Shade's poem are plain.  But is Kinbote's story of Zembla a crazy man's hallucinations (as we are lead to believe) or is he relating actual events of a real country in which a series of monarchs were assassinated and in which the last king, the Beloved Charles, may become the latest victim?  Also, who is Charles Kinbote?  These are some of the questions I asked myself while reading Nabokov's puzzling, but fascinating, book.	2001-05-04

Although the novel consists of only the poem and the commentary, rest assured there is a plot, but its development is quite unconventional.<br />The poet is a reclusive college professor named John Shade, and his colleague is another professor named Charles Kinbote, who comes from a fictitious northern European country called Zembla.  Kinbote, long an admirer of Shade's work, had rented a house adjacent to Shade's five months prior to Shade's death.  Kinbote has a voyeuristic obsession with Shade, spying on his house with binoculars and prying into his work.  Convinced that he and Shade had some kind of exclusive rapport during Shade's final months, Kinbote believes that much of the text of &quot;Pale Fire&quot; refers to information he had disclosed to Shade about recent political events in Zembla, when it is obvious that Shade's poem is strictly personal, expounding on important times in his life: his childhood, his courtship with his wife, the death of his daughter, his heart attack.  <br />The &quot;narration&quot; of the novel takes place a few months after Shade's death, with Kinbote living in a motel room disturbed by noisy neighbors and writing his commentary about the poem.  His commentary tends to go off on comical tangents about the political intrigue in Zembla.  We learn that the last King of Zembla was imprisoned in his palace during a quasi-Bolshevik Revolution but managed to escape via a secret passage and travel incognito to America, where he was given a new identity.  After the escape, the King was stalked by a heavily aliased assassin who resourcefully discovered his quarry's whereabouts, resulting ina confrontation whose outcome did not go exactly as planned.  <br />The plot construction is diabolically clever in the way Nabokov reveals information little by little throughout Kinbote's commentary; you may have to read the book twice to see which details you missed the first time, but Nabokov's prose is so colorful and ebullient that doing so is a pleasure.  Even more interesting is the doubt established by Nabokov as to whether Kinbote's revelations are reality or delusions; his sanity is questionable.  Every now and then I come across a book that's so wildly creative and so much fun that it reminds me why I love to read -- &quot;Pale Fire&quot; is easily one of those books.	2001-03-30

It contains a long poem by &quot;John Shade&quot; &amp; then 200+ pages of commentary on the poem by &quot;Charles Kinbote&quot;.  Kinbote emerges as a complete lunatic over the course of his commentary, reading meanings into Shade's work that are obviously unsupportable.<br />Nabokov, thus, shows that critics bring such a subjective perspective to the works they critique, that they can hardly be considered an appropriate prism through which to view the original work.  I heartily agree with the point, but it becomes somewhat labored when stretched to this length.<br />GRADE: B	2000-10-31
US	50718004	R985XAXCTBVJ4	0679723420	755867934	Pale Fire	Books	5	185	193	N	N	Nabokov's Tour de Force	Pale Fire is the name of a 999-line poem in four cantos by the &quot;distinguished American poet&quot; John Shade, published posthumously in a lovingly prepared edition with a foreword and detailed commentary by the Zemblan literary scholar Charles Kinbote.  Pale Fire is also the name of the novel by Vladimir Nabokov in which the poem is written by Shade and annotated by Kinbote, who are Nabokov's creations.  The novel is actually written in the form of poem and scholarly apparatus, not omitting a thorough index.  It is a perfect and perfectly original union of form and meaning.  It is also wickedly, outrageously funny. <br />The poem itself is a complicated, beautiful, mysterious achievement.  It reveals the character of John Shade so completely and movingly that we have to keep reminding ourselves that it was actually written by Nabokov, himself.  The poem is the heart of the novel, literally and figuratively, although the commentary no doubt constitutes the most interesting reading.  Pale Fire is Shade's final work; possibly his greatest work.  It is the product of every thought and experience in a long, thoughtful life, and it also contains that entire life:  childhood, adolescence, marriage, fatherhood, old age and death.  The title refers to the &quot;pale fire of time,&quot; and is taken from a poem by Yeats and not from Shakespeare, as Kinbote confidently suggests.  Or is Nabokov simply leading us on a merry chase?  Better check Timon of Athens to be sure.<br />And Kinbote is frequently wrong in his confident suggestions in the commentary.  He identifies allusions where none exist; fails to recognize those that are actually there (he is writing his notes in a remote cabin in the Rockies and complains that he has no books to check his references), and suggests interpretations which are clearly, hilariously, wrong.  The hapless Dr. Kinbote has got it into his head that Pale Fire (the poem) is really about himself, and his commentary is an audacious attempt todemonstrate this. <br />So, almost ignoring what is actually present in the poem, he proceeds through the commentary to give a detailed history of his own life and times, often revealing far more than he really means to do.  And it turns out to be quite a good story, because Kinbote, a native of the remote northern European country of Zembla, has had quite an adventurous past.  It is only a pity that it is quite irrelevant to Shade's poem.  Kinbote just happens to be a man who doesn't do anything by halves; even the most innocuous phrase of the poem is &quot;demonstrated&quot; to be a cryptic reference to some event in Kinbote's life.  Pale Fire is nothing if it is not great fun. <br />But Pale Fire is not merely amusing and inventive.  Kinbote's commentary seems to be everything literary criticism should not be; but it is actually only an extreme, exaggerated version of what literary criticism truly is.  Kinbote attempts to rewrite Shade's poem in his own image and likeness, but this is true to a greater or lesser extent--or a more or less subtle extent--of every critic, amateur or professional. <br />Pale Fire is thus a complex, and ultimately rather touching, demonstration of the way people have of reading their lives into books and reading books into their lives, like Kinbote.  (And also, the way we have of writing our lives into books and writing books into our lives, like Shade.)  It is an affirmation of the power of literature, of the power of books to help us make sense of our lives, and of the impossibility of distinguishing precisely where art ends and life begins.  To quote John Shade: <br />          I feel I understand/            Existence, or at least a minute part/            Of my existence, only through my art,/            In terms of combinational delight;/            And if my private universe scans right,/            So does the verse of galaxies divine/            Which I suspect is an iambic line.<br />Almost every reader can remember that oneparticular novel, poem or play that seemed to have been written for him and him alone.  The one the reader took so personally, it changed his entire outlook on life and which even now he cannot discuss rationally or impartially.  Every passionate reader knows of just such a book or even books.  So, perhaps we should spare one or two sympathetic thoughts for the poor, but smitten, Dr. Kinbote even as we laugh uproariously at his well-intentioned mistakes.	2000-10-02

Nabokov, that Grand Master, has constructed an elaborate puzzle here.  <br />Chess as a metaphor for life itself. Black and white: black letters on a white page, moieties, the two players that mirror each other like lovers caught up in an almost infinite game of possibilities and permutations, the two parts of the text itself and the syzygy of sun and moon.<br />But as one reads and rereads the novel, immersing oneself in the substance of the text one realizes that at heart Pale Fire is about the transmutation of grey.  The grey of shades, shadows, indeterminate hues (hazel!), fumbled moves, grades and degrees, obfuscation and hesitation is gloriously transformed into the texture of life itself.<br />And as the game begins and the players cross the invisible line of the mirror and make incursions into foreign territory or surround each others pieces in ever-changing arabesques, the two-dimensional black/white grid morphs into a three-dimensional matrix with interstitial spaces and other facets reclaiming their position in the light. Gray is now about resonance and reflection, refraction and submersion, give and take.  Text is now enmeshed in texture, the syzygy of sun and moon is now immersed in the waters of the ocean.	2000-09-24

But having just started it again for the, oh, fifth or sixth time, I confess that knowing Kinbote's quirks and secrets as well as I do, his goofy selfishness and insensitivity are truly hilarious.  (e.g.: I love the way that, in the Foreword, he can't mention his car without prefixing it with the defensive epithet &quot;powerful&quot; - perhaps VN was hinting here at a cod-Freudian relationship, Kinbote unconsciously imagining car as phallic substitute, I won't go on, but you get the idea.)  <br />Having also just reread Brian Boyd's mighty biography of Nabokov, I'm very attracted to the idea that Kinbote is Shade's invention.  It does make the book tie up with fantastic neatness - although it also takes a lot of the impact out of Shade's senseless death.  If Shade didn't really die, then the book isn't as subversively moving as it might have been - although, now that I think about it, it's moving in a rather more realistic and complicated way; damn these biographers and their privileged insight!<br />&quot;Pale Fire&quot; is both puzzle and lyric.  It zigzags wildly around the heavens while keeping its focus firmly on that frozen swamp in which Hazel Shade disappears.  Most of Nabokov's imitators copy the verbal exuberance, but fail to appreciate the beating heart.  His best books throbwith life as much as they crackle with wit and intelligence, and a book as clever and as lively as &quot;Pale Fire&quot; almost makes me want to forgive the author for condoning the bombing of North Vietnam.  Not quite, mind you.  There are limits.	2000-09-22

It presents facts and the  testimony of a deranged man, and allows the reader to do the detective  work. The task presented the reader is daunting as the plots, subplots, and  character sketches twist in ever tightening involutions, levels of  complexity stacking one on top of another. Nabokov is kind though. Ever  conscious of the novel as entertainment he allows the proccess to be fun.  He gives away many of the mysteries in ways that lead the reader to believe  that he or she has made the discovery. He also leaves some that are so  complicated that it would take multiple rereads (or a good companion  reader) to make the discoveries. This book is without a doubt my favorite  of Nabokov's works, and there are few that I would not recommend it to. My  only warning is that you will get out of this book exactly what you put in  it. If you read straight through and put it down, you will only scratch the  suface of what this novel offers and intends. Though even this will eb an  enjoyable experience. The more time you invest and the more you  investigate, the richer the experiece will be, and in my opinion, the more  fun you will have.

Even fewer provide such enormous  rewards, especially if said reader brings an open mind and a serious  attention to detail.  What kind of book, exactly, is &quot;Pale Fire&quot;,  anyway?  A longish poem with annotation and index?  A wildly experimental  novel that flaunts every convention for the sake of innovation?  An elegiac  reflection on days gone by or a wickedly comedic parody of scholarship and  the artistic urge?  It is all those things and more, a watershed in  English-language literature, the apotheosis of Nabokov's craft as writer  and satirist.  For the record, the crazed, domineering Prof. Kinbote  (mastermind or madman?  You decide) is rivaled only by Humbert Humbert when  it comes to delusional, obssessive narrators--talk about unreliable, not to  mention fascinating beyond belief.  What are we to make of his claim to be  the exiled King of Zembla? Where, if not only in his over-ripe imagination,  is Zembla and what, if anything, does this country have to do with the poet  Shade and his dead daughter?  There is the question of the hired assasin  &quot;Jakob Gradus&quot;, too, though, like Zembla, Gradus might or might  not be anything more that an invention of Kinbote's (if Kinbote himself is  actually Kinbote and not an imposter claiming to be a man who might be an  imposter as well...you can see where this is going, can't you?)  &quot;Pale  Fire&quot; is a puzzle, one that makes strenuous demands upon the reader,  one that cannot be read straight-through (there are page references in the  annotation, after all--you'd do well to pay attention to them) or merely  &quot;skimmed&quot;.  If you have the patience to immerse yourself in  Nabokov/Kinbote's topsy-turvy world of intrigue, artistry and (perhaps?)  the supernatural, you are in for a bracing read.  There's no other book out  there like &quot;Pale Fire&quot;, it could only have come from the  brilliant mind of Nabokov and it is splendid, indeed.  A word to the wise:   Read the book ALL THE WAY to the very end.  What might seem like peripheral  information is actually critical if you intend to crack the novel's  deviously intricate code.	2000-08-08

The story unfolds in an introduction to, and commentary to a 999 line poem.  It appears that Nabakov had great  fun constructing this masterpiece and I think the reader will have fun  deciphering it.  The introduction and commentary are &quot;written&quot; by  a slightly insane, slightly delusional professor, Charles Kinbote, who is  perhaps a deposed king on the run, perhaps not.  He believes he has  inspired the poet to construct a poem about his former kingdom, but alas,  the poem is about the poet's life.  Kinbote is greatly disappointed, but in  his commentary manages to find allusions to his former kingdom and rambles  on and on about it.  The results are often hilarious and always thought  provoking.  Nabokov has such a good time writing in English and because it  is not his native toungue, he sees things in the words that native English  speakers wouldn't.  It's fun to watch him play with the words, as it's fun  to watch him play with our conceptions of reality.  The whole book plays  around with what is reality, who is the narrator.  Is it Nabokov pretending  to be Kinbote, is it just Nabokov.  One wonders what really happened in the  story.  Kinbote tells one version, the characters he speaks of tells  another, as does our poet, John Shade, Nabokov is telling yet another.   There are so many layers of story and illusion.  I found myself wondering  what really happened, but it's fiction, nothing happened, or everything  happened.  I really enjoyed this book a great deal.  It even took my mind  off of being in the dentist's chair.  I highly recommend this book to  anyone who isn't afraid of slightly experimental fiction.  Fans of Infinite  Jest and House of Leaves will certainly enjoy Pale Fire.	2000-05-12

Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov has an absolutely marvelous sense of humor that is unbecoming a professor of literature at Harvard.  Good for him!  The humor of this book is unmistakable &amp; is transparent to even the most naive of Nabokov's readers.  That this gentleman can write a book that  is hilarious and at the same time a work of depth and genius is awe  inspiring.<br /> &quot;Pale Fire&quot; is the tale of a pedantic, psychotic,  misogynistic literary critic who attempts to write an overly-elaborate  critique of a poem written by a recently deceased scholar.  What is so  amusing is how this academician commits so many undergraduate fallacies  such as reading too much into a poem and saying &quot;the poet must have  had me in mind when he wrote this.&quot;  He catches erudite allusions only  to miss the most obvious references.  In the meantime, he also grapples  with the demons of his hypochondriac unconscious which make him think that  someone or something is &quot;after&quot; him.<br />This is a wonderful book  that has very few peers.  For those other reviewers who found that it  lacked depth, I would suggest that they read it again.  If they still don't  find profundity, I would recommend that they read it a third time....a  fourth time, etc. until they see what is really &quot;going on&quot; and  that the book may be all fun and games, but is fun and games centered  around a recondite maze of allegories.  A book for the more daring spirits  amongst us (and for those who have been waiting a book that makes fun of  literary critics......)	2000-03-05

However, the novel is so dense and frustrating that I nearly gave up before finishing it.  There are infinite puzzles to be worked out here, and  frankly I felt the puzzles overshadowed the story itself.  I loved Pnin,  but this one took it too far.<br />I reccomend the poem in itself though-- a  beautiful work.	2000-01-13
US	52130985	R82C6F0A731GQ	0679723420	755867934	Pale Fire	Books	5	5	11	N	N	Artistic and Intricate	Pale Fire was a fascinating novel to read, though difficult to interpret.  I found the explanation in Nabokov's big 2-part biography to be the best. It was fun to puzzle though this novel, flipping pages back and  forth.<br />However I must reiterate a position I made earlier in my review of  ADA.  Nabokov did not &quot;love&quot; many of his characters.  Nabokov  detested the characters of both Humbert and Van Veen (or for that matter,  the narrator of &quot;Despair&quot; and &quot;King, Queen, Knave&quot;.   And clearly, Kinbote, to the extent that he existed was an insane man and a  bad man.  <br />Nabokov assumed that you the reader could judge these  characters immoral yourself, and that despite their narratorial efforts,  you would not be fooled by their delusions of self-worth. Nabokov's best  readers avoid getting suckered by his suspect narrators because the real  moral message of his books lie underneath this confused surface.	1999-10-06
US	51202123	R2YXRLSO4A6AQD	0679723420	755867934	Pale Fire	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Beautiful, heartbreaking, inenubilable, and perfect.	This is a beautiful, heartbreaking, inenubilable and perfect novel.  Its only flaw is that I did not write it.  It is a novel that makes one demand that all great novels make of the reader: that you approach the book with  intelligence, imagination, and attention to detail.  If you do, you will  find its core of humanity in the buried stories of Charles Kinbote, the  grief of the Shades for their lost daughter, and the yearning for physical  and artistic immortality. The reviewers who found the book lacking in  heart, or to be no more than a literary funhouse, should reread the novel.   Try, this time approaching the novel from the index - the funniest part of  the book (Shade, Sybil, passim) - and try to figure out why the index  descriptions, such as the one where Kinbote refers an index entry about a  person who &quot;betrays a noble heart&quot; to a commentary that discusses  a green-jacketed shadow.  Try to follow the trail of Kinbote's heartbreak  and madness, and then tell me that there is no heart to this book. Oh, and  the reviewer who felt that Nabokov did not love Kinbote as he loved Humbert  Humbert and Van Veen should reread those books.	1999-08-01
US	51279637	R121JBFR3JZFI8	0679723420	755867934	Pale Fire	Books	5	2	7	N	N	Yes, yes, brilliant.  but...	This is a fantastic book.  Of course.  The wordplay is dazzling, the games intricate, the scope both ambitious and fully realized.  It will ever earn five stars on Earth.  That being said, in some alternate universe (Terra,  perhaps?) where Steven King is Vladimir Nabokov, I would only give it four  stars.<br />It isn't as good as Ada, Pnin or Lolita, despite being technically  superior to the latter two.  Why?  Because Nabokov doesn't love Charles  Kimbote - and hence, we don't (contrast Van, Timofey and Humbert).  And - I  know - with circumspection, Pale Fire can be viewed as a triple-joke -  being about John Shade after all, to whom Nabokov is much more kind.  Or  even that Shade and Kimbote are one and the same, etcetera ad nauseum.   But, in my final analysis, for all it's technical intricacy, ambition, and  florid prose, this book fails to move my heart as well as dazzle my  mind.<br />Or maybe I just don't get it.  Regardless, I highly recommend it.   Right behind Ada.	1999-07-19

It's filled all sorts of funny things, a few sad and  melancholy things, and there was at least one part where I couldn't stop  laughing.  It was also interesting to see how Nabokov maneuvered his way  around the perspectives of the two main characters, both of whom are  endearing in their own different ways.<br />However, these thrills I would  compare to the time you were a kid and put a handmirror behind your back in  a barber shop and saw infinite reflections of yourself.  If that's all it  takes to make you happy, this is the book for you.  Don't expect too much  depth or symbolism or allegory.  The joy of the book is all on the surface.  Comparisons of this work to &quot;Ulysses&quot; are a bit unfair.  &quot;Pale Fire&quot; has a complexity because it contains a number of  perspectives, nice intermittent details, and interesting interactions  between characters, but in my book that's all one level (two at the most).  The only real point one might derive from this book is a sense of the  subjectivity of life.  Ulysses was complicated on the surface but much  deeper in its exploration of existence and meaning.<br />So basically what  I'm saying is this:  &quot;Pale Fire&quot; is a good read that will force  you to think, but it won't alter your life.	1999-02-22
US	52967489	RUJS53V2G6UK2	0679723420	755867934	Pale Fire	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Comedic and Literary Genius	This novel/poem works on so many levels it definitely requires more than one read.  A friend once described reading James Joyce's ULYSSES like trying to juggle a hundred balls at once, you will never achieve that in  one sitting, but with each reading your appreciation deepens.  While  Palefire may not contain one hundred balls to juggle, Nabokov has packed  this work with enough angles and double and triple entendres to joyfully  occupy readers on all levels.  This book should occupy a unique place in  twentieth century literature.  It can be at once a hilarious comedy, a  deeply troubling psychological tragedy, a historical thriller, and simply a  work of lyrical and lingusitic beauty.<br />This ios the book that convinced  me of Nabokov's genius.  What he has accomplished is this:  disguised a  masterpiece as a frivolous, pompous, poorly written, often unorganized,  almost schizophrenic teenage attempt at &quot;great  literature&quot;.<br />READER PLEASE DO NOT BE FOOLED.  If you find yourself  having any of these reactions to the book, the joke is on you, and Nabokov,  I am sure, would have wanted that anyway.	1999-01-05

Nabokov always crafts books with interesting twists, plays on words, and hidden foreshadowing, but PALE FIRE is possibly my favorite of his books.  It is wonderful -- an excellent story inside an excellent story inside an excellent story.  I read it twice straight through, and now I go back for a re-read every once in a while.  It is immensely satisfying.<br />If you are looking for an easy read, the top plot will probably be great for you.  But if you're looking for something more, this book HAS it!<br />Wonderfully intricate and very worthwhile.	1998-07-09

At the time, I read it, discussed it in class, and enjoyed it, I guess. <br /> Since then, however, I have almost become obsessed with it: reading it and re-reading it. I don't know why. <br /> The thing that sticks in my mind most is this: English wasn't Nabokov's first language, and he writes more beautifully than native speakers.<br /> If you read the book for no other reason than to see what our language can do, that is enough.	1998-03-18

The best part was that I had no idea where that finish was going to be.    I don't believe I've ever read in the \\"erotic alien abduction\\" genre. In fact, I had no idea what such a thing was. I'd read some of Penny Ash's words on Twitter and liked the way she communicated so I decided to read \\"Pale Fire.\\" I'm glad I did, although I had to wade through Vladimir Nabokov's book by the same name before I found Penny Ash's Kindle book on the shelf at Amazon.    My taste buds haven't been tuned to this kind of writing, but it didn't take long for me to realize that Ash has a flair for the sublime. I'm not going into the plot because I don't want to drop any spoilers, but frankly I found this book a satisfying combination of humor and some really serious philosophical thinking. Did I mention that Pale Fire is fast paced? By the time I arrived at the very satisfying conclusion I was breathless as well as please with how things turned out.    I ought to mention that the mildly erotic content of Pale Fire is totally in proportion and in keeping with the way the story is told. In this I find that Ash hits the mark.    Her female characters are fleshed out in ways so that even a man could understand and approve of the motivations of a determined woman. I found her development of the principal male character to be totally charming. Sasha becomes the man that every woman hopes a man will be--at least that's what my wife tells me when she finished the book.    Read this book if you want a fresh take on how good and evil clash. The nicest part about this is that you'll feel really good when you finish.	2010-11-17

The next thing she knows, she's being kidnapped and taken to an experimental laboratory but Sasha comes to the rescue.<br /><br />Aliens introduce Sasha and Cath to their children, providing an excellent and positive viewpoint on humans meeting otherworld species rather than making them the bad guys. This is a refreshing viewpoint.<br /><br />The only thing about this unique tale that lacked was an erotic element. The book should have been in a mainstream romance category instead.<br /><br />Aside from that, it was a great plot and well done. The very clever author, Penny Ash will go far with her career with such a creative imagination. This book absolutley deserves 4 Cherries.	2010-06-16
