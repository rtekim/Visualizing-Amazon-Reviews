I did read it back to back with another of Virginia Woolf's great novels, &#34;To the Lighthouse.&#34; Truthfully, for me, that might be a bit too much Virginia Woolf, but once accomplished, I felt very smug and proud of myself. Woolf expertly and intimately delves into the womanly mind of her title character, Clarissa Dalloway. The novel is about one day in the life of this woman who is planning a party for that evening, and several other characters who cross her path that day, and the impact they have on her. There are some flashbacks and trains of inner thought, monologues that further define each character. One tragic young man, Septimus Warren Smith, a shell-shocked soldier, is not noticed by Clarissa, but his passing is felt during Clarissa 's party. To read one of Woolf's books is to know her: her feminism, her sexuality, her brilliant intellect, her suicidal urges (which eventually got the best of her); her kindness; and her intensity. I'm not sure I'll ever read another Virginia Woolf, but I'm glad I read this one. For further understanding, one might watch the 1997 film, &#34;Mrs. Dalloway,&#34; with Vanessa Redgrave in the title role; or read Michael Cunningham's novel &#34;The Hours,&#34; or watch the film starring Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore.",2014-04-09

On this particular day, she is preparing for the party she will host in the evening -- buying flowers, readying her house, etc. Although on the outside a charming woman with a talent for bringing people together, on the inside Clarissa is an endless stream of memories, longings, and doubts about the choices she has made.<br /><br />We are also transported, at times, into the psyches of some of the people she comes into contact with, including her husband Richard Dalloway, who can't verbally express his love for his wife, and her old flame Peter Walsh, who has just returned from India. Reading these perspectives and their thoughts about Clarissa give us a deeper, more complex understanding of her - who she is now and who she used to be. We see her horror of death, the joy she takes in throwing parties (a joy considered petty by some), the way she has sacrificed passion for conventionality, and how the passage of time has changed her. Parallel to Mrs. Dalloway's story is the narrative of Septimus Smith, a suicidal, insane ex-soldier who is unable to translate his experiences into words.<br /><br />I really, really loved the language in this book. There were times that I didn't even care about what was going on in the plot -- just absorbing the lyrical, rhythmic prose was more than enough. I can't tell you how many passages I underlined, either for their poetic beauty or the way they conveyed a tiny, shattering truth.<br /><br />\\""The sun might go in and out, on the tassels, on the wallpaper, but he would wait, he thought, stretching out his feet, looking at his ringed sock at the end of the sofa; he would wait in this warm place, this pocket of still air, which one comes on at the edge of a wood sometimes in the evening, when, because of a fall in the ground, or some arrangement of the trees (one must be scientific above all, scientific), warmth lingers, andthe air buffets the cheek like the wing of a bird.\\""<br /><br />Mrs. Dalloway made me feel all the feels. I felt the beauty of a hot June day in London, the vibrant but unsettling mentality of the mentally ill, the melancholy sadness of seeing a wild life become small, the doubt over the value of the life one leads, the impossibility of ever really knowing anyone, the fear (and conversely, the embracing) of death, and the way experience/age deepens feeling.<br /><br />I loved this book, but I don't feel like I fully understood it. I can tell that some of the symbolism went over my head and that there were many connections I failed to make. And I'm okay with that. This is a book I will definitely return to, and I will enjoy digging deeper in future reads. I really want to read more of Woolf's work and more about Woolf, herself. I want to know about her life and her themes so that I can understand her writing more fully.<br /><br />More reviews at Books Speak Volumes, a book blog.",2013-10-02

Royalty, nobility, and aristocracy are still revered in quasi-religious fashion by the poor and the middle class, as well as by those who occupy elevated status.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the place of the most fortunate in this class-based society is in the process of being relegated to co-equal or even second place by the power of emerging technology, however garish its appearance and however gaudy its trite commercial messages.  Post-WW I England seems as staid and unchanging as ever, but the products of modern science, harnessed to an evermore aggressive capitalism, threaten to transform traditional ways of life, much as the hopelessly ungainly machine called the \\""tank\\"" hastened the end of the static nightmare of trench warfare.  Septimus Smith may know this well, but who's to say.<br /><br />Tradition gives way to the garish and commercial; the English gentleman is superseded by the equally empty-headed captain of industry, and, ironically, the traditionally privileged are challenged by those who most ostentatiously sacrifice for those impoverished and maimed by war.  Though only vaguely evident, value, morality, and patterns of social organization are up for grabs.<br /><br />Still, for today, Clarissa Dalloway's life, now in its fifty-second year, is much as it has been since childhood.  Solidity, stability, the everyday pleasures of walking in London, looking in shop windows and seeing the same people, though perhaps a bit wizened now, doing the same as they did forty years ago is fortifying and even beautiful.  Not a religious woman, Clarissa nevertheless, sees beauty all around her, in everyday things, ordinary people, and commonplace events.  While walking in London, she loves it all, including the strong and reliable bell of Big Ben.<br /><br />Time, however, suffuses all things.  Recovered from an unspecified illness (Something to do with her heart?), she feels quite well, though she knows she is getting older.  Still slender, attractive, and smartly dressed, she is content with herself and looking forward to this evening's party, one of many she hosts, largely because that's what one does, and she enjoys them.<br /><br />Early in the day, however, she has an unexpected visit from Peter Walsh, a suitor of thirty years ago.  He seems much the same to her, and she to him.  England is still an imperial power, and Peter has, true to family tradition, been a high-level administrator in India for nearly three decades.  He is in London nominally to see lawyers about facilitating the divorce of a woman he says he loves and hopes to wed.  Given that she is already married to a major in the Indian Army, this hardly seems a way to maintain the morale and commitment of troops charged with holding together the empire.  Besides, it is obvious that Peter still loves Clarissa, and she is not oblivious to the good times that marriage to him might have brought.  Good times, yes, but perhaps too many and too intense.  She must retain some independence.<br /><br />At her party in the evening, the Prime Minister graciously makes an appearance, looking every inch a bookkeeper or mid-level clerk, though he does try.  Sally Seton, the closest and most irreverent friend of Clarissa's youth, makes an unexpected appearance.  Now married to an industrialist and the mother of five, one is led to wonder if marriage to a wealthy industrialist represents success or failure.  After all, where does an industrialist, however wealthy, fit into the class system of England of the 1920's.  Peter Walsh wonders much the same about himself as a colonial administrator.  Is he a success or a failure?<br /><br />All the while, and unbeknownst to all but an eminent physician at the party, Septimus Smith, war hero and promising member of the middle class, has succumbed to shell shock, making clear the limitations of traditional and commonplace medicine of the day.  (Yes, Virginia Woolf's novel is quite timely.)<br /><br />Mrs. Dalloway may be the most beautifully written novel I have ever read.  Encompassing only a day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway and her memories and the memories of others, it is in the deepest sense an existentialist masterpiece.  What does it mean to be?  If not in the ontological sense of a professional philosopher, than as a matter of getting by with a feeling that all these man-made social conventions that constitute our experiential world make some sort of sense and have some sort of purpose.  The author's mastery of a stream-of-consciousness style is ideally suited to questions of just this sort, illuminating the fluidity behind an unchanging expression.<br /><br />Characters get older, but never seem to change.  All around them, however, unnoticed and unacknowledged, there are hints that the world is becoming a massively different place.  It's good, perhaps, that we get old and die.

Her novels, whether short or long, manage to examine some of the more hidden areas of humanity.  \\""Mrs. Dalloway\\"" is no exception, even when the story is not just about its title character.<br /><br />The novel literally takes place over the course of one day, as Clarissa Dalloway prepares for and gives a dinner party; she is the perfect hostess, her mind driven more by social opinion than by her own thoughts.  Yet as the story unfolds through an unseen narrator, readers can enter Clarissa's thoughts abuot the present and the past, as well as those of other characters, major and minor.  Readers follow a young couple, Septimus and Rezia Smith, around London as the pair search for a doctor to heal Septimus, a war veteran with an off-kilter mindset.  Thrown into the mix for short periods are Clarissa's husband, Richard, who tries to tell his wife how he really feels about her, and their daughter, Elizabeth, who couldn't be more unlike her mother if she tried.  The other major player is Peter Walsh, Clarissa's old flame, who ran off to India when she turned him down, but is back now hoping for a job, for comfort, for...something he's not quite sure about.<br /><br />Woolf used an almost stream of consciousness style for this telling as the narrative shifts almost seamlessly between different characters and their thoughts.  This helps to push the story onward but it can also make it difficult at times to tell which character is talking.  Even though it all takes place in one day, Woolf manages to draw the reader back and forth through time, building up the characters' backgrounds in their remembrances.  For such a short novel, \\""Mrs. Dalloway\\"" is a dense book, commenting upon various issues - societal, political, and economical.

Holmes and Bradshaw), feminism (viewed, for instance, in the contrast between Elizabeth's potential and old Aunt Parry's reminisce of India), and homosexuality (Clarissa's impossible love of Sally Seton at Bourton) -- is the non-stop motion of the novel from the opening in the morning when Clarissa leaves her house to purchase flowers for her party to end of her party and the day.<br /><br />This motion manifests in the physical movement of various characters, the movement though the minds of the characters, and through time itself, in particular linear, interior, and flashback time.  The unceasing motion within the novel and how Woolf manages it proves one of MRS. DALLOWAY's great pleasures.  Being aware of and contemplating how Woolf works time -- something like a Congreve clock, down to the imprecision of the timekeeping -- adds to the enjoyment of the novel.<br /><br />Woolf employs linear, or the hours of the day, as a skeleton upon which she hangs the physical action, that being the movement of the characters around London and through the day.  Big Ben and St. Margaret's chime at regular junctures in the novel.  Many have written much concerning this aspect of time in MRS. DALLOWAY.  Others have mapped the routes of Clarissa, Peter, Elizabeth, Septimus and Rezia.  If you enjoy the novel, you might like to explore these commentaries.  You can find some online.<br /><br />In addition to moving through the day, characters move back and forth in time.  This is particularly true of Clarissa and Peter, who are about to see each other after a very long time.  They once loved each other.  Clarissa contemplated marrying Peter, until an important summer at her family's estate at Bourton when Richard Dalloway appeared.  Peter still holds a passion for Clarissa and Clarissa rethinks her choice of husband.  We view the events of that past time interpreted through their recollections.  Septimus, the shell-shocked war veteran, and his wife Rezia also spend long passages remembering the war and their meeting.  During these passages, real time may be a few moments but in the characters' minds days, months, and seasons pass.<br /><br />Most striking, however, is how Woolf moves the cerebral action of the novel, which is the thoughts of the characters, from individual to individual, including an array of minor characters.

Through this one day the reader is given a window into the life of Clarissa Dalloway, the central character, and to other characters that are connected to her in some way or another. We see Clarissa's marriage to her husband Robert, old suitors whom she rejected, friends from her childhood, and people she passes on the street. It does not have much of a plot, but is instead driven by vivid characterization and a dreamlike style. Mrs. Dalloway is the portrait of a woman, a flawed and human woman, and of the many people who orbit around her in one day,<br /><br />The first thing that really struck me about Mrs. Dalloway was the style, for which it is rightly famous. Like many of her modernist contemporaries, Woolf experimented with style, in this case using a stream-of-consciousness narrative that focuses on portraying the consciousness and thought patterns of her characters. Since people almost never think in logical or linear paths, the narrative wanders from subject to subject. The style matches these wandering thoughts perfectly, with the sentence lengths and amount of description changing to match the mood of the narrator. This style makes the characters thoughts feel incredibly real and honest, like you're looking through a window into each character's mind. The narrative moves seamlessly between characters, transitioning from one narrative perspective to another both smoothly and without warning, making it sometimes difficult to realize that it's happened until the end of a sentence or paragraph. While this can sometimes be confusing, it is a perfect way to transition from one person's experience to the next; it makes the book as a whole just as wandering and fluid as the individual narratives. It's things like that, the way that the larger and smaller structures reinforce each other and work together thematically, that make Woolf such a good writer, and make her books so effective.<br /><br />The stream-of-consciousness style and the free-indirect narrative mean that the characters in Mrs. Dalloway are incredibly rich and lifelike. Each time there is a change of narrator, the reader is given an entirely different perspective on the characters. When Clarissa is narrating, she seems like a reasonable and good person, and her decisions, actions, and estimations of the other characters make as much sense to the reader as they do to her. When the narrator changes to Peter Walsh, we see Clarissa in a different light, more silly and flawed. When Clarissa described her marriage early in the book, I was inclined to dislike her husband Richard, and Peter's opinion of him only supported those feelings. But during the brief section where Richard narrates, I saw him for what he was, not evil or cruel, but a well-meaning, flawed, and all-together too human man. Woolf's characterization, her ability to portray the feelings and motivations of characters so well that the reader understands and believes them, her insistence on making even her antagonists real people, is something that I found completely surprising and utterly pleasing.<br /><br />The style and characterization in Mrs. Dalloway are not just aesthetically pleasing and inherently interesting; like in any good novel, they also serve thematic purposes. Many of the characters in Mrs. Dalloway are detached or separated from the people around them. Clarissa is described as \\""cold\\"" by a number of characters, and her marriage to Richard is a distant one. Peter Walsh just returned to England from a long stay in India, and is constantly reminded of how different the two places are, and how much people have changed, or not changed, since he left. Septimus Smith has shell shock from his time in the war, and is kept mentally distant from both his wife and from reality in general. The narrative voice compliments and draws attention to these many kinds of distance through the use of free indirect style. Rather than using \\""I\\"" or \\""we\\"" like in a first person narration, the novel is in the free indirect style, which is a special kind of limited third person narration. Rather than being an impartial narrator, in this style the third person narrator sees and describes things only how the character would see or describe them. This makes the narrator and the characters nearly indistinguishable, but still separates them through the use of third person pronouns. This narrative style allows Woolf to provide a rich and detailed portrait of the characters using stream-of-consciousness writing while still keeping the narrator detached from both the characters and the author. This separation between narrator, character, author, and reader matches the separation between the characters themselves, and puts the reader in the same situation as the characters.<br /><br />As much as this novel is a portrait of the distance between people, it is also a story of people trying to make connections. Clarissa's party is, above all else, her attempt to bring people together. Woolf's use of smooth transitions between characters, the repetition of ideas and places in the thoughts of different characters, and the lack of chapters and rarity of section breaks all endeavor to make connections between the wandering strands of narrative in the same way that the characters try to make connections with each other. The themes of this novel pull in two separate directions, pointing toward the loneliness of the modern world and the many ways in which people find connection. Woolf manages to incorporate both of those elements and, through her mastery of style, fuse them into a coherent and aesthetically pleasing whole.<br /><br />I feel like I should mention some of the problems that people have with Virginia Woolf. Many people find the fact that she only writes about upper-middle-class white people and completely ignores the existence of the working class and minorities to be problematic. I think that this is a valid critique not of any single novel, as no novel can have everything in it, but of her output as a whole, especially her nonfiction. In Mrs. Dalloway there is only one working-class character, Ms. Kilman, who is not portrayed in a good light even in her own narration. This erasure of the working class and minorities is a problem not just with Virginia Woolf, but with both literary Modernism and early feminism as a whole. I think it's important to interrogate the limitations of these works even as we enjoy the beauty and virtuosity of the writing. Another problematic element is the depiction of empire in Mrs. Dalloway, specifically the British colonization of India. I personally don't know what to make of this theme, which returns multiple times throughout the novel. Partially because of the free indirect style, I don't know where the characters' opinions on the matter stop and where Woolf's ideas and possible biases begin. I will have to read the novel a few more times before I can say anything conclusive about empire in Mrs. Dalloway, but I wanted to throw it out there as something to pay attention to if you are reading this yourself.<br /><br />Mrs. Dalloway is often hailed as one of the modern classics, and after reading it I can absolutely understand why. Woof's use of style and structure serve to paint a picture of a woman, a truly human woman, complete with flaws and strengths, full of new hopes and failed dreams, and to show the people who come into contact with her throughout the course of a day. Despite the high literary style, it feels honest and uncontrived. The characters feel familiar, like the people you meet every day, and the feelings and thoughts they have could very well be your own. It is a beautiful, luminous, haunting book that will only improve upon rereading. I had a lot of expectations going in to this reading, and I am happy to say that Mrs.Dalloway exceeded them all.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars.nores the existence of the working class and minorities to be problematic.

The concepts for the novels are similar, but the styles are polar opposites. I recommend becoming familiar with both works in order to appreciate the different ways that character studies can be developed during a day by relying extensively on thought life. Both are brilliant, but in much different ways.<br /><br />Mrs. Dalloway is English, delicate, fussy, ornate, and feminine. Ulysses is Irish, crude, unrestrained, common, and masculine.<br /><br />What stands out the most about Mrs. Dalloway are the many original descriptive sentences and phrases that look as though they went through 200 rewritings to be so polished and complete. Their expressions overwhelm the story at time because the reader is left gasping at a stunning turn of phrase or an idea. In writing, you can sit and admire and forget to read on.<br /><br />A blessing of listening to the excellent reading by Virginia Leishman is that the brilliant writing is better integrated into the story by forcing you to keep going. I enjoyed the experience. I don't want to discourage you from reading the book first, but I believe you will appreciate the overall craft more if you listen before reading. It's the same advice I provide for William Faulkner's books. There's a beauty in the oral expression that is otherwise lost.<br /><br />I found the story to feel a little dated. I also found myself not being terribly engaged by Mrs. Dalloway or her husband. That's a pretty big problem to have when listening to or reading a novel. Someone today who wrote historical fiction about this period would do it differently.<br /><br />Naturally, if I were only rating the marvelous ornate writing, this would be five stars.

I'm glad I gave it a go, though, because in my opinion Woolf takes the stream-of-consciousness writing style and does it right, threading the narrative together in a wandering but coherent and meaningful way.    The story spins itself out over just one day, as Clarissa Dalloway occupies herself with the planning of a party she's hosting that evening.  Throughout the course of the day we jump around from her point of view to a few other characters she comes in contact with, namely Peter Walsh, an old friend who has been living away from England for decades, mostly in India, and has now returned to try and work out divorce plans so he can marry a woman back in India.  In their youth Peter and Clarissa were a couple whom most thought would marry, but she ended up marrying Richard Dalloway instead, an event that Peter has never really gotten over.  When he comes to see Clarissa the day of her party they reminisce about old times, particularly about a specific weekend they and another friend of Clarissa's, Sally Seton, had spent together at Clarissa's family estate.  This is where we get the most informative glimpses into Clarissa's youth and what has formed her over the years, including her romantic but not entirely understood feelings for her friend Sally.      Two other significant points of view we get are from the loosely connected character of Septimus Smith and his Italian wife Lucrezia as they're out and about in town.  Septimus, a WWI vet, is clearly mentally disturbed and distraught over something he can't quite clarify, even to himself, and although it's never known if he's suffering post-traumatic war stress or is perhaps schizophrenic, the passages following his rambling, tormented thoughts are intense.  His wife Lucrezia is desperately worried about him and unsure what to do, and feeling like a displaced foreigner dropped in a strange town, has no one to turn to.  When she finally calls upon the local doctor and he tells her Septimus will have to be taken away, she is horrified and frightened, both for him and herself.      Mrs. Dalloway was actually the combination of two short stories, \\""Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street\\"" and \\""The Prime Minister\\"".  Generally I don't find a lot of literature that looks at the social aftermath, even peripherally, of WWI (Hemingway stands out as an exception, of course, but he focuses more on the war itself) since that conflict tends to be overshadowed by the events of WWII.  The impact of the first world war, though, was significant, given the incredibly high death toll and economic impact.  \\""This late age of the world's experience had bred in them all, all men and women, a well of tears,\\"" the narrative goes at one point, speaking volumes in those few words.      It's masterfully done and has a delicacy and eloquence about it that makes each word important.  Woolf's vision and unique perception of the world around her is extraordinary:  \\""It was a sudden revelation, a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then, as it spread, one yielded to its expansion, and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer, swollen with some astonishing significance, some pressure of rapture, which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an extraordinary alleviation over the cracks and sores! Then, for that moment, she had seen an illumination; a match burning in a crocus; an inner meaning almost expressed. But the close withdrew; the hard softened. It was over -- the moment.\\""    In the end I was left wondering what the events of the day would signify for Clarissa, as she looks down the path at impending old age and is vaguely, uncomfortably aware that the years she has lived, ratherthan forming her more clearly and definitively as a person, have seemed to somehow make her less; that her sense of self has been watered down, as if essential parts of herself have been allowed to erode and disappear, rather than crystallize and build some crucial inner self.  The image remaining is one of death, when at the end of life a person eventually returns to the original state one is born in:  soft, embryonic and unformed.  Disturbing!    That's just my own interpretation, mind you.  At any rate, it's a compelling read from a woman I can't help but think must have tormented herself with her own thoughts and questions, so much so that she eventually committed suicide.  Like Sylvia Plath, she obviously had a brilliant mind and it's a shame the world was robbed of it too soon.",2008-12-05

Virginia Woolf was originally going to call her breakthrough novel The Hours, a title Michael Cunningham used in his tribute novel to Mrs. Dalloway. The pealing of Big Ben and other chimes striking the hours segue this chapterless novel into different character spheres, different memories or thoughts. Big Ben's leaden circles of sound move out, widen, and wrap other characters into the narrative.<br /> Using James Joyce's then-new technique of stream of consciousness, Woolf explores the minds of a number of her characters.

Though they pass close by each other, Septimus and Clarissa never meet. When she hears word of this stranger's suicide through a famous doctor at the party, it has a profound effect upon her. Septimus is probably closer in his mental state to Virginia Woolf herself than to Clarissa Dalloway, but the ripples of meaning, like the reverberations of the chiming, caused by his death make her neglect her party.

I came to it after reading [[ASIN:0156907399 TO THE LIGHTHOUSE]], written two years later (1925 and 1927). Both books are set in summer, and both are confined to a single physical setting. But whereas the house and garden in TO THE LIGHTHOUSE, nominally in Scotland, might almost be anywhere, London is a real and precise presence in MRS DALLOWAY, lovingly described over a range of several miles. The later book, though concentrating on two specific days, has a span of almost a decade; MRS DALLOWAY follows the classical unity of time, starting in the early morning and continuing until night in a single unbroken span (a precedent perhaps imitated by Ian McEwan in his [[ASIN:1400076196 SATURDAY]]). Conversely, while TO THE LIGHTHOUSE confines itself to about a dozen characters, MRS DALLOWAY moves in ever-expanding ripples, adding more and more people as guests arrive for Clarissa Dalloway's party in the book's concluding scene.<br /><br />The hours of the day are marked by the sound of Big Ben: \\""First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable. The leaden circles dissolved in the air.\\"" The image of expanding and dissipating circles is central; as in TO THE LIGHTHOUSE, Woolf is preoccupied with the passage of time; both books are a memento mori. But neither one is grim; there is a summer freshness here, a feeling for the charm of society life in a great city, that fits the preliminary musical chimes of the great clock -- but the irrevocable toll of time is not forgotten. We see Clarissa Dalloway, a little over fifty, wife of a respected politician with an assured place in society. Like the sound of the clock, like ripples on the water, her circles have also expanded since her marriage, but have they also dissipated, dissolved in the air? Near the beginning of the book, she is visited by Peter Walsh, a former suitor whom she refused some thirty years before, now back home after many years in India. Both of them have changed, but the memories take her back and force her to weigh and reweigh her concepts of success and happiness.<br /><br />All the characters in the novel are known personally to Clarissa Dalloway, with the exception of only two: Septimus Warren Smith and his Italian wife Lucrezia, whose story, weaving in and out of the main one, takes up about a fifth of the whole. Septimus, a clerk by profession but something of a poet and aesthete, has returned from the war unable to feel. When his best friend is killed in the last days of the war, he congratulates himself on surviving without cracking up, but soon begins to recognize his lack of emotion for the curse that it is; he married Lucrezia largely in an attempt to overcome this. He must be one of the first victims of shell-shock to appear in literature (but not the last: see Pat Barker's magnificent [[ASIN:0452270073 REGENERATION]] and, in a lighter vein, all of Jacqueline Winspear's [[ASIN:0142004332 MAISIE DOBBS]] series). Virtually everything in Woolf's mature novels is connected primarily by thought rather than through action, but this takes the principle even farther, linking Septimus to Clarissa in theme only, as her Doppelg&auml;nger; the author admitted as much in a later preface.

Woolf creates a character's interior life through a virtuosic, highly mobile third-person narrator, who might be thought of as the character's \\""persona,\\"" not merely \\""expressing\\"" the character's thoughts but \\""mirroring\\"" how the character perceives him or herself as seen by others. Moreover, the indefinite pronouns can shift unexpectedly or occur in too close proximity to make identification easy or even definite. As a result, the reader has to work overtime to achieve entrance into the mind of the \\""right\\"" character while simultaneously sensing the liquid, interpenetrating and shared qualities of human identity itself. And finally there's that tone, now soft, now loud, and rarely without irony.<br /><br />Woolf makes it fairly easy on the reader with the broad, sardonic strokes she uses to paint the practically villainous Sir William Bradshaw, the eminent psychiatrist viewed by many (especially himself) as the scientific high priest of this cross-section of deluded London luminaries; and she's equally nasty to her other \\""villain,\\"" Miss Kilman, a repressed and embittered born-again Christian who, like Sir William, lives by the code of \\""conversion,\\"" Woolf's euphemism for those powerful personalities who are bent upon breaking, controlling and dominating the will of anyone not strong enough to resist them. The other portraits are more subtle, requiring the reader either to hear the soft, nuanced ironical tones or risk missing both the social satire and the character. Woolf's targets range, perhaps not surprisingly, from the pretense, pride, and hypocrisy of an out-of-touch social stratum that clings to the \\""orderly\\"" past; to the arrogance of modern medical \\""science\\""; to, more surprisingly, the suffocating alternatives offered by both religion and love. She uses the term \\""Human Nature\\"" ironically, making it refer to those individuals who cannot see with understanding, empathy or vision, substituting for \\""life\\"" the ego's own conventional, reductive and limited sense of a world that's all surface and order.<br /><br />Readers lured to this novel because of Cunningham's \\""The Hours\\"" (novel or film) may be disappointed or quickly frustrated. Moving from Cunningham to Woolf is a bit like going from Fitzgerald to Faulkner, or from Austen to Shakespeare. What you immediately notice is the far greater range and more inclusive thematic focus and, most importantly, the sheer power and vitality of the prose (from fluid motion to dynamic rush). Woolf--like Joyce, Faulkner, and Shakespeare--employs a syntax that can cause the head to spin and the earth: she's a writer who represents not merely individual characters but captures a microcosm of life not to mention the life of language itself.<br /><br />The greatest challenge \\""Mrs. Dalloway\\"" presents to a first-time reader is never to let up. It's essential to stay with Clarissa throughout her entire day, finally becoming a fully engaged participant in the party itself--the final thirty pages of the novel, which contain some of Woolf's best writing. Especially critical is the extended moment, almost 20 pages into the party scene, when Clarissa, like Septimus, walks to the window and has her epiphany. It's a moment highly reminiscent of Gabriel Conroy's singular internal struggle and ultimate attainment of vision in the closing paragraphs of \\""The Dead\\"" (Woolf was not especially fond of Joyce, but it's hard to believe she was not influenced by him).  At that moment, Clarissa sees her affinity and even oneness with Septimus, a character who suffers internally but is capable of resisting the worse alternative of the \\""cures\\"" offered by Dr. Bradshaw, one of the guests at Clarissa's own party.  The insight produces action: one character chooses death; the other, life. But Woolf enables us to see these apparently opposite choices as existential cognates: both characters make choices that enable them to save their souls.  (The \\""Death of the Soul\\"" is a theme introduced early in the novel by the insightful Peter, a \\""failure\\"" by society's standards and his own admission and someone who cannot get the better of his fixations--on the irretrievable past and his own youth.

Meanwhile, she and other characters, like her rejected suitor, Peter Walsh, her well-meaning husband, Richard, her emotionally-distant daughter, Elizabeth, a mentally ill war veteran, Septimus Warren Smith, and many others go about their life while reflecting on the past, the present, the future, and how they all perpetually connect. <br /> <br />Mrs. Dalloway is a wonderfully intricate book, full of so many symbols and underlying meanings that it becomes obvious from the very beginning that this is more than a story about a dinner party. Of course, in a sense, it really is just a story about a dinner party, and such in-depth feelings and events that are unfolding around and within the characters are to be expected whenever so many different people are brought together, both physically and, in some cases, emotionally. Woolf just draws specific attention to these universal and timeless events and relationships, and then leaves it up to the reader to further dwell on their significance. These characters may be living in a different time than us, as is evident to some degree by their strict formality and unique social customs, but beneath the surface, the sensations they feel, like loneliness, jealousy, and passion, show that they are really no different than us. <br /> <br />However, as with any book by Virginia Woolf, I would not recommend it to someone looking for an easy read who isn't willing to spend time reflecting on its themes and complexities.

If true, I think one can say Virginia Woolf invented the modern autobiographical novel.  Clarissa, Mrs Dalloway, is Virginia.  Mrs Dalloway was published in 1925 when VW was 43 years old; Clarissa is 52 and perhaps that's how old Mrs Woolf felt when she wrote her autobiography of middle age.  When sane, she is Mrs Dalloway; when mad, she is Septimus.  Her descriptions of madness (hallucinations, paranoid delusions) are incredible, especially when written at a time when Freud (whose work Virginia's Hogarth Press had published) was all the rage.   Her questioning lesbian love is extraordinarily interesting -- not so much whether it was morally right or wrong but, at a deeper level, what was lesbian love all about and where did it fit in.  It becomes a parlour game to correlate details on every page with the corresponding details in Mrs Woolf's life.  Her questioning lesbian love in 1925 would have occurred at the height of her involvement with Vita Sackville-West, whom she first met in 1922.  Even little references to the fact that an individual would not inherit a family home due to male preference inheritance laws tracks with Vita's predicament.  And why \\""Clarissa\\""?

Bouillier's debt to Woolf is broader and deeper than just a stolen phrase. Both books center around the anticipation of a party in contrast with the reality of its experience as it unfolds; and both share themes of the cruelty and triviality of human nature. Compared to other stream of conscious masterpieces (Joyce's ULYSSES or Faulkner's THE SOUND AND THE FURY), Dalloway is relatively easy to follow. I found it's structure and execution to be rather cinematice. The story is bookended with sections focusing on the title character. In the large middle section the narrative passes seamlessly from one secondary character to another like a baton in a (leisurely) relay race. The trick is to anticipate that the baton will be passed and that the point of view and pronominal references are going to shift. I put an \\""x\\"" in the margin each time I observed the baton being passed (these would probably be chapter breaks in more conventional novels). I found this to be helpful when I needed to reread a section to refresh my memory on a detail. What is amazing is that Woolfe employs an objective third person narration throughout, and yet each section strongly projects the obsessions and interests of the character that has been brought into the foreground. The prose is fluid, beautiful, and free of gimmickry. The author, like Clarissa Dalloway, is in complete control of all she surveys, a master manipulator.

Some friends attend and Clarissa may or may not have gained some self-insight.  That basically is the plot of CLARISSA DALLOWAY.  But Virginia Woolf took this marginal sequence of events and created not just one but two separate and overlapping universes with it.  To do this, Woolf avoided the conventional linear approach to fiction that had characterized novel writing until the jangling horrors of the War caused a number of very intellectual minds to suddenly pay some serious attention to the pioneering books of Freud and Jung with the result that the inner recesses of the mind opened up a brand new way to think, to perceive, and as a result to write.  Woolf, of course, was not the first fiction writer to do this.  James Joyce did much the same with his ULYSSES, but Woolf in her more controlled way of keeping straight in the reader's mind who was doing what improved on this free associational way to write so that readers could follow the Byzantine labyrinth of Clarissa's synaptic pathways and experience in real time what she does.  <br /> <br />Clarissa is a middle-aged woman who obsesses over the past.  When a passionate lover offered her marriage years ago, she turned him down for the predictable dullness of another.  When Clarissa had the opportunity to have a lesbian affair when she was a teenager, she turned that down too.  Her life has been pretty much the same, and now at fifty-two, she pauses to wonder--perhaps not too deeply--whether the fault may be hers.  Is she inherently sterile?  Clarissa does not possess the needed objectivity to get too close but the reader certainly does.  Clarissa has spent a lifetime perfecting the fine art of erecting insurmountable walls around herself that no one even knows are there.  Perhaps part of the reason is that she has bought into the pre-Victorian world life of servants, massive formal parties, and a life spent ina hurry going nowhere. Clarissa is not an evil woman, nor does she maliciously plot against others, but she is lacking the emotional spark of life that might infuse her soul with meaning.  At her parties, which she plans with a vengeance, she is articulate and vivacious, both qualities which hide her essential internal fears rather than emphasize her non-existent external charm.  Connection is beyond her.  <br /> <br />While Clarissa occupies her universe of stasis, Woolf creates an adjacent universe of angst, separated from each other by a spatial and temporal bag of literary tricks that Woolf uses with masterly skill.  Occupying this other world is Septimus Warren Smith, a survivor of the War but only in a physical sense. Inside he is a wreck, emptied of human feeling, unable to communicate with his new wife, and crying out loudly and plainly that he wants only to die.  He never meets Clarissa though he is invited to her party.  What they share are their private worlds of pain that connect to the reader if not to each other.  They both hear the tolling of Big Ben, and they link, not solid as in a chain but metaphorically as in a dream.  His death by suicide does not close his universe totally; a bit of it remains within Clarissa as she hears ever so briefly of it, almost as if in passing.  His death lets her know that her life was very nearly as sterile as his was; at least it would if she were more perceptive, but she is not and that is the true tragedy of Clarissa.  Sometimes one has to die just to give another a chance at life.  Virginia Woolf says this better than anyone else has. <br />",2006-08-30

It drives me nuts to hear elitist snobs approach literary orgasm whenever she is brought up in conversation.

It was frustrating, because she is such a beautiful writer that I really wanted to understand it more than I did.<br /><br />Over the years since that time, I have read a number of other Woolf novels, and loved them. I have always been a little bit nervous about going back to Mrs. Dalloway. I had some time recently, so I finally decided to give it a go.<br /><br />I am not sure if the difference is age, or familiarity with her prose, but I had no trace of the same difficulty that I had experienced 20 years ago.

It had not occurred to me yet that living to give parties is also a choice, and one as awful in its own way as the option Septimus takes.<br /><br />It has been suggested that this book makes a good companion to reading or screening The Hours.

While that basic summary may sound rather unremarkable, there is so much more to \\""Mrs. Dalloway\\"" than I could possibly discuss here.

Perhaps I'm just bull headed, but if so many people considered this work a classic, I must simply be missing something, so on this attempt, I came in prepared. Some may consider it cheating, but on this reading, I prepared by perusing a summery of the work before beginning to gain a basic knowledge of the work's plot, and I have to say, it did the trick for me. <br />Being well aware of the bare structure of the novel, I was left to concentrate on the sheer poetry that is Woolf's language. I found once I got my foot in the door (that is once I read the first 15 pages or so and adjusted to Woolf's prose and use of long running sentences) I simply loved it, and could not get enough of Clarissa and the rest of her world! <br />I suppose another road block for many readers may be the clear depth of Woolf's observations within the novel. One must realize, Woolf is less concerned with the present action of the novel than what that action causes in the mind of her characters, and this is simply an arrangement I believe many readers have not previously encountered, and therefore condemn the novel, not seeing the genius of the tome, and Virginia Woolf herself. <br />Despite the confusion some readers may find in Woolf and Mrs. Dalloway subsequently, the novel given its due is worth every moment of effort, and the reader I find will be well rewarded, I know I was! <br />",2004-12-30

She writes with such stops and starts that one must almost be a literary professor to keep up with her thoughts as they are strung out into extraordinarily long sentences laced with a multitude of punctuations. I found that I was often lost on what character she was delving into and had to go back and re-read entire paragraphs to figure out where I had lost her thought.

With detailed descriptions of incidents, memories, and streams of consciousness, readers go through the characters' almost lifelong experiences. Woolf's writing, which appears to be improvised in the automatic writing, freely jumps from one person's perspective to another's, or from a description of an incident's surface to a description of a person's subconscious thought. These components organically form a mosaic of various people's lives. <br /> <br />Most characters are in their fifties, cling to their memories, and have some form of anxieties to feel that their lives have failed in one way or another.

His wife, tormented by his inexplicable behavior, wants to get him medical help, but her husband fears these threats to his freedom even more than death.

The novel bears more than a hint of social criticism, blaming the patriarchal culture for Clarissa's lack of choices, but even more than that it is a cry for help from an author who was plagued by her own fears and doubts.<br />As characters, the women are better realized than the men, and apart from the over-critical Peter and the intellectual light-weight Richard, most of the men are pretty unpleasant.

It's much better the second time around; the deft characterization and swiftly moving prose transport one into the different mindsets presented throughout.  This is almost &quot;Ulysses&quot; light; Woolf's stream-of-consciousness in a day is much more palatable than Joyce's monstrosity.

Instead, it is the shellshocked, suicidal, conflicted Septimus, a victim of World War I, who spends a good portion of his page time seeing his dead friend Evans.  Septimus shoulders the blame for Evans' death, and Septimus imagines that he is on trial, oftentimes muttering about his &quot;crime&quot; and &quot;guilt.&quot;  His only escape is suicide.  He is the only character whom Clarissa does not meet; this furthers the story and will perhaps muddle the novel for some.<br />Clarissa herself goes through her day in the life preparing for a party, running into old friends and remembering old ghosts.  The fact that she is an unhappy housewife questioning her choices makes the novel and the ultimate resolution all that more emotional and impactful.<br />This is one of the most overlooked books in America today; it is a work of genius from an author whose talent is terribly underrated.

Woolf wasn't overly fond of how James Joyce had executed his day-in-the-life tour de force, ULYSSES, so she decided to write her own, carving out in MRS.

Set in London in June 1923 Woolf creates an intriguing mix of characters. As Clarissa Dalloway is busy preparing for a party in the evening the narration cohesively jumps to Peter Walsh, her lover from years past. The reader also meets Sally Seton (her childhood friend), Elizabeth (Clarissa's daughter), Richard Dalloway (Clarissa's husband) and Septimus Warren Smith (a man suffering from shell shock from WW1) among others. Lack of action is fully compensated by the extraction of the inner workings of the character's consciousness. This aspect makes this book a success.

The novel unfolds over one sultry day in London as Clarissa Dalloway is preparing for a party she will give in the evening. Smith has battled against mental illness from his experiences in World War II. Clarissa kicks off the day buying flowers for the party. As the day unravels, narration begins to shift to different characters. Clarissa reminisces of her entangled love relationships at Bourton. During her earlier years, Clarissa caught herself between her fianc√©, Peter Walsh, her sensual female friend Sally Seton, and her husband Richard Dalloway. Much to Clarissa's surprise (as well as mine) is when all these old-time lovers reunion at the evening party in the presence of the Prime Minister. Peter Walsh shows up at Clarissa's doorstep right before the party after running off to India for some 25 years. The voluptuous Sally Seton also makes her entrance as Lady Rosseter. Present among the London elite are Sir Septimus Warren Smith and his wife. Smith has struggled with mental illness from his experiences of World War I. Incidents that lead to convergence of these characters is what makes the book a legacy (you have to read and find out).<br />The book overall does not manifest a structure. Virginia Woolf has told the story through the multiple point of views from the different characters. The book also explores the hidden thoughts, feelings, and actions and relies on which to tell the story. At the end the story is seamlessly woven together with the party being the meeting points of all her characters. The pleasure of reading this book stems from seeing how these characters have gone their own separate and unpredictable ways, headed off in their own directions, pinned by memory, and cross path again at the evening party. If you find reading The Hours somewhat confusing, Mrs. Dalloway is even more so, between the shifts of characters. For a tiny book Woolf has written prose that is packed with figurative language, poetic expressions, vivid details and provocative tones. The sensual affair between Clarissa and Sally is hinted at in a stifling manner. Michael Cunningham graciously makes that affair come into fruition by putting Clarissa and Sally in the same bedroom in The Hours. The book is simple in plot, but rich in language. That is, certain level of attentiveness is required for reading. I'm convinced that Michael Cunningham must have inherited Woolf's idiosyncratic language and long sentences!

It was a lovely surprise, actually.<br />I knew it was considered an \\""experimental\\"" novel, and focused on only one day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, a 50-something wife of an upper class and successful, but not quite successful enough governmental official. But I didn't know that the stream of consciousness as Clarissa prepares for a party that evening, and remembers and considers her life, is shared among multiple characters. I loved the way the viewpoint flowed among the characters, in a way, as if once they shared an experience on the street or in the park, the point of view would switch to the next person and follow him or her. It was fascinating and done even-handedly.<br />The flow of point of view brought out some key differences in the characters. Clarissa, while one empathizes with her, seems shallow and self-involved when compared with Septimus, the only one of the main characters who doesn't appear at the party at the end of the day. Septimus is seriously mentally ill, the result of shell shock from World War I. He has an Italian wife he has brought back to London with him from the war, and she is beside herself with worry. Her husband talks to people who aren't there. He writes cryptic notes to himself and leaves them about. She can't connect with him anymore. When it's her point of view, her loneliness is palpable and painful. She's losing hope. Septimus, who watched his war buddy die and \\""took it like a man\\"" is afraid he no longer feels anything, and has been getting \\""treatment\\"" from a family practitioner who has no idea what to do for his psychological problems.<br />Meanwhile, Clarissa prepares for her party by mending her gown. Her former love interest, the man she was involved with before she became engaged to her husband, Richard, comes back into her life from India and drops in her. She remembers that she always feels judged by Peter Walsh and sees him as someone who has made poor and ruinous errors in judgment where women are concerned. He's in London to get a divorce for his new interest, an Indian woman married to an Indian military officer, so that he can be with her. His being back in London and her receiving him in her home causes them to remember their pasts, including a woman, Sally, they had both known, who was very antiestablishment, and with whom Clarissa seems to have been in love, as well.<br />The day moves forward, and the author ingeniously inserts chiming clocks throughout the narrative to keep the reader anchored in time as the characters' minds flow back and forth over the years and the recent days. The contrast of Clarissa's and Septimus's lives is striking, and there is an idea that Peter Walsh's connection with India, Clarissa's thoughts about her own death and Septimus's pain over the death of his friend and his lack of feeling are commenting on a coming demise of the British Empire. When some characters speak of a patient's death during Clarissa's party, she is selfishly offended; though someone has died, she feels very petulantly negative toward those guests, thinking that they have \\""brought death to my party.\\""<br />The book is very thoughtful, very considered, and always, of course, subjective. It's a wonder to read because although it flows so well among all these people who tend to answer each other and make pointed contrasts, there is a lot to think about within this one day. One gains from this perception: You know Clarissa's feelings and you know others feelings about her.

In order not to miss any references in the movie, I first read \\""Mrs Dalloway,\\"" or tried to, as I ended up skimming it after the first 100 pages of its overall 192 page length.  I have difficulties with my eyes and tend to skim if the material being read is not rewarding to me, and I do not have to discuss the material in a book group I belong to.<br />\\""Mrs. Dalloway\\"" covers one day in the life of the title character who is the wife of a very well-to-do member of the British House of Commons.  The time is the early 1920's; Mr. Dalloway is influential enough to at least occasionally receive the Prime Minister at his home and to be invited to functions of the royal family.  That makes Mrs. Dalloway a social power house and at the end of this day she will give a dinner party which the Prime Minister is expected to attend.  She has a coterie of servants experienced with such dinners but she characteristically reserves certain tasks to herself.  The story starts as she walks from her home near Westminster Cathedral on a beautiful June day for exercise and to buy the flowers to be used at the dinner.  If you have spent some time in central London, the places she goes and the differences between then and now are interesting.<br />The story makes use of flashbacks, stream of consciousness techniques, and very long sentences strung together with commas, semi-colons and parentheses which can take a lot of work to decode, just as a recording of one's thoughts would be difficult to decode.  The writing, except for the flashbacks,  is similar to that of Henry James's \\""The Beast in the Jungle,\\"" published ca 1900; Woolf's publication date of 1925 makes her work almost contemporary with that of James.  James, however, never gives life to any character other than that of the lead male character, and then only to one facet of his life. Maureen Howard's introduction to my copy of the novel indicates that Woolf was consciously seeking to write in a new, unhackneyed form but hoped to avoid the appearance of the use of a \\""method.\\""  I think that, like James, who wrote \\""The Beast in the Jungle\\"" in his \\""arty\\"" period, Woolf's \\""art\\"" has made her novel a less than satisfying story for me.  There are similarities with Woolf's 1927 novel, \\""To the Lighthouse,\\"" with its much more accessible main character, Mrs. Ramsay, and which was a much more interesting read for me as I developed a fondness for Mrs. Ramsay but not for Mrs. Dalloway.  It seems to me that art was used with a lighter hand in the later novel and it is more intellectually stimulating.<br />According to one source, Woolf was very much interested in getting the reader to experience the flow of time and used various devices to achieve this.  The memory flashbacks allow the author to reach outside the events of the day and place some of the attendees at the dinner in perspective and tell how they have related to Mrs. Dalloway in the past, making their presence at the dinner more significant.  In contrast, \\""The Beast in the Jungle\\"" and \\""To the Lighthouse\\"" are more linear,covering very extended periods of time more in sequence.  <br />Both of the Woolf novels have a society matron as their central character and a dinner party takes a central place in both; in the later novel, however, the husband is an academic of much more modest means and all of the characters seem more accessible.  The principal difference is that place, a home in the country, is also a character in the later work, while it is not so in the case of the Dalloway's London home.  <br />Both novels are also impacted by the First World War in a peripheral way as Woolf relates the woman's view of the war, concerned with loved ones, not battles or great political and patriotic themes.<br />Woolf reaches outside Mrs Dalloway's society and brings in a character, Septimus Smith, who is rapidly losing his grip on reality, and his life will impact on Mrs. Dalloway's during the day.  It is not clear what Woolf's motive for bringing Smith into the story was.  Perhaps it was to contrast the somewhat artificial problems in Mrs. Dalloway's world, insulated as they were by wealth, to the real problems of Smith, having much more limited assets.  The events of the day in the lives of Smith and his Italian wife, Lucrezia, bring \\""real life\\"" into the dinner conversation that night and we read of Mrs. Dalloway's reaction to the intrusion into her party.  Smith's doctors are pictured<BR>as self-interested charlatans and one of them as bringing fear into the lives of Smith and his wife. Perhaps there was a connection with the doctors in Woolf's own troubled life into which mental illness intruded as an unwelcome stranger.  Woolf succeeds to some extent in making her characters \\""live\\"" but less so, for me, than in her later novel.<br />All in all a good read if you are very interested in the art if writing, less so if the story and characterization are your main interests.  If you are going to read only one Woolf work, \\""To the Light House\\"" is a better choice in my opinion.<br />By the way, my wife and I went to see \\""The Hours\\"" after I wrote the above.  The connection between the movie and the novel, \\""Mrs Dalloway,\\"" is very minor.  There is some attempt to portray a small part of Woolf's life with her husband but overall the movie was more of a propaganda piece for homosexuality which never struck me as a theme in Woolf's writings.  All of the major characters in the movie are portrayed as homosexuals.  Hollywood loves anything that pushes the envelope.",2003-02-17

The wife of Richard Dalloway, a member of Parliament, Mrs. Dalloway is someone who is skilled, like an artist, at creating the perfect party. But the resemblances to a character and a narrative from Jane Austen or Anthony Trollope end there, for Woolf's fictional agenda is consciously modern and her technique is entirely that of interior monologue, omniscient description and, most markedly, a stream of consciousness narrative. Thus, Woolf's text gracefully and imaginatively moves from the interiority of Clarissa Dalloway's thoughts, perceptions and memories to those of the her former lover, Peter Walsh, who has just returned from India, to those of Septimus Warren Smith, a kind of literary doppelganger to Clarissa, a broken young man who served in World War I and suffers the horrible psychological effects of that conflict. It is, in particular, Septimus who darkly hovers over the gaiety of Mrs. Dalloway's day and, ultimately, brings that psychological darkness to Mrs. Dalloway's party.<br />Continually challenging the reader, Woolf's difficult, stream of consiousness narrative technique brings the reader into the minds of the characters, the language on the page telling a coherent and deeply sensitive story by describing sensations, memories, feelings.

Mrs. Dalloway is a book to savour, every sentence, every phrase. A quick read it is not, even if quite a short novel! A few pages at a time is best, I found, to let it drift slowly into my soul. <br />It's like a long narrative poem, with exquistely perfect descriptions (what verbs!), dreamy stream-of-consciousness meanderings, and sudden cut-to-the-quick action. I found the sudden shifts into various character's points of view a little disconcerting at first -- whose head  am I in now? -- but soon came to realize the distinctive voices. <br />Unfolding over one hot summer day in London, we gradually ease closer and closer to Clarissa Dalloway's grand party. Flashing back to holiday scenes at Bourton, we learn about the tangled relationships between the young Clarissa, her n'er-do-well fianc√© Peter Walsh, her wild and sensual girlfriend Sally Seton, and her eventual Member of Parliament husband Richard Dalloway. Peter Walsh, who has been away in India some 25-30 years, turns up on Clarissa's doorstep the morning of the party. Sally Seton, now Lady Rosseter, unexpectedly waltzes onto the scene that evening. How do those sensual relationships of youth translate into a sophisticated party scene decades later, with the Prime Minister and much of upper crust London in attendance? (I won't give that away!)<br />As counterpoint to London high society, we have two other important characters, Septimus Warren Smith and his Italian milliner wife Rezia. Septimus suffers post-World War I shellshock, and we follow his descent into suicidal madness. The paths of Septimus and Rezia touch those of the other characters' ever so tangentially, little more than a quick brush in the street. Yet Woolf has seamlessly woven them together. <br />Altogether this is a hauntingly beautiful novel, one that will continue to reverberate through you.",2001-03-25

The novel is so complex and challenging that although I enjoyed it immesly the first time- the second and third I was able to associate the deeper meanings and appreciate the artistic, innovative writting style.<br />The first book I had read by this author (To the Lighthouse) left me much dissapointed with Ms. Woolfe.  But I started to read 'The Hours' (which you must read if you have read this!) and found to best appreciate that book, I had to read this one first.  I was pleasantly surprised to find such a unique and touching novel.  I related to it on so many different levels; to so many different characters.  Being a woman, I empathized with the struggle of Clarissa in her day of preparation and understood the insecurities she may have felt with her life choices but never would display to others.  <br />The authors clever writting style and literary genius was evident in this novel.  I know there may be many that don't appreciate Ms. Woolfe's talent= but if nothing else one must ascede that her manipulation of language is extraordinary.  Ms. Dalloway is almost sung off the pages of the book, I felt like I was getting a buetiful renoir painted before my eyes when reading.  I admit, that it is a book best enjoyed upon re-reading but it is so worth the investment!  After this, I am excited to go back and read the dreaded 'To the Lighthouse' and maybe find somethings with in that I  may have missed.

In Proust, the stunning use of memory and sense perception, as well as the stream of consciousness narrative of the great \\""roman fleuve\\"", marked the auspicious beginnings of a modern sensibility and technique in fiction.  Similarly, Joyce's difficult, blasphemous and similarly streaming novel, set in the course of a single day and emanating from the perceiving mind of its narrator, carried forward this sensibility and technique.  It is not surprising, then, that Virginia Woolf, while writing her brilliant and innovative \\""Mrs. Dalloway\\"", was reading these two authors at the time, for Woolf's novel stands as yet another masterful work of modern sensibility and technique, a classic in its own right.<br />\\""Mrs. Dalloway\\"" is set entirely during a single bright beautiful day in June, when Clarissa Dalloway is occupied by last minute preparations for a party she is having that evening.  The wife of Richard Dalloway, a member of Parliament, Mrs. Dalloway is someone who is skilled, like an artist, at creating the perfect party.  But the resemblances to a character and a narrative from Jane Austen or Anthony Trollope end there, for Woolf's fictional agenda is consciously modern and her technique is entirely that of interior monologue, omniscient description and, most markedly, a stream of consciousness narrative.  Thus, Woolf's text gracefully and imaginatively moves from the interiority of Clarissa Dalloway's thoughts, perceptions and memories  to those of the her former lover, Peter Walsh, who has just returned from India, to those of Septimus Warren Smith, a kind of literary doppelganger to Clarissa, a broken young man who served in World War I and suffers the horrible psychological effects of that conflict.  It is, in particular, Septimus who darkly hovers over the gaiety of Mrs. Dalloway's day and, ultimately, brings that psychologicaldarkness to Mrs. Dalloway's party.<br />Continually challenging the reader, Woolf's difficult, stream of consiousness narrative technique brings the reader into the minds of the characters, the language on the page telling a coherent and deeply sensitive story by describing sensations, memories, feelings.  But it is worth the effort, for \\""Mrs. Dalloway\\"" is truly one of the great works of Twentieth century English literature, a modern novel that can stand comfortably, albeit diminuitively, next to The Great Marcel and the creator of Bloom's Day.",2000-10-25

Although Clarissa and Septimus never meet, it is through the interweaving of each one's story into a gossamer whole that Woolf works her genius.<br />The book is set on a June day in 1923, as Clarissa prepares for a party that evening.  Unfolding events trigger memories and recollections of her past, and Woolf offers these bits and pieces to the reader who must then construct the psychological and emotional makeup of Clarissa Dalloway in his own mind.  We also learn much about Clarissa through the thoughts of other characters, such as her one-time lover, Peter Walsh, her friend, Sally Seton, her husband, Richard and her daughter Elizabeth.<br />It is Septimus Warren Smith, however, driven to the brink of insanity by the war, an insanity that even his wife's tender ministrations cannot cure, who acts as Clarissa's societal antithesis and serves to divide her world into the &quot;then&quot; and the &quot;now.&quot;<br />In this extremely complex and character-driven novel, Woolf offers her readers a challenge.  The novel is not separated into chapters; almost all of the action occurs in the thoughts and reminiscences of the characters and the reader must piece together the story from the random bits and pieces of information each character provides.  The complexity of the characters may add to the frustration because Woolf makes it difficult for the reader to receive any single dominant impression of any one of them.  This, however, forms the essence of the novel and displays the genius of Woolf:  It is impossible to describe any human being in a simple phrase or collection of adjectives.  We are many things to many people, all of them somewhat different, none of them the same, just as we are many things to ourselves.<br />Throughout the book, the reader is constantly called upon to compare and contrast Peter Walsh and Richard Dalloway, the two significant love interests in Clarissa Dalloway's life.  Compared to Peter, an adventurer, Richard Dalloway appears more than a bit reserved and dour.  But, readers must constantly question this view of Richard as his personality seems to alter with his altering relationships.<br />Intimacy, particularly emotional intimacy, and the preservation of one's uniqueness are two of Woolf's continuing themes.  We find that Clarissa married Richard, in part, to preserve her sense of self; Peter would have demanded far more of her than she was, perhaps, willing to give.  Here, Clarissa and Septimus, so outwardly different, would find they share much in common.  While Clarissa feels threatened by her daughter's tenacious tutor, Miss Kilman, as well as by Peter, Septimus feels threatened by his doctor.  Each feels the others are asking too much.  Septimus and Clarissa even agree on the subject of death:  &quot;There is no death,&quot; Septimus declares, while Clarissa, the atheist, secretly believes that bits and pieces of her will remain intact forever.<br />Although some characters in this book may, at first, appear to be one-dimensional, we soon learn that all are extraordinarily complex.  There is Sally, impulsive yet considerate; Richard, bashful yet timid; Peter inhibited yet adventurous; Septimus, insane yet credible.  And Clarissa?  She is all of these things and more.<br />It is, however, Woolf's torrential stream-of-consciousness prose that makes this novel a true masterpiece.  Even those who find the plot of little interest will be drawn in by the exquisiteness of Woolf's language.  This is a complex, character study in the fullest sense of theword, one with no easy answers, for Woolf, in the end seems to be telling us that perhaps, at our essence, we are all unknowable, even to ourselves.",2000-10-09

I find it a challenge  to follow Woolf's stream-of-consciousness prose and because her plots are  rather mundane (about average people in fairly average circumstances) She  bores me.  I recognize the 'greatness' that is Virginia Woolf, and perhaps  others would think me a philistine because I cannot wax eloquent about her  ability to capture whatever it is about people that reviewers find so  captivating.  Perhaps I find that I simply can't identify with any of the  characters in her books and therefore have a hard time getting excited  about what they are thinking and feeling, let alone doing.  Mrs. Dalloway,  Clarissa, is presented in this book as the protagonist in the description  of one day (in her life).  The secondary characters, her husband, her  sister and nieces and nephews, an old flame, and a horribly mad young man  and his confused wife, are of limited interest as well.

The plot is nothing to speak of -- it's  similar to a Jane Austen book when lots of interesting and  not-so-interesting people interact in their mundane lives.  It's what Woolf  does with the subtle interactions and her stream of conscious writing that  makes this book so good.  Having read maybe 6 of Woolf's works, my favorite  is still To the Lighthouse.  Maybe that's because Mrs. Ramsey is so much  more human -- Mrs. Dalloway is always described as distant and cold.  This  book is a love story of sorts about how Clarissa turns down the true love  of her life and instead marries a wealthy politician.

I was really looking forward to reading this book because I was under the impression that other people liked it. As I found out later, this is not necessarily the case and I can understand why. It's not that Mrs. Dalloway is a bad book and, in fact, it gets better as it goes along and even has some profound quotes, such as, \\""Nothing exists outside us except a state of mind.\\""<br /><br />The book is incredibly detailed and vivid in its descriptions, and Woolf does a great job of really getting inside of the heads of various characters. The problem is the stream of consciousness writing made it difficult to recognize transitions from one person to the next. No matter what page I was on, I felt like I was having aha moments about two pages before. I was always reading a few pages of my comprehension. The result is that I can look back on the book with some fondness, but I remember the difficulties I encountered. My favorite parts were those pertaining to Septimus and Rezia (even more so than Mrs. Dalloway herself). Theirs was a palpable and tragic story that I could have read an entire book about.<br /><br />To be fair to the book, I skipped the Introduction. It was more or less a play-by-play of the entire book and I thought that reading it would ruin the story for me. Instead, I read it after I finished the book and it put things into better context for me. If I were to do it over again, though, I still don't think I would have read the Introduction first. I don't like knowing everything that's going to happen in a book, even if it makes it \\""easier\\"" to get through. The book has a great quote that says, \\""It is a thousand pities never to say what one feels,\\"" and so, I will be honest..... I could have just read the Introduction and skipped reading the book altogether and come away with the same amount of comprehension. But that's neither here nor there and I am left feeling ambiguous about the book. I enjoyed it after the fact, but not as much while reading it.",2013-02-03
