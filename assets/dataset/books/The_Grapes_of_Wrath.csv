US	1632546	R1Y7LBVKHECHJI	0143039431	999720718	The Grapes of Wrath	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Still very much relatable today	I’ve read plenty of books with anti-capitalist themes, but not one has been so fantastic as John Steinbeck‘s The Grapes of Wrath. It was unexpectedly post-apocalyptic, at times funny, and it brought the finer points of my pro-worker politics to light. This, I thought, is perfect. This is why I feel the way I feel. Today, more than 75 years after its initial publication, the plight of the Joad family and the events surrounding their exodus continue to be relevant.<br /><br />A few weeks ago, I didn’t expect to finish The Grapes of Wrath. I was tutoring a rising 9th grader who could not have been more disinterested in the work we were doing, and who practically refused to read the book because he found it boring. Even though I wholeheartedly believe his attitude will get him nowhere in his education — One cannot, after all, only read the books one enjoys and expect to succeed. — I do believe that the book is one of those unfortunate titles taught at what is, for many students, the wrong time.<br /><br />There’s no time better to learn about the darker side of our world than in early adolescence, when children can be inspired to make a difference, and are not so set in their ways that they will ignore any hard evidence that contradicts their beliefs. However, the sad fact of the matter is that most students aren’t capable of understanding the gravity of The Grapes of Wrath at 14-years-old, and many teachers — particularly young ones — aren’t well-equipped to help children identify what, exactly, is going on in the novel. For example, you can give students Chapter 5, and I’m sure they’ll sense the desperation and outrage of the tenant farmers, but they won’t be able to put a finger down and say, “That’s the Theory of Alienation!” And how many of our overworked, underpaid educators will be able to identify and teach the same?<br /><br />Don’t think I’m knocking the individuals who file into school buildings, day-in and day-out, to teach our children and mold them into upstanding citizens. I’m not. It’s just that reading such a wonderful treatise on community and capitalism makes me wonder how many high school freshmen are actually getting the full dose of meaning and nuance in The Grapes of Wrath.<br /><br />But on to lighter subjects. Reading The Grapes of Wrath, more often than not, brought The Stand to mind. The Joads’ cross-country journey is full of peril and loss. When anyone breaks off from the herd, you know they won’t be seen again in this world. There is a sense, with every new character added, that they will be the family’s undoing. Despite the novel’s positive rendering of migrant communities as open, accepting, and helpful, I couldn’t shake the thought that anyone met on the road could be a coiled snake, waiting to strike.<br /><br />That’s putting my own experience to it, however. Nothing in The Grapes of Wrath suggests that the poor are out to get others who are impoverished. Rather, all of the peril is external. It’s the police, the guards, the capitalists that the proletariat have to fear. Acts of God are unfortunate and strike at the most inopportune moments, but the unfairness of the anti-migrant prejudice in The Grapes of Wrath is blatantly and unnecessarily cruel. Steinbeck presents the discrimination from both sides, forcing readers to examine their own presumptions about others, and to realize that, whenever we judge our neighbors, we have not read their histories as we have the Joads’; our own statements, then — about people of other races, creeds, and economic classes — may be just as unjustified as those directed at the migrants.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath is brilliantly relevant today, at a time when racism and anti-immigrant bias are still so pervasive that presidential candidates can remain in the running after calling Hispanic immigrants rapists and thieves, or after suggesting that “[i]mmigration without assimilation is an invasion.”For those of you who haven’t yet read the novel — or who remember it only as a book about a family migrating from Oklahoma to California — as well as those of you looking for your next group read, I can do nothing but encourage you to pick up this book. The Grapes of Wrath is one of the most discuss-able novels I’ve ever read, and it’s well worth the few hours it will take you to read it.For those of you who haven’t yet read the novel — or who remember it only as a book about a family migrating from Oklahoma to California — as well as those of you looking for your next group read, I can do nothing but encourage you to pick up this book.

Steinbeck was a gifted writer who had used his writing skills to promote his political agenda (and he doesn't hide it - if you look up his interviews regarding the book, he stated his political intentions clearly). The language is most simplistic and unsophisticated, hence accessible to most readers NOT able to handle Charles Dickens - the book is not written for literature lovers but for simple folks. Sort sentences in simple combinations create a story that expertly vilifies whatever the author wants at the moment.<br />A capitalism hater, he describes technological progress in the 20th century as inherently evil and a root cause of all extreme poverty. There is a entire chapter vilifying a tractor - it starves people to death - see, before tractors, people used to plow by hand. The chapter states &#34;What kind of a crop would be produced by a land that has not known man's touch, but has been plowed by the machine? We have felt every inch of the land with our bare hands, and it has known love. Now, it only knows the machine.&#34; - this is not the exact quote but close.<br />Entire book is like this. Every progress made 100 years ago in technology made someone starve. Capitalism are the reason for mass starvation following the great dust bowl.<br />The book ignores solid economics and American history - such things that the great dust bowl was caused by massive agricultural practices that destroyed the grasslands, and tractors helped feed millions of people and significantly increased the crop production, that capitalists only remained in business so long as they could sell their goods to people at acceptable price - and low prices on products are driven by a need to sell it and not to starve workers.<br />Steinbeck deserves credit for being able to develop the most preposterous ideas using simple words. If he, say, wanted to write that my desk lamp had caused the recent train derailment in New York state, he could have done it most convincingly, and unsophisticated people would have believed it to be absolutely true. For this ability, he deserves credit, and two stars instead of one.erailment in New York state, he could have done it most convincingly, and unsophisticated people would have believed it to be absolutely true.

The Joad family fell victim to the Dust Bowl and the power-hungry acquisition of land by big agriculture capitalist ventures. The family was forced to leave the farm and they decided to migrate to California. The journey didn't live up to the expectations that this would be an ideal place to live. The family faced an incredibly difficult journey to the West Coast. When they arrived, the found that wages were low and supply was far more than demand. There was a hostility to poor &#34;Okies&#34; flooding the region and settling into migrant camps.<br /><br />Life was day-to-day survival. Elder family members died as the journey was too much to handle. There was a good amount of fear as Tom Joad Jr. was constantly trying to stay out of trouble with the law. Rose of Sharon was abandoned by her husband. She was emotionally desolate and delivered a stillborn baby. The family was hard working with moral values. They were trying their best to be self-reliant, but there just weren't enough jobs to go around.<br /><br />Steinbeck wrote from a leftist perspective where greedy industrialists were the antagonists in the story. He contrasted this with the government-run ideal community where people effectively governed and provided for themselves. The family found some relief there, although they were forced to leave because there wasn't enough work available in the region. Reverend Casy was a controversial figure in the story. He was a preacher who lost his faith. The book puts organized religion in a bad light. I personally didn't like or agree with the perspective, but it does bring up a valid point of people's faith being tested in hard times.<br /><br />Overall, the book is brilliantly written and with vivid detail. The story is engaging throughout. The narrative provides an essential voice of the era. It runs counter to the idea that people are solely responsibly for financial ruin. Many are victims of forces beyond their control or the greedy powers that be. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and found a lot of value in the message. This is despite the fact that organized religion is put in such a negative light. That was the one issue I had with the book.re victims of forces beyond their control or the greedy powers that be.

A couple years back I decided to start reading all the classics that I never read before, assuming that people called them 'classics' for good reason.  For the life of me I cannot understand how this book is a classic.  Maybe the bar was set lower or differently when the book came out (I am, after all, reading the book 75 years after it was written), and people had different priorities, but I thought this whole thing was just awful.  The descriptions of settings and scenery were well worded, but the characters were all one dimensional; maybe Tom was two dimensional but just barely.  Uncle john was a whiney little biatch who needs to man up.  Al needs to stop thinking with his... ya know.  There was no character development.  Throughout the entire ordeal nobody seemed to learn from their mistakes.  Despite never having a steady income the family would spend frivolously as soon as they earned some cash.  Instead of thinking several months into the future and just buying pork and potatoes and I dunno, rice and beans?  They would buy bacon, bread, cracker jacks, coffee and sugar.  The milk I sorta understand every now and then due to nutritional needs.  But they were buying new clothes that they didn't need, hats, gloves, a new stove when the old one worked just fine but didn't look pretty enough.<br /><br />How am I supposed to have pity or empathy for these people if they are too stupid to learn and grow as viable human beings.  Oh boo hoo, we have nothing to eat today, uhm, well, maybe you shouldnt have bought one meals worth of bacon instead of 3 days worth of potatoes!?  And don't even get me started on the garbage, anti-climactic, lack of closure ending.  I spent a solid month reading some of this book every other day before going to bed and I am rewarded with nothing but bitterness for the books wasting my time.	2015-04-15

The extended Joad Family is evicted from the land in Oklahoma they farm as sharecroppers and you feel like you are accompanying them as they make a perilous journey to California in search of work.  The Joads are like real people you know.  You alternately love them, wish they didn't do foolish things, want to help them and feel their suffering.  These are hardy people who deal somehow with obstacles that would crush most people quickly.  A story of an America not that long past where there was little safety net and the collapse of the economy made it hard for even people who wanted to work to survive.  Not to be missed.	2015-03-07

This is quite a long read, with very detailed descriptions, and lots of symbolism and meaning behind it. For a younger dyslexic, it was a bit difficult since the author wrote the characters speech with accents and older Midwest slang that younger generations probably wouldn't know. However, I definitely recommend reading it for anyone who is interested in history. It is fiction, but much of the events reflect real life history in the western US. You get emotionally attached to the characters, and see them change in their perspectives and you really get the sense of the tragedy that befell many people during that time.	2015-02-18

Why, Tom, we’re the people that live. They ain’t gonna wipe us out. Why, we’re the people – we go on.&#34;– Ma Joad<br /><br />When nothing will grow on your farm in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl, when half your house has been bulldozed away by your landowner, when you sell as many belongings as you can, buy a car, add a makeshift trailer and pile three generations of your family inside and on top, next to mattresses, frying pans, barrels, a couple slaughtered and salted pigs and a dog, for the longest journey you’ve ever made, where do you get your strength? You get it from your family and the people around you who are struggling just like you.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath is one of the greatest American stories of endurance ever told. It’s a fictional account of the Joad family and a real-life depiction of the western migration of about two hundred thousand displaced farm workers during The Great Depression, people who left their homes in Oklahoma and the surrounding states with the promise of work and a better life in California. When they reach California and discover what the real relationship is between big-time farmers and poor migrants, when they are forced to take pennies for a long day of picking peaches or cotton or grapes, when they earn barely enough to feed their families, even when they live in tents and shacks and railroad cars and are nearly starving, they don’t give up.<br /><br />Maybe you’ve never read The Grapes of Wrath. There’s so much information and analysis about this great classic, I don’t think I can come close to offering anything new. So I’m just going to tell you what I like about the story.<br /><br />  The characters are terrific. Some are strong, some are weak, but they face their ordeal with surprising optimism, even when there is little hope.<br /><br />  My favorite is Ma. She isn’t afraid to assert herself and her quick thinking gets the family out of more than a few tough situations. She talks plain, but she’s smart and insightful. When Pa complains that Ma is telling him what to do, he suggests that “it’s purty near time to get out a stick.” Ma stands up to him. “You get your stick, Pa. Times when they’s food an’ a place to set, then maybe you can use your stick an’ keep your skin whole…But you jus’ get you a stick now an’ you ain’t lickin’ no woman; you’re a fightin’, cause I got a stick all laid out too.” She makes crucial decisions by instinct. She understands people and has a vision of what things can be like if everyone pulls together. She accepts everyone’s weaknesses and sees how they can contribute.<br /><br />  Jim Casy, the preacher, is another character with depth and vision. He’s humble and he understands his sins. The fact that he questions his ability to preach makes his ideas all the more powerful. He seems to have it right when he says, “I got thinkin’ how we was holy when we was one thing, an’ mankin’ was holy when it was one thing. An’ it on’y got unholy when one mis’able little fella got the bit in his teeth an’ run off his own way, kickin’ and draggin’ an’ fightin’. Fella like that bust the holiness.”<br /><br />  I like how the family forgives each other for their weaknesses. They don’t dwell on them. Tom Joad has served his time for murder and the family accepts him. They understand when Noah goes off. When Al goes out “tomcatting,” they accept this as inevitable. Instead, they see how great he is with the car and they give him confidence. They tolerate Uncle John’s occasional drunkenness. They understand that’s the only way he can cope with his own sorrow. They accept Rosasharn’s preoccupation with her pregnancy, Granma’s and Grandpa’s craziness. They know that they can’t change some things. They focus instead on getting to California.<br /><br />  When tragedy strikes again and again, theydeal with it. They don’t feel sorry for themselves. They aren’t passive. They defend themselves if they have to. They try to do things right, but they don’t feel guilty about things when they cut corners or break some rules. And they aren’t afraid. When the service station boy tells Tom he has nerve for crossing the California desert in the night, Tom answers plainly, “It don’t take no nerve to do somepin when there ain’t nothin’ else you can do.”<br /><br />  They are generous. Even when they have nothing, they offer to help their neighbors. And their neighbors help in return. They have their community of family and shantytown neighbors.<br /><br />When The Grapes of Wrath was published, Steinbeck said, “I've done my damndest to rip a reader's nerves to rags.” He put heart and soul into expressing his outrage over the treatment of these poor migrant farm workers and he did it with vivid descriptions and powerful characters.<br /><br />Did you read The Grapes of Wrath in high school or college? Have you read it more than once? This is my third time and I give it five bookmarks for its lasting story and important message.deal with it. They don’t feel sorry for themselves.

I read this book in college and was bowled over by it.  The vividness of the characters and their truly human needs, desires and sufferings made me feel as if I was part of their family.  Such hardship is unfortunately too common in this world, and more unfortunate is the fact that we as Americans have done all we can to distance ourselves from recognizing and empathizing with such suffering.  A book like this is indispensable if you want to understand just how fragile our way of life is and how quickly it can turn to ruin.  As the main character seems to emblematize, all any of us ultimately possess (in good times or bad) is our character, our ethics.	2014-11-29

This was my first read of Steinbeck’s fictional account of one family trying to survive in dust-ravaged, Great Depression of the 1930’s.  Today The Grapes of Wrath is often assigned to high school students, but I am glad that I waited until I had a world of experience behind me before tackling the novel because much of the subtleties of the constant war on the poor would have slipped by me.  The parallels between then and now are stark and disturbing.<br /><br />Steinbeck styled his book in sort of a sing-song manner with chapters about the struggles of the Joad family alternating with chapters of a more general nature that describe how society functioned at the time.  In those expository chapters he talked about the banks, foreclosures, car dealers, corporate farming, red-baiting, the eternal connection between police and people with property, the physical effects of malnutrition and lack of medical services, and the poor treatment of migrant workers desperate to simply survive.  Much of what he described about America in the 1930’s can be overlaid onto contemporary society with embarrassingly few wrinkles.<br /><br />Steinbeck’s 1939 look at America in the Great Depression struck a deep chord within society – so much so that many felt it was dangerous to the established social order.  The book was immediately banned by the libraries of Kern County, California, which was in the center of the large and heartless corporate farm system that Steinbeck described with such horrific clarity.  Over the intervening years The Grapes of Wrath has made its way onto numerous banned book lists because of the threat some believed it posed to social order.<br /><br />The book has also made its way onto several lists of the best one hundred novels of the last century, often landing in the top ten.  It is truly an important work.<br /><br />The fictional Joads were originally small farmers whose ancestors had fought in the American Revolution.  They had homesteaded and raised several generations on the small Oklahoma family farm before crop failures forced them to mortgage their home and land to the bank.  As the banks acquired the Joad land and the land of their neighbors, the once independent farmers became tenant farmers or sharecroppers.  Eventually the banks and their masters, corporate America, decided that the way to maximize profits on the land was to drive the tenants out, knock down the fences, and plant massive fields of cotton.  Their tractors pushed houses off of their foundations so the farmers could not return and squat on the property, and even yards were plowed up for cotton.<br /><br />At the same time, handbills were appearing that described California as a land of plenty, and a land of plenty of work.  The Joads, like thousands of other “Okies,” sold off their excess possessions for pennies on the dollar, bought jalopies that were priced at far more than their actual worth, and headed West to pick fruit and start over in a Promised Land.  After a journey of much hardship in which both grandparents died, the family finally reached California – where there was an intentional glut of workers (the real reason for all of the handbills) and wages were extremely low.  Workers rushed from farm to farm begging work and taking what they could get at a depressed wage.  When there were no crops to pick, community pressures (and often violence) forced them to move on – “And don’t come back until the cotton is ready to be picked!”<br /><br />The only reprieve the Joad family had was a month when they managed to get into a government camp, a wonderful place with hot showers and flush toilets.  The camp was an experiment in self-governance that angered the local growers who did not want any of their workforce to be spoiled with good conditions.  The local growers were focused on ways to disrupt life at the camp and get it shut down.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath takes the concept of survival down to the bare essentials.  It is a gritty portrait of the haves versus the have-nots, and the struggles that some faced in getting ahead while others struggled equally hard to stay ahead and keep the rabble down.  In one particularly poignant scene, Ma Joad, the family matriarch and backbone, lamented to a company store operator who had just risked his job by making her a loan of ten cents to buy sugar:<br /><br />“I’m learnin’ one thing good,” she said.  “Learnin it all a time, ever’ day.  If you’re in trouble, hurt, or need – go to poor people.  They’re the only ones that’ll help – the only ones.”<br /><br />Amen, Ma Joad.  Some things never change.he camp and get it shut down.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath takes the concept of survival down to the bare essentials.

One of the things I like most about Steinbeck's writing is that he can really tell a story.  His books are full of colourful characters who are not superheroes but ordinary people. The last time I read this book was in high-school so I wanted to re-read it to remind myself why it's held in such high regard.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath deals with the dustbowl years. They were a hard and impoverishing time in the USA when the weather and politics combined to drive people off the land and into cities in search for jobs. Farmers watched as the wind literally picked up their top-soil and blew it all away. Hard working families packed up what they could and took to the roads, often in a southerly direction, looking for jobs.<br />There was great animosity towards these 'migrant' workers and this conflict is well captured in this book.<br />Steinbeck had the ability to draw people in such a way that we empathise with them  regardless which side of the argument they are in.	2014-09-07

Purpose of the ethnic cleansing: form a revolutionary vanguard.  Looking at the dust bowl / migration of the Okies this new way makes the most sense of events that transpire in the novel.<br />According to the novel Okies were forced from the land because of drought and because land owners wanted to use tractors to cultivate large fields of cotton.  Why weren’t the Okies hired to build irrigation systems for the fields and perform other tasks such as weed / insect control and harvesting?<br />According to the novel Okies were given hand bills stating that there were many jobs in CA.  When the inflow of Okies was too great why didn’t authorities step in and stem the flow of Okies to CA?  It seems the authorities should have had a reasoned program to diffuse the Okies throughout the US.<br />According to the novel shanty towns sprang up in CA.  A shanty town is burned down by the locals.  Their reason: to keep the Okies moving so they can’t sign up for relief.  There were many communists in CA. Why give the communists a powerful rallying point?  Could the locals see the advantages of the Okies going on relief?  If one sector is working for slave wages this puts other sectors in jeopardy.  Employers can hire the Okies cheaply for many kinds of non-agricultural jobs.<br />According to the novel the federal government set up a camp to house the displaced Okies called Weedpatch.  The Okies who have survived the journey are disoriented; their ties to traditional religion have been weakened by the deaths of the older Okies.  Weedpatch is a Communist Collective; the residents are trained to see the advantages of collectivization. A weed is a plant that grows very fast, can spread very rapidly and has survival advantages over delicate cultivated plants; a plant that conventional wisdom despises.  This explains the name Weedpatch which is an unlikely name for a facility for displaced persons.<br />The Okies are radicalized by the harshness of their working conditions, the burning down of their shanty towns and by the training they receive at Weedpatch.  Another inducement: the invasion of Weedpatch by the local police.  Three things aren’t clear: 1. what the local authorities would do with Weedpatch once they invaded it, 2. why Weedpatch didn’t have some sort of agreement with the local police that would allow the police reasonable access, 3. why, if the police secretly wanted to foment a riot at Weedpatch as a pretext for invasion, they apparently let this information out to a local business association, which informed its members, one of whom informed the Okies.  It does make sense as a clever way to radicalize the Okies.  The place where they receive humane treatment is subject to invasion by the police.  Yet, they are able to outwit the police because the police have inexplicably informed a local business organization of plans that need to be kept secret in order to work effectively.for displaced persons.<br />The Okies are radicalized by the harshness of their working conditions, the burning down of their shanty towns and by the training they receive at Weedpatch.

As somebody who researched the Dust Bowl, I was hesitant to read this classic and masterpiece. As somebody who has seen the classic American film adaptation, I can assure you that you will see the legendary Henry Fonda as Tom Joad and nobody else in the role.<br /><br />The film was faithful to the novel which illustrates in words about how the Dust Bowl and the migration of the Joad family to California came to be. The first hundred or so pages has newly paroled Tom returning home after four years in prison. He learns from a former preacher, Casy, about the harrowing Dust Bowl and its disastrous effects on his family and others. Casy has become disillusioned and a broken down man overall. Tom used to look up to the old preacher but Casy has become more of a prisoner than Tom himself.<br /><br />When Tom learns that the Joads are moving to California, he goes with them. The journey in their jalopy is long, painful, and tragic as well. Once there, California turns out to be another adventure where unfriendly locals don't take kindly to the Okies.<br /><br />Steinbeck's masterpieces chronicled an average Oklahoma family trying to survive in the Great Depression. The Joads had left their Oklahoma homestead by force. California was the promised land that didn't live up to the promises falsely advertised to them.<br /><br />Steinbeck fuses fiction and fact with poetic imagery to explain the hardships of the time period. The Great Depression is one of America's darkest and most harrowing times in history. The Dust Bowl years crippled the Plains states like Oklahoma and others. When you see how the Dust Storms effected a preacher like Casy, you realized its damage and effects on his psyche.<br /><br />This book should be read by everybody. It is one of those books to be reread over and over again in order to be fully appreciated.	2014-08-14

What makes a great reading experience is clearer. The Grapes of Wrath, like Gone with the Wind, is so alive that the reader enters its world and lives and breathes with its characters, and when the book is finished, always remembers Tom Joad and Ma, as he or she remembers Scarlett and Rhett and Melanie and Ashley. It's like the shower scene in \\"Psycho,\\" like Hamlet, like Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski, characters bigger than life, characters not based on life but life based on such characters. Willie Loman. Dolek Berson from \\"The Wall\\" by John Hersey that no one has ever heard of but which is the great Jewish novel to come out of the Warsaw Ghetto, oddly, written by the Christian son of missionaries, who born in China but was in the army when Europe was liberated.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath is more urgent today than ever, when cliches like the 99 percent and the 1 percent, are batted around by those in the know, when cyborgs on cell phones wander unheeding controlled by electronics with no thought of anything, especially their own urges. Steinbeck rued the tractor over the plow. In the 1970s the hippies from the 1960s wanted to move away from the cities and live on the land. All that brouhaha, of which I was a loud and silent member, fought for nothing. It is no wonder that millennials might think this work is inane, old-fashioned, or whatever. Their world is totally money-based, with short-attention spans, no thought of the morrow, a political body respected only by the rabid, by idiots who really signify nothing, full of fury and sound. Born-again Christians whose only goal really is, well, defined by the saying, There's a sucker born every minute. Money, money, money. Companies that make all of their dough in the US, outsourcing all their lower-level jobs to places like India to save a buck.<br /><br />So here you have the Joad family who, unlike the homeless and the insane, come to California to find work, not to live off the guilt feelings of the populace, spend their money on booze or drugs, and sit all day with their cups out, looking for a free lunch. They look for work and they wind up part of a grey diaspora.<br /><br />Steinbeck never rose as high. I just finished East of Eden, which I liked, but it is on a whole other level, a lower level than Grapes. The work is so focused, so intent. E. M. Forster said a novel is a work of a certain length that has a flaw in it.  Steinbeck's flaws, I think, are those slices of life, probably, in his mind, written to give universal meaning to his specific story, but which actually slows down the action.<br /><br />If everyone would only read The Grapes of Wrath perhaps . . . perhaps. . . .

US	22216877	R2UUTVWNRUAKQ5	0143039431	999720718	The Grapes of Wrath	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Almost more relevant now than when it was written	Replace farmers from Oklahoma with migrant workers from Mexico and I doubt you'd be able to tell that this novel was written back in 1939. And that's what really stuck me about this novel - how relevant it still is - in some ways even more now than then.<br /><br />The first similarity is economic. As I write this we are still either going through a 'great recession' or are slowly emerging from an economic downturn. The causes are different, of course, here in the novel it was bad farming techniques mixed with new technology that drove the farmers from their land. Today it's an over-saturated housing market - people banking all their futures on the bubble of hope that perhaps the value of their own home will increase enough for them to make a tidy profit. And just like land that's been worked too hard, people worked the housing market too hard and it collapsed. Banks came to take the farms in the novel and banks came to take the homes in our own time.<br /><br />And both examples were of people running as fast as they could just to stay a little ahead of disaster. The farmers grew crops that destroyed the soil because they had no choice - they couldn't compete with the new farms, the corporate farms and machine efficiency. A family can't compete with a fleet of harvesters and tractors - working the land by hand can't keep up with a tractor. And the same goes for the people with houses these days. Everybody borrowed on cheap credit from the bank to hopefully 'buy low' and then 'sell high', but when everyone does it then there isn't no value in any of it and it all falls apart and everyone still owes the banks. And all they wanted was a piece of a dream, a chance to stay afloat economically, to send their kids to a good college, to make the car payments, put food on the table.<br /><br />In the novel the Californian's hated the Oakies, called them lazy, called them animals, called them thieves; in today's world we call the homeowners who lost it all idiots, greedy, lazy. But we also hate the banks. Call the banks greedy, inhumane, a great machine that's too big to die and too big to fail and everybody has to keep feeding it because nobody is really too sure how to control it anymore.<br /><br />But there is one difference, and that's the work. When the people lost the value on their homes, when the banks realized that the amount of money in the economy was based on a weak speculation and that there was actually a lot less money than there really was, when that caused credit to dry up, and when that caused smaller businesses to close up because they couldn't run the businesses with no credit, which in turn caused people to lose their jobs, and that caused the economy to drag down deeper and created a vicious cycle that made it worse and worse - after all that, the people had nowhere to go because all the 'poor jobs', the type of work Steinbeck writes about in the novel had all been taken by the immigrants.<br /><br />And that cussed more issues. The poor American middle-class blamed the Mexican's and now militia patrol the borders to kick the Mexican's out or do worse things in the desert at night when nobody is looking. A man like Casey in the novel is no different than a immigrant getting killed by some militia border patrol.<br /><br />And that causes resentment on all sides and the center can't hold.<br /><br />And that's just the economic similarity between the novel and today's times. Politically it's the same too. A conservative will say the poor just gotta work, but the conservative will also be on the side of the businessman and when everyone needs work, the businessman can keep wages down and in turn keep the poor really poor. But that's supposed to be ok because the conservative will say the poor can take help from a charity or a church - but that's easy to tell someone else when it's not you having to beg and take charity, easy to tell another man to beg. But the conservative man is holding on by a thread as thin as can be too and he's causing his own demise because soon the corporation will put him out of work too, his job will be lost and he'll have to go begging and he won't be so mean and conservative anymore. He'll see the value of sticking by your fellow man instead of blaming him for his troubles.<br /><br />And that's what the book is about - about family, about sticking together, about helping, about not letting the fruit on the vine rot when others go in need. And that's why it's an even more radical novel today than when it was written because it 'smells' of Communism or of Socialism. And the conservative man doesn't want to hear about that, he doesn't want a union because union men are lazy and he doesn't want socialism because the government will tell him what to do and he doesn't want communism because he can take care of his own family.<br /><br />That is until he can't, then he'll be singing a different tune or he'll be turning on his own people like some of the people in the novel who turned against their own just to put food on the table; the great selfishness.<br /><br />That's the saddest thing about the book - how spot on Steinbeck was about human nature. And for as beautiful as the novel is, as well written as it is, nothing can compare to how true it is. And maybe that's the thing that makes people still so angry about it - that it reveals a truth we don't want to accept about ourselves, that deep down we know that they way we live, that the American dream is not working, that it never really worked and that we either side with the people who will toss us on the heap of irrelevance or we fight the powers that be. And maybe if we worried a little more about if their neighbor has enough in his bowl and a little less about if we have enough in our own then maybe things would be better.<br /><br />The novel is a microcosm of American, then and now. And that's quite an achievement because how many novels ring this true 75 years after they were written? And the novel is a damning indictment too, and that's why it still scares people.<br /><br />And that ending. What an ending too. It's both hopeful and sad. It's religious and it turns religion on it's head too. It's bleak and yet it's also comforting.<br /><br />Now I didn't realize it at first, but this is the third in a series of books I've been reading that deal explicitly with society - 'The Seven Pillars of Wisdom' talked about a people fighting for their independence in the deserts of Arabia, '100 Years of Solitude' about a village coping with modernity, and now this novel about a country having to find a new direction. And they are also about the poor, about people who have been taken advantage of by a government or an economy and have been cast aside. And that's been a struggle since man understood ownership and it will continue to be a struggle as long as some men side with the very forces that could steamroll everyone in the end.<br /><br />'Don't turn on your own kind', Tom says. Well I hope Tom is still somewhere out there keeping an eye on everyone, helping where he can, beat up and bloody but still fighting. The world needs more Tom's and more Ma's. Someone's gotta keep the family together.<br /><br />Anyway, brilliant novel.

This dream is often misinterpreted as a guaranteed promise of opportunity, success, and happiness. During the Great Depression, immigrants, just as the Joad family, have attempted to fulfill this vision. Looking back at history, this dream was nearly impossible to achieve for immigrants. Instead of pursuing the promises of the dream, migrant farmers stood at a disadvantage and struggled through life with limited opportunities and abilities.<br /> Steinbeck describes the misleading image of California as a promise of success, pleasant weather, healthy living, and job opportunities. It is no wonder that his fictional family is so allured by the West. Technological development and industrial growth was evident in California during the Great Depression, and was often advertised as advanced and open for immediate job opportunities for newcomers. The Joad family had no choice but to leave their farm behind and trust the pamphlets that advertised jobs in the West. They had no choice but to believe that once they passed the border into California, good luck and happiness would be awaiting them.<br /> If migrants were able to reach California, they were at an extreme disadvantage. They faced discrimination, lived separate and unfortunate lives, and were ultimately used and taken advantage of for cheap labor. When the Joad family crosses the border, they are ill received. They are called “Oakies,” and are forced to stay at government camps to avoid danger. Their high hopes and expectations of this new land eventually lead to disappointment and despair.<br />Steinbeck creates a paradox of the California Dream.  Easy living is difficult; the influx of new people looking for jobs and a steady lifestyle created an overcrowded and difficult community to live in. California is a false sense of reality; the promise of the dream is a paradox, for the high expectations are met with despair and hardship. The Joads kept their hopes alive by following a faulty and deceptive dream. Once they arrived in the West, the land of prosperity was not at all what they had expected.hopes alive by following a faulty and deceptive dream.

Not so! This book is very cool. It is about the dust bowl and depresison causeing a mass migration to California. The chapters mostly alternate between giving a big theoretical picture of the causes and then giving the particular demonstration of what is happening using one family. At the time of its publishing it was comdemed for its language and some adult themes which still seem shocking. The author tries to avoid sounding like a communist but that is deffinately the way he is leaning. One of the more radical parts of the book is its insistence that the family unit is dead. Because farms have become huge and the family farms can't compete the new unit needs to be the union not the family. - sounds fairly Marxist to me. The movie of the book follows it super close for the first half but then bails on the books realism, pessimism and theory n the second half. Of course the movie totally deletes the last shocking scene in the book of the mom who has just had a stillbirth nursing an adult male stranger who is starving to death. This is once again Stienbeck saying the family unit is lost we have to do something different. All through the book the mom has been the chief advocate for the family but she totally fails and her family falls apart. In the end she is the one who asks her daughter to nurse the stranger.	2014-03-05

I am very comfortable in saying that this book, along with Faulkner's THE SOUND AND THE FURY, are the two greatest books written by an American.	2014-02-10

The trip takes place in an old car. It's been three generations of the family. Arriving in California there is no such better days and continued a desperate struggle for survival. It is a complaint to the social and economic system. Each character is described brilliantly with a great narrative art. Times were dark. The novel is.

Finally, the Joads pack up or sell everything they have and take off for California.

The way people come together in a time of crisis and the struggle that they fight for, oh, it is a movement Steinbeck captured to perfection.  You may find yourself rooting for each of the characters in the times of their journey for the promised land of agriculture.  It may seem a bit sensational at times, but Steinbeck has said he had to tone down the language especially before he published the book.  These were not easy times.  He was lucky to find such a boon for literature in his time.<br /><br />I would recommend this product along with Sirens of Morning Light by Benjamin Anderson, a quest for a man in Iowa to regain his identity, which becomes entangled with people who claim to have known him when he discovers he is a scientific experiment.  It embraces a more modern rustic setting.  Make sure not to miss either book.	2014-01-13

The book, set in the dust bowl of the 1930's, is the tale of one family, the Joads, as they fight their way to California in search of work.  The novel employes a complex structure of juxtaposition, pairing a narrative chapter with a brief explanation or side story to explain the situation the Joads are experiencing.<br />  The major reason that any person should read this book is because it is a classic immigrant tale.  A family is forced to move and fights to make a living in a new, strange land.  The book, however, may be difficult for some to understand.  The author writes in accent when displaying the Joads speech pattern.  The book is able to be understood on many levels, from simplistic to complicated and diverse, making it a great read for readers of all levels.  This novel is not for the faint of heart, being that it is not a comedy but a tragedy filled with sad scenes and an ending that can be viewed as optimistic or pessimistic.<br />  If a person can get by the minor difficulties in the book, it is a book that every person should read.	2014-01-13

That being said, Steinbeck is one of my favorite writers and, once I started reading the book,  I couldn't put it down.  Steinbeck paints portraits with words.  He so brilliantly brings his characters to life that the reader does not just read words; the reader virtually SEES the scene.

The novel focuses on a poor family of farmers driven from their repossessed Oklahoma farm by the Dust Bowl/drought and concomitant economic hardships of the Great Depression. Along with thousands of other 'Okies,' they sought jobs and a future in what was touted as California's agricultural Eden. Route 66 served as their conduit - a route I've had the opportunity to drive on in a number of abandoned sections, alongside on newer Interstates,  as well as walk among the ruins of some of its bridges, abandoned tourist sites, and the vehicles abandoned where they broke down - all while reflecting upon the situations of those who passed decades earlier.<br /><br />Unfortunately, upon ultimately arriving in California, the Joads  find reality differs from what they'd envisioned - there's a labor glut, and large farmers are taking advantage of it to impose ever decreasing wages. Many areas actively resist settlement by the incoming hordes - including the Joads. Tom witnesses the killing of his friend and former preacher, Jim Casey, and in turn kills the attacker - relegating himself to the life of a fugitive.<br /><br />The moral of the story might be that great decency and hard work by themselves do not generate a happy ending.	2013-12-13

Here's another wonderful book by Steinbeck that I think is well worth reading for many reasons: first you have the picture of the times (20's and 30's) when so much of America saw changes. Then there's the change in California  as it became one of the most important agricultural states in the union.  Then we take a family who has been the victims of the mechanization of farming and the take-over of farming by conglomerates.  The book tells about the family's trip to California --  the place of their dreams-- and the difficulties they face just to stay together and to stay alive.  A wonderful piece of Americana with a lot more impact than a history book.	2013-12-12

While children starved, families broke apart and the country changed the rich worked harder and harder to get more and more no matter the cost.<br /> “The Grapes of Wrath,” by John Steinbeck follows the story of a family of Okie farmers, the Joads, through the Dust Bowl and their struggle to survive in the false hope of a new start in California. Seen as socialist propaganda which led to hundreds of death threats toward Steinbeck, the novel vividly demonstrates the short comings of the laissez-faire capitalism which led to the depression and monopolization of agriculture in America. Although the novel doesn’t outright attack capitalism, or even promote socialism, the ethical and emotional strain the story inflicts definitely leads to reflection on two polarized socio-economic ideologies. The political nature of the novel during one of the most influential times in not only American, but global history, led to much controversy but also massive sales and a spurring environment for discussion and debate.<br /> However, the political and economic aspects of the book are not the only thing standing this novel out from many others. The parallelisms to the Old and New Testaments are an art form in itself. The countless allusions, from Jesus and his story to the story of the Ancient Hebrews and the Egyptians, help demonstrate the lasting struggle between man, power, land and wealth.<br /> “The Grapes of Wrath” opened the minds of millions in a time where humanitarianism was the difference between life and death. While the values of animosity, ignorance and greed are values deeply ingrained in the human psyche, “The Grapes of Wrath,” shows the true nature of humans, the nature to survive, and survive as we, not I.	2013-12-05

In the times of the book that they have Tom Joad, it would describe the misfortune the Joad family would encounter after the release of their family member Tom Joad after being imprisoned for four years and for good behavior was released early and placed on parole. One their new difficulties was the tragic death Ol' Joad, the family's grandpa, this had a terrible toll on the family's will to survive and the luck. As I read through the I had noticed that this family was not the only ones being targeted by the government if one was to look back at into history the government had taken away land that had belonged to many hard working citizens. This event made me feel like it was a wrong for such a thing to happen because it had caused many Americans to migrate to California without any idea whether or not there would be a sign of hope for them in having a normal life again. Overall I give this book five stars since it goes into great details in realism. I especially loved the ending of the novel, however I'm not going to be a spoiler and tell you. That is something you have to read to find out. In the end I would recommend this novel to peers that are hungry for the twisted truth about history and how it had effect the lives of others.	2013-11-01

I did not know anything about the difficulties encountered by poor folks trying to find a better life in the west.  Steinbeck was a deep thinker and expert writer.  I got awfully tired of the filthy language and had to quit reading it to my wife because of that.  I cannot disregard the fact that the language in the book was any different than the language of the people described.<br />  As i look back and remember that my father driving a 1928 Pontiac and pulling a homemade trailer landed at his brother's rented house in Tacoma with five dollars in his pocket.  The automobile was a gift from his elderly aunt.  We lived together with my uncle and his family in a one bedroom house for two months.  There were ten of us.<br />  I am glad that we went to WA and not to CA.  We were not mistreated in anyway.

The story itself tells of the Joad family and their honesty, wisdom, pain, courage, compassion, and their will to survive. The language and imagery throughout the story made me feel as if I was really there during the whole story. At times the Joad family felt as if they should give up but didn't.

The title of this work is in the vernacular of American society because it is a story about all of us.  We all suffer pain and loss so we can clearly identify with the heart broken sorrow that moves this family from Dust Bowl east Oklahoma to California.  The ravages of the depression multiplied ten fold by the drought and dust storms in the 1930's caused whole family's of share croppers to pull up stakes and go West where the brochures being circulated promise steady work and good wages.  The families pooled their meager resources to buy a worn out vehicle for $25 and start the 1800 mile trip with as little as $100 cash to buy gas and to live on.The journey is fraught with terror and hardship only to arrive in California and find thousands of other migrants lining up for the work and security a job would provide.  Your stomach turns when all the family has left to eat is fried corn meal with nothing better to look forward to.  If you were ever hungry or cold you will feel this families pain.  This book tells the story of the Joad family but it is about you and I and our deepest instincts to survive.	2013-09-05

Yes it's a book about the little guy getting squeezed out by the big banks and farms, but to me, that wasn't the main theme of the book. It merely provided the catalyst for a story about what people do when faced with hardship. It's a story of survival, and how people respond differently to the circumstances that befall them. Some run. Some give up. Some keep fighting until the end when there's no hope in sight.<br /><br />The writing was excellent, with just enough \\"Okie-isms\\" to make it that much more real. I felt as if I were right there experiencing what the Joad family was up against, from broken down engines to having no food to a truck stop with a nickel juke box. If you like stories about survival, and what lengths people will go to in order to make it to the next day, I think you'll enjoy this book.	2013-09-03

This is a book about struggle, and the obstacles pile higher in higher for the Joad family as they try to eke out of living.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - Taken as a whole, I felt for the Joad family as they did their best to remain human and good in the face of ravenous competition from other hungry families and the cruel anonymous system that would rather see them dead.  But, as individuals, I had a hard time pulling the family apart.  Each of their heartaches and struggles touched me, but they just didn't seem like significantly different people with different desires.<br /><br />3) Theme (5 stars) - Moral commentary abounds in this story.  There's certainly a comment about capitalism in here, how a bank or a company \\"breathes profits and eats interest and money\\" and therefore is an unfeeling machine that can't help but roll over the individual losers at the game, else it will die of hunger.  And there's a comment on ownership, about how hard work and loving makes a true owner, not having the finances to buy it.  And there's also a comment about mass production and complex economic division of labor, how it makes men disconnected from what they produce, and no longer care or appreciate it.  But that's all in the background.  The foreground is the struggle of these realities placed upon a family, and how they cope with them.  How man first is Christianly, then they squabble and fight for the scraps, and then finally some rise up to unite themselves into a protective unionized shield against the unfeeling and unstoppable machine.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - Usually, I can read Steinbeck for hundreds of pages and not get tired.  He's wise, but not preachingly so.  He's sardonic, but not depressingly so.  He's plain-spoken, yet authoritative.  But most of all he's insightful.  Not a landmark, or historical event, or character goes by without a simple yet deep analysis; and the gems are so casually thrown about that you almost take them for granted.  But in this novel, there was just such a high dialogue to narrative percentage that much of that magic was lost in the Oakie conversations.  Don't get me wrong, Steinbeck captured the language and mentality of the Oakies well, I just didn't find them as engaging as the language and mentality of the narrator.<br /><br />5) Setting (5 stars) - The West during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl.  Roaming as a poor itinerant family man in a world that doesn't want you.  I saw the dusty barren fields, felt the hot bumpy car migration, smelled the cramped Hoovervilles, and heard the flickering moments of human joy during the community dance.  I was transported close enough to the experience to know I am very lucky that this wasn't my life.  But it is the life for many still today, or at least a close approximation with only the names and locations changed.  And for that it remains, unfortunately, timeless in setting.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - I liked the novel, and would recommend it, but I didn't love it.  I think it was the characters that kept it at a 4 star and not 5 star level.  I felt for them, but I didn't latch on to them.s plain-spoken, yet authoritative.  But most of all he's insightful.

For the `Okies' the Great Depression was merely the prelude to the Dust Bowl that wiped out the homes and everything these farm people had ever worked their lives to provide for themselves. The pot of gold at the end of their rainbow is merely a mirage, enticing them further west like the proverbial carrot for the mule. The drama keeps replaying itself; only the props have changed. There is a compelling quality and an irresistible urge to keep reading novels of characters pushed to extreme limits of endurance and survival. Just as much as Robinson Crusoe, the migrants of `The Grapes of Wrath' are shipwrecked in an untenable situation where creative ingenuity and persistence are essential to their survival.<br /><br />John Steinbeck's novel has been justifiably praised and it is understandable that it has been seen as almost the definitive saga of the hardships of the Depression. I first read it over thirty years ago and the characters have become idealized in my memory. I misremembered them, probably because the power of the heroic and relentless drive to persevere in spite of overwhelming odds overshadowed the fact that these characters are filled with flaws, insecurity, selfishness and vanity and yet the instinct for survival is so strong within them that it pulls them beyond their endurance and the tolerance of anything they ever thought they would consider doing.<br /><br />Steinbeck's Joad family is not naturally heroic or particularly altruistic. They want what most people want--security, an intact family, their own home, a way to support themselves. Despite their best intentions, their notions of what the family is and where they are determined to go are completely tossed aside by the intervention of unexpected circumstance.<br /><br />The unlikely hero of the family is ex-con Tom, just out of prison and on parole, which he breaks when he leaves the state with his family to head west. Tom's righteous indignation and bad temper has already resulted in him killing one man. It requires immense self-control to refrain from retaliation at the taunts and injustice the family suffer all the way to California from western `natives' who fear that the `Okies' (substitute any kind of racial or ethnic epithet for an equivalent insult) will take away their jobs and the authorities who jump in to quell any glimmers of burgeoning unionizing. Younger brother Al, who idolizes Tom and emulates his brother in many ways with an added dose of sexual bravado and general cockiness, is impetuous and just wants to get married and work in a garage somewhere. The pregnant Rose of Sharon is deserted by her husband, an emotional child despite impending motherhood, pines for Connie and tries to console herself with the thought that he will come back for her after he gets settled and finds them a home. Pa and his brother John are weak patriarchs. John is consumed with guilt over a `sin' that he has blown into a badge of honor as well as an avoidance mechanism. Pa grumbles and is occasionally assertive and decisive but is ultimately humbled by Ma's authority. Ma is the rock of the family. She is the foundation upon which all of them rest, the real spiritual leader of the family.<br /><br />The ex-preacher Jim Casy is an enlightened spiritual guide. His initials underscore his Christ figure status. He has been to the wilderness and come to a realization that is reminiscent of Emerson's `oversoul', that he is part of a collective soul, one with all other life on the planet. He sacrifices himself once by turning himself in to the authorities in place of another man who killed a policeman, serves his jail time and returns as an active unionizer in a camp where the Joads coincidentally find themselves. Steinbeck sees unionizing as true Christianity and Casy is its sacrificial prophet. After killing the man who killed Casy, Tom is a fugitive. He tells Ma before he leaves that he is now part of that soul that Casy spoke of and he is essentially continuing Casy's crusade for justice.<br /><br />Men in the novel are characterized as reactors to the fits and starts of circumstances whereas women literally `go with the flow' of the ongoing river of life. The feminine nurturing aspect ushers the continuation of life and the recycling of energy and nourishment--literally in the eerily beautiful final scene of the novel, a conclusion that could never have been filmed in the world of 1940 when the acclaimed film version was released.<br /><br />Steinbeck's novel was a controversial powder keg when it was ignited and released to the public of 1939 and it retains all of its power over seventy years later. The Great Depression, the Dust Bowl and the Okies were all elements of a particular point in history. Injustice, inequality between rich and poor and the plight of the homeless and the unemployed are still with us in a world where `The Grapes of Wrath' has lost none of its relevance.o killed Casy, Tom is a fugitive.

In the gray sky a red sun appeared, a dim red circle that gave a little light, like dusk; and as that day advanced, the dusk slipped back toward darkness, and the wind cried and whimpered over the fallen corn.  Men and women huddled in their houses, and they tied handkerchiefs over their noses when they went out, and wore goggles to protect their eyes.\\"<br /><br />The description of the dust storms that contributed to the collapse of  midwestern American farm life is how John Steinbeck chose to open his masterpiece \\"[[ASIN:0143039431 The Grapes of Wrath]].\\"  The remainder of the book focuses on one Oklahoma family, the Joads, and their attempts to create a better life for themselves in California during the Great Depression.<br /><br />There are several things that stood out to me in this novel.  First, Steinbeck's writing is exceptional.  His characters are sympathetic, his prose moving and the vernacular he uses transports the reader to a different time and place.  Second, though Steinbeck did not himself have firsthand knowledge of the plight of the \\"Okies\\", he uses (then) contemporary research he gained from interviewing someone who did.  It's those small nuances that impress me so much.  For instance, how the family is constantly trying to keep their car running, by patching tires and borrowing or making parts.  How food is stretched out by frying dough or serving cornmeal mush.  Third, although the family's hardships are certainly heart-wrenching, Steinbeck also takes the time to instruct the reader on the various causes for those hardships.  Yes, the Okies were taken advantage of.  But when the crop prices bottomed out, Steinbeck told how the orchard owners struggled to decide whether to let the fruit rot or to pay the pickers less.<br /><br />I'm sure many reading this novel would focus on the wrongs done to these migrant workers by the California natives or corporate owners.  Though it wasn't mentioned in the book, I know that mistakes made by those in Washington DC contributed just as much to the Great Depression.  I found myself more angry at those public policy makers while reading this book than anyone else.<br /><br />One beautiful message Steinbeck delivers is how the downtrodden consistently help each other.  Even though they have nothing, they share what they have.  In a world of darkness and despair, those acts of kindness are the beacons of hope that shine in this story.istakes made by those in Washington DC contributed just as much to the Great Depression.

US	11191604	R1V0Z6OOW67CH2	0143039431	999720718	The Grapes of Wrath	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Flawed but still one of the greatest American novels	The final installment in John Steinbeck's informal \\"Dust Bowl Trilogy\\" along with In Dubious Battle and Of Mice and Men, The Grapes of Wrath is a work that clearly has to be in the discussion if we're talking about the greatest American novel. I don't think it quite gets there, for a number of reasons addressed below, but that's not to take away from the achievement.<br /><br />Steinbeck's epic of the Joads--clearly everyman figures created to represent much more than themselves--stuns with its epic scope, overweening ambition and dramatic power. The book is nowhere better than in the scenes showing the Joads dealing with each other and with the outside forces they don't understand. We feel the desperation, cringe at the naivet&eacute; and admire the pluck and determination as they make their way from their appropriated traditional homestead to a hopefully better life in California.<br /><br />Each family member comes alive as a distinct personality in Steinbeck's beautifully detailed narrative, even the little kids Winfield and Ruthie. I loved the descriptions of their behaviors. That's just how little kids are. This is supported by Steinbeck's incredible eye for detail and master stylist's ability to convey it vividly, whether it's how to repair a crankshaft in a '26 Dodge or how to gut and roast a rabbit over an open fire. He clearly knew what he was talking about.<br /><br />The one character I think fails to work is Jim Casy, who is clearly the author's alter ego as well as being the most obvious Christ figure in the history of literature. Steinbeck strains to put his philosophy into Casy's mouth in a kind of elevated hillbilly-speak that works less often than you would like. At different points, this task is also taken up by Tom Joad and by Ma, with mixed results.<br /><br />The novel is also often celebrated for its approach of alternating short broad-perspective chapters that at their best work as virtual poems, with the longer narrative chapters that bring us back to the particular with the story of the Joads' adventures. It reinforces the universality of the Joads and puts them in perspective among the larger historical, economic and cultural forces at work.<br /><br />The one major flaw I found in this book is the way Steinbeck wears his sympathies on his sleeve and lets it affect his art. While he purports to push a no-fault philosophy that says in the words of Casy \\"maybe there's no right and no wrong, there's just stuff folks do,\\" that's clearly not the case. In fact, this is one of the most Manichean books ever written. In reality, the stuff folks do that is neither right nor wrong only applies to stuff folks do that Steinbeck approves of. When that stuff extends to calling in bank loans, pricing products to market or leveraging economies of scale, there definitely is right and wrong and Steinbeck makes no bones about it.<br /><br />There is also a pettiness in Steinbeck calling out businessmen, farmers and cops for stereotyping the \\"Okies\\" and then stereotyping those same businessmen, farmers and cops mercilessly himself (you can always tell which characters Steinbeck disapproves of because there's no subtlety to their mustache-twirling evil). Clearly, Steinbeck was if not a socialist then certainly a man of the left at this point, perhaps understandably so because there's no doubt the Dust Bowl migrants were often cruelly taken advantage of, but those opinions get in the way of the art at times. The government camp, for example, is romanticized beyond credibility.<br /><br />Steinbeck got Grapes in just under the wire as the 1930s were ending and the cultural/political landscape he depicted changed with the U.S. entry into World War II. Hence, the revolution he predicts several times in the book never happened and The Grapes of Wrath becomes a kind of amber-encrusted cultural artifact despite its universalist ambitions. Well, even so it remains a powerful document that is a testament to the human spirit and amust-read on any tour of American literature.ead on any tour of American literature.	2013-07-12

I've never been a particular fan of John Steinbeck, but this particular book has interested me because of the connection to my own family; my mother and her parents and siblings were among the thousands of \\"Okies\\" who immigrated to California during the Depression.<br /><br />Although my mother's family was, like all the others, very poor and worked hard just to eke out a living, thankfully they never had it quite as bad as Steinbeck's Joad family.  The Grapes of Wrath is not a happy story; that is easily foreseen from the get-go, when the Joads and others making the trek out west dream endlessly of a California that they imagine almost on a par with paradise.  A place that, of course, never existed.<br /><br />This is a story of struggle and sadness and unrelenting misery.  There are no bright spots, no happiness to give a little relief to all the hardship.  The Joad family suffers sickness and death and the slow and gradual breakup of their family.  They struggle endlessly to find enough work to feed themselves and they struggle against the injustices of the way of life they are trapped in.  The story ends inconclusively, with the reader left not knowing what will happen to them and especially what will happen to Tom Joad, the main character.  The only really conclusive point that Steinbeck seems to make in the final scene is that the Joad family will somehow survive and live on; the final scene seems meant to convey that, no matter how dire the circumstances, they always find a way to sustain themselves and keep living.<br /><br />Steinbeck's use of language is rough throughout this book, and there are many crude passages and scenes, especially in the beginning of the book.  However, there are many passages where his writing sings almost like poetry and it was this that kept me listening.  This is a poignant and powerful look at a bygone era, the Depression in general and the plight of the Okies coming to California in particular.  The fact that I live in Central California, near many of the towns mentioned in the story, brought it even that much closer to  home for me.<br /><br />It is easy to see how this book had such a powerful impact, especially since it was written during the Depression, while events such as those depicted in the story were actually taking place.  For me, the main take-away here is admiration of those who survived the trek to California and who managed to forge an existence in their new \\"promised land.\\"  I am also very thankful and appreciative for how easy my life has been by comparison.<br /><br />This is an excellent audio version; the narrator does an outstanding job and adds much to the characters and their story.g to California in particular.

The last weekend my Centurion II group met with the late Charles Colson he requested we re- read John Steinbeck's classic - The Grapes of Wrath.  I have read more that 150 book Biblical worldview recommend by Chuck Colson and this book is one of my favorites.  I know we all read Steinbeck's classic in high school but I promise you will read it from a far different perspective now.  I fear Chuck asked us to re-read the book as part of his preparing us for some very tough times.<br />I review books by letting the author speak for him/herself.  The paragraph below introduces my favorite character.  She reminds me of my precious mother.<br />\\"...Ma was heavy, but not fat; thick with childbearing and work.  She wore a loose Mother Hubbard of gray cloth in which there had once been colored flowers, but the color was washed out now. So that the small flowered pattern was only a little lighter gray that the background.  The dress came down to her ankles, and her strong, broad, bare feet  moved quickly and deftly over the floor.  Her thin, steel-gray hair was gathered in a sparse wispy knot at the back of her head.  Strong, freckled arms were bare to the elbow, and her hands were chubby and delicate, like those of a plump little girl.  She looked out into the sunshine.  Her face was not soft; it was controlled, kindly.  Her hazel eyes seemed to have experienced all possible tragedy and to have mounted pain and suffering like steps into a high calm and superhuman undertaking.  She seemed to know, to accept, to welcome her position. The citadel of the family, the strong place that could not be taken.  And since old Tom and the children could not know hurt of fear unless she acknowledged hurt and fear, she had practiced denying them in herself.  And since, when a joyful thing happened, they looked to see whether joy was on her, it was her habit to build up laughter out of inadequate family materials.  Imperturbability could be depended upon.  And from her great and humble position in the family she had taken dignity and a clean calm beauty.  From her position as healer, her hands had grown sure and cool and quiet; from her position as arbiter she had become as remote and faultless in judgment as a goddess.  She seemed to know that if she swayed the family shook, and if she ever really deeply wavered or despaired the family would fall, the family will to function would be gone.\\"<br />Grapes of Wrath will bless you.

Some were required reading, others not.  Many read better after you have more life experience behind you.  For example Dickens, Hemmingway, Twain.  There are things in those books you simply couldn't see or understand when younger. Little of that applies to The Grapes of Wrath.  Even setting aside the tedious political and economic naïvet&eacute; of the author, the treatment of the principle characters is condescending and stereotypical. They are cardboard Hollywood caricatures.  Maybe that is why it was turned so successfully in to a movie.<br /><br />I have/had parents and grandparents with dust bowl and southern California connections to that period so I have real people with which to compare the characters in the book.  Perhaps the disconnect between Steinbeck's imagination and real people I knew is why I can't suspend disbelief.<br /><br />In sum, the book is interesting from the point of view of literary history, but if you want a good read try one of authors listed earlier, or even Bronte or Austen if your taste runs that direction.	2013-02-12

US	27654372	R2JJRKY0FMTMH7	0143039431	999720718	The Grapes of Wrath	Books	4	0	0	N	N	AP English	This was the first book I have read of John Steinbeck's, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Steinbeck writes with a simple elegance, while telling a sad, yet compelling story about struggles through the Great Depression.<br /><br />In The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck uses a peculiar combination of diction. Overall, the book seems very conversational. Steinbeck uses very simple words, with the occasional large word thrown in, with a folksy sort of feel. His use of simple diction makes the book extremely understandable, in turn making it more relatable as people tend to relate to things they understand.<br /><br />To get more specific in areas concerning diction, I'd like to discuss the diction used when Steinbeck includes dialogue. In the dialogue, Steinbeck's grammar is atrocious. Words are left incomplete, sentences unfinished; the grammar is just awful. However, this does not detract from the appeal of the novel as would be suspected. It instead enhances the appeal of the book by making it more realistic. The way Steinbeck shows the way people would have talked in the era of the Great Depression. Personally, I quite appreciate Steinbeck's efforts to make the novel as realistic as humanly possible.<br /><br />The other aspect of Steinbeck's writing in The Grapes of Wrath that I came to really enjoy and appreciate was his use of figurative language and imagery. Steinbeck does a phenomenal job painting a picture in the readers' heads. He uses very detail oriented style, full of very rich adjectives.<br /><br />While the adjectives do more to fill the role of imagery, Steinbeck has an incredible talent in his use of figurative language. I found one of his favorite figurative language devices to be the extended metaphor. In one of the between chapters (the broad chapters, that aren't character specific) almost everything was an extended metaphor, and everything was being compared to one central thing. Everything was compared to a monster; the bank, the tractors, even the guys who drove the tractors were all somehow made out to be a monster. Even in the chapters that were character specific, Steinbeck loves his extended metaphors.<br /><br />Steinbeck uses these devices, and many others, to create what is a literary masterpiece in my mind. An important story was shared with the many people who have read and will read this book. It is a book that can be read multiple times and a person wouldn't tire of it. Steinbeck's use of simple, detail oriented diction creates a wonderful base on which to build such a story.<br /><br />This being the first of Steinbeck's works that I have read, I have been thoroughly impressed and will continue to read novels written by him. The Grapes of Wrath tells a phenomenal story in a simple fashion that is so incredibly understandable, and relatable, that I found myself completely drawn into the story; after the first 150 pages or so anyway, which I found to be a bit slow. Even so, I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good, understandable book to read.who drove the tractors were all somehow made out to be a monster.

The Grapes of Wrath is a well written, intriguing, darn good book. I was truly impressed by the art and detail that is put into this novel. The book begins with the telling of the truly hospitable conditions that farmers in the south-eastern plains were experiencing. The story follows a family named the Joad's and their desire and pursuit to get to California in search of work, easier times, and a happy life. Tom Joad, who is the main character in the book, is one who I became attached to early on, because of his rash and hasty nature, but kind and merciful attitude. His journey and growth really captured me through-out the whole book.<br /><br />The theme of the book was quite interesting. Humanism, unity, family, and the concept of the Oversoul persist in being the top reasons behind all the events that transpire in the book. The concept of Humanism, family, and the moral reasoning of leaving no man behind are powerful things. Ma Joad, mother of Tom, demonstrates the greatest form of humanism and family, by always wanting to help others in need, and making sure that people were working together to accomplish goals. She is also the one person in the family that is constantly trying to keep the family intact and functioning. Ma even gets physical when she feels her family is going to be broken up. This leads to the next theme, which is unity. Unity is shown in both the camps of people that the Joad's come across, and in a bigger sense of family, the community. The groups of people that the family stumbles across are groups in which everyone had a place, and people worked for the benefit of each other, not themselves. This is something that really takes a mental toll on some of the main characters, who go on to enact their newfound sense of place. Jim Casy, a former preacher, joins the Joad's early on in the book, and is really trying to figure out how to help people who are in need of spiritual help. He comes upon the idea of a shared soul, and no one person being separated from another. This concept of the Oversoul has a profound effect on both Tom and Jim Casy, who make steps towards who they are going to become through-out the book.<br /><br />This is a book that I truly do like, for all the detail and gritty realness of the whole situation that many people were in. However, it can get very dry, very quickly. The first part of the book definitely takes it's time to pick up, which it does, and it becomes very interesting after that point. The character development was excellent and I became enticed with the people surrounding the story.<br /><br />I recommend this book to those who want to read about the harsh conditions and times that people went through, but beware of some long, uninteresting conversations about life.eparated from another.

Ostensibly a novel that is intended to highlight the labor injustice in the California agriculture industry experienced by Dust Bowl migrants of the 1930's, the reader quickly finds that the gaunt frame of this plot is heavily draped with endless similes, metaphors, and other descriptive machinations that merely serve to bore even the most persistent. Chapter after chapter Steinbeck's words ponderously crawl across the pages on their hands and knees, begging the reader to flip forward a few pages just to relieve the monotony. It is sure to delight every English literature college professor and fill Steinbeck devotees with self-righteous pleasure and an endless supply of meaningless excerpts to be pressed on unsuspecting but appreciatively nodding folks at the specialty bookstores in Hyannis Port and Berkeley. But for most readers, Grapes of Wrath is an unrewarding chore.<br /><br />Given the novel's pretensions it is no surprise that in the intervening decades legions of harried college freshmen and gawky high school students have been required to read, and lord help us all, interpret the words of Steinbeck in Grapes of Wrath until no remaining literary stone is unturned and whole forests of trees are cut down to feed the maws of the paper mills that produce the neatly ruled blue notebooks favored by professors and teachers for book reports and final exams. This constant exposure and the endless self-reinforcing literary acclaim in the seventy odd years since the publishing of the novel might lead the unsuspecting reader to consider taking it on as thoughtful grist for the mental mill. Let this review serve as warning label that should be on the back cover. There are hundreds of thousands of works written in the century before, during, and after that will better serve to both entertain and provoke the critical thinking the reader is looking for.<br /><br />Yes, Steinbeck was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Grapes of Wrath, a dubious distinction if there was ever one. Pulitzers are liberally handed out to the newsprint literati for purportedly socially meaningful articles and books that uplift the oppressed and cast down the powerful. So it is no surprise the Grapes of Wrath was so recognized for shining a light on exploitative corporate farming interests and the conditions endured by many in the horrid years of the Great Depression. Throw into the mix the ecological disaster of the Dust Bowl and one has a sure fire formula guaranteed to please hard-to-please snarky book reviewers. Is the book a good read? Heck no, but that is hardly the point.<br /><br />Steinbeck, this reviewer is sure, meant to ape Victor Hugo's Les Miserables (1862) when he wrote the Grapes of Wrath. It is telling that even the English translation of Les Miserables towers over Steinbeck's novel in terms of depth and readability, no mean feat when one considers that the French novel was excoriated by reviewers of that era as overly sentimental socialist tripe.  Grapes of Wrath continues to be a tempting resource for classroom assignments, particularly given its message of class struggle, social justice, and the neat ability to refer glowingly to FDR's social engineering conducted in his first two terms in office. Unfortunately this focus is in spite of the fact that the style of writing is tortured and archaic, that most plot elements have not aged well over the years, and that none of the main characters are overly interesting. These drawbacks are real achievements given the continuing relevance of questionable modern agricultural practices and illegal immigrant migrants in the 21st century.<br /><br />In terms of early to mid-20th century social relevance one could do better with The Jungle (1906, Upton Sinclair) or 1984 (1949, George Orwell). In the same era, but for literary visualizations, the reader is much better off diving into Something Wicked This Way Comes or Dandelion Wine (1962 & 1957, Ray Bradbury). And just about anything off of the Amazon bestseller list would be vastly more entertaining.ch better off diving into Something Wicked This Way Comes or Dandelion Wine (1962 & 1957, Ray Bradbury).

If Amazon allowed it, this book would get a -10 star rating. If I could find every copy of this book I'd bundle them up and hurl them into the nearest nuclear reactor, gather the residue, and put it on the next probe to a neighboring galaxy. If I had a functional time machine, I'd seriously consider making sure this book never was created.<br /><br />Somehow, John Steinbeck manages to simultaneously whine while also using an author \\"voice\\" that drips with unparalleled condescension. I consider The Grapes of Wrath an atrocity foisted upon generations of unsuspecting students by brain-dead literati who call it Literature---most likely because they feel a tremendous need to prove they are intellectually superior to everyone else by forcing garbage down their throats.<br /><br />My grandparents were very much like Okies from the depression era. They came from the Missouri Ozarks, got married in 1933 and raised 11 children. During this era, my grandfather worked as a laborer on a pig farm, mostly shoveling pig manure. Obviously, my grandparents were very culturally similar to the Okies Steinbeck attempted to portray in this \\"novel\\". I find The Grapes of Wrath to be completely insulting to their legacy.<br /><br />The reason why is that The Grapes of Wrath uses symbols and referents that were completely alien to their world view. In no way would my grandparents conceptualize or symbolize the world like Steinbeck does. Of course, Steinbeck doesn't care. He's too good and too arrogant to try to look at the world through their lens. Instead, he transmogrifies their world view into something palatable to self-identified intelligentsia based in university English departments. Of course, their experience, expressed in symbols that would have spoken to people immersed in their own culture wouldn't be sophisticated enough to make their experience \\"valid\\". Oh no. Instead, he needed to create something totally alien to them, and then claim it to be the ultimate expression of their experience.<br /><br />To understand how offensive The Grapes of Wrath is, it's as if someone tried to write a novelization of \\"Boy'z 'n the Hood\\" using symbols and cultural referants typical among members of Augusta National Golf Club, with ghetto slang rendered into dialect by a white man with an elite education, then trying to tell people the result is the definitive rendition of American urban experience. The Grapes of Wrath is a 169,481 word definition of Noblesse Oblige.<br /><br />In short, Steinbeck is saying we can't care about people like my grandparents unless we turn them into something the eastern liberal establishment can understand (while validating their self-proclaimed intellectual superiority).<br /><br />I do recognize that my hatred for this book is extreme, probably driven by being forced to read it 3 times during my education AND WRITE PAPERS ON IT. Reading it was bad enough. Having to write three papers on The Grapes of Wrath is traumatic enough to make someone refuse to write an essay for the rest of their life. I so hated this book that I found myself hoping the entire Joad family would get mowed down by a Zephyr hurtling down the highway so they'd be put out of their misery. Unfortunately, Deathrace 2000 wouldn't get made for another 36 years.<br /><br />I wrote this review hoping that people who revere this book (and I recognize that there are many) can understand why legions of students (I would suggest they are a silent majority) hate it (as I did many years ago). I'm trying to give a voice to these people that cannot be dismissed with condescending insults like \\"you're not mature enough\\" or \\"you're just not capable of understanding\\". I thoroughly understand Steinbeck's craft, and I despise it.<br /><br />What makes The Grapes of Wrath even worse is Steinbeck's undeniable literary gifts. The Grapes of Wrath is the artistic equivalent of Pablo Picasso painting a heroic mural glorifying the Hollywood tradition of white actors performing in Blackface.<br /><br />I think the best summary of John Steinbeck's career came when The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose \\"limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising\\".lywood tradition of white actors performing in Blackface.<br /><br />I think the best summary of John Steinbeck's career came when The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose \\"limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising\\".	2012-11-01

We have really become very soft, with even the poor having such extras that couldn't have been imaginable by the migrant workers described by Steinbeck.<br /><br />Never before have I been graced with the prose that describes the haves and have-nots in such a dark and colorful way.  The main characters, the Joad Family, learn what it means to be feared and hated by anyone who \\"had\\" something.  The people of California that owned land or stores knew the face of desperation, because they had experience the lengths humankind will go to in order to feed their loved ones.<br /><br />Being a liberal and a supporter of labor unions I felt incredible compassion for the Joad family and all the workers just looking for a fair days wage, but I also saw how the establishment could put a sterile (it is not my fault) corporate face to the practices of the farmers who would exploit the plight of the migrant workers.<br /><br />Reading the book one probably find it hard to think this was done to our own people.  Even though it is not right, it is easier to stomach such actions being levied upon outsiders who come and take our jobs, but can one imagine the same feelings towards truly desperate Americans willing to undercut each other to extreme measures just to put the very basic nutrients on the table for their families.  We have moved several generations from the likes of this type of desperation, which would tear apart the fabric of the crowded, interconnected and interdependent nation that we live in now.<br /><br />Finally, I thought it was amazing how the police and union busters used tactics of counterinsurgency.  I'm a military officer and found the subject very timely and see how well Steinbeck understood the strategies and how powerful the hearts and minds of the locals are to strategic success.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was the ending.

He's also brilliant when it comes to character development. This book also refers to the Dust Bowl and how farmers were getting taken advantage of by the government. This is a great book to explain in more detail how greed especially in government is greater than the welfare of its own people. It reminded me of 1984 but in this sense, these events truly did happen which made this book more frightening to read. Well done, Mr. Steinbeck!	2012-09-18

Fell in love with Of Mice and Men in high school (one of the few I actually read) and my all-time favorite book is East of Eden. So I kinda hoped this would be another love. I did like it, but it's a lot more depressing than anything I've read. It deals with real life, real emotions, and real poverty.

US	22227947	RKKML361SSJDX	0143039431	999720718	The Grapes of Wrath	Books	5	2	3	N	Y	America's Odyssey. Fantastic.	Grapes of Wrath is historical work of fiction. Covering the migration of tens of thousands of tenant farmers from the mid-west to the West of America. The book is half-fiction and half historical narrative.<br /><br />Amazing and absorbing are two words that initially come to mind when recalling the story. We follow the Joads, a family of tenant farmers, from Oklahoma to California. The mid west has become a dust bowl and the crops are performing badly. The land owners are heavily indebted to the banks who call in their loans. The land owners have to bow as industrialization thunders down on them and tractors and massive earth moving machines plow and turn the land. The tenant farmers are evicted and slowly but surely, reality sets in. They have nothing but each other. All the work is out west they hear. Our story starts as they point the old jalopy west and set off for better days.<br /><br />Steinbeck writes the story from 3rd person perspective and writes using the vernacular one would hear if one were a fly on the wall. Only becomes On'y, something becomes sumptin, every becomes ever', family becomes fambly. After reading for a while, the voice in your head takes on a Southern drawl as you read over the exchanges of the family. Conversation is scant yet, succinct. Articulation is nonexistent but the emotion leaps from the page. It truly is amazing the amount of feeling Steinbeck manages to get across to the reader. You truly are in the wagon, tents, camps, fields with the Joads as their personal Odyssey develops.<br /><br />There are 30 chapters and every other one is a historical perspective that Steinbeck uses to color in the hurdles and forces working against the migrants who were headed West. These folks were treated with contempt, condescension, abuse, left to starve and physically abused by law-enforcement yet, they continued on their way with hope. The hope was eroding from within yet, onwards they went. Tight family units looking out for each other and helping others along the way.<br /><br />The characters all add their \\"something\\" to the story. One of the more interesting ones, for me, was the character Casey. Casey, an ex-preacher, is somewhat like the phone in the old movies. Someone would grab the phone and use it to fill in some parts of the movie. Casey has that role in some places. He's a thinker and we find him thinking and explaining things to the Joads as they come to terms with their predicament.<br /><br />This work is a classic, no two ways about it. It's an American Odyssey during the great depression. Down home, heart of the Nation people uprooted by progress and forced to adapt to a world that didn't want them.

The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent book that depicts one families struggle during this time. John Steinbeck executed and wrote this story very well. He truly is an amazing author, descriptive and precise, capable of creating mood and atmosphere that makes you feel as though you are a member of the family throughout the entire story. Steinbeck is not only socially and politically observant of the times; he also adds depth to his story by depicting the conditions that the people lived in, and describing the desires of not just individuals, but the nation during the struggle of the great depression, after the dust bowl. The story is an epic tale of one Oklahoman family and their forced migration west.  After having their farm and home foreclosed on by the bank, the Joads are forced to leave the only home they have ever known.  With word that there is work out west they are forced to make their trek across the country to survive.  Even though it happened almost eighty years ago, The Grapes of Wrath is reminiscent of what is happening now in politics.  With such a large gap between the wealthy and the poor there is a sense that all people want is a fair chance in this book. I would recommend this The Grapes of Wrath to anyone who has interests in politics, history, or social sciences.  John Steinbeck has a very good understanding of these and even makes a few suggestions on ideas that he thought were good and later came to be( Like rotating crops in farming, the formation of unions, and other regulations that were put into place after the great depression). John Steinbeck demanded that a full copy of \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,\\" be put in the first edition of his book.  It contains the line \\"He is stomping out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.\\" Which Of course is where he got the title for his book; also it captures the essence of his writing. If you are looking for a good fictional read, that is informative about the way people lived during the great depression, then this is the book for you.also it captures the essence of his writing.

And what a great talent as a writer Steinbeck was. His easy, fluid, yet intensely descriptive style is second to none. I have read books by him I appreciated more, and books I appreciated less, but I would say that this is his masterpiece. His high level of detail meshes perfectly with a gloomy, depressing slice of real American history. All of which he intensely researched. It's a well told story, and provided me with quite a bit of mental fodder to mull over. You don't have to bond with, or even like, the main characters, to enjoy the epic and panoramic nature. I am an artist and writer. I write my own novels now. Steinbeck still remains one of my biggest influences.<br />You don't have to agree with every position held by Steinbeck to enjoy his writing, and at no point in this does he push communism on the reader. You know what one of my favorite novels is? Atlas Shrugged. I vote libertarian. My favorite genres tend to be dark Sci-Fi and horror. That's what I write, and what magazines I do illustrations for. That is also entirely beside the point.	2012-07-08

The book follows the Joad family for about nine months as they are driven from the place they've called home for generations and travel to California, only to find out that it is not the land of opportunity they expected. Steinbeck's formula here is to intersperse the lengthy chapters chronicling the Joads' journey with short chapters that encapsulate some nuance about the period or the people, giving you a picture of the greater struggle taking place, of which the Joads are just a small part. It creates a very powerful effect. This migration west involved hundreds of thousands of individuals. You see in a few pages the big picture, then you are pulled back into the intimacies of the Joads' lives and the tragedy is made very personal. In one especially startling example, Steinbeck puts these words into the mouth of a character after selling a nameless migrant and his family some gas for their car, \\"Well, you and me got sense. Them goddamn Okies got no sense and no feeling. They ain't human. A human being wouldn't live like they do. A human being couldn't stand it to be so dirty and miserable. They ain't a hell of a lot better than gorillas.\\" In the next chapter, the Joads make camp along a stream and Ma is so happy for the clean water and the chance to stay put for a day so that she can take a bath and wash the family's clothes. The Joads are good, honest, decent people looking for the means to earn an honest wage and thereby feed their family. The thought of charity repels them. At one point Pa talks about the prospect of picking cotton and is so excited about the fact that it's good, hard work, worthy of the wage he'll earn. How soft and incredibly privileged it makes us all seem. \\"They streamed over the mountains, hungry and restless - restless as ants, scurrying to find work to do - to lift, to push, to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food.\\"	2012-06-02

Give it to your children. (Tell them it's by some guy you've never heard of but think is really amazing.)<br /><br />Above all, forget that it's a classic.

Its grim tone hits you hard in the face and it's no surprise that Steinbeck said of the book that \\"I've done my damndest to rip a reader's nerves to rags\\". But once you can adapt to the bleak tone of the book (and the narrator) it becomes deeply compelling, to the point where you will want your car journey to work to last just that little bit longer so you can listen to that little bit more.<br /><br />Anyhow, to let you know what the audio version of the book is like, it is first rate. Many audio books pick readers who have little to no versatility in conveying their charactors and read the book as if reading the football results. John Chancer is different as he really conveys well the 12 charactors of the family, so much so that you could swear that you've actually met the family and heard their voices!<br /><br />One limitation of the package is that it is a box with 16 CD's in 16 in fiddly thin sleeves. The CD case has a tendency to fall on the floor and chuck its contents all over the car, which is highly annoying when you are endeavouring to concentrate.<br /><br />But, aside from that, the story is excellent and the narrator creates a rich cast of voices to fit the landscape of the book.<br /><br />Incidentally, anyone who's a fan of the comedian Bill Hicks may be interested to know that this book was said to be his favourite. Hicks loved the book so much that he even based his 'famous last words' on Tom Joad's final speech \\"I left in love, in laughter, and in truth, and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit.\\"<br /><br />Although Tom Joad's final speech is actually different, the spirit is the same and it's easy to see why he picked that part as it is easily the most profound part of a deeply moving novel.	2012-03-19
US	13248451	R36N7TII5PD7SV	0143039431	999720718	The Grapes of Wrath	Books	5	2	3	N	N	At first interesting, after much thought amazing.	This is an absolutely fantastic book illustrating the difficulties of many Americans during the depression (and the strength of a family to stick together and fight for each other). Though it is definitely not a page turner, and frequently slow, this is perhaps the only book I've read that I find myself frequently telling people they should read.<br /><br />I had a difficult time appreciating the book while reading it; however, I greatly appreciated it upon completion (about 4 years ago) and my appreciation keeps growing. I find the book to be very relevant and a good reminder of how life was for many just 80 years ago, especially when I hear people talking about how difficult or unfair things are today in the US. It's a sad reminder that, although I wouldn't wish the Joads' life on anyone, our society is far removed from the difficulties that instilled strength, resiliency, and a code of honor that made both that generation and this country great.<br /><br />I'm tempted to give this book 4 stars because it's slow and sometimes difficult to get through (though I am a fan of the chapter structure where Steinbeck alternates between long chapters involving the Joads and short anecdotes not involving the Joads but showing further insight into life during that time), but due to its impact on me and my continued frequent recommendation to others to read it, giving it less than 5 stars would be an injustice to this book. Also, I'm not sure who I would broadly recommend this book to, but I would not generally recommend it to younger audiences (who may lack sufficient insight into life and history) as I didn't read it until I was nearly 30 and still needed some time after reading it to fully appreciate it.	2012-03-11

One of these families is the Joads (the collective character of this tale), which \\"in group\\" confront the continuous adversity \\"individualism\\" is offering them every step of the way from the moment they leave Oklahoma until they finally try to settle down in California where they had gone following the indications of a handbill requesting orange pickers and just one unique hope, to find work, but in California things does not seem to be the way it looked, and the battle renews and rages on. Contemporary issues arise, such as immigration, equality, unemployment, egotism, hunger, strikes, law, authority, social demands. The ending leaves a message of hope, related to the will each individual possess in its more intimate and spiritual values.

Ma Joad, in particular, struck me as an unwaveringly strong character who tries to hold her family together, even as it disintegrates before her eyes.<br /><br />In the interchapters, Steinbeck casts his lens on the larger situation and suffering of these migrants, and makes a sobering social commentary on the state of America and its politics of commerce and capitalism. Some readers have commented on the oppressive view that Steinbeck forces on the reader, but that to me is secondary, because the narrative persuades through both the examination of the micro as well as the macro, and it is a point of view that demands careful gaze.	2012-02-17

I waited for my mom to come to the store after security called her, imagining the anger she'd have in her face when she saw me and feeling shame, shame, shame. I didn't cry until she walked into the office and burst into tears, herself! Then I did, too. And on the way home, as I sobbed, she said things like, \\"I know, I know,\\" and \\"Shh...\\" Then she bought me a pineapple softserve ice cream cone at a drive-thru Mexican restaurant and took me home, where I laid in bed waiting for the sound of my dad's diesel engine and my impending doom.<br /><br />I thought of that while reading this book because Ma Joad, the strongest character I've met in a Steinbeck story, would tell her kids or her husband to hush when they started doubting themselves and their choices. She'd say something like, \\"Of course you did what you could! We all did. Everybody did what they could, so hush now, and peel these potatoes. Your pa and brothers need to eat!\\" Even her son who had killed somebody (in self-defense) was given a full pardon by Ma and told to just hush up about it! Of course you didn't put shame on the family! You did yer time, now hush!<br /><br />So, scrawny Ruthie Joad goes and tells a whopper of a family secret that changes things for everybody and puts an instant fear into the whole clan, including Ma, who gets wind of it from little Winfield. And Winfield says, hopefully, \\"Gonna whup her, Ma?\\" But no. She orders everyone to be quiet about it to Ruthie and not make her feel worse than she already does. When Ruthie shows up, she runs to her ma's middle and screams and cries into her belly. Ma knew, of course. Nobody can punish a person like him or herself. Just read the book and look at Uncle John, and you'll know it, too.<br /><br />Now, this book is not historical fiction--it's fiction from history. John Steinbeck wrote this book while all of the labor injustice was happening. Effigies of Steinbeck were burned all over California in protest over this revealing saga! He grew up in Salinas, well off, but idealistic. He spent his school vacations working in fields and on farms and listening, listening, listening to people's stories. He felt love and empathy for these people. He saw it as another Civil War for our country, but this time between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have nots,\\" which is why he used a phrase from a Civil War ballad as his title.<br /><br />Books about injustice and upheaval make me feel so anxious because they make me look at myself. My students read books about Martin Luther King, Jr., or Rosa Parks, and they feel empowered. They say really lofty things about justice and rights and humanity and what was wrong, and what they would do. And I'm glad to hear them talk like that, but I get anxious during this sort of talk, too. I don't think I'd have been the one to stand up against anything. If I were there, I wouldn't have been picketing, facing violence! I'd have been hiding in my cabin, wishing everyone else would just go back to their cabins and work and stop causing trouble. People are likely to get their heads smashed in when they stand against power. And thank the Lord (Ma Joad's Lord, please, not Rosasharn's or Uncle John's) that there are people who will. Okay, enough about me and how I am no hero. It makes me feel squirmy.<br /><br />Though, maybe I'll find my cause. There was one thing that got to Ma Joad enough to shame her kids, and that was selfishness or self-pity. \\"It's not all about you, Rosasharn,\\" she says to her pregnant daughter. She tells her that if she were well and not with child, she'd give her a whop in the face for all that self-pity. She wanted her to understand that you can't be self-serving! You've got to give even when you've got nothing! And Rosasharn learned that lesson. I learned that she had in one of the most beautiful paragraphs I will ever read.ling saga!

You've got to give even when you've got nothing! And Rosasharn learned that lesson. I learned that she had in one of the most beautiful paragraphs I will ever read.	2012-01-31

There are many parallels in the novel's plot to what is occurring in our economy today.  There are differences, too, and they are poignant:  the strong family bond, the lack of governmental aid to the poor, and how they lived, from their cars to their houses both simplifies and complicates the Joad's journey to California and they hope, stability for their family.  Anyone who has driven along Route 66 or the Texas panhandle, for instance, can really appreciate Steinback's intense description of the Joad's journey to California and just how nerve-wracking it must have been without the benefit of a good car, motels, bottled water, and credit cards.<br /><br />For those who might complain that the narrative intermingled with the Joad's story is too lefty or smacks of propaganda, I think it adds a good balance to the story.  It gives you a sense of the anger and sadness building among nameless people as their lives fall apart, while the Joads give a name and a face to the suffering.  And again, I think it is pretty on par with what is going on today:  a universal feeling of helpfulness that really hasn't found a purpose, plan, or footing among private struggles of individuals.<br /><br />Long story short:  Grapes of Wrath is a really good novel.  And anytime I read a book where there is a moment when I actually have to put the book down because it is too painful to go on, I can't help but love the book.	2012-01-18

The transition of the 1930's economy in the Midwest to mechanization is similar to the current transitional economy in the U.S., where we are moving from manufacturing to more of a tech base. We are moving away from what we know to something we don't know, and people are not sure what to do or what to make of it.<br /><br />I have loved the Steinbeck books I have read up to this point (Travels With Charley, Of Mice and Men, Tortilla Flat, and Cannery Row), but Grapes is much too one sided for me. In typical Steinbeck fashion he puts you right into the story, but he paints with much too broad a brush here. It is slanted, and does not give equal time to both sides. The bad is too bad and the good is too good. Steinbeck seems to leave out a basic understanding of economics, perhaps intentionally, and I'm afraid lots of people just swallow the anti-corporate message without thinking. Some think companies are an unending fountain of money. They are not. Education is the problem, as it was then and continues to be.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath brought to light many things that needed changing in the United States of the 1930's, and for that I give it credit. Illegal monopolies, unfair labor practices, corrupt local officials, etc. are all effectively criticized here by Steinbeck. The immigrating Joads, as legal U.S. citizens, have rights as citizens which should be protected.<br /><br />The character of Al, one of the Joad's sons, is a bright spot. Al is changing and embracing the future by learning to work on cars, even after the mechanization has forced the Joads out of their sharecropped farm. The Great Depression forced people to move and to change, developing new skills as the economy changed. Al's forward-thinking adaptation made me wonder if the government relief mentioned in the book simply enables people to sit right where they are when things change and simply cash a government check each month, draining society instead of adapting to the change and contributing to the new economy in a positive way. I am afraid this type of thinking so prevalent in modern society is teaching people to become dependent on the government (in exchange for votes) instead of going out and making their own opportunities.<br /><br />While reading The Grapes of Wrath I lost patience with Steinbeck's rhetoric in which corporations and the wealthy got that way by unjustly taking advantage of others. Even small businesses (restaurants, stores, gas stations, etc.) in the book are treated with contempt. Small businesses create jobs. Large corporations create jobs. Individuals who gamble their family's security and future by starting their own businesses create jobs. These are positive forces in the economy. The Government taking money away from these positive forces is a drain, which must be justified in one way or another.<br /><br />At times the Joad family is starving, but they balk at working for wages they deem are too low. You do what you have to do however, and the Joads end up working and eating. Companies don't get ahead by cheating people for very long, and The Grapes of Wrath effectively illustrates the labor abuses of that time. Reforms were made and things eventually got better for the workers as well as for the economy as a whole. It is how the Free Market works, for better or worse. The real challenge lies in dealing with the transitional economy and figuring out how to prosper in it. It is a cycle, and The Grapes of Wrath is timely today because we are in that same type of economic cycle in the U.S. right now. Rather than looking to The Grapes of Wrath for answers, however, maybe we should look to it instead to learn from our past mistakes.government check each month, draining society instead of adapting to the change and contributing to the new economy in a positive way.

A lot of people read this book in High School or early in College, but for some reason my HS skipped it, probably because it is a little longer than most of the other books we read. That said, I'm very glad I took the time to read it, and also find a certain amount of serendipity in the fact that I read it as the effects of the 2008 financial meltdown are still reeking havoc on careers of so many people. The book in of its self is great, but the timing of when I read seems to give it a little extra kick.<br />Grapes of Wrath is often labeled as a work of socialist fiction. Personally, I didn't really get that from my reading of it. There are workers that are treated unfairly, they are often harassed or oppressed by their employers, they theorize that if they stand together they could demand more, and they find that they are often better off when they are left to fend for themselves. If you look at these, you will find that there isn't much in the way of propaganda here. Workplace bullying by those with any level of authority is a fairly well-known and well accounted fact of life. Your boss is a jerk and the company will do anything it can to suck every bit of effort out of you for the lowest price possible; maybe this was not well known in the 30's or people were more ashamed of it then, but now it is what it is. Which leads to the next point about workers sticking together. I don't think it is particularly socialist to realize the practical fact that there is strength in numbers, which can be leveraged against businesses that go to far. I know what Marxism is, and that isn't it. Finally, the characters often remark that they are better off taking care of themselves or enforcing their own laws. That sounds like a small government libertarian's dream to me.<br />The pleasant surprises I found in the book involved the well developed characters, accept for Noah (pointless), Connie (plot point but nearly pointless) and Uncle John (broken record.) I was able to create a solid visual image of this tight knit family that shared so much together. You had a real sense of each person's place in the Joad family, that could be alternately openly loving or mechanically efficient. I also found Steinbeck's use of different literary tools interesting, with him moving (although not very smoothly) from immersive local color, to disjointed stream-of-conscious, to poetic prose. He uses these tools to help bring more texture to the parts they are used in without being too heavy handed, although his jumping from different perspectives or suddenly going head first in the mile a minute mind of a used car salesman, can be jarring.<br />Some readers complained that this book is slow. That is true; it is a little slow, but I believe it is probably supposed to be. This isn't an action packed thriller or romantic drama, its a yarn about simple people trying to live their lives in a world that is far from simple. If the story didn't take the time to set up the atmosphere, to really set the scene, I don't think the book would be half as good.<br />Finally, given the ago of book, there has been a lot of time for people to over analyze its historical accuracy. This is a work of fiction set against a series of events that happened in history; so looking further than that is merely an academic exercise. Its in the Literature section of the book store not the History or Non-Fiction section, so you would have to be a fool to put too much stock in the writer's interpretation of events.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1.) Steinbeck does a wonderful job of capturing the mindset of a farming family. He waxes poetic about the cultivation of land in a way that I wouldn't have thought possible, which in turn gave me a real sense of how much love farmers can have for their life's work.<br />2.) The fictional Joad family lets a 21st Century urbanite like me look into a world that I havelittle connection to and no experience with. A good writer engages the reader in a way that makes them feel like they are sharing the story with the characters, and Steinbeck does exactly that. I really wanted to know what happens to the characters after the all too open end (see con below.)<br />3.) Some may disagree with Steinbeck's personal reasoning behind writing Grapes of Wrath, but it's hard to argue with his economics, especially since we are seeing a model of it in action now. As the demands for jobs go up, workers are willing to work for increasingly less out of fear and desperation. Just as Steinbeck's farm owners pit workers against each other to lower wages and work conditions, so do the managers and presidents of business today. Don't want to work overtime? There is a line of applicants that will. Want $50k a year? I have 10 resumes from people that will do it for $40k a year. You've got a retirement plan and pension? I should get rid of you because you cost too much and hire a college grad for the half the money and don't have to offer them any kind of benefits because they will be happy just to be working. This is real and I see it happening every day.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.) Like most good books, Grapes of Wrath isn't for the casual reader. It's long, slow and thoroughly depressing; as well has needing a little bit of historical context. I think it was worth it, but I know not everyone will get a lot out of it.<br />2.) If I was looking to edit the book down to make it easier to read, I would tie up some of the dead ends or eliminate them altogether. What was the point of Noah? Do so many animals need to get hit by cars? Why did Casey play such an important role, just to vanish for a quarter of the book and then meet an inauspicious end suddenly.<br />3.) The book ends very abruptly. There is a complete lack of finality that makes you wonder if the author really knew what was going to happen to his characters when he started writing. To just end the story in the middle of a sort of hairy moment, after suffering so much with the Joads, it almost seems like a waste. Steinbeck closed on a pretty, albeit odd in a modern context, visual, but I think it was a very unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A great book about the American experience for some in the 1930's that is a little long, but for me should have been a little longer if only to give the reader a sense of what the future would have in store for the Joads.ience with.

The way Steinbeck wrote of the Joads' struggles was entertaining and informative. This novel was somewhat depressing, however, because of how real it was. Families moved to find work during the Great Depression and found themselves struggling to find work, just like the Joad family. A quote I found very interesting, \\"For man, unlike any other thing organic or inorganic in the universe, grows beyond his work, walks up the stairs of his concepts, emerges ahead of his accomplishments,\\" shows the significance of growing from experiences. The Joad family grew from everything they went through. This was one of the best books I've read, and I will definitely be revisiting it!	2011-11-21

In fact, when you see friends and others out of work or losing their homes it looks a LOT more like a 'Depression'.  A recent article in the LA Times pointed out that what we *don't* yet see coming out of the hard times this time around is great art - it seems the movie makers and musicians are too far removed from the plight of normal Americans to see what's going on.  I guess we can always revisit some of the art to come out of that *other* Depression back in the 1930s, like Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.<br /><br />The book centers around the Joad family from Oklahoma.  Having lost their farm to the bank they decide to move to California after seeing fliers advertising high pay for farm workers, and hit the road in an old truck converted to haul all their worldly belongings.  On the road, however, they notice a lot of others in similar circumstances are also heading to California with similarly high hopes.  And when they arrive they find a vast oversupply of labor has driven down wages to levels making it impossible to support a family.  Even worse, however, they arrive to find that nearly all the land is owned by huge corporate farmers who are colluding to exploit workers and keep wages low, and using law enforcement officials to prevent unions from forming.<br /><br />In spite of the optimism the Joad family has for making a better life in California, this is not a happy story and was not meant to be such.  Steinbeck famously wrote \\"I want to put a tag of shame on the greedy bastards who are responsible for this,\\" and there's a lot of that same sentiment today.  While the migrant worker aspect of the story might remind readers more of the Mexican workers of today along with its attendant racism (\\"Okies\\" were as reviled as \\"illegal immigrants\\" are now), the fear of losing one's home and not being able to provide for a family will resonate with most everyone.  And the book illustrates well the effects of the economic disaster on families.  The Joads find themselves disintegrating even while on the road, and they learn that they must rely on their larger community more and more.  Assistance by the federal government is an oasis from the persecution by the harassment of the California deputies, but isn't enough for them to become self-reliant again.<br /><br />The style of the writing is fairly raw in its portrayal of the poor.  The Joads are people of the land and their language is coarse and talk of sex is frequent.  Nonetheless, they come across as honest and deserving of respect and sympathy.  Interspersed throughout the narrative are chapters that leave the Joads to show the larger view of the situation.  And while I found some of these diversions annoying, the overall story is so powerful it makes the reader angry at the situation.  Also, it took me about 150 pages before I really got into the story.  It's not what you'd call a \\"pleasurable\\" read, but it's compelling for the gravity of the story and you can't help but feel hopeful for the family to get a break.  And it's probably a story that should be read again in these difficult economic times.And the book illustrates well the effects of the economic disaster on families.

I liked almost everything about this book--the characters, the story, the history, the dialogue.  One of the only complaints was the abrupt and pointless ending, although I do commiserate with the author because how do you end a novel such as this?  This novel is a masterpiece in itself as well as in what it accomplished by bringing to light the impact of the Great Depression on the working poor.  It's hard to know if this story is the worst of the worst or just the story of an average family during this time.  Either way, it's a tragedy and very moving.  As a sidenote, Steinbeck definitely exhibits a hope in communism and socialism to bring equality and end the kind of poverty illustrated in this book.  When this book was written, history hadn't yet judged the communist/socialist experiment which has now been shown to be responsible for more injustice and poverty than what it replaced.  Along those lines, the novel's villains are the \\"big bankers\\" and \\"big farm owners.\\"  Ironically, FDR's New Deal policies dictated price controls for farm goods and wages which led to mandated government destruction of food during the Depression.  So, the New Deal was just as big a \\"villain\\" as the bankers and farm owners even though the book leaves that part out.	2011-09-03

Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.<br /><br />Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.<br /><br />Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.<br /><br />Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee!

I just want to say the following:<br /><br />This is one only about 5 books I have read in my life that I would give 5 stars to. It is more than a book, it is a statement on Americana. Steinbeck's masterpiece, every sentence has meaning. This book transcends generations. Read it!	2011-07-10
US	33946626	R182DEDD56L6Y7	0143039431	999720718	The Grapes of Wrath	Books	5	6	8	N	N	It took 150 pages to hook me, but once it did...	Over the years I've read and heard from many people about The Grapes of Wrath.  The comments ranged from, \\"it's overrated\\" to \\"it's the best book ever written by an American author\\".  I will not try to make you believe either.  However, this is the most powerful writing that I have ever read.  There are passages in this book that just make you stop and sit back to think a bit.  One that hit me very hard was midway through the book: \\"Pray God some day kind people won't all be poor\\".  This line was written in response to the destitute tenant farmers scrabbling for work with nearly no money putting a few coins each on a pile in front of a tent where a little boy had died of malnutrition so that the family could have him buried.<br /><br />Throughout history the American dream has had many speed bumps or as in the case of this novel, barriers. But the spirit of the American people in every instance has overcome all.  This is a book about that spirit, nearly broken, but not ever completely.  There isn't much that can befall a family that the Joad family did not have to deal with.  It's a story of persistence and overcoming all odds without losing your own humanity.  When everything is against you and you can still look at the other person as someone in more need, then you will begin to understand what made these people.<br /><br />Seventy years later, this story has as much or more relevance than the period from which it came.  The world is absorbing yet another economic crisis.  There are many differences between now and the era of the Dust Bowl and Steinbeck brings these to the foreground with his typical prescience.<br /><br />The family unit is front and center in this work.  The mother and father were so over matched by the elements of nature, progress and technology and just plain happenstance that every member of the family stepped in and picked up the entire group on their shoulders when it was needed.  Looking back at this particular element of the story by way of 2011 makes me think that as a culture, we have lost some of this most fundamental building block of society.<br /><br />As liberal and progressive a thinker as John Steinbeck was in presenting this story, I cannot help but think just how conservative his thinking by today's standards.  His use of ostracizing the children at croquet and then using a similar method on adults at the government camp would be thought to be draconian today, but in fact these were commonly used forms of punishment to protect the whole of society from those that wanted to break it down.  Are we missing this element in today's society?<br /><br />In The Grapes of Wrath, several years of dust storms and drought have brought on major changes in the way farms and farmland are owed and operated.  The big, bad corporations and banks take over the land when the tenant farmers are not able to make their payments.  Is today's economic crash much different?  Are we substituting housing for farms?  How many of those subsequent bankers lost their jobs to a different but very real economic stress in 2008 as many large banks had to downsize and re-organize?<br /><br />The relevance is real, the emotion palpable, and the understanding that it could happen to anyone is scary.  Yes, The Grapes of Wrath is as terrific as it is terrifying, real as it is relevant, and is as American as Apple Pie.  If you haven't read it before, please do so.  Instead of ridiculous demands in our schools to read Great Expectations, The Grapes of Wrath should be the book of choice.  There is just so much to be learned from this great book.k that as a culture, we have lost some of this most fundamental building block of society.

The narratives describing a place, an event, a feeling or emotion were so well written that the reader would feel transported back in time, to the place, made to see the event as it happened, made to feel the emotions.  This, no matter if one has to struggle to understand some of the spoken words in context.<br /><br />A lot can be learned from this book, not only about history and the appreciation of what we have in the present day, but also more about the human strength, tenacity and innate goodness in the face of a seeming insurmountable adversity.  I really wish it has a happier ending, say a reunion of the Joad family, or better times...but really, what happier ending could it have than one's giving of self to a stranger in dire need?  Somehow, the reader knows, as Mama Joad had known, that all will be alright in the end.	2011-06-20

As many of the inhabitants of rural America--especially in the South and Appalachia--are of Scotch-Irish descent (many of my own ancestors included) it is natural to expect that the American revival meeting might have its origin in Lowland Scotland.  I also found that these Scottish \\"Holy Fairs\\" were ridiculed by the poet Robert Burns in his poem \\"The Holy Fair\\", as can be found in [[ASIN:1456381040 Poems and Songs of Robert Burns]].  Indeed, Burns considered such gatherings to be an assembly of hypocrites who attended these meetings in order to arrange assignations with the young women attending such events.  Of course Burns (the sire of numerous illegitimate children) was all for debauchery--just as long as it was indulged in a way that was free of pretense!<br /><br />As I continued thinking about this aspect of religious revival meetings I remembered the section of The Grapes of Wrath in which Tom Joad encounters Jim Casy, who had been a revival preacher in Tom's youth.  Casy tells Tom about how he would bed young women in the grass after they had been excited by such meetings, which seemed to have acted as a sort of aphrodisiac.  In Casy's confession to Tom he worried about his own hypocrisy in those days--leading those girls into sin just after exhorting them to shun such encounters.	2011-05-30

I finished reading this in December(now it's April) but I still remember how realistic this was written by Steinbeck.  He makes the characters come alive and breathe.  Their hard lives are seen as heroic and well done scenes in a long play.<br />  This is supposed to be a communistic version of California with the scenes of the goons beating up the union leaders.  Look now what is happening to destroy unions in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio(pretty soon New Jersey, Florida, and who knows). So Steinbeck was right in 1938 to portray unions as the enemy of the rich capitalist ranchers and agricultural powerful interests.  The poor Joads were only trying to do honest work and look what happened to them.<br />  First the banks wouldn't lend to them back in Oklahoma so they decided to travel to California to make a new living.  Then when they tried to make a little more money they were beaten by the union haters.  Their camp was destroyed by the owners.<br />  Supposedly John Steinbeck wrote this in 5 months in 1936 at the time of the Dust Bowl.  This is history that is rarely taught in America today.  Young people should read this American classic.  There is a Steinbeck Museum in Salinas, California and I hope to go there as soon as possible.	2011-04-13
US	51888319	R2K6JY6O0GMVKO	0143039431	999720718	The Grapes of Wrath	Books	5	1	2	N	N	An American Classic	I'm fifty years old, I've read literally thousands of books, and I'm not aware that I've ever read a novel written by John Steinbeck.  Recognizing this deficiency, I ordered a Steinbeck collection, seven of his most celebrated works including The Grapes of Wrath.  I vaguely recall seeing the film starring Henry Fonda, and am well aware of the plot and the historical backdrop, but nothing can take the place of reading the work itself.<br /><br />As most know, the book details the westward migration of the Joad family, as they are uprooted from their Oklahoma homestead by the evils of the Great Depression, the Oklahoma dust bowl and the advent of mechanized farming.  The family harbors visions of milk and honey awaiting their arrival in California, or so they are assured by the numerous handbills promising plentiful work and bountiful riches.  What await them instead are rapacious labor recruiters, unfriendly natives and slow but sure starvation.<br /><br />Steinbeck certainly succeeds in painting a vivid and stark picture of the hopelessness faced by the migrants.  His chapters alternate between \\"big picture\\" overviews and the particular heartbreaks and hazards faced by the Joads in particular.  The story is an education in economics, labor relations, politics and human nature.  In this day and age, it is difficult to conceive of children literally starving to death in the shadow of the most productive agricultural land in the country, much of it lying fallow and off limits to those that were capable of growing the food to nourish their own families.<br /><br />This is a very powerful novel, both with regard to the emotions that it taps and the beliefs and conceptions that one holds.  It provides a sharp contrast between a period when so many were desperate to work for as little as something to eat, to one in which so many demand so much without having to lift a finger.  There must be a happy medium.	2011-03-30

California, to look for a new beginning, is their destination. And along the way, it's all about the struggles as humans they go through, their self sacrifices, soul searching and willingness to band together just to get through it alive.<br /><br />If nothing, Grapes of Wrath is moving, and heartbreaking but tedious with description and choke full of lengthy descriptions. I don't recommend this if you absolutely hate historical fiction, as it takes a certain preference of historical fiction to enjoy this novel. I liked it in the end. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for historical fiction, maybe it's because I was forced to read it, but I enjoyed it. I don't think I could've grasped the symbolic Christian references - and I think it would be much more appreciated by a more worldly, older generation than mine.<br /><br />Regardless, try it. It's a classic anyway, there must be a reason for that. Maybe you'll even like it at the end like me.	2011-01-27

The Grapes of Wrath by Steinback depicts the life of Joad family as a microcosm of the immigrant workers during the Depression era, and Steinback ingeniously describes the workers' plights and ensuing 'wraths'. The novel was so impressive toward the end; Steinback imbues great metaphors such as the baby, rising rain, vineyard, and so forth, and he powerfully portrays the scenes, especially the final one. I, as a student fond of reading, have to say that the novel was one of the few living novels that I have read.	2010-09-04

Then, one day, I decided to give it one last try. For whatever reason I was finally ready and wow, did I love it! The plight of the Joad family evoked such a combination of despair and hope that I felt as though my heart would burst. I had read Steinbeck before, (\\"East of Eden\\" is one of my favorites), but \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is so relevant to the present economic situation in this country that it really struck a chord with me. I imagine there are many American families living a modern-day version of this story. Steinbeck was a master and his vision extends into a future we can only imagine.

In this remarkable novel we travel, suffer, laugh, cry, mourn and endure with the Joad family of Sallisaw, Oklahoma. The 455 page Penguin edition is nicely edited including footnotes and a useful introduction and bibliography of books about the novel and its author John Steinbeck.<br />  The Joads are forced to leave their home following a bank foreclosure. They decide to travel to California based on a handbill promising good jobs in the golden state. They ruefully discover that this is a false promise to induce hundreds of thousands to travel west so that the owners won't have to pay the workers a decent wage. The journey is analogous to the Hebrews slaves escape from Egyptian captivity as they sought out the Promised Land under the leadership of Moses in the bibilcal book of Exodus. Consider the affinities:<br />1. 12 persons are in the Joad party as there were 12 tribes of Israel.<br />2. The elderly grandparents grandpa and grandma Joad die before California is reached; similar to the death of Moses on Mount Horeb and the death of the exodus generation before Israel was settled.<br />3. Water and the crossing of rivers is important in both Exodus and The Grapes of Wrath.<br />  The book has many memorable characters:<br />Rose of Sharon-This Joad young woman is deserted by her husband Connie while she is pregnant. In the last unforgettable scene of the book she gives her breast filled with milk to a starving vagrant in a dank barn.<br />Noah Joad is a mentally damaged Joad son who decides to stay by a river and fish instead of moving west with the family.<br />Al Joad is the youngest Joad brother. He chases girls in all the camps the family stays in and keeps the beat up truck going down the road. As the novel ends he is engaged to be married to a fellow migrant girl of 16.<br />  The book abounds in minor characters which range from a determined turtle eager to reach his destination (much like the Joads are eager to reach the Golden State); slutty waitresses, burly truck drivers and fellow migrants suffering the slings and arrows of Depression era poverty. The language in The Grapes of Wrath is graphic, profane and based on the ungrammatical speech of poorly educated country people.<br />  The novel's title \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is taken from the second line of Julia Ward Howe's \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\\" The book is a battle cry for justice to the poor migrants of the 1930's. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is still a controversial novel since its publication in 1939.

Jim Casey (his initials are the same as Jesus Christ) is murdered by a mob for defending the poor and weak as Jesus was crucified on the cross.

Being below the age of 18 in high school, and still being financially supported by my parents in college, I would have probably knocked the book. I think the themes in the book are so complex and so adult that there is definitely a maturity level that needs to be reached to appreciate the book.<br /><br />Steinbeck does an excellent job of relating to the Joad's struggles, painting a picture of the depression, and truly captures the pain and reality of the travels to the west in 1939. Just from reading the book made the depression so much more alive where I could feel the Joad's heartbreak. I was just sick reading about the treatment of the people, but relieved to see the acts of kindness done throughout the novel. My favorite character was by far Ma. She set an example of how to keep a family together and the true definition of a humanitarian. Though I wouldn't have begged to read this book in high school, or college, I am truly appreciative that I waited to read it.	2010-05-11

I have a natural interest with American history, and my main interest is in the early 20th century during the 20s-40s. This book does a wonderful job at portraying that time period, as well as realizing what life was like for your average working man during our countries worst economic decade. People were fired and lost their land, people traveled across the country to find minimum wage jobs to support their families, people dies and lost family memebers on the way, people broke the law and commited suicide to cope, and people were miserable on top of all this. The characters aren't too boring, and go through some of the depressions worst moments. This book also shows the brutality of the government and how they would force people out of nice camps and jail them just for voicing their opinions. In the end, nothing changes, and everyone is as bad off as when they started off, if not worse. They are without a home, job, or decent meals, and this is all shown very clearly throughout the novel, as well as how Americans worked together to support each other with humane acts to hopefully make it out of the depression and regain their homes and jobs.	2010-04-23

The Joad family, uprooted from their 40-acre Oklahoma farm during the late 1930s by economic hard times, brought on by drought and dust storms and exacerbated by corporate greed and efficiencies of big agriculture, journey westward to California because they \\"got to\\" in order to stay alive, make a decent living, and retain a tenuous sliver of human dignity.<br /><br />Through strife, exhaustion and personal tragedy, the Joads maintain their faith that the sun will shine tomorrow, no matter how heavily the rain falls today.  In sharp contrast to Grampa's dream to \\"get me a whole bunch a grapes off a bush . . . [and] squash `em on my face an' let `em run offen my chin,\\" and the family's hope that \\"it'll be all different out there--plenty work, an' ever'thing nice an' green, an' little white houses an' oranges growin' aroun',\\" California for the newcomer Joads is synonymous with difficulty finding work, menial wages when work is available, harsh living conditions, blatant animosity towards \\"Okies\\" from the local residents, constant money shortages, and always being hungry.  By story's end, we are left wondering how the Joads are any better off after being flooded out of their railcar encampment next to a cotton field in central California, but we somehow find solace and comfort in the poignancy of Rosasharn's bighearted willingness to give from her own breast the precious life she has to share.<br /><br />According to Steinbeck (and I think he is right on this point), the most generous people are those who have the least material wealth and fewest possessions.  \\"For the quality of owning freezes you forever into `I,' and cuts you off forever from the `we.'\\"  Further, in the words of (reformed) ex-preacher Casy (whose voice is probably Steinbeck's), \\"a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big one.\\"  If only each of us, in our consumerist 21st century material bliss, could take this message to heart, perhaps our ever-so-efficient, profit-oriented, techno-mechanical world might become a friendlier, more compassionate place better fit for our one big human soul.<br /><br />From a stylistic point of view, I found the many interludes juxtaposed between the primary chapters of the book more distracting than informative, particularly the ones written in stream-of-consciousness form.  If the reason for including these \\"extraneous\\" interludes is to provide background information to complement the \\"Joad\\" chapters, then, in my opinion, Steinbeck should have adhered to a more documentary form in these sections, doing the research to develop the interludes into a more substantive and factual picture of the historical setting, condition of American society during the Great Depression years, and ironies of California as a land of boundless opportunity.h of us, in our consumerist 21st century material bliss, could take this message to heart, perhaps our ever-so-efficient, profit-oriented, techno-mechanical world might become a friendlier, more compassionate place better fit for our one big human soul.

People I know who haven't liked it say that it was too slow, or \\"What's the deal with the turtle?\\" and didn't get past the first couple chapters.  Some say it's just too sad.<br /><br />For me, this book meant everything.  \\"To the red country and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth.\\"  When I read this first line, I remember feeling like it was a line that I would always remember.  I had the sense that I wasn't reading a story that some guy named Steinbeck came up with.  I felt like the true feelings and experiences of a very real group of people were simply being funneled to me via Steinbeck's pen.<br /><br />The story felt very relevant to early 21st century America in that Fear seemed to be at the root of all evil.  The Grapes of Wrath showed how Fear could be used to control and exploit people on a huge scale.  It also depicted the human experience as profoundly intertwined with the earth.  The characters' lives were turned upside down by nature, first by drought and later by flood.  The very last scene showed how all of us are on this earth, in this life, together, like it or not and I found comfort in that.<br /><br />I had goosebumps and a pounding heart.  All this for a book where the main characters speak in dialect about the \\"Fambly\\".  Somehow John Steinbeck managed to fit what, to me, is essentially the meaning of life into a short novel about sharecroppers in the 30s.<br /><br />An amazing book.

I only wish I hadn't waited so long to read it. On the other hand, years of personal life experience helped me to truly appreciate a book of this nature.  It earned Steinbeck the Pulitzer Prize in 1940, and I think it's well worth it.<br /><br />The story follows the plight of the dirt-poor Oklahoman sharecroppers who became victims of the great draught of the 1930's. The land literally dried up, turned to dust and blew way, so the banks and the landowners had no other choice but to expel the sharecroppers from their farms. Just like that, their services were no longer needed. The sharecroppers, in turn, were lured to California by a rain of colorful flyers depicting California as the land of opportunity with plenty of well-paying jobs and the chance for a brand new life. All they had to do was get there. So hundreds of thousands of displaced workers packed their eager belongings and headed west.<br /><br />The perspective of the story is from the Joad family's point of view. They were a typical poor family who managed to fix up their old truck with sweat and bailing wire and put together just enough cash money to make the long trip to the agricultural heartland of California. But, of course, something went wrong. Not one thing, but a series of misfortunes. And in my opinion, John Steinbeck did a brilliant job of writing a story that immerses you deep into the heart of the action, as if we, the readers, were sitting in that old broken down truck right alongside the Joad family, breathing the air they breathed, eating the food the ate, feeling their pain, and experiencing everything they experienced. And life on the road to California was tough beyond imagination.<br /><br />By some miracle, the Joad family eventually made it to California. But it wasn't exactly like the flyers had depicted it would be. It seems that the California farmers and landowners had send out thousands of flyers to fill a small number of jobs. If a farmer needed five hundred workers, he'd send out twenty thousand flyers. This tactic resulted in an all-out hunger panic, and forced thousands upon thousands of starving migrants to compete for a relatively few jobs. Thus, wages were negotiated lower and lower until it wasn't even enough money to feed a family. For instance, a man with a wife and children would gladly work for less than a man with no family. And the women broke their backs and worked their own fingers to the bone tending to their impoverished families, oftentimes feeding them nothing more than hot gravy made from a splash lard and flour. So the migrants basically found themselves in the same shape they were in before they left their homes in Oklahoma. They had no money, no food and no gas to go elsewhere. And on top of that, the locals didn't want them near their towns, houses, stores or children for fear of being overrun by thieves. So the police constantly harassed them, shot at them, threw them in jail, and drove them off the property and back onto the open road. Poor, starving, and marooned in a strange land, for the Joad family, as well as the thousands of other migrant families, California proved to be anything but the land of opportunity.<br /><br />John Steinbeck wasn't a writer known for using big bang endings, but to me, the ending of this book was exceptional and, in my opinion, can only be truly understood after you have read the entire book. You'll have to judge for yourself. I give Grapes of Wrath my highest recommendation.thousands of flyers to fill a small number of jobs.

In this wonderful depiction of the horrors the Oklahoma farmers faced during the great dustbowl of the 1930's, I was once again awakened to what a story is supposed to be about.  Too often, we are zapped with this wild tales of one explosion after another, with characters so much bigger than life that they would need the whole universe to survive in.  Here, we see the intimate interactions of those who must struggle to survive in a hostile environment.  We even see those little devilish schemes certain characters assume in order to be human.  (The preacher is the perfect example.)  I was mesmerized by the wonderful way the great novelist paints the mannerisms of each of his characters.<br /><br />The story evolves in a slow and natural way, blazing a trail through the perils the Joad family faces on their journey to California, where hope drives them and keeps them sane.  And even when they complete this trials, other, more severe setbacks are waiting for them in ambush.  It is a story of struggles and greed, of honesty and deceit.  The story finds its way into the deepest chasms of your heart and then tears out a piece.<br /><br />I recommend reading other Steinbeck books first, to savor the best for last.	2009-03-20

No shocking climax (although there are a number of shocking events portrayed throughout), no personified villian... none of that.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath is phenomenal not for the unforgetable cross-country trek of the Joad family in the post-depression years, but for the essence of humanity which Steinbeck so perfectly captures in every chapter.  Steinbeck demonstrates how people who are just barely getting by on what they have sometimes have more to give to their fellow man than the wealthiest citizens our society has to offer.  He draws a vivid picture of struggle during hard times for the most disenfanchized Americans, yet shows the emotional side of poverty and disolutionment, and reveals how genuin humanity can often be most prevalent amidst the most inhumane of living conditions.<br /><br />It has been said that Steinbeck had a socialist agenda when he came out with The Grapes of Wrath, but I couldn't disagree more with that assessment.  Steinbeck isn't so much jabbing at a political/economic injustice in this novel as he is striking at the lack of humanity that can be brought about when business efficiency and profitability are thought to trump human decency.<br /><br />As I write this review the American financial system is once again in peril, and themes from Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath are suddenly becoming more meaningful than they had been when I read this book in high school.  I am amazed at how true and applicable Steinbecks points still ring today, and I recomend this book to anyone who hasn't read it in years or who has yet to read it for the first time.	2009-03-06

It was publicly banned and burned by citizens, it was debated on national radio hook-ups; but above all, it was read.\\" Steinbeck scholar John Timmerman sums up the book's impact: \\"The Grapes of Wrath may well be the most thoroughly discussed novel - in criticism, reviews, and college classrooms - of twentieth century American literature.\\" Within a year John Ford made a major movie starring Henry Fonda and in 1962 the Nobel committee cited The Grapes of Wrath as a \\"great work\\" and as one of the committee's main reasons for granting Steinbeck the Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /><br />Perhaps it's most fundamental message is the equality of life, there is no difference between the poor and rich, other than a bank account, all life is sacred. Treat a poor person with dignity and respect and they will and can do as well as anyone else. It is a timeless message and one that bears constant repeating, although Steinbeck's treatment is a bit folksy and sentimental.<br /><br />Contemporary critic Carl Van Doren said \\"This novel did more than any other Depression novel to revise the picture of America as Americans imagined it.\\" The American image of the frontier pioneer moving westward had shifted to the Joad family. The Joads encapsulated the American character and spirit of independence, scrappy can-do hard-working virtuous, an American hero archetype. Martin Seymour-Smith says the work is fundamentally flawed because Steinbeck can not show why the California businessmen's behavior is wrong - after all, they are just trying to make a living, would the Joad's in their shoes have acted any different? \\"There is a conflict in him [Steinbeck] between the philosophical unanimist and the humane socialist,\\" in other word how the Joad's treat animals (as objects) but demand equality in humans. Thus the books message of all life being sacred, no matter its circumstance, is fundamentally contradicted.<br /><br />In the end Grapes of Wrath is of epic proportions and a gripping story.

Unfortunately I've discovered that there doesn't seem to be any consensus as to which books deserve to be on that list.  Out of the three lists I've come upon only two books were even listed more than once (\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", and \\"Of Mice and Men\\" both by John Steinbeck), so I've been forced to read as many books as possible from all of the lists to try and compose my own.<br /><br />Based on the listings I suspected the \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was going to be a special book so I wanted to own the hardback copy of it, but since it has been out of print for so long I finally broke down and just bought the paperback.  Let me just say that this is one of the best novels ever written and certainly will make my final listing.  It definitely was deserving of the Nobel prize it received.<br /><br />Written in 1939 this book captures the story of the Joad family during the Great Depression when thousands of families left their farms in Oklahoma and moved out to California to try to improve their fortunes, only to find sorrow and death waiting for them there.<br /><br />The story opens with Tom Joad being released from prison on parole for a charge of murder he committed in self defense.  He returns home after being away for several years only to find his family packing up and moving away.  The crops hadn't been good for several seasons and the banks were foreclosing on the loans.  Small farmers were being squeezed out by the big corporations and people were forced to try to find a different profession.<br /><br />When handbills arrive declaring that there was plenty of work out in California picking crops the people took it as a sign of hope.  They sold most of their possessions, packed whatever was left up in a broken down truck and headed west on route 66.<br /><br />The Joad Family consisting of fourteen people and friends plus one dog, along with all of their belongings set out for the trip in just one truck that they bought from a very charismatic salesman and had customized.  (I'm sorry but this was one of the few things in the story I had a problem with, since I just couldn't picture it.  I'm one of seven kids and the nine of us could never fit in a station wagon.  How did fourteen people and a dog fit in one truck with all of our belongings?)  There was Mr. and Mrs. Joad, Grandma and Grandpa Joad, Uncle John, Casy the former preacher, the boys Noah, Tom, Al, and little Winfield, and then there was the daughter Rosasharon (Rose of Sharon) who was pregnant along with her husband Connie, Rosasharon's younger sister Ruthie, plus the dog...<br /><br />While home on the farm when there was work Mr. Joad and the men ran the family, but when they got out on the road without any work Mr. Joad became a lost without his purpose in life, and Mrs. Joad had to take over as the head of the family.  She made all of the tough decisions on the road and showed her strength to keep everyone going.  Uncle John is a dark soul who had never forgiven himself for not being able to do more for his wife when she got sick and died.  He fluctuates in the novel between being a drunk and someone who gives away all of his possessions to the kids to try to make it up to the world.  The oldest son Noah I believe is mentally challenged due to a birthing accident and is kind of lost with all of the changes.  Tom who is the next oldest son represents justice and truth throughout the novel.  Al is a tomcat who's always out looking for girls, but wants to settle down some day and be a mechanic.  Rosasharon and Connie are a young couple who dream of owning their own home with a white picket fence and raising a family.  Casy used to be a preacher but lost his belief in God.  Out in California he discovers a new calling.  The kids Winfield and Ruthie I believe just represent innocence.<br /><br />Along the road they live day to day, dollar to dollar with the belief thatall they need to do is get to California and they would find salvation.  They meet many adversities along the road which they struggle to overcome.  By working together and making some new friends they manage to survive.  The whole country seems to be moving and change is in the air.  Route 66 is perfectly described, from the truck stop restaurants, to the broken down gas stations, we are shown different levels of haves and have nots.  The Joads do a little better job than some in maintaining their moral standards and beliefs but they see the road take it's toll on the people.<br /><br />After many tragedies and tribulations they finally arrive in California only to find that they were mislead.  California may be beautiful and the land fertile but it is all owned by greedy men, who don't want to share any of their wealth.<br /><br />A great number of people have been lured out west in order to produce a cheap labor force to pick crops.  With thousands of people fighting for just a few jobs they would accept lower wages just to keep from starving.  The people tried to turn to the government for help only to find more greed and corruption.  The government would only grant assistance to people who had been in the state for more than a year and the police were all either related to or paid off by the wealthy land owners who wanted to maintain the cheap labor force, so they kept the people moving so they couldn't obtain any lasting residency.<br /><br />People were living in make shift homes on the edge of town called Hoovervilles (after Herbert Hoover, president 1929-1933), until the cops came and forced them out.<br /><br />Even in desperation the people still tried to ban together to create their own rules and maintain their basic morals for what was acceptable, but they were being plagued on at every turn.  They still acted as men, but you could see their tolerance reach critical levels.<br /><br />Each chapter you could feel the tension rising as the people were beaten down and mistreated.  It was hard to believe the level of cruelty.  The rich were afraid of the poor people and thought they were going to take everything they owned so they treated them as less than human and gave them nothing.  The poor could only turn to other poor people for help since no one else seemed to care.  Throughout the book as the people reached a greater and greater level of desperation you wondered when they were going to break, but the human spirit seems to persevere.<br /><br />After all that transpires you are just amazed at the ability of these people to keep fighting and go on, and that gives you a little bit of hope.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book.y would find salvation.

Giving a book like the Grapes of Wrath to a 15 year old serves largely to put them off fine literature for the rest of their lives.  The depth of understanding and compassion for the human condition as communicated by a book like this is simply unfathomable to those who haven't lived much life yet, but after you've gotten a healthy dose of living, it comes across like fine music to a trained ear.<br /><br />My heart doesn't bleed for the Joads today as it might have 25 years ago.  Yes, it's grim and unfair, but it's no longer shocking or disturbing, and I can see now that Steinbeck didn't intend sensationalism to be the main point.  What he's about is revealing the human dignity, the innate goodness and unbreakable pride of these people, and by extension the American people in general, something that still resonates today, especially with reference to the working classes.  When the Joads and their kind decline government hand outs, requesting instead the simple opportunity to work hard and be rewarded commensurate with their labor (even if it means a grueling cross-country journey to a place they don't know) one can hear today's white working poors' exasperated disdain for government, insisting that they simply be allowed to keep more of their pay and not be held back in their efforts by nit-picking legalities and cultural trivialities that disapprove of their lifestyles.<br /><br />Sadly, most such people will never read the Grapes of Wrath.  Worse yet, many liberal lawmakers won't read it again after high school and won't glean from it an essential understanding about the pride and perseverance of the American working class that could benefit them in cultivating this constituency.  A book like the Grapes of Wrath should be required reading - for every American over 30.	2007-12-16

One can easily imagine Tom Joad or, more to the point, his sister Rosasharon saying it in her \\"sharing\\" scene in the closing pages of the book.  I read this book, the first time, in sophomore study hall just before lunch in small town Wisconsin; largely as a result of the wretched deprivations depicted in the book,  I remember rushing home, sure I would starve to death if I didn't immediately ingest the bowl of soup and sandwich my mother had waiting for me.  As the Joad family move out of Dustbowl Oklahoma toward the promised land of California, the Joads must survive on fried dough and unripe fruit (from which they are warned they may \\"get the skitters\\"); Along the way they meet tragedy and, in most cases, their dreams of a better life are smashed like last year's fallen fruit...And, yet, they still hope for the best.  Maybe the next Hooverville will be different, maybe the next fruit ranch; if they could only make it there. Government offered little or no help.  Long before the rest of the nation hit the skids, farmers were getting the short end of the stick; they never saw any of the prosperity of the 1920's, and the Dustbowl didn't help either.  But Tom Joad sees hope in numbers, \\"Wherever a guy is hungry, I'll be there...\\",  he says, urging the readers to come along, to fight injustice wherever  they can:  a challenge as urgent today as when Tom made it in this wonderful book.	2007-07-27

The irony is that it is a book about ordinary people, and the language and plot are hardly difficult at all.  The Joads, driven off their Oklahoma farm by the encroachment of industrialization, seek a better life in California - with thousands of others in the same position.  The migrants are forced to compete for survival, but only by leveraging their power as a group can they ever truly triumph.  The theme of individual vs. group is further emphasized by the form of the novel.  Steinbeck uses alternating chapters about the Joads and \\"interchapters\\" about the migrants as a whole.  Thus the book, besides being the great American epic about the Joads, is also a social and political novel that caused an enormous uproar upon its publication.  This is a book that is part of the collective American conscious and should be read by everyone who wants to feel thoroughly educated.	2007-05-21

Is it because it was written before you were born? (1939)  Does its name scare you, as it did me, into imagining it would be about all sorts of odd things, as I did?  Well don't let your preconceived notions fool you.  It's a terrific novel. It is a great piece of literature that won Mr. Steinbeck a well-deserved Pulitzer Prize, and eventually, with his other contributions to literature, earned him a Nobel Prize.<br /><br />What can I say about the Joads that has not already been said in the past sixty-odd years?  How could I have missed knowing them earlier?  I read this story, with its \\"country speech\\" and \\"country ways\\" and wanted to take them all in.  I wanted to comfort them all.  I didn't know what I would find at the Joads when we first meet Tom going home.  Who is this Tom Joad Jr. and why was he in jail?  He must have had a HORRIBLE life to end up there, he must have.  Then you meet the 'fambly.'  You live with the 'fambly.'  You see proud Pa try so hard to be the head of the home during the Dust Bowl migration.  This family, who for generations upon generations, upon generations lived off their land.  The land wasn't a piece of property, it was family.  It fed them, it housed them.  They raised a crop to sell, so they can pay off the loans they took when times were tough before.  When the rains stopped coming, and the payments to the bank stopped being made, the 'banks' came and told all these people to leave.  Imagine someone coming to tell you that the land you have lived on all your life, the land of your fathers and grandfathers belonged to the banks and you had to leave right now.  Imagine the dread.  All your life spent in the same place, with the same neighbors, the same strong values; \\"Yes Sir! Yes Ma'am!\\"  No talking back, everyone knew their place.  And then the dust came, and took away everything you knew.<br /><br />The Joads sell everything they own, load up a beat-up truck with the necessities (food, water, mattresses, clothes, pots, pans) and head towards the promised land of California.  Along with 500,000 other displaced people.  All looking for land to work; it's all they know.  You get land, you work it, it's yours.  They had no idea what life outside of Oklahoma was really  going to be like.<br /><br />There's Ma, trying so hard to keep the family strong.  She's the backbone.  She eventually takes charge, which, back on their farm, was unheard of.  Times were changing.<br /><br />Ma & Pa, 6 kids, Grandma & Grandpa, Uncle John, the Preacher Casey, and Connie, the husband of one of Ma's daughters.  Thirteen people in one truck.<br /><br />I wanted to bring them home, let them eat, give them a hot bath, tell them it'll be ok.  I wanted to simultaneously smack the heck out of Rose of Sharon (Rosasharn) and comfort her in the end; tell her she really did do good in God's eyes at that very last paragraph.  I saw Ruthie grow in those 7 or 8 months into someone I did not like.  She was mean, she was vindictive, she was 7.  I saw humanity at its worse.  Things like this really did happen in the early 1930's, after the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl.  These \\"Okies\\" were treated with contempt.  They were  kicked off their lands, treated like animals, paid meager wages or in some cases, they were paid with a loaf of bread for 16 hours of work, and it's disgusting.  How would you fare? What would you be willing to do to feed your starving family?<br /><br />It's a terrific book.  I wish I knew how Noah fared.  I wish I knew what happened to that spineless Connie.  Is Tom ok?  Did he take up the cause that Casey so tragically and instantaneously had taken from him?  I imagine so. I imagine Tom forcing these cities who spurned them, who burned them out, who arrested them, to have to accept them; 500,000 strong.  If not directly, then inspiring others to go on and on.  The packing plants who throw away food, while these people sit outside the gates dying.  The orange growers who sprayed kerosene on the overstock of oranges rather than give them away for free.

Steinbeck was a red, and this book is infused with politics; but, unlike Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, The Grapes of Wrath is a fine work of literature. Not perfect, not without flaws, not as good as Zola's similarly-themed Germinal, but still a classic achievement by a truly great American author. Everyone should read it, from socialists to Shriners, and, as with any work of fiction, take it cum grano salis.<br /><br />Steinbeck didn't like capitalism, because, especially during the Depression, there were many things about it not to like. His prediction that the private ownership of the means of production was soon to be over (as of 1939) hasn't been borne out...but the guy is not remembered for being a commie pantywaist, or a spectacularly-wrong prognosticator.<br /><br />He was a writer, an exceptional one, and most people claim this is his best book. (I would argue that Of Mice and Men holds that distinction, but Grapes is almost five times as long...and how can a six-hundred-page book be worse'n a novella?)<br /><br />Whatever you think, about politics, economics, or literature, this book is not a waste of time.	2007-04-05

I love the majority of his work.<br /><br />Also, I'm writing this review before I do research on this book.  I have just finished reading it, so my opinion is fresh and mine only.  It has not been influenced by what others think.  I do plan on reading a great many summaries and opinions from great thinkers to try and find out why people generally think this is such a great book.<br /><br />Let's start with what I liked about this book.  A good narrator (audio CD version). And I like Steinbecks ability to demonstrate the human spirit.  Now what I do not like about this book is that it starts off with bad things happening to folks and it just goes downhill for these folks all the way, getting worse off the whole time, till the end when they are as bad off as they can get.  People dying left & right, thrown in jail, everyone who already lives in California are mean, pregnant woman can't get enough food, kids starve, no more work for three months, river floods, baby dies, etc.  This is the most depressing book I think I've ever read.  And where is the plot?  There isn't one.  This book could have been written in one chapter, but John drags us through this misery over and over again, round and round.  This book is a statement, that's for sure.  Maybe everyone thinks it's so great because it is a great statement.  I do believe that later in John's life he regretted writing this book, or at least wished that he had written it differently.  I have read online that this book is still banned in certain places of this country.  That is wrong.  I don't feel that way.  I don't like the book, but I think anyone that wants to read it should be able to read it (I warn you it's depressing and a waste of time!)	2006-09-29

From the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma to the grim and cruel lives faced by migrant workers in California, the story captures the heartache of the Great Depresssion and the power and redemption of the human spirit.  Steinbeck captures the spirit of the times perfectly through his compelling characters.  This is as good as it gets.<br /><br />I listened to the unabridged audio edition, and it is fabulous.  The narrator is extraordinarily talented and completely captures the spirit of this classic.  His dialogue is perfect.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, it is that the primary hero of the story simply drifts off in a bit of an anticlimax.  But that's probably necessary to the overall plot.  Taken as a whole, the story is the most moving and inspirational work of fiction I've ever read or heard.	2006-05-20

Although I found the plot (the plight of the Joad family and their journey to California to find a better lifestyle) interesting and thought provoking, the novel is too long to keep the interest of the reader. Intercalary chapters (usually odd numbered) add seemingly pointless symbolism and can confuse or bore readers.Another aspect of the novel that I severly disliked was the diction (an older Oklahoma twang) that was hard to understand.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't like many aspects of the novel, but I thought that the plot was interesting.

The actor is very good.  I love books on tape, and this is among my top favorites ever.<br /><br />I loved Grapes of Wrath (read in my sophomore year).  It was a joy, and often hard, to rediscover this beautiful story about the determined and downtrodden Joads.  This actor does a great job in rendering the characters with sensitivity.<br /><br />My favorite part is when they cross into CA and Mrs. Joad makes her stand, saying \\"We're not bustin' up this family!\\"  This scene was just as moving on tape as it was when I first read it long ago.  It brought tears to my eyes all over again.  I highly recommend this audio book!	2004-09-29

Steinbeck, a moderate leftist, portrays a family of &quot;Dust Bowl&quot; migrants as they travel through the Midwest to California, to seek land and new jobs(the banks supported by the government[in many cases being the same thing] pushed millions of people off their land at the time), but when they arrive all they find is people who are so corrupted by money and an endless fear of loss of capital that they do not offer the family any support or aid.<br />  Steinbeck wrote this book as a summation of real events that happened in the 1930's. His book realizes the need for social change in America and the world. It does not make anyone look &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; It simply makes the system humanity follows seem like the one tearing us apart. Just one of the things that makes this novel maybe the best one ever written. If only steinbeck was alive today, maybe he'd write a novel or two to take Bush down.	2004-03-04

But they's somepin worse'n the devil got hold a country, an it ain't gonna let go till it's chopped loose.\\"<br />Grapes Of Wrath is the story of the desperate battle of migrant labourers with the rich, greedy, malevolent and the mean. When the Joads arrive in California from their native Oklahoma, their troubles and tribulations are rewarded not by bounty, but by even more hardship. What ensues is a timeless battle. It is waged by the spirit of the downtrodden on the one side, and by the mercenary mean muscle of the other. The story is primordial and resonates with any reader with a sense for perception.<br />The classic work of fiction describes a world where the rich, with their glitzy cars, ride alone and never mind hitting a man or a noble dog should one come in their way. Then there is the poor and oppressed who, despite their condition, extend a hand time and time again and never forget what is important on the great round dustbowl. The wheel in the sky seems to work against those who toil and possess a heart, but cruelty and oppression are exposed as mere facades that once removed reveal nothing more than a faceless corporate entity bereft of the right to exist.<br />It is in this setting that John Steinbeck writes in amazingly authentic and sanguine dialogue the flight of the strong-at-heart from, and again into, the belly of a system bent on browbeating compassion, kindness and veracity.	2003-08-26

The poetry of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath takes on even greater depth with the Okie dialect of Dylan Baker. This is probably the greatest American novel of the last century. Despite the condescending attitude of academics, this book lets us all in on our own history. Steinbeck doesn't tell us who we are, he shows us who we are by showing us what we have been. As Samuel Clemens dug up our essence in the disease of slavery, Steinbeck confronts us with the violence of our economic system. Also like Clemens, he shows how religion tends to compound injustices. But what makes this a truly great novel is that all this understanding of the world and how it works is communicated by the lives of characters so real and complex that they have become part of our personal history. We experience the depths of our own emotions and capacity to love. The final scene is perhaps the most powerful depiction of human love in all of literature.	2002-03-06

Steinbecks classic is one that will make you feel emotions: sadness, pity, relief, and joy.  The story based on the worker migrations to california is beyond a doubt a classic novel that MUST be read... enough about the book...<br />the audio book is excellently read by david baker who reads with great clarity and pronunciation.  it is unabridged so the listener will get the whole thing as it is.  i had read the book twice already and was well on my way during my third pass through when i ran into the idea of listening to this.  i had high expectations of the book's content, but was wary about the readers interpretations being thrown upon the reader.  baker does a good job of not throwing out too much of his own interpretations/feelings into the words as he speaks them {and when he does they coincide with my interpretations/feelings}.<br />the unabridged audio book is well worth the price. only thing is that audio books cannot compare to actually reading the book for yourself.  even with the audio book, i often went back to the book to reread certain parts, and i recommend that everyone pick up the book too and read it... but the book being around 2 inches thick, and if you do not have time sometimes for reading it, the audio book is a good alternative!	2001-07-18

The story of  the ongoing hope and determination of the displaced migrants, pitted  against the disdainful land-owners, highlights a 20th century conflict  between traditional values of inherent virtue and the interests of  business, economic efficiency, and the profit-seeking wealthy.  The first  few times I read this story, I saw only a tract that promotes centralized  state authority and socialist constructs as a solution to injustice and  poverty, as also appears in Upton Sinclair's &quot;The Jungle&quot;.  In  my later years, however, I have seen Steinbeck's prophecy against the  hypocrisy of those who would call themselves &quot;Christian&quot; and  &quot;righteous&quot;, then ignore the essential tenets of their faith to  serve their own interests, the minute they've left church on Sunday.  The  book continues to speak to our own age, when the well-to-do in the  &quot;winner-take-all&quot; competition of the modern marketplace find it  all too convenient to neglect the poor that remain.  Although history has  since proven the value of a free-market  economy, its &quot;winners&quot;  are just as human as  its &quot;losers&quot;, and cannot in good conscience  brush them aside, discounting them as products of their own failings.	1998-10-16

This is the timeless story of the struggle for survival.  This time concerning the Joad family - a simple crop sharing farm people - uprooted by changes both climatic and economic (it reminds one of the recent downsizing and the loss of blue collar jobs) on their trek westward searching for a new hope. This book works on all levels and raises important issues if you can get a handle on the depression.  As literature it is excellent.  Any author that can devote an entire chapter to the life-and death struggles of a turtle crossing the road and keep you on the edge of your seat deserves fame (what is the symbolism any how?).  This book also raises the important issues of today.  What to do with displaced (homeless) people? Who's responsible if anyone for peoples well-being.  Are their abuses in the work place?  Who's fault is it?  What should be done?  Are simple people to be admired or pitied?.  Fortunately, he doesn't give you all the answers, but makes you think for yourself.  Admittedly, he does go into melodrama.  His brief dealings about the communist ideals with the government camp, and the breast feeding of an ill man showing how people must help themselves are two such examples. Yet, I feel it is a must read even if it leaves you drained and questioning your own ethics.	1998-05-26

No, kids, Mark Twain was not a racist, in spite of the langauge of his characters.  Had these myopic critics opened their eyes a little more, they might have seen that Jim the slave is a superior man to his lighter-skinned contemporaries.  What &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; represents to some is a threat, a not-so- gentle stirring up of uncomplacencies, a brutal kick in the rear to the comfortable.  Working in a grocery store I see this every day in my affluent customers.  Most haven't a clue where or how their  fruits and vegetables make their way to the produce stands.  Some have vague ideas about unwashed and illiterate Mexicans, toiling away in the feilds like beasts of burden.  I live in California, home to Proposition 187, and all of the attendant misconceptions about illegal immigrants.  Why, it was only last year when federal authorities raided a strawberry farm in the Salinas Valley, discovering living conditions that mirrored exactly those portrayed in Steinbeck's novel sixty years before.  In spite of the efforts of Ceasar Chavez, whom I regard as a saint, and uncounted others, working conditions for the farm worker have scarcely improved since &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot;  Remember the grape boycott?  <br />  I'm getting a bit afield, I know.  I recently tried out an American literature course at my local community college, and was unpleasantly surprised.  Instead of a careful reading of good books, I was inundated with the crimes of the Eurocentric Male.  Oh, and the books were included as supporting garnish.  Seems to me that our culture of destructionism and revisionism is taking an awful toll upon our understanding of literature.  Like the traveler confusing the map with the territory, our unimaginative academics are confusing the messenger with the message.   Rather than spending precious time bashing the author, wouldn't it be more prudent to disucss the ideas as presented? Had Steinbeck been a Communist, would his ideas then be considered more suspect?  I invite other readers to share their ideas.  We need more of this.	1998-01-21

Regarded by many as the seminal Amercian novel, The Grapes of Wrath is not merely a snapshot of Dust Bowl poverty, but of the strength of the human spirit.  While the movie focuses on the character of Tom Joad, Steinbeck's book is really about Tom's mother, and how she eventually assumes the leadership of her family.  The pages are literally choked with the red dust of Oklahoma's ruined farms, and of the dust and exhaust fumes on the road to California.  The dialogue is colloquial and accurately portrayed.  His characters are rich in substance, as is the entire story.  Throughout the book, the scene is introduced with poetically-written interludes, giving the reader a clear sense of where he or she is.  For those who feel content with the John Ford film, I recommend the book, if only for the sheer enjoyment one can get from reading this work.	1998-01-09

It is a complete joy to read the melange of roadside towns and attractions that seem to haunt the Joads' journey.  Their jalopy becomes a metaphor of a broken down world that entraps them.  However catastrophic the tragedy becomes,  it is a slow and deliberate kind of grief.  There always seems to be someone to help send the Joads' on their way.  The tale hits home when the Oklahoma family reaches California, the land of hopes and dreams, of liberty, for the Joads' and the rest of the nation.  There awaits them a cauldron of discontent among those sharing a similar fate, in the migrant worker camps.  Of course, like all Steinbeck works, the novel ends on a dark, albeit sardonic note that is brilliant and one that only he could have produced.

There is a good reason Steinbeck is considered a huge literary genius in American literature. The use of dialect to create a visual moment in which the reader's emotional and intellectual soul is immersed is exquisite. Unfortunately, many of the conditions in the book still exist today.	2015-07-09

It seems a bit dated today and the struggles of the Joad family may be a bit over the top, but the character development is brilliant. I also enjoyed the alternating Joad family detail vs the chapters devoted to the bigger story.  After the book was released it is said  Steinbeck was surprised by the communist backlash.  I can't imagine why he'd be surprised, the socialist sentiments resound throughout the book. Regardless it's a fascinating read.	2015-06-28

Picture the struggle, the desperation, the hunger. Find yourself what it would be like making that trek with the Joad's across country, then among the camps.

The unemployed travel towards the mirage they hear about. Up on reaching the oasis after unbearable hardships, not only they find out that the reality is far bleaker than what they expected but also they are outsiders just just not welcome by the citizens as equals. Steinbeck details the exploitations in their most naked form. The plight of the Joads is real for a countless even now. And, it is given far less voice than required.<br /><br />The story is enriched with the dignity of some of the protagonists. The leads keep their morales high, suffer whatever they must without much bitterness and do not dwell over even momentous life and death events after they are through. They retain their faith and display compassion that would melt any hearts. The author's mastery is visible whenever he turns poetic in describing the land and the surroundings.<br /><br />Some of the implied solutions are nothing but idealistic though. It is easy to condemn, and hence implicitly suggest a reduction of, the &#34;machine power&#34; (tractors in this book) when so much of human energy is unemployed in every age. It is equally natural to blame the poverty on governments not doing enough, capital owners cornering means of production, merchants charging prices on which they are seen making excessive profits or even existing workers/new workers behaving in ways detrimental to new workers/existing workers. Should the rich places/nations have open doors for everyone not privileged? Should government own everything and control price of labour as well as goods?<br /><br />In Ayn Rand's Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, the economic fight was less against capitalists versus labourers and more between good people (all capitalists) versus the bad. As a result, she could make a theoretical case for laissez faire that is impractical in real life. Steinbeck's must read grapes is perhaps the other extreme.sult, she could make a theoretical case for laissez faire that is impractical in real life.

The trials and tribulations of these people and, how they suffered in order to feed their families while living in squalor, under inhumane conditions, being deliberately driven into continually worsening situations in an attempt to make them give up their own  homes. It was eye-opening to see the fear of those people already living out west and how they used to humiliate, beat, kill, or run these people off public lands because of their own fears that these arriving immigrants could only extend bad conditions on them  on 'their' own lands. Those in California were starting to believe the propaganda that these Oakie's were bad people looking to do harm, steal food, trespass and take jobs at their next destinations. Truth is they were not greedy, or out to harm anyone else, all they wanted was a fair chance to raise their families in peace and, without the pains of starvation, in lands with ample fruit and, meat that in many cases went to waste due shear meanness by the owner of these products. Their tenacity  was incredible as they continued to move on in an attempt to save the themselves, their familes and, friend's from starvation, illness, and, homelessness by moving them all to these strange lands in the west with the empty promise of unlimited work for all; this belief died as quickly as it came about for those that started their long trek's to these new promised lands as they would discover along the way. This alone would have been enough to stop most families in their tracks but, not the Joad's............they continued to race toward a dream that was truly a nightmare even  after being warned several times that there would not be any work there. These people were tricked and/or forced into giving up their lives by 'them', & 'they', never knowing who 'them' and 'they' really were. Were 'they' the land owners, the banks, the government.....................it seems that the leaders of this farming movement were very successful by keeping them living in ignorance as these scoundrels stole their lives out from under them...............they were helpless until the point of anger.

A carefully researched and written Novel that will emotionally draw you into the ravenous corporate  protective greed and the generosity of the exploited, who get driven from their farms and lives right here in America. Notice how Steinbeck uses alternating intermediate chapters, with rhythmic descriptive writing that makes you feel like you are coming up for air and looking around before continuing with the tails of tragedies and small triumphs of the Joad family.	2015-01-17

However, Steinbeck gets a bit, actually more than a bit, preachy in this book. I am very sympathetic to the plight depicted in this work and to Steinbeck's philosophy. I am  sure that I would have had very similar ideas in 1938. I wish that he would have allowed their story to make his points without explicit expositions of his political views. I don't like preaching even when I agree with the preacher.<br />I do recommend that this book be read. Much of it clarifies an important historical era, and much of it carries a timeless message of human struggle.	2014-11-20

The story has a post-apocalyptic feeling to it, as the characters deal with a foreign world after their entire way of life is obliterated.  It is also a powerful tale of dignity and loss, as well as the struggle to maintain humanity against something nameless and faceless that is impossible to understand.  If you read this in high school, you should read it again -- it is well worth your time.	2014-11-01

One of the greatest novels ever written.  You will learn about and understand, but never pity, the Judd family prying through obstacle after obstacle just to get back to some semblance of the lives they had before the Depression and the Dust Bowl era devastated half a nation.  Steinbeck takes you into their experience, into their hearts and minds.  You perceive and feel them, almost as though you were one of them, driving ever west, with all the belongings you can mount onto a rickety truck, the very last means of getting out of a desperate spiral downward. Much is written about Steinbeck's social philosophy and political leanings, but I think the novel is so much more - and so much less!  Steinbeck uses his masterful writing and his understanding of how the minds and hearts of his characters are shaped by - and themselves shape - the failing and desperate society around them. Each individual reacts differently to dire straits, and each makes their choice to acquiesce, fight, or continue to seek a better, brighter light. This is not just a story about the time and space which it describes. It is about the inner struggle every human encounters at some point in life, about the choices we all can and do make.	2014-10-09

Reading &#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34; only reaffirmed my love for Depression-era literature. There is something about the bleak social, political, and economic landscape that thrills me. And the fact that it was written in 1939 so all the original vocabulary from that era (i.e., jalopy) was included was a delight. The poor Joads never got a break, did they? From their forty acres in Oklahoma under dust and confiscated by the big banks to being hated for being an &#34;Okie&#34; in California while trying to find work, they barely survived to eat and have shelter. Each chapter was more heart breaking than the previous one. Ma was my favorite character. She was so resilient and tried to be positive while take care of her family. A true inspiration in the face of adversity. Recommended for anyone interested in Labor issues to ponder what has (and has not) changed in worker rights throughout the decades.	2014-09-25

I was required to read this book for an university American Lit. course and didn’t think much of it then, but, at the time, everything was postmodernism and ‘realism’ was, generally, frowned upon. Now, decades later, I’ve gotten around to re-reading it and have had an entirely different reaction to it.<br /><br />What caught me this time was the spare Whitman-esque quality to the prose and the glorification of the individual and the everyday which Whitman was noted for, as well. The lyrical quality of the prose drew me into the narrative and the characters.<br /><br />Tom Jode is still a bit of a clich&eacute; character, to me, for his predictable character and the fact there was no surprise what happened to him at the end of the book. The outcome was pretty much telegraphed from the beginning of the book.<br /><br />However, this being literary and realist fiction, the reader is never surprised, or rarely surprized, by what happens to the characters—even the choices that take them there. Here the journey is all about character development [or the struggle a character puts up with their nature], style, and ideas [in this case the reaction of the government, police, and locals to the plight of the ‘Okies’ and other transients].<br /><br />The analysis of what drove the ‘Okies’ onto the road is particularly interesting and more and more valuable as time passes and our understanding of the American Great Depression and the Dust Bowl Era recedes into myth and politically driven academic analysis/history.<br /><br />This was an excellent read for the variety of characters, the cinematic and poetic nature of Steinbeck’s prose, and the historical importance of the period.<br /><br />Contemporary readers may have a hard time with the endless descriptions of everyday activities but as a time capsule of how people lived and how they worked and thought it is invaluable and, really, very beautiful—though often tragic. As well, readers may have trouble with the conclusion of the book, because it does not really end, as the troubles of the world never, really, end.<br /><br />Readers may find the inversion of roles interesting too…as the book progresses.<br /><br />A must read!!!<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars.onclusion of the book, because it does not really end, as the troubles of the world never, really, end.<br /><br />Readers may find the inversion of roles interesting too…as the book progresses.<br /><br />A must read!!!<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars.	2014-08-27

A great novel immerses you in this world; you feel that you have walked the landscapes, commiserated with the characters, and shared their emotions. The world of The Grapes of Wrath is 1930s America, a time of economic depression and desolation. By the time I had finished this book, I felt I had lived in that era.<br />The Grapes of Wrath impresses on you the terrible power of poverty. This is a poverty that came close to crushing the Joad Family, our protagonists, in their journey from Oklahoma to California. John Steinbeck describes every detail of the Joad Family's experience: the intricacies of their car, their daily meals, and their nightly sleeping conditions. The detail is so evocative that you eventually feel the family's hunger, homelessness, and even hopelessness.<br /><br />This novel edged close to despair, but fortunately ended on a note of hope. I'm not entirely sure of Steinbeck's philosophy. The novel is an indictment of capitalism. The novel also favorably portrays citizen-run communities in which egalitarianism and cooperation reign supreme. These communities are in line with the novel's odd pantheism (as expressed by the preacher character) in which holiness is found in all things, and not in a distinct deity. Fortunately, these philosophies are not fully worked out, as they would have transformed the book into a polemical work. What is left is a great novel and an impoverished world that will remain in your imagination.	2014-08-14

The methods have changed and most people probably don't think of themselves like the suffering migrant workers in this novel; but we've more in common with them than we're ever going to be allowed to have with The Man.<br /><br />This book is generally criticized by those that &#34;ain't figur'd her out yet&#34; as socialist propaganda. They've either never read the book or grossly misunderstand humanism. Worse yet, many of those loudest critics boast of their religion, which I also believe they grossly misunderstand.<br /><br />The only &#34;Goddamn Red&#34; is see if this book is that of the bleeding, caring heart of the reader that tries to empathize with these people's plight.<br /><br />But I suppose that just makes me a socialist liberal nutjob.

Where the Joad family went was to California and this afforded another excellent history lesson.

Steinbeck wrote very sympathetically of his characters.  He described in great detail the issues facing a migrant labor force and the price they had to pay to survive as well as the sentiments of those in communities where the migrants set up camp.  The story he has laid out of the family, individuals and small business (farmers) being victims of large companies and banks is one that resonates today.	2014-07-22

His style can be recognized throughout his writings. It is timeless, moving yet has an easy flow.<br />The Grapes of Wrath is a story written in the depression era. This is a moving tale of a poor farming family who is getting kicked off their land.<br />The characters and the story come to life with each word. This could easily be a true story of its time. It is a time in history we need to contain knowledge of. Though fictional, The Grapes of Wrath is a good choice for a history student to read as they turn the pages in their history book to The Great Depression. Many hard-working families suddenly became penniless, homeless and hopeless during this wretched era.<br />The term “sharecroppers” was nearly said with a sneer.Many Americans were duped into traveling out west with promises, hope and dreams of a bountiful land filled with wealth and riches untold. Yet upon their arrival, they like all the other hundreds of starving families find themselves living in camps and begging for work on a day to day schedule.<br />The people were treated a​s if they were a blemish on society because they were poor and hungry.<br />This is a moving story and a must read. It is an excellent example of a very hard time in history which our grandparents and great-grandparents endured.	2014-06-29

You will think in dialect for days after reading it and never forget the characters.  Topics of family, loyalty, loss and grief, hope, social inequality and power run amok are as meaningful today as they were 75 years ago.  It is a sweeping, haunting, deeply emotional novel that captures a tragic American era through the eyes of one family, the Joads. It is worth buying just to read Chapter 15. I think of The Grapes of Wrath whenever one of my top-one-percent friends/relatives tells me s/he has &#34;worked hard for what I have&#34;--usually in a conversation about why they shouldn't pay a penny more in taxes or support affordable health care.

There are so many things going on in this book but for me at its heart it's a story of the average man's struggle once he's no longer needed. Whether he's pushed out by the dust bowl or he's been &#34;tractored off his land&#34; the struggles are the same.  He has to find work no matter what and is increasingly competing in a larger pool of unemployed workers for a smaller pool of jobs.  As a technologist, this is something that weighs constantly on my mind: what will everyone do when most jobs are automated or taken over by artificial intelligence.  What will millions of truck drivers do once the trucks are driving themselves.<br /><br />Read this book now.	2014-05-14

Search, and there is a remedy to be found for almost everything.	My first flashes of memory date to circa 1937.  While we in FL had mud vice dust, the poverty was the same.  Human struggle to survive hardships seems to have diminished as ease of acquiring  necessities becomes less arduous.  The book reminded me of how easy life is today compared to then.  The movie failed to express the misery that was brought out in the book.	2014-05-07

Wonderful characters, and an engaging story that unfolds bit by bit in such a compelling way. John Steinbeck has a way of dropping you into a story so you can feel the emotions of the characters as if you were actually there. I read this book decades ago as a teen or young adult but did not at all understand the political commentary that was woven into the story. Now I read it, and it gives me a different perspective on many important issues that still exist today in some ways.	2014-05-06
US	12334937	R3I2FYCIP6OALM	B001BKTEZA	999720718	The Grapes of Wrath	Digital_Ebook_Purchase	5	9	9	N	Y	As timeless as it is gritty	This book has been called Steinbeck's masterpiece, and it's not hard to see why.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath is so completely, so guturally human that it's practically impossible not to become engrossed in the life stories of the main characters. Some have complained that the characters are flat, that there is little growth. I find this only partially true. There is much to read between the lines. One who reads closely can find much growth in the characters of Ma Joad, Rose of Sharon, Tom, and even Al. Then there is the former preacher, Casy, whose growth occurred before the Joads' story even began -- but Steinbeck offers glimpses of that growth in his stories to the Joads.<br /><br />This careful examination of the Dust Bowl, the Great Depression, and the effects of corporatism and the ensuing expansion of poverty is insightful and heart-rending. Migrant farmers find themselves picking fruit and vegetables to sell for mere pennies a day, meanwhile they are unable to even feed their own families. They watch as corporate farms burn and destroy fruit and vegetables to keep the prices high and prevent the starving from stealing the &#34;extra.&#34; They see acre upon acre of land go unused, but they cannot even plant a few carrots because it is owned by the banks and the migrants are charged with trespassing. The &#34;Okies,&#34; as they are called, are treated worse than animals. Families break apart and the old, sick, or very young die of malnutrition and sickness. Meanwhile, the corporate farms and banks continue to put small farms out of business and scheme to keep prices high and wages low. The stark contrast can be seen in a corporate farm owner, decked out in gold chains, wryly offering work to the desperate Joads in the midst of a strike.<br /><br />I have heard it said that it is only in recent years that people are crying &#34;class warfare.&#34; The Grapes of Wrath is a poignant example of class warfare before the term was even coined. This book is a time capsule of times passed -- and history will repeat itself if we don't learn from the lesson Steinbeck has to teach.capsule of times passed -- and history will repeat itself if we don't learn from the lesson Steinbeck has to teach.	2014-05-05

We all know our history. While I can imagine how this story must have touched many at the time that it was written it is not moving in the same way today -- many similar hardships abound worldwide.  While I enjoyed the story that followed the Joad's I really did not enjoy the intermittent chapters that expounded poetically about the general issue.

When I first started the book I had a real hard time getting into it; I didn't care about the characters at all. It wasn't until the Joads met the Wilsons and people started suffering some real trials that I started to care about the characters. This is a story of struggle, there isn't really a happy story to tell here, but there are some times of relief. The bad times that these people go through seem relentless and even to the last line you see a family that is willing to do whatever it takes to survive and help others who are the same situation.<br /><br />The ending was really weird, but it really wrapped up the book nicely and the spirit of the book lives on. You feel sorry for these people, no one is really willing to help them except people that have little to nothing. The people who have much or mainly concerned about getting and protecting what they think is theirs. People will say if you don't like the wages then you should go find another job, no one is forcing you to work here, but this story shows it isn't as simple as that.	2013-12-10

Steinbeck tells this tale through the language and eyes of a family who farmed in Oklahoma. This family is forced to move from their beloved homestead due to a drought and The Depression.  It it a little difficult to read the broken English and slang expressions of the farmers at first but as the story moves along the reader feels empathy and sympathy for the people who have become migrant workers at the beck and call of others in order to survive.<br /><br />This author captures the heart and soul of this family who will do anything to save each other and keep their family together.  They experience much hardships and tragedies but show a resilience that is astounding to see how they make do with so little and yet show such compassion for others.<br /><br />This tale was written in 1939 but is still timely in its message of the meaning of love of family and survival of the fittest. It also conveys the differences of those who are affluent and those who are needy.  It is a very moving story that will stay with you for a very long time.	2013-11-14

I disagree with some who say it is difficult to read.  Although the plot moves slowly at first, this work is not about the plot.  It actually reads very easily since it is basically a very simple story.  You can read it at a fast pace if you choose to.  There are no subplots, difficult characters to figure out, changes in timeline, etc.  It is just a story about a family traveling west in their truck and their day to day trials.  Of course the story conveys complex human emotions, politics, history, and religion but does so with a simple story.  This is the beauty of the work, to say so much with so little.  There are many worthwhile discussions to have about this story, one is \\"did the Joad family know they were suffering as much as they were\\".  This novel also made me think about our modern lives today.  Will I ever appreciate a cup of coffee as much as Pa Joad did?  Don't get me wrong.... these workers suffered much, that is for sure.  One of my favorite passages is the description of a farm at nighttime with horses vs. tractors, it is beautifully written.  Enjoy this book.	2013-08-14

Yet, don't know that the help is much better off today. High hopes for a family to make it big in West. Promises broken, unfair labor practices and corruption are ever present.<br />I was really disappointed in the ending. It just left you hanging. I guess that&#34;s the idea. Very sad.

The economic struggles of the Joad family mirror what is happening to thousands of families today in response to globalization.  Entire communities facing economic ruin when a major employer suddenly closes down and ships all of the jobs overseas, or cuts jobs and replaces workers with machines, leaving thousands of workers with little or no other options but to pull up stakes, leave everything behind and look for better opportunities elsewhere, only to find the cards stacked against them by the very system that created the problem in the first place.  Families facing unrelenting competition for fewer and fewer job opportunities while employers squeeze more and more concessions from desperate people who are looking for any scrap of work they can find to survive.<br /><br />I found it compelling that the Joad's, whose only motivation was to look for any work to support themselves, were considered undesirables and scorned and exploited by the rich and powerful.  The parallels to what is happening today in our society was striking.  Would the Joad's have been considered 'takers' because they stayed in a government work camp to survive when they couldn't find any work to support themselves?<br /><br />I'm glad to hear that Steven Spielberg recently purchased the rights to this story and plans to re-make the movie.  I hope he does for this story what he did for Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List and shift America's perspective on the plights of the poor and disadvantaged.  I plan to view the 1940 version of this story starting Henry Fonda.<br /><br />I'm so glad that I finally was able to read this very compelling novel. You will really enjoy it if you have never read it before.	2013-07-23

I've tried to stay general as much as possible.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath makes you feel vulnerable and exposed to a monster greater than all of us.  It doesn't take much, a couple seasons of drought (in this case), you miss those payments, and pretty soon the bank has your house.  What can you do?  You struggle to find a place to live or find a place to die.  The dustbowl isn't what makes us vulnerable, it's the system itself; tragedy like this can strike for many reasons, and therefore is, in essence, inevitable.<br /><br />Steinbeck was an incredible talent.  A lot of reviewers have said the book is slow, but I disagree.  The plot moves forward immediately, but I think reviewers are responding to a plot that sneaks up on the reader and Steinbeck's emphasis on voice.  He alternates his voice seemingly effortlessly between the Oklahoman drawl in chapters devoted specifically to the protagonist Joad family and the other chapters that magnify the tragedy to multitudes of families suffering a similar fate.<br /><br />Not only is Steinbeck brilliant with his use of voice, but his understanding of cool transcends time.  Tommy Joad is straight up cool, and he's as cool today as he ever was.  The world loves a man that does what needs to be done: supporting his family, being a strong leader and brother, but also when circumstances force him to action, Tom won't back down, up to and including killing a man (or two), going to prison, and possibly leading a communist revolution.  I'm not advocating these actions, but you can't argue what a great character Tommy makes.<br /><br />There is also a great deal of gender role development throughout.  When things are good, the family is structured one way, but as things go bad, the family structure must react, or adapt.  Characters are pushed to their limits and strength is shown as both a masculine trait, but also as a subtle and often deeper feminine trait.  Some writers seem capable of writing dialogue for only one sex, but Steinbeck proves himself to be a master of both.<br /><br />Another common complaint is that the ending disappoints.  I assume those that didn't complain, probably went out and hung themselves.  Yes, it's a depressing book!  That's the point.  When things get bad, you have to do unbearable things to survive.  The worse things get, the farther the Joad family is willing to go to help their family and others.  The events push the limit of human endurance.  You think this book would be worth reading if the Joad family found steady work and lived happily ever after?  But the ending is also beautiful in a way, exemplifying love and unity of man.  It's unpredictable through omission and inclusion.  It's worth it, so finish the book.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath is powerful, memorable, and remains relevant to modern society; it is truly a classic work of literature.ogue for only one sex, but Steinbeck proves himself to be a master of both.<br /><br />Another common complaint is that the ending disappoints.

This book gave me a new appreciation for the poor, the destitute, and how labor organizations came to exist.  I imagined my gparents going thru similar trials to feed their family. Labor unions are getting a bad rap, but now it is clear to me that greed and little respect for fellow man necessitated their existence.	2013-01-20

It is true that there are more safety nets now for people, though some in our country are trying to get rid of these.  As a result of the social legislation of the 1930's there  is unemployment compensation, aid to dependent children, protection of  an individual's assets in banks that fail.  Why would our  legislators want to  allow these to disappear to save a few bucks when they continue to rent public lands for exploration to huge pick companies @$5.00 an acre, same with mining rights to  mining companies, depriving the US government from receiving justified revenue, no royalty rights???	2013-01-18

The question he posed is how can the economical factors help with the sociological situation. It has got to be more than a 'bottom line' philosophy.

Steinbeck painted a vivid picture of the struggles and hopes of poor men and women. They weren't looking for wellfare, but simply a job so they could feed their families and get ahead.<br /><br />The story focuses on the Joad family as they sell most of their possessions to raise enough money for the long journey from Oklahoma to California. Intermixed with their story are great descriptions of the land, the road they took (Route 66), and the hundreds of thousands of people doing the same thing the Joad's were doing.<br /><br />The book doesn't get into the factors that led so many families to head West, and after reading \\"The Worst Hard Time\\", it doesn't appear to be the Dust Bowl as much as it was the overall depression the country was going through in the 1930's.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the descriptions and brutal honesty of the novel, I knocked off a star because I didn't care for Ex-Reverand Casy's view on morality nor the ending of the book that left me wanting more closure for the Joad family. The ending got me to California with the Joad's, but didn't give me any sense of their fate.	2012-08-21

This was a time of sweeping social and economic changes. This was a time when banks, powerful land owners, mechanized farming, prejudice and bigotry sent people packing.<br /><br />While working as a journalist in San Francisco, John Steinbeck wrote a series of feature articles about these migrant workers. He developed a powerful respect for their initiative and empathized with their plight. Those articles were the stimulus that drove him to write Grapes of Wrath. A short time after its publication, Grapes of Wrath received the 1939 Book of the Year Award from the American Booksellers Association. In 1940 it won a Pulitzer Prize for Literature.<br /><br />Steinbeck used powerful, lyrical prose while establishing many of the scenes his characters lived in and passed through. He had a gift of writing in the vernacular language of the people of Oklahoma, and the surrounding states. Most chapters were anchored in dialog between the Joad family members and those with whom they had contact. Most of the story centers on protagonist Tom Joad, second son and parolee from an Oklahoma state prison. Ma Joad, the matriarch of the family is the bond that keeps the family together.<br /><br />The first half of the book follows the family along Route 66 from eastern Oklahoma across the state into the Texas Panhandle, New Mexico, Arizona and deserts until they are awed by the beauty of Califonia. Along the way, they experience devastating losses, disappointment, and innumerable hardships. The Joad family meets and bonds with fellow travelers, and experiences generosity by a restaurant cook and waitress. After arriving in California, the family learns harsh realities of life as Okie migrants while camping in one of the infamous Hooverville camps or shanty towns.<br /><br />Steinbeck gives the reader glimpses of the causes and social issues as seen through the eyes of his characters, but he doesn't stop there. At times he breaks up the journey and branches into short narratives that read like prose poems. In these narratives he frequently uses repetition to drive home his message. He hammers on banks. He has little patience for land owners who call the migrants squatters even though they acquired the land earlier though questionable means.<br /><br />He shows us sheriffs, vigilantes and private security officers working as pawns of the powerful. These are the implements of injustice and the source of escalating tensions. They will stop at nothing to quash dissent. Migrants are exploited through the devaluation of their work by these land owners.<br /><br />Grapes of Wrath lives up to its accolades. Be prepared for an emotional ride. Use it as an opportunity to assess your prejudices and preconceived ideas about this trying time in our history.

Steinbeck is commenting on industrialization, big business killing small business, environmentalism, family, the extended family of the human race...all in an allegory of Exodus and Jesus Christ's life. I can't think of a more timely message for the modern world. The symbolism was a bit obvious at times, but there were also more subtle areas in which he left you with just a hint of import until you were able to analyze it more fully.  The ending gives new meaning to the Milk of Human Kindness. I absolutely recommend this, but at least a basic background in the history of the Dust Bowl and Depression are recommended.	2012-05-30

It gives voice to a people suffering badly and it portrays them as they surely would like to be seen - as honorable decent people trying to make their way against the forces of nature, man and economics. John Steinbeck masterfully interweaves the struggling of one family into the great calamity of the dust bowl that brought out the worst in some people and best in others as millions deal with poverty and dislocation.<br /><br />You could argue that he idealized the virtuous indigent and vilified the wealthy as cruel and callous but much of what he wrote came of direct observation and much of what occurred in fiction happened in fact. When the pie from which we all feed from shrinks the fight for what remains is dirty and there's a tendency for the empowered to leave the rest behind regardless of legitimacy.<br /><br />The Joad family have lost their farm in Oklahoma and they are joining the great migration to California and the promise of jobs and opportunity. They are a healthy close-knit family that care and look out for each other. The strain of homelessness and uncertainty pays a heavy price which is at the root of the book's story. It would be a hard man not to feel empathy for them and the millions like them. Steinbeck wrote the book in 1938-39. He is staring right into the abyss of the Depression. You can feel the immediacy still. His writing is beautiful as his characters take life and the scenes are clear.<br /><br />When you read one of the most famous books in American literature do you try to ignore the hype and just read the book? There is so much going on here.  Is he arguing for bigger government? Is he anti-capitalist or perhaps supporting communism? My conclusion is he saying \\"look - people are suffering. We Americans have a collective responsibility to each other.\\"  I did not see this as philosophy or a soapbox polemic against anything other than the breakdown in respect for human potential. It is a book that is supposed to raise your empathy and recognize the wasted potential of so many.<br /><br />That the book is still popular and evoking passions 70 years later is a good thing.  I wonder if our legislators in Arizona or Alabama recognize their own actions as creating another generation of homeless, dispossessed immigrants who are fleeing their homes, jobs and schools. What are the costs for these broken families that will no doubt slip into poverty similar to the Joads? I hope there's a Grapes of Wrath being written now to give voice to themthing other than the breakdown in respect for human potential.
