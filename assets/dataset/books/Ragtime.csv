Certainly it was far superior in content and depth to the later productions of the movie and the musical.<br />Doctorow skillfully blends the lives of fictional and historical characters who's lives interweave with one another in varying ways. Underneath the web of relationships and the variety of intentions of each character is, this sense of how interconnected and interwoven everyone's life is with one another. In some cases seemingly trivial gestures have what are significant effects on another character's life, as with Houdini and his encounter with a child. At other times the actions are overt and wide ranging from the machinations of Henry Ford and J.P. Morgan to the efforts of Coalhouse Walker Jr. to seek justice. In most cases all the characters while consumed with their own desires and efforts to find their way in life are asleep to the many and profound ways each of us impact others. The interactions in the story are not only fascinating, but for me was food for thought about my own intentions in life and how aware I am of my own impact on others and how aware I am or not about what it is other people are feeling and going through each day.<br />Doctorow's style is such that he can say so much in a short turn of phrase that tells a great deal about the setting or the character(s), His writing is skillfully fluid and I enjoyed the way he moved in and out of the various lives of the many characters in the book. It was never hard to follow at all, but kept you on your toes. It was a book I couldn't put down, all the while not wishing it to end.<br />The book fleshes out so much more than the movie was ever able to. For those who saw the film and haven't read the book, you'll realize that it's almost a totally different story with far more plots, characters and situations than the film revealed and even differing intentions and goals from some of the main characters.<br />This will be one of the few books I know I will read again.

The Model T shared the road with horse-drawn fire wagons, assembly-lined factories employed masses of fungible workers who enjoyed few rights, and just 50 years after the Civil War African Americans were ascending into the ranks of the educated middle class and, on the way up, were confronted with vicious racism. Add to this mix the advent of mass entertainment, Freudian sexual awareness, and socialism and you have a time of disorienting social change.<br /><br />The narrative is centered around a WASPy family's experience with Coalhouse Walker, Jr., an African American ragtime piano player. Without introducing spoilers, Coalhouse Walker is wronged and - in defending his honor - forces the WASPy family headlong into the rushing currents of the time.<br /><br />What kept me from giving this 5 stars? Maybe it was the pacing and plot development. Multiple story lines are launched and slowly converge as the book reaches the end. At times, this approach felt tedious. But right when a yawn was coming on, Doctorow would slay me with a line like this:<br /><br />\\""His grief for Sarah and the life they might have had was hardened into a ceremony of vengeance in the manner of the ancient warrior.\\""<br /><br />This is the fourth Doctorow book I've read.

With interwoven historical and fictional characters these books substantively have much in common with 'Ragtime', but from a stylistic perspective they differ markedly.  Whereas Vidal's characters, both real and imagined, are elaborately (and often hilariously) brought to life, Doctorow tells us little.  His historical characters are often mere outlines filled in with the most elementary of biographical detail.  An example of this is Booker T. Washington, whose appearance seems as unfulfilling and unnecessary as a celebrity TV cameo - certainly we learn nothing about the man that we did not know before.  Harry Houdini, who is presented as a tragic character, is one of the few exceptions, and here Doctorow succeeds in presenting more than the facts found in a one-volume encyclopedia.    Another major point of divergence is in the writing style.  It has been said that the short simple sentences of 'Ragtime' echo the rhythms of the music itself.  Maybe my rhythm is off, but I found them to be a distraction that impeded the flow of the writing.  Fortunately the style improves as the novel moves on - whether this is meant to signify a change in the music of the time, I don't know, but it came as a relief.    There are some great chapters in this book.  Indeed, for the first half of the book they almost seem like separate vignettes bound together by a time and place.  Given the contrived way they are eventually bound together, I almost wish they had been left alone, ala 'Winesburg, Ohio'.

Doctorow. In fact, reading the book is like entering the magic of dreams -- a mystical and surreal land where life is beautiful and cruel and heaped with absurd correspondences that carry eerie significance. <br /> <br />In Doctorow's early 1900s, the lives of everyday fictional people such as a wealthy white family, a poor Jewish immigrant family, and a black family broken before it can form, flow freely into the experiences of historical figures such as the radical anarchist  Emma Goldman, Gibson Girl Evelyn Nesbit, magician Harry Houdini, financier J.P Morgan, automobile manufacturer Henry Ford, architect Stanford White, psychoanalysts Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung and General Tom Thumb, to name just a few. These imagined interactions have lasting effects on everyone involved. Goldman brings the numb and much-abused body of the Gibson Girl Nesbit to life with matronly care by rubbing the girl's confined muscles with liniment.

Doctorow's novel Ragtime vividly explores the lifestyle, culture, and relationship of family, business, and life at the turn of the twentieth century.

For example, Ragtime incorporates an emphasis on the changing role of women which is illustrated in change of the white middle-class wife throughout the novel.  The wife undergoes a series of changes triggered by her husband's departure for a trip and her reading of female literature that emphasizes women's sexual tendencies and the role they play.  Doctorow deliberately critiqued and placed the families in stereotypical roles so that the reader could understand and follow the transitions which the family went through over the course of the novel.

Doctorow's relatively early novel, \\""Ragtime\\"" (1974) remains his best-known work.  The book is a delight to read, moves with the feel of ragtime piano, and has a light happy surface. Yet the book combines many disparate threads and stories, a wealth of historical and fictional characters thrown together, and offers an unsettling vision of the United States at the turn of the century, c.1906. There is a complex, multi-layered vision at work here.<br /><br />The story is told in the first person in the words of Young Boy, whose parents are Father, a successful manufacturer of fireworks and flags in New Rochelle, New York, and Mother, an increasingly frustrated houswife.  Mother has a brother, referred to as \\""Mother's younger brother\\"" who is infatuated with a notorious, (and historical) beauty and femme fatale of the day, Evelyn Nesbit, and who becomes an expert in the use of explosives in Father's fireworks business.<br /><br />The story of this family slowly intertwines with that of a different American family -- Tateh, a Jewish immigrant from East Europe who at the beginning of the book is struggling as a silouette artist on Hester Street New York City, has young daughter, and Mameh, who through poverty and desparation has abandoned the family for a life of prostitution.<br /><br />There is a third fictitious American intertwined in the story.  Sarah is a young (18 years old) black woman who has a young child that come to live with Mother while Father is away exploring the North Pole with Peary.  Mid-way in the novel, we meet the baby's father and Sarah's suitor, an older black man and a pianist named Coalhouse Walker.  Coalhouse has studied ragtime with Scott Joplin.  The book is redolent with Joplin's music including \\""Maple Leaf Rag\\"" and \\""Wall Street Rag.\\""  Coalhouse, in his dignity and his violent rage, quickly becomes the chief protagonist of the book.  Doctorow has resurrected the character of Coalhouse Walker; and as a much younger man he plays a prominent role in his most recent novel, \\""The March\\"" (2005), a fictional retelling of Sherman's march through Georgia and the Carolinas in the Civil War.<br /><br />But these characters and their interlocking stories are only a part of \\""Ragtime\\"".  Doctorow threads their stories in stunningly with stories of historical figures from early 20th Century America.  The characters we meet include the escape artist, Harry Houdini, the anarchist Emma Goldman, J.P. Morgan, Henry Ford, Booker T. Washington, Sigmund Freud, Theodore Roosevelt, Scott Joplin, Evelyn Nesbit, her cuckolded husband, Harry Thaw, and her lover, the architect Stanford White, and several others.  Some of these people have prominent roles in the stories while others have cameo parts.  But their personalities in virtually every case shine through Doctorow's prose.<br /><br />For all the elan, rambunctiousness, and lyricism of the story, \\""Ragtime\\"" presents a picture of a United States plagued by racism, poverty, and violence.  The story pivots on Coalhouse Walker's attempts to assert his dignity and manhood in the face of a racial slur in New Rochelle.  These efforts lead inexorably to violence and to destruction.  The excitement, flow and complexity of the stories carry the reader along but the dark undertow is never absent.<br /><br />I think Doctorow is at his best in his portrayals of New York City in all its aspects.  I was particularly impressed with his portraits of his life in the tenements with Tateh and his daughters, his scenes of the powerful in New York, (J.P Morgan and his meeting with Henry Ford), and the ubiquitous and lovingly-portrayed Emma Goldman.  Doctorow's feel for New York City comes through in this book and in many of his later novels, including \\""Billy Bathgate\\"" and \\""City of God\\"".<br /><br />In its musicality, lightness, and depth, \\""Ragtime\\"" is the work of a great American storyteller.

Doctorow painfully dramatizes (as well as personalizes) the social abuses of the latter 19th Century but still manages to re-affirm the possibilities inherent in the American dream. The focus is on a single, not-so-typical American family, although such luminaries of the era as Harry Houdini, Henry Ford, and Pierpont Morgan also appear as minor characters. Father goes on an expedition to the North Pole and comes back with more than he bargained for. Mother's brother becomes embroiled in a torrid love affair with a notorious beauty who has played a significant role in a famous murder case.

The narrator is never mentioned my name, but I suppose he is the one referred to as the \\""boy\\"".  We never learn the names of the family in this novel; they are simply referred to as Mother, Father, Younger Brother, and Grandfather. <br /> <br />The wandering story follows the life of this family and the lives of a few other famous people: including Harry Houdini, Pierpoint Morgan, Sigmund Freud, and Henry Ford.  There are also many others.  The story does a good job of intertwining the lives of these famous people with the main family in the story.   <br /> <br />Ragtime is written more like a journal than a novel.  It has no clear cut plot, but rather drops us off at one event and then we are transported to the next.  Some interesting passages include:  The discovery of the black baby by Mother, the final showdown with Coalhouse, a famous whore has an affair with Younger Brother, and Father's voyage to the arctic. <br /> <br />The story seems more intent on sharing scenes than telling a story.  There is dialogue, but no quotation marks around it.  The style is very original.  I have not read anything like it.  At first it takes some getting used to, but if you stick with it, the events will unravel in your mind and you will be able to follow what happens. <br /> <br />I am recommending Ragtime because I feel you have to read it to believe it.  I certainly would understand if one thought it was a masterpiece and the other hated it.  With that in mind, it certainly deserves to be taken a look at, and you can't argue with its imagination and inventiveness.   <br /> <br />I have two main quarrels with the book that prevent me from thinking this work of fiction deserves to be called a masterpiece.  The main one is that the book tries to do too many things.  I understand the feeling Doctorow wants to give us about the turn of the century, but he tries to juggle too many issues at once here.  He never really gives the proper focus on any one issue for very long before throwing another one in our face.  For that reason, the book seems a bit heavy handed at times (which is my second quarrel). <br /> <br />Despite those issues I found myself enjoying a great deal of Ragtime and marveled at its writing style and unusual characters.  I also enjoyed how strong Doctorow ended his chapters.  His most thoughtful and sublime sentences in the book are those he chooses to end the chapters with.  That alone made me want to keep reading.  There really is a lot to appreciate and admire here if you can get past the flaws and past the unconventional way of telling a story. <br /> <br />Grade: B",2004-12-30

Doctorow's best known work, a celebrated novel that combines the syncopation of ragtime and the literary sensibilities of a writer intrigued by history as literary device.  Set primarily in Westchester County's New Rochelle but also in New York City and, briefly, Massachusetts, the novel follows the stories of real and fictional characters as they move from innocence to disillusionment, from peace time to the beginnings of racial conflict and World War I.<br /><br />Because the novel contains so many stories, some as short as a few pages (in the case of Freud) and some woven throughout the entire novel, describing the plot of the book is a challenge.  The author primarily follows the lives of a New Rochelle family (Father, Mother, Younger Brother, and the Little Boy) as they navigate changing times.  Father accompanies Peary on his exploration to the North Pole. Mother takes in a young black woman, Sarah, and her newborn, an impulsive act which leads to the introduction of ragtime pianist Coalhouse Walker and his simple demands which escalate into violence.  Younger Brother becomes infatuated with the celebrated beauty Evelyn Nesbit, which in turn leads to his association with anarchist Emma Goldman.  Harry Houdini's car breaks down in front of their house, and the novel enters his story as well. The family acts as a touchstone for the disparate stories of a generation.  Meanwhile, the story of a counterpart family - Mameh, Tateh, and the Little Girl - unfolds in the ghetto, where the Jewish immigrant family struggles for survival.  Unbeknownst to both families, their stories are linked by those of the others.<br /><br />In syncopated prose that dissipates partway through the novel as the short age of ragtime gives way to jazz, Doctorow manages to infuse irony in short, seemingly unrelated sentences: \\""Everyone wore white in the summer.  Tennis racquets were hefty and the racquet faces elliptical.  There was a lot of sexual fainting.  There were no Negroes.\\""  Since the novel is about the loss of the naivet&eacute; that gives birth to such generalizations, this kind of set-up allows for the numerous tales that shoot off in different directions.<br /><br />The complicated novel is not demanding to read, although the huge cast of characters and the emphasis on history makes emotional identification with the characters difficult.  If readers look at this novel as an Impressionistic look at life at the beginning of the 20th century, they will find more satisfaction than if they regard it as the story of Little Boy's family.  The coherence of this novel comes from the brackets of an era and not from a tidy relation among the plots.

Of particular interest is the parallel with the violence and terrorism perpetrated by the anarchists and wobblies (International Workers of the World) back then, whose anger at the existing capitalist system suffuse and drive this tale, and events in our own time, as we face, once more, an upswelling of terrorism directed against our nation and society.<br /><br /> In the first years of the twentieth century, a well-off family in New Rochelle, New York, which takes its income from the manufacture of fireworks and flags, thriving on the patriotism of the nation, is suddenly thrust into a series of events which will bring its members face to face with some of the less savory characterstics and characters of American society. Famous personages from that era (Houdini, Stanford White, Elizabeth Nesbit, Emma Goldman, J. P. Morgan, Henry Ford) intermingle with the fictional characters and come together in a remarkable confluence as a proud, self-made black musician named Coalhouse Walker comes courting, only to find himself a victim of mindless racism one evening on his way back to New York City. Too proud to walk away or accept less than full restitution for his loss, he at last precipitates a series of events that bring the historical and fictional players together in a shocking moment of violence and careless killing. The characters move on despite the carnage, as America flows forward into the turmoil that will become the twentieth century, but Walker makes his point.<br /><br /> Despite its intriguing sense of period, the tale has some weaknesses. None of the characterizations are particularly strong or moving and the story reads as though Doctorow, having immersed himself in the documents of the period, as part of his research, just decided to write out a description of the real events as he found them, interspersing these with his imagined characters and their doings. Dialogue is buried in the narrative, an interesting technique that does work in this case though it causes the book to read more like an historical narrative than a genuinely dramatized tale of the people at its center. This unfortunately tends to make the characters seem a bit distant and vague. Nevertheless, the tale works and leaves you with a sense of having been there as we laughingly discover how the socialist artist from Eastern Europe, Tateh, finally leaves all his ideals behind to make his fortune in the unique American fantasyland of a newly burgeoning Hollywood. The implied narrative voice of a young boy who views all this from his unique vantage point as a son of a strangely conjoined family is subtly played and almost lost in the final denouement. You have to attend closely to catch it.<br /><br /> Alas, we don't feel much for any of the players except a profound sense of ironic separation as America barrels its way more deeply into the new century, World War I looming darkly on the horizon. And that terrorism which manifested itself at our last entry into a &quot;new century,&quot; and which has been so nicely caught in this novel, seems to have eerily returned once more as we move again into the next hundred year span, prompting me to wonder if Doctorow sensed or imagined any of this back in 1975 when this one was published.<br /><br /> SWMhese with his imagined characters and their doings.

The musical interested me so much, that I decided to read the book as well. I highly recommend both. This book is wonderful! It is very historical, and one must applaud Doctorow for being so accurate. Take Henry Ford. Not only does he talk about the relationship of him and J.P. Morgan, but also says something about his anti-semitism (Which is a proven fact). He gives a real person, Evelyn Nesbit, heart when she helps Tateh and The Little Girl. Emma Goldman is an influence in Younger Brother's life. All of the historical characters tie in with the fiction characters perfectly. Father's relationship with Admiral Peary is another example. All of the subplots tie in perfectly as well. Coalhouse and The Famliy, Tateh and Mother, the Younger Brother &quot;saga&quot; are all subplots that are like this. The only &quot;problem&quot; with this book is the Tateh subplot. Doctorow uses him as a metaphor for the immigrant population so it gets a bit confusing somewhat. You don't know if that is all of the immigrants or just him. Also, Tateh is never really part of the story. His character is more of an onlooker, watching other people in his life.

The first thing I can say about Ragtime, which is a fictionalized story about things that essentially happened in one way or another, is that Doctrow manages to get beyond his clearly socialistic sympathies (evident foremost in the narrative voice) and tell a wonderful and moving story.<br />Ragtime crisscrosses around east coast America to tell three different interlocking stories about three distinctly American families: Old World white and rich, ambitious immigrant Jews and up-and-coming sophisticated black circa 1902.  These three families represent three distinct social classes and, being archetypes to the Nth degree can therefore be used to represent a much larger group of Americans.  The story itself, as others readers have stated, is very simply told.  Ragtime is quite easy to read and very quickly paced.  The urgency of the technological and political advances, the rapid social changes and the human inability to reconcile itself with this too swiftly moving world makes up for the bulk of the narrative, consisting mostly of characters struggling to catch up with the latest play of events.  Most of these characters are well-meaning idealistics, constantly disappointed or undermined by the larger, antagonistic world and seeing their great hopes destroyed by the impatience of the world around them.

Oh yes, by the barest bones definition, RAGTIME is indeed historical fiction, and the reader cannot escape the fact that history does matter, it does make a difference.  There are central characters in RAGTIME, but they exist mainly to provide a forward thrust to the narrative, the vehicle Doctorow has chosen to drive home his point.  They embody roles, are examples of certain patterns of behavior and as such are not even named.  They are not meant to be seen as individual people doing things, but more as demographics, as representatives of groups of people.  The main characters are puppeteered with a great deal of irony as Doctorow indoctrinates his readers with his views on capitalism and the correct execution of the American Dream.  In choosing the first decade of the last century, Doctorow gave himself a rich cast of real characters to play with, all living within the crux of \\""now\\"" and \\""then\\"" and dealing with that fact as best they could.  History matters here, because Doctorow has built his story on it, and so entwined his narrative with it that it is impossible to ignore.  RAGTIME could not be lifted out of its decade.  It belongs there.  <br />With these lofty ideals to contend with, the plot of RAGTIME then becomes rather fantastical, both in its twisting of accepted history with rampant, speculatory commentary presented as fact and also in the neatness with which everything ends.  The branding of famous magician Houdini as \\""one of the last great mother lovers\\"", is particularly puzzling.  Indeed, the Houdini of RAGTIME is one blonde away from opening a motel and calling himself Norman Baits.  That Doctorow chose not to mention that the man had married in 1894-and that he and his wife had been so in love that after his death, she held annual séances for the rest of her life, trying to contact him-is irresponsible at best, manipulative at worst.  Such blatant mishandling of history for narrative purposes weakens the integrity of the novel and lessons the impact of Doctorow's lessons for his contemporary audience.  The neat conclusion is also somewhat bothersome, but as its scenes are painted by Doctorow's wide, ironic brush, it is fairly certain that even the sing song quality of the last few pages is intentional, as he glibly describes the deaths of a few main characters and the assassinations that will plunge the world into the Great War.   <br />Borges wrote of fiction's ability to be a truer mirror of society than fact, but Doctorow blithely carries this idea too far, nonsensically twisting history for the express purpose of creating disgustingly easy to use tropes.  This device smacks of laziness or worse, and cheapens whatever lasting value the novel could otherwise have had.  How awful.",2002-09-12

While this is a worthwhile comparison, I feel that Altman ultimately pulls it off better, as the whole intertwining-strands-of-narrative thing is much easier to follow in film, and, frankly, it's a bit clumsy in Doctorow's hands.  Characters disappear for a hundred pages here and there, and none of the characters are all that well defined, whereas in, say, MASH, even the minor characters are unique.<br />This being said, the book reads rather quickly, and is worth taking a couple of days to burn through.

I did find some redemption, but it sure took a long time to get there.<br />\\""Ragtime,\\"" written in 1975, is an attempt at historical fiction. Doctorow writes a tale of racial injustice set in the early part of the 19th century. Real historical figures appear at a rapid pace: Henry Ford, Harry Thaw, Stanford White, Harry Houdini, and scads of others. Against this backdrop, Doctorow sets up the story of Coalhouse Walker, a black piano player who rebels against the treatment he receives from a local fire station. After his car is vandalized and his wife-to-be is killed, Walker goes on a rampage of violence and mayhem.<br />I know what Doctorow is trying to do, but I just don't like it. The racial angle doesn't come into play until far into the book, and the prose is sheer agony. His sentences are extremely short, which in itself is a different way, and not necessarily a wrong way, of writing a novel. I think he is trying to make his prose mirror ragtime music, or images of the time. For me, every sentence was like ramming a truck into a brick wall.<br />Something should also be said about the various story threads in the novel. Sensational accounts of the day (the Thaw-Stanford murder) vie with fictional characters. While Doctorow does manage to weave them together at the end of the book, he takes far too long to do so. All of the vignettes seem to have much to do with the idea of escaping some type of role or problem. Houdini's escape tricks, Younger Brother's search for something to believe in, Morgan's quest for immortality; they all involve a sort of transcendence.

Ragtime captures the chaos and sense of change of the period: rags-to-riches, riches-to-rags, shifting classes, colliding cultures, anarchists, communists, and capitalists old (J.P.Morgan) vs. new (Henry Ford).  An outstanding novel.<br />Some have commented that the coincidences and interconnections in Ragtime are tortured and convoluted.  Not so!  The fact that Doctorow manages to elegantly weave these storylines is the true genius of the novel.  Many of the coincidences occur subtly without barging into the plot; for example when the family meets Tateh and his daughter on the beach, they never become aware that they're connected via the fact that he and younger brother had a link with the Nesbit.  There never occurs a final \\""ah-ha!\\"" in which the threads all tie together, as in life some circles come to closure while some loose ends remain.<br />Consider that three steps separate Booker T. Washington and Matthew Perry, two real-life characters who probably never met: Washington =&gt; Walker =&gt; Father =&gt; Perry.  Likewise, four steps separate the fictional racist Firechief from the Archduke Ferdinand: Firechief =&gt; Walker =&gt; Family =&gt; Houdini =&gt; Ferdinand.  Some steps are coincidental brushes (Houdini stops by the family's house) and some are deeper, but Doctorow's theme is that we're all more connected than we think.  The reader is aware of links that never are revealed to the characters.  <br />This is not a historical novel, but a period piece, and one of the major themes of the period was that the world was becoming smaller.  Newspapers, Ford's motorcars, flying machines, newspapers, exploding immigration, these are all phenomenon of America in the early 1900's which would bring a hick firechief leaps closer to a European aristocrat.  <br />Scott Joplin hovers over the novel throughout, both through Doctorow's writing style and through Walker's references, but interestingly only enters as a character (briefly and indirectly) when friends of the terminally ill composer threaten to sue when newspapers tie him to Walker.  <br />Briskly paced, entertaining, with interesting characters.  Note that in movies like as Robert Altman's Short Cuts or Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia you'll see a reflection of Doctorow's mosaic style.  An excellent novel, highly recommended.",2001-02-16

This was a time of crucial social and political restructuring of American society, when a large influx of European immigrants coincided with the Industrial Revolution's increasing need for mechanized, low-skill labor, leading to exploitation of workers and the consequent formation of labor unions.  <br />At the center of the novel is a nameless family in New Rochelle, New York, representing a rising middle class.  The father runs a patriotic flag and fireworks company, and for sport accompanies Robert Peary's expedition to the North Pole.  The mother's younger brother is a clever but impetuous young man who represents a growing social consciousness in the bourgeois fabric.  The family takes in a poor young black woman and her baby.  The woman has attracted a suitor, a black pianist named Coalhouse Walker who plays Scott Joplin rags for the family when he comes to visit.  One day, when some racist firemen extort Walker for money and vandalize his car, his pique incites a chain reaction of violence and terror in his quest for justice.  <br />This story is intertwined with that of a family of destitute Jewish immigrants  who have arrived in New York from Latvia.  The father, who makes fancy silhouettes for a living, draws a series of flippable sketches to entertain his daughter, inventing the art of animation and eventually becoming a mogul in the burgeoning film industry. <br />Meanwhile, the stories of several famous personages play like a tabloid in the background:  Houdini performs daring feats of escape; prominent New York architect Stanford White is shot by eccentric millionaire Harry Thaw for fooling around with his wife; the fantastically wealthy financier J.P. Morgan lives like a king and indulges his fascination with Egyptology; Henry Ford utilizes the concept of interchangeability of parts, jobs, and workers to mass-produce cheap cars.  There are also briefcameos by Freud, Theodore Dreiser, and Booker T. Washington.     <br />Doctorow writes as though he were creating a series of journal entries for a magazine, detailing everything that happens to the characters without getting too close or attached to them.  Interestingly, there is only narration in the novel; all the dialogue is quotationless.  On first glance the book may look ponderous because of this, but actually the short, declarative sentences and light tone keep the pace lively.

The reader  catches a personal look at escape artist Houdini, investor and millionaire  J.P.

I don't claim to be a literary critic of any sort but Dotorow's writing is consistantly poor and bland. And that's not the only problem:  he's writing about historical figures mixed in with his own little cast of  characters: very unbelievable and laborious to read. I knew the book was  going to be incredibly poor when he said 'Catlike Chinamen gazed at them  out of dark shops' in an early scene describing Sigmund Freud seeing New  York (in this case Chinatown, NY) for the first time. It's stupid,  unnecessary description like this that makes reading this book so goddamn  painful. I mean, if you're going to be Thoreau and analyze things such as  the insignificant Chinamen staring at Freud (which is sophmoric and stupid  in its own right.. somehow working in that there were Chinese people in New  York, while their staring at Freud is rather inexplicable as he wasn't  really a &quot;famous face&quot; at the time which makes one question if  Doctorow is commenting on the lack of contact with white people that early  Asian Americans had---- who the hell knows?), do so. But Doctorow is no  Thoreau; his sentences are short, undescriptive and to put it simply, lame.  <br />IN CONCLUSION: I think more people are in love with the IDEA of a book  like Ragtime (American history told through a cast of characters  intermingling with historical figures)...rather than in love with this  &quot;rag&quot; of a book (pun intended, but clearly failing!)",2000-07-06

The vignettes Doctorow draws for us have  a great deal in common, I believe, with Dos Passos' snapshots. In answer to  Banger's question about why this time period, I would suggest that this is  an era that is generally regarded in the American historical consciousness  as being primarily bucolic and carefree. The nation, relatively innocent,  having shaken off the aftereffects of the civil war, has recently won the  spurious Spanish-American war, and is generally revelling in a sense of  purpose and civility. What Doctorow is suggesting is that this serene  surface was already infected, with a host of social ills festering beneath  it. A shift was occuring that would lead to labor riots, race riots, change  in mores (sexual attitudes), loss of faith in institutions, etc. that would  define the 20th century. If this were all of Doctorow's plan however, it  would have been interesting Sociology, but a pretty boring novel. Doctorow  is above all an interesting storyteller. He knows how to keep a plot moving  and how to invest it with enough intellectual hardware to make the reader  feel that his/her time has been worth the effort. He can bring a scene to  life with a few fresh (never shopworn) details. He doesn't spend a great  deal of time elabortaing over these details, as James or Wolfe do, but he  makes the reader just as cognizant of them. A few brushstrokes and we are  there. His writing is cinematic, in that we can &quot;see&quot; the scene  he is depicting, without burdening us with excess verbiage. This is the  hallmark of a really good author.

So does Doctorow portray the period of Ragtime in American History, after the turn of the Century and before  WWI as a time where  a man such as Father could believe his life to be  under his control while all around him events spin out of control.   Doctorow's novel deftly weaves fiction and fact in an ironic deftly  stacatto tone which is itself reminiscent of ragtime music.  His stylistic  convention of failing to give names to the main fictional characters,  simply referring to them as Mother, Father, Little Boy, Younger Brother  etc. is simply another effective way of showing the way in which the larger  social and political events of this century overwhelm these people.  What  makes the novel particularly great is its lack of a political judgment.   Doctorow is clearly making a biting comment on the injustices of the day,  but unlike the protest novel's of that era such as &quot;The Jungle&quot;   Ragtime is evenly balanced and really has nothing better to say for  socialism, anarchism or anything else.

All of these events are  written so well that you can't help but feel the way Doctorow describes the  character's feelings before he actually describes them.  This is one of the  few historical fiction books I've read that I've enjoyed as well as raved  about.",1999-08-17

The book deals with sadomasichism, sexual immorality, vengeance, and love all woven together into a grand  tapestry of a great book.  I especially liked the way that Doctorow placed  real life people into the lives of the simple people, a Jewish peddler, a  WASP family, and a vengeance enraged pianist from Harlem.  In conclusion, I  believe that this is one of the best books I have ever read.",1999-06-27
US,52217200,RL77UGU6Q9G6J,0452279070,956761338,Ragtime,Books,3,1,5,N,N,"Novel of historic dimensions","Ragtime is a very eventful and dramatic book. It vividly describes a period in U.S. history when that country went though all kinds of turmoil. A very dramatic subplot is the ragtime musician who rises against white  society when he feels unjustly treated. He turns to terror to get justice  done. The black moral leader Booker T. Washington intervenes. In the end,  justice is done, but the musician Coalhouse does not survive this. What  struck me when I read it was that part of the storyline is so much similar  to a story from the romantic eighteenth/early nineteenth German author  Heinrich von Kleist (some of whose books are also available in English). In  the story (almost novel) of Michael Kohlhaas, horse trader Michael Kohlhaas  is held up by a local German ruler (a local baron) when he enters his  domain. The latter requires his horses and uses them for a while. Kohlhaas  wants his horses back and feels treated unjustly. He organises a band of  supporters, and together they turn against the petty German barons and  kings. They burn down their castles. The uprising sets Germany ablaze.  Society then turns to their moral leader, Marten Luther (we are speaking  here of the fifteenth / sixteenth century). Marten Luther manages to get  Michael Kohlhaas to surrender. He will get his horses back, but he will  also be excecuted. Justice has prevailed.  If you are familiar with  Ragtime, you will recognize this story into all kinds of details (Booker T.  Washington = Marten Luther; cars = horses, etc., the plots themselves). I  don't think that this diminishes the power of Doctorow's story. I rather  like the idea of great classic stories being redeveloped for new eras and  different nations. Think of Odysseus and how this story has been retold  (although Ulysses by James Joyce is a very unlikely modern development, if  at all related).  There is a warning here. Justice is not the only value  that should prevail. Male pride and the quest for justice may be a bad  combination. And where it took Germany centuries to become united and  depose the petty rulers, so the U.S. too may have to struggle on for a long  time before racial division is overcome.",1999-05-30

Looking at some of the comments above mine, I have to say that some of those who gave less than 5 stars also made strange observations.  It's a bad book because it's not about Freud?!

I must admit, but to call it the &quot;Great  American&quot; novel or even to include it on the list of the century's top  100 books gives it far too much credit than it deserves. I felt as if some  one told me a story about people I've never met. The characters were very  two-dimensional. His description of media sex symbols was way out of  context. Why bring up Maryln Monroe? This is a book about a time long  before she was born, written in a period before she was born, supposedly.  One review mentions that he/she read the book when they were in the sixth  grade. That is about where I would place this on a reading list.

So let's call it &quot;a lively, funny, poignant, well-paced novel that happens to be about America but it's so fascinating you might not notice.&quot;  It's about an unnamed family (the characters are simply named Father, Mother, The Little Boy, etc., which makes for some very lovely metaphoric overtones) who keep running into and involving themselves in the lives of celebrities of the '20s (Harry Houdini, Henry Ford, J.P. Morgan...about a dozen of them are recurring characters) as well as some no-name underclass workers and immigrants, who were treated far more shabbily than popular memory tells.  The classes clash in a contrapuntal dance, history is made, and all the while The Family is subtly changing, and by the end of the book we actually care that the stage is set for our modern world, and that the glories and abuses of the Roaring Twenties are about to be lost forever. The writing moves at a satisfying clip, and the book is on the brief side anyway, so you'll burn through much of it at your first sitting, and be eager to get back to it, even if you don't do what I did: get to the end, smile, and start to reread it at the beginning.  I've wanted to meet E.L. Doctorow ever since.  You should be similarly charmed",1997-03-11
