US,17146543,R29NO0HJ63CU3Z,1580601200,675572194,Beloved,Books,5,0,0,N,N,"For all its literary beauty, Beloved remains a novel against injustice and the erasure of memories.","In this Toni Morrison’s 1987 masterpiece, Beloved, a runaway slave, Sethe, with her capture imminent, kills her infant child rather than have her taken into bondage. What kind of mother would cut her daughter's head off with a hacksaw? This is what Toni Morrison explores in this chilling and the brilliantly written book which is inspired by real life events.<br /><br />''I was amazed by this story I came across about a woman called Margaret Garner who had escaped from Kentucky, I think, into Cincinnati with four children,'' Ms. Morrison said. ''And she was a kind of cause celebre in the fight against the Fugitive Slave laws, which mandated the return of escapees to their owners,” Morrison writes. “She killed one of them, just as in the novel. I found an article in a magazine of the period, and there was this young woman in her 20's, being interviewed - oh, a lot of people interviewed her, mostly preachers and journalists, and she was very calm, she was very serene. They kept remarking on the fact that she was not frothing at the mouth; she was not a madwoman, and she kept saying, 'No, they're not going to live like that. They will not live the way I have lived.”<br /><br />Beloved, like so many great novels, is not easy to sum up. So nuanced is its view of life and human beings, and so rich and profound is its intention.<br />Frontally, Beloved is the story of Sethe and her daughter, Beloved. Sethe is an escaped slave and mother of four young children. Her joy at successfully escaping while pregnant, giving birth in flight, and finding refuge at her mother-in-law's, Baby Suggs, home comes to an end twenty-eight days later. Her cruel owner has tracked her down, and rather than let her children suffer the pain of slavery Sethe proceeds to kill them. For killing her third child, Sethe spends time in jail. She is later freed and returns to her mother-in-law’s house-number 124. It has now become a haunted house-full of the dead baby’s venom.’<br /><br />After all the misery of her life, Sethe, now a free woman returns to a house of shattering mirrors, turned up slop jars, and smacks on the behind. Hers became a life suspended between the nastiness of life and the meanness of the dead. It doesn’t take long for her sons, Howard and Buglar to turn their backs on 124, and flee from the ghost’s invisible spite. Even Baby Suggs soon dies in the midst of the outrageous behaviour of the baby ghost.<br /><br />Enter Paul D, one of the ''Sweet Home men'', the male slaves, from Sethe's past. Their owner, Mr. Garner, treated them well. But, he later dies, and his sickly widow, Mrs. Garner, brings in her relative, who is known as ''the schoolteacher.'' The latter’s cruelty and sadism defy all description. He also had two repulsive nephews. Sweet Home soon becomes Hell on earth, and most of the slaves, including Sethe, flee. Halle, her husband, doesn't. But, Paul D. does. Eighteen years after fleeing from Sweet Home, they meet again, as Paul D arrives in house 124, despairing and with his spirit broken from his travails.<br /><br />Paul D and Sethe try to form a ''real'' family, and the baby ghost is driven out by Paul D. For a while some domestic equilibrium is established. But, then, a strange, beautiful, real flesh-and-blood young woman arrives at 124. She is about 20 years old, the same age as Sethe’s dead daughter would be.<br /><br />The young woman doesn’t remember where she comes from, takes an intense interest in Sethe, and says her name is Beloved. It is as if the dead child has been resurrected, determined to make Sethe pay for having taken her life. The book then fluctuates between the present and the past, and through different voices the sordid past of America is narrated. The novel is a harsh dissection of slavery, and it abounds with suffering and loss. Many of its characters are either captives or fugitives from captivity. The characters in Beloved are all stained by the inhuman and predatory culture thatprevailed at the time.<br /><br />There is also a strong theme of the supernatural. Beloved is an intriguing character, and through her we learn about Sethe-her childhood, her adolescence and Sethe as a mother. The discourse and interactions between a mother and her ghost-child are told with great skill. Despite her tormented life, Sethe’s love for her children is immoderate. She lives in a community where there is loyalty among friends, and the poor share the little they have.<br /><br />One of the things that make Beloved the supreme novel it is about history, humanity’s excesses and survival is Toni Morrison’s virtuosity-delivered with intellect and imagination that is unmatchable. The canvas the author paints on is vast, and yet she is able to bring to life characters in a world that is both real and magical. Even the most gruesome aspects of the story, strangely, are delivered with humour.<br /><br />For all its literary beauty, Beloved remains a novel against injustice and the erasure of memories. The women are the primary symbol of that protest and fight against the trivialization of human life. Beloved is a gem and a treasure to be savoured, read and re-read.prevailed at the time.<br /><br />There is also a strong theme of the supernatural.

The protagonist, Sethe, is involved in perhaps one of the most difficult ethical dilemmas imaginable. Sethe had recently escaped bondage and arrived at 124, the home of her mother-in-law in the free state of Ohio. When the plantation owner catches up with her, she is cornered along with her 2 year old daughter and in an act of desperation (that she alternatively interprets as motherly love and protection), kills her baby. Having experienced slavery herself, Sethe could not accept a future of servitude and submission for her daughter, Beloved. As paradoxical as it may seem, she takes control of her motherhood rather than giving it up. Baffled, the plantation owner leaves without Sethe and the local black community condemns her. But years later, a mysterious woman also named Beloved arrives at 124. No one knows for certain who she is; where she came from is equally unknown. Nonetheless, she haunts 124 as if she's a former resident returned to reclaim it. As the reader grapples with the gorgeous complexities and ambiguities of the novel, the spirit of Beloved looms over every page.",2015-06-13

I got a bit frustrated because it wasn’t straight forward. Like here’s the plot and here’s how it ends. But in reality you start to understand what the plot is, it’s pretty simple if you ask me. It’s about how a slave-women escape’s to the free north and then what is the ending to her “supposed to be freedom”.<br /> Some of my favorite parts in the book is in chapter one when Toni Morrison talks about Denver living in 124; a haunted house, that is haunted by the ghost of Sethe’s firstborn daughter. Denver lived with Baby Suggs but after about 8 years she died. But right before she died she sank into really deep depression. Then she died right after Sethe’s son. This is very interesting to me, even though it’s sad.<br /> Chapter four is also a very interesting part, for me anyway. Paul D told Sethe that she could safely re-enter her past and that he would be right there to help her if she falls. Paul D took Denver and Sethe to the carnival they were having, Denver surprised herself by having a really good time. All the people they saw greeted them casually. Instead of greeting Sethe, Denver, and Paul D with hatred. On the way home from the carnival Sethe see’s signs of happiness in the future.<br /> Denver and Beloved danced inside the house while Paul D and Sethe sat outside on the porch. While those two danced Denver asked Beloved how she got her name. Beloved told Denver the story behind it. After the story Denver asked her why she came back, she mentioned Sethe. She wanted to see “her face”. Denver was offended that she wasn’t the main reason for her return.<br /> This was an attention getter, a book that you don’t want to put down. Something that you never want to stop reading until you get the answers. This book is highly recommended. I give Beloved by Toni Morrison a rate of 5 stars. I hope you enjoy reading this book!ars.

Former slave Sethe and her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver might seem to be living comfortably enough in their two-story house on the outskirts of Cincinnati, but life within the walls of 124 Bluestone Road is in fact an ordeal they struggle to endure from day to day.  Sethe, her body and mind both scarred beyond any hope of healing, is a pariah among her neighbors.  Denver hasn't set foot outside her own yard in a decade.  Sethe's once-vibrant mother-in-law had lost the will to live long before she actually died, and her two sons had run away from home when they were barely old enough to fend for themselves.  The house, it turns out, is \\""spiteful.  Full of a baby's venom,\\"" haunted by the spirit of Sethe's other daughter, victim of a violent, bloody death.  It is on the porch of this spiteful house that Sethe finds, coming home from work one day, a man from her past, a man she'd never dreamed she would ever see again.  Paul D orders the ghost out of the house - and when he and Sethe reconnect, he's invited in to stay.  Soon, however, a fourth resident joins Sethe's little household: an enigmatic, childlike young woman with no family and no history.  She calls herself Beloved.<br /><br />Toni Morrison's \\""Beloved\\"" isn't an easy book to read - in fact, it's downright painful.  (It must have been painful and exhilarating to write.)  The horrors of slavery are spelled out here in intimate detail: violence and weariness and fear, but also a whole catalog of psychological traumas, loss and degradation and powerlessness.  Sethe's own sufferings may seem extreme even by historical standards, but she is in fact loosely based on a real historical figure, escaped slave Margaret Garner.  There is much in this novel that is gruesome and revolting; even relatively hardened readers may find themselves wincing now and then.  At the same time, this novel is a thing of beauty.  Morrison's prose, at its most prosaic, verges on poetry.  The seductive rhythms of her language are the perfect vehicle for the complex characters and devastating primal emotions that are her stock in trade.  Morrison's writing obscures even as it illuminates, and \\""Beloved\\"" can be a hard book to read for reasons wholly unrelated to its content: it can be hard to keep track of all the shifts of narration and timeline.  Even readers with excellent comprehension skills and a strong background in American history may find themselves needing to reread a few paragraphs, a page, even a whole short chapter, now and then.  As is typical of Morrison's work, the ending is full of loose threads and ambiguities: not the sort that leave the reader feeling genuinely unsatisfied, but the kind that make it almost impossible not to spend a lot of time thinking about the book after you've set it down.<br /><br />\\""Beloved\\"" is a mature and deeply human novel, and fully deserves its reputation as a modern classic.  Anyone willing to take an unflinching look at the psychological realities of one of the darkest aspects of American (and world) history will find it a richly rewarding experience.

There is a beauty to her writing that is unmatched. I have given it long and intense thought, pondering how to express my opinion of the greatness of her writing.  In doing this, not only have I read her books, I have read many of the things that others have said about her.  In this effort, the best description of her writing that I can find, is found on pages 99 through 102 of Thomas D. Rush's “Reality's Pen: Reflections On Family, History & Culture.” The book can be found right here on Amazon. The description is contained within a piece called “You Never Know Who God Wants You To Meet.”  There are also several apt quotations from Ms. Morrison sprinkled throughout the book. In doing this review, it is only fair to point out the thorough description of Morrison's work contained within Rush's book.

I was expecting an action packed tale about an escaped slave; it was instead a slow-moving story that provoked much thought about what is right and wrong. Beloved is riddled with many flashbacks, symbols, and metaphors that, at some points, left me sitting motionless and confused, yet nevertheless intrigued by what had just been said. I cannot say that this novel was a page turner for me and that it seemed impossible to put down because that would not be true. I think that Beloved is a fairly good novel, but to those looking for an exciting book to read, like I was, I do not suggest it. I have read many books that were exciting, and if I were to list those, Beloved would not make the cut. However, if you are someone who enjoys novels with deeper meanings and historical content, then you will enjoy this book. Toni Morrison presents a moral dilemma that as readers, we could not begin to understand without the help of flashbacks about characters’ pasts. The story is at many parts confusing, but slowly the novel begins to make since and you are able to understand the characters and the motives for their actions.

And only in the end I got the broader picture.<br />The story is situated in Ohio, in the period 1860-1880, during and short after the American Civil War; it is centered around a group of Afro-American slaves, officially freed, but in reality still enslaved. One woman, Sethe has undergone very traumatic experiences as a slave; it is mostly through her eyes we follow the story. It's my impression that not this story on its own (about the horrors of slavery) is central to this book, but the way the trauma distorts Sethe's way of experiencing reality, the present and the past. In a review on Goodreads I read a nice comparison with Proust: Proust reconstructed his past by offering a detailled, lineair story (though he noticed afterwards that this was not as trustworthy as he thought it was), but with Morisson this becomes a past in bits and bites, with much \\""illogical\\"", non-linear-elements, as the consequence of traumatic experiences.<br />In this sense the book is interesting.

Toni Morrison wrote about slavery in a way we could understand it.  Images, tastes, and sensations are explored in this book whether it's the taste of iron from a bit that was put in a slave's mouth or the sense of hummingbird wings in your hair as you fearfully make a fateful decision about the future of your child.  When asked if this book was magical realism, Morrison said that each subject matter deserves its own form and that she loved the process of invention in writing.  She invented a form to suit her subject.<br /><br />This book is about memory, and that anything dead coming back to life hurts.  We discussed this in our Coursera MOOC class on relationships in fiction, and the professor commented that the structure of the book is one of \\""delayed disclosures\\"".  The book takes you back to the scene of the crime.  It's pastward, he said, like in psychology where you find the original injury. When you finally discern, with growing horror, what the original injury is, you are ready for it and you understand it.  All of the lesser horrors preceding it helps you understand it in context.<br /><br />This is brilliant narration.

In doing so you will not only read a compelling story, but you will expand your knowledge of this world as well as learn some about yourself when looking at your reactions and feelings to the events in this novel.  However, this novel is not an easy read and does take thinking and re-reading to understand what is happening.  But it is so worth it!  ORDER! :)",2013-05-29

Everyone gleans something from this book. Be forewarned that it is not for the faint of heart. There's your answer.<br /><br />For those of you who have read BELOVED, you're aware that it's an excellent piece of literature. You're also aware that it's a somewhat difficult book to read, as it makes the reader think about things most people would rather not consider. It really forces a person to confront issues in the world that are ugly, hard, and painful to the point of being poetic. An active reader considers (at least) the obvious issues- issues such as a person having less freedom than a rooster and what could lead to such constraints today, what exactly love means (and does a mother who kills her own children love them? is she simply short sighted? is life worth living without freedom? does a mother have the right to decide between life and death for her child/ren?) and what a person should do for/with love, how people could have ever treated each other this way (and for those aware of modern day slavery, how it's possible that people continue to do this/ let it continue), etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />The list of difficult questions and even harder answers never ends when you read a book like this. In fact, each time I read it, I come away with more. The first time I read it, I recognized it instantly as a book that would change me forever.<br /><br />I came across this book (this exact devil-red copy) for the first time in an AP English 12 class in high school. My teacher taught in several countries before returning to the states and had come back with the idea that the comfort zones of young people needed to be challenged and questioned to the extreme. As a seventeen year old child, the book shocked me, shook me up, and shook new parts out of me.<br /><br />That is the point of reading: expanded horizons, increased awareness of our human family, and, perhaps most importantly, increased awareness of who we are as individual people.<br /><br />She constantly put difficult questions to us, urging us to speak already, and answer as brutally honestly as possible. She even occasionally screamed at us \\""C'mon, people, WHAT DO YOU THINK?! FEEL SOMETHING!\\""<br /><br />Let me tell you, it led to a lot of interesting classroom \\""discussion\\"" (*cough* arguments *cough*).<br /><br />Later, I became a teacher myself. My teaching style is a little (read: insanely, ridiculously, black-to-white) different, and I am MUCH more selective. I'm the sort of teacher that would rather guide constructive discussion in the classroom rather than a bar brawl.<br /><br />I still do not believe this book is wrong for the classroom.<br /><br />The question lies in what sort of class it is. If you are considering including this book in your curriculum (or having your child read it over the summer), I strongly suggest it be with upper-level high school (preferably students you've had before and know) or lower-university level students. The real question is not whether your students are ready to(or even capable of) reading and understanding this horror-film-history novel. Most people would agree that the mind censors out what it is not willing to accept.<br /><br />The question really has to do with whether the students are mature enough to handle what this book will teach them about themselves. It's a book that should be supplemented with deep thought (read: self-searching essays and tons of classroom discussion).<br /><br />Are your students (or your children) ready to recognize their beliefs and develop their understanding of slavery? freedom? love? murder (maybe versus mercy killing)? etc.<br /><br />The other question is whether you, as a teacher and guide for them, are ready to include such topics in the classroom.<br /><br />My high school teacher was in to making her students play god (a practice I disagree with to this day) and assigned us the task of writing a modern court scene for the various characters in the book. We had to judge their actions, and then defend/accuse them accordingly as if we were lawyers. Since we had just finished Dante's INFERNO, those who thought dear mommy was a horrible Medea had the option of forgoing that assignment and putting her in hell. We had to decide her punishment, and explain why she deserved that punishment.<br /><br />As I suggested, I truly have a problem with any assignment that forces students to judge another person's soul. There's a big dude upstairs for that. So I'm even harsher.<br /><br />I give my students this assignment:<br />After discussing the topics mentioned, as well as some others, I ask my students to take a moment to think about the person they love the most.<br /><br />Then I ask them to make the same life-of-torture or death decision for that person.<br /><br />I ask them to go home and spend some time really thinking and (perhaps more importantly) figuring out what they feel about it. I then ask them to write an essay on what they've learned. I give them the question \\""What would you do?\\""<br /><br />I've gotten every sort of response to this.

I think the author's variation was interesting and left the reader wondering what would happen next. I've seen the good, bad, and ugly reviews of this book, but decided to take a chance anyway - I am glad that I did.<br /><br />Our Elizabeth in this story has grown up as part of a wealthy family and came in contact with Darcy at an early age. In fact, this Darcy and Elizabeth have always loved each other. Elizabeth is there when Darcy's parents die, and she's there to see Wickham in action. This Elizabeth and Darcy don't have the same issues as the original characters. No worries because there is a plot.<br /><br />In this variation of P&P Elizabeth's mother and Miss Bingley are your bad guys and they both seem to fit the bill. Elizabeth's mother has a mental illness that slowly seems to drive her insane (with the help of Miss Bingley) and Miss Bingley won't give up on marrying Darcy (even after he's married happily with Elizabeth).<br /><br />Yes - Darcy does fall in love with Elizabeth when she is 15 and he is 23. It is a little odd, but to me, this fit with the period as well. But this brings me to notion of love at first site, or just having a feeling that you are meant to be with a particular someone.

You knew the mad man Pomeroy was mad, but the motives of the others like Develin and Countess Perruche were a little too vague. Develin's love for Ella and wanting to marrying her and the Countess for a few trinkets and precious beyond anyone's understanding? Hard to believe! Develin doesn't mind that the woman he shows love for and has asked to marry is mauled and raped by a mad man, before he gets her? The Countess does what she does, for a few trinkets from Saber? Saber thinks he is going mad, but other than a few disjointed dreams he has of India, you never really know the whole story of that madness, even at the end as he has gotten better but not whole. I didn't see where Ella improved Sabers slide into madness at all, you can't call the sex they had rolling around in the mud and rain a lead to a cure, although Saber did? Ella, with a knife at her throat a couple of times at Sabers hands, would have had me getting to the bottom of Sabers problems mighty fast, but for a couple half hearted attempts, she doesn't. I have heard of loving a man blindly but Ella takes it to a new level. The end was fast, too fast with not enough of the threads pulled together for my liking. Saber ends up an ineffective hero at the last, as he supposedly was in India. Pomeroy's stabbing poker was hard to believe, too. I couldn't visualize the poker being used as a knife in Sabers back at that close a range, and how did he manage to get to Sabers back with the poker in the first place. Pomeroy ended up running, as some of the guilty were gathered up, but not all and you never hear what happened to any of the guilty except Pomeroy who made a fatal trip down the stairs. This could have been a good book, I still read it from beginning to end, but I got so tired of the repetitiveness of Ella's I love you and Sabers I can't marry you and can't tell you why,on and on!

It is, in a word, awful.    First of all, other than the use of the same names of people and places, this novel has absolutely no relation to 'Pride and Prejudice' at all.  What characters remain have only the shade of a resemblance to their P&P counterparts.  It appears that the author had an idea for a novel and thought that the only way to get it published was to use the names from P&P, which I believe would be accurate.  There is no way that this would have been published otherwise.    The writing itself is not bad as far as grammar or punctuation, and the plot had potential.  It fails in execution.  The majority of the prose is exposition.  Frankly, the narrator talks too much.  Most of the content has the feel of a summary, often feeling more like a book report or perhaps an outline for a novel.  Then in the middle of one of these summaries, a stray line of dialog will be thrown in (or can it be called dialog when only one person speaks?).    Speaking of the dialog:  Although avoiding dialog for the most part, the author chooses to use dialog in the oddest places.  For example:         \\""The Garnon party met their hosts in the drawing room before dinner.  When they were shown in, Elizabeth hurried to make them comfortable.  'Miss Garnon, allow me to welcome you and your parents to our home.'  She led them closer to the fire and bade them to sit.  'I trust you have found your rooms acceptable?'       \\""'Oh, yes, Mrs. Darcy.  They are very comfortable, indeed.'  Mr. and Mrs. Garnon agreed and smiled at everyone before Mrs. Garnon spoke.  'Thank you for seeing that we had hot baths upon our arrival.  We had grown quite chilled before reaching Pemberley.'\\""  That is the entire scene.  It has absolutely no relevance to the plot or anything else going on in the novel.  It is perplexing since most plot points are rushed over - but it must be clear that Elizabeth ordered hot baths for her guests.  (????)Although most of the plot is conveyed in short summaries, occasionally the exposition goes into minute detail of the most inconsequential information.  For example:  \\""A week later, three carriages pulled away from Longbourn.  Darcy, Elizabeth, Georgiana, and Mr. Bennet were in one.  The Hursts and the Bingleys were in another, while the third carriage carried Sarah, Georgiana's maid, Heather, Darcy's valet, Williamson, and Mr. Bingley's valet, Jenkins.\\""  (OK, the comma usage is incorrect in that last sentence.)  All of this wouldn't have been an issue if the author had been as generous when conveying the actual plot.    Throughout the reading, I couldn't quite put my finger on the odd tone of the novel.  Now I realize that it most resembles that of a fairy tale, especially when it comes to pacing.  Years will be summed up in a paragraph, then the forward motion of the plot will come to a dead stop while something meaningless is described in excruciating detail.    I am inclined to think that the author must be quite young.  She (or he) is not familiar with the basic structure of a novel.  I would suggest that the author read more novels, educate her/himself about novel construction, then try this again using this as an outline -- and give the characters original names.    One more annoyance:  The author must just have learned that \\""breakfast\\"" comes from the morning meal being a break from the fast during slumber.  Throughout the novel: he broke his fast, she broke her fast, they broke their fast.  For heaven's sake, just let them eat!  Although, once again, this is one of those little details that should have been omitted in favor of advancing the plot.",2011-01-16

Beloved is a story about former slaves. From here, you see the destroyed identities these characters have due to slavery and their own inability to cope with the past and past actions. It inhibits one to form a coherent self-identity, thus an inability to learn how to deal with traumas and go forward. Lastly, there is something to be said about community. Community is needed. It provides solidarity, the connections that people need for social support, whatever it might be. Sethe's past actions cut that support from the community. However, the community is also at fault for their view of Sethe and Baby Suggs. Both sides eventually reconcile and that is what Morrison explores. Dealing with the past: You must reconcile what has happened with what is happening in order to have a better feature. However, you cannot do that without knowing what has happened. This is what the character Denver represents, someone willing to ignore the past and thus unable to reconcile herself and her current situation. When she is confronted with knowledge of the past and learning what has happened instead of ignoring history, she starts to reconcile her family with the community.<br />In turn, the community begins to reconcile with the residents of 124 and make up for their past mistakes Make no mistake though, this is about the destruction slavery has caused and while sad and depressing, the end provides an idea of hope: That eventually we can reconcile what has happened with what is happening and build a better future. Lastly, I applaud Morrison for her use of the supernatural. Whether drawn from African Culture or use of Christian Symbolism, it adds to the story because it implies there is something greater than ourselves that will make us confront that which we do not want to confront.",2010-08-02

In this book Sethe and her daughter Denver live alone in a house in Ohio shortly after the Civil War. Sethe's two sons, run away from home by the time they are thirteen.<br />The house is haunted by the ghost of Sethe's 2 year old unnamed baby, simply known as Beloved. The haunting is severe and poltergeist-like, Beloved throws things, the house rattles and shakes, yet Sethe refuses to leave. No one visits Sethe and Denver, they don't want to go near the house, everyone knows it is haunted.<br /><br />One day, an old acquaintance of Sethe's, a man named Paul D, shows up at her doorstep. The two become involved right away. Paul D knew Sethe years ago when she was first married and lived on a plantation before they were freed. He is happy to reconnect with her all these years later.<br />Not shortly after, a woman shows up in front of Sethe's home. Something about her is different, she can't talk much, is very sleepy and her skin is baby soft. When asked her name, she simply spells out the word, 'Beloved'.<br /><br />Sethe lets Beloved into her home, gives her a place to sleep and takes her in for the time being. The family just figures she is a wanderer with no place to go.

Also I like romance novels to have a little bit of tragedy that the hero and heroine must over come (not just one long happy fairy tale) and this book certainly had it with the loss of Zenobia's mother and first love and eventually her kingdom of Palmyra. Yet there is a satisfying happy ending, so overall I recommend it to any people willing to pick it up. Oh and this novel is historically acurate, another trait a majority of romance novels lack.",2009-01-07

It was also listed as one of the best American novels of the past 25 years...so I kept it even after canceling the class.  While it was an interesting story and a thought provoking read, I had a hard time with this book for a few different reasons.<br /><br />Writing Style<br />The narrative was written in a close third person following very closely alongside the minds of a few main characters, Sethe primarily but also Denver, Paul D and some other characters who showed up later (Stamp & even Beloved herself).  The voices used were likely fairly authentic to the voices of mid/late-1800 recently freed slaves in America.  The grammar was a little mixed up at times, but generally very understandable.<br /><br />The grammar wasn't as difficult to follow as the actual style of the voices themselves.  Often, I was caught in a sort of stream-of-consciousness type narrative from one of the characters.  Being pulled that far inside the character's head made it difficult for me to keep my bearings or perspective clear.  The roundabout way subjects were treated left me confused and really slowed down the reading for me while I tried to keep the message straight.  I'm not sure if this disorientation was intentional or if it's my own personal distance from this type of character that made it hard, but that was my primary complaint with the book.<br /><br />Characters, Setting, Tone, etc.<br />The characters were well created and very alive to me, especially as the book progressed.  Even though the 'stream of consciousness' writing hung me up a lot, it also helped me get to know the characters better.  I felt like I understood Sethe and Denver much better after getting into their heads.<br /><br />The settings fluctuated back and forth for me...sometimes they felt extremely real and vivid and other times they felt very flat and clapboard/2-d.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with the characters and the setting was that I often lost site of the fact that this was set in the mid-1800s in a post-civil-war/abolitionist nation just rising out of slavery.  The tone of the novel was often the largest element, and that tone often didn't ring \\""post-civil-war\\"" to me.<br /><br />Again, it could be my distance from the subject but many times through the book, it was almost a shock to be reminded that these characters had just recently been living on a plantation as slaves.  Most of the time while I was reading, my mind conjured up a more contemporary setting...people living in a poor borough in the 1900s, perhaps even the late-1900s.<br /><br />Maybe that should be a compliment to the story rather than a detractor...it shows that this is a Timeless sort of tale that could easily happen 150 years ago or last week.<br /><br />Themes<br />This novel presented a number of strong messages.<br /><br />The racial message was naturally there loud and clear.  It came as a strong reminder of the horrific reality that was slavery in the U.S.A...and the racism that followed after abolitionism...and even today.  I loved the line where Sethe comments that she has her freedom now, but she's still not free.<br /><br />That sense of freedom leads into another major theme, that of Identity.  Sethe and these other ex-slaves are trying to redefine themselves in a world that has chewed them up and spit them out.  Beyond the slave reference, Sethe and her family have an added stigma because of Beloved.  All of the characters come face-to-face with their own identity (or lack thereof) and have to take major actions to determine what they want to become.<br /><br />The other major theme that struck me was that of Family and of relations within the Family.  Most of what Sethe did was for her family.  She was driven to escape slavery to protect and provide a better life for her family.  She ran with her kids in tow to the tool shed when the white authorities came, becauseshe had to protect her family.  She went to prison for her family.  She lived alone and stigmatized in a haunted house in an effort to keep her family whole.  And yet, her actions also served to drive her family apart.  Her sons leave as soon as they feel physically capable of doing so.  Her remaining living daughter Denver is totally estranged and practically ignored by her.  Going back to the \\""identity\\"" factor, Sethe hasn't really learned how to be a mother and has to learn what it means to create a family in the world she's living in.<br /><br />Overall<br />Overall I had a hard time with this book.  It was a very slow read for me, often talking itself in circles and leaving me confused.  Still, I found the story very interesting and thought provoking.  I felt awful for Sethe and her family and for the trials they had to endure.  Even though, as I mentioned above, I felt that the 'slavery' theme often got overshadowed, I was still struck by the awful fact that slavery did exist (still exists some places in the world) and just how awful it was.  Even the \\""good\\"" slave owners (of \\""Sweet Home\\"" where Sethe ran from) were despicable and made me shrink in shame.<br /><br />It was a good book, but hard to read.  I don't know how good the movie was, but if it's true enough to the book, I might recommend watching that rather than trying to push through the book.<br /><br />Still, it's worth reading if only to get a new insight into the world of slavery and racism that raged (and still lingers) in America and the world.<br /><br />***<br />3 starsatized in a haunted house in an effort to keep her family whole.

Morrison writes with beautiful and poetic language. That aside, I struggled through this book despite the magnificent writing. Firstly, I just want to note that DO NOT ATTEMPT to read this book if you have never read the Bible. Literally every other page is a literary picture of a Bibical image; whether it be the Four Horsemen, Snakes, Sword and Shield, or the Flood. This imagery was very vivid but it becomes so bogged down in symbolism and imagery that it is impossible to evade confusion. One chapter (not labeled chapters although) in particular has a conversation at the end without quotations or names and takes you about 5 rereads to understand it. I read this for International Baccalaureate Advanced Lit Studies (Higher level lit) and even my teacher noted that it will take several rereads to understand the novel. I can see how this is ok for a Lit class but not someone who is reading it for fun; it is definitely not a casual, \\""hey I need something to read!\\"" book.

That's so ridiculous I can't even suspend my disbelief. The mother and the revived ghost-daughter end up being co-dependent and obsessed with each other, and some other drama ensues.

This amount of hype, Morrison's iconic status, and the difficulty of the book can cause a great amount of skepticism in the reader.  One wants to hate the book and toss it aside.<br /><br />It took me quite a while to warm to the book, and I did almost toss it aside at points.  It is not an easy read.  Morrison could have structured her narrative in a more readable way, but she deliberately chose not to.  The story of the runaway slave-mother's tragic loss of her daughter is too painful to be told in this fashion.  So it's done episodically, with flashbacks, and with the device of the sudden appearance of a stray girl who is taken in as a new daughter with growing suspicions as to her being a reincarnation.<br /><br />There are very good reasons for Morrison to tell the tale in this fashion.  The events of the slave era, after all, exist only in racial memory, and a 21st century reader can best approach the horrors of the times by peeling back the layers of memory.  This is exactly how Morrison tells her story, and it does resonate.  Also, it is apparent that Morrison is skilled in the oral traditions of a culture that didn't tell legends in a linear manner.<br /><br />So, the reader has to put aside his/her frustrations with the difficulty of this approach and appreciate the writer's need to tell the tale in this fashion.  And it helps that the story becomes a lot clearer as you slog through the narrative.<br /><br />Morrison's language is quite remarkable.  It is at times poetic.  She can capture the character and look of a person in a few striking sentences.  It's really some of the best writing I've read for some time.<br /><br />So, the book does live up to the hype.

Frankly, this is the sort of work people will like or loathe with very little ambivalence.  Morrison uses a strange style in telling the story of a woman who tries to kill her children rather than see them be returned to slavery, yet it works.<br /><br />The past and the present are jumbled together for Sethe, who does succeed in cutting the throat of her baby daughter before the slavecatchers can stop her.  The same is true for the other characters in the story.  They've been in chain gangs, raped, seen all of their children sold away.  These people can't stop reliving the horrors they've seen.  The fluid, sometimes confusing jumps between past and present underscore this: the words read like the jumbled thoughts of humans who have suffered severe trauma in a time when post-traumatic stress disorder wasn't acknowledged and therapists didn't exist.<br /><br />Confusing to read?  Sometimes, I'll admit.  But in light of the story, it make sense.<br /><br />This is not your typical ghost story.  Sethe's baby daughter does indeed haunt her house, and violently so.  Her young sons are so terrified that they flee and never return, and Sethe's dwindling family lives in isolation since the house's reputation pretty much stops all visitors.  But unlike most ghost stories, this is one in which the ghost takes physical form.  Beloved returns from death as a young flesh-and-blood woman, but this only increases the chaos she wrecks on her family.  Even Beloved's memories are recorded here, but they're not all Beloved's.  One hears a story told by an anonymous girl who survives a voyage across the Atlantic in the hold of a slave ship.<br /><br />In this sense, Beloved's rage isn't just that of a daughter murdered by a mother trying to protect her in the only way she knew, but the rage and despair of millions of black people who suffered and died under slavery.  This is the story of Sethe and her family's healing.  In all these ways, this isn't just a ghost story, but a tale of an exorcism, of tbe purging of a bad memory.<br /><br />The people are fantastically-rendered.  I'm not sure where some people get that the characters are \\""just supposed to represent something\\"".  These feel and act like real people.  Morrison describes the heart of Sethe's lover, Paul D, as kept in a tin box that's been rusted shut - the only way he's managed not to crack after surviving a chain gang and traveling homeless the last twenty years.  Denver is a young woman too afraid to leave her house.  So isolated is she that she's happy to have a ghost to play with, even if it is a ghost.<br /><br />White people are viewed with a detached mistrust for obvious reasons.  Seen through the eyes of the novel's black characters, whites are unknoweable, bland, perhaps not real people.  This is an interesting switch from old literature (written by whites) in which blacks were the ones viewed as otherworldly and strange.  It all depends on who's the witness, after all.<br /><br />No one is perfect and, with the exception of the sadist Schoolteacher, no one is purely bad.  The white couple who bring Baby Suggs out of slavery are very kind indeed, and certainly more evolved than many white folk of the time period.  Yet in their home they have a statue of a black boy, his mouth open to receive coins, a sign affixed around his neck with the words \\""At yo service\\"", revealing that even good, kind people still need to deal with their racism.  Slavecatchers are able to catch Sethe unawares because none of her neighbors warn her of the white men's advance.  They are jealous and spiteful of her family's prosperity, and so in her hour of need, they abandon her.<br /><br />A friend told me this book gave her nightmares, and I understand why: the violence and cruelty is breath-taking.  At the plantation ironically-named Sweet Home, boys are hanged from trees, pregnant women are raped and men are burned alive for trying to flee.  It is from here that Sethe and Paul D escape, but the horrors of the place live in their memory and affect everything they do, even after two decades.  The master, known only as Schoolteacher for the way he \\""teaches\\"" those who need behavior modification, is a monster reminiscent of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele.  The murder of Sethe's daughter is appalling, but given the circumstances, understood.  Death is the only way Sethe can save her children from Hell.<br /><br />Although the core of the book focuses on a mother and her murdererd daughter, the story is that of a people, really.  Sethe and Beloved are only tiny fragments in a bigger story, that of the abduction and torture of a race.  Slavery was the most antifamily institution ever invented, where the break-up of the family was not an act of terror but just another bit of public policy.<br /><br />With a tale of such great magnitude, a writer could easily lose track of what she were doing or never even get it off the ground.

(Many of these reviewers appear to have read the novel as assigned reading for a class).  Other reviewers will tell you the novel is a haunting, provocative literary achievement.<br /><br />I agree with the latter (I gave it 5 stars) but I understand the criticism to a degree.  The subject matter is disturbing and the narrative flow can be difficult to follow.  The novel is told through the eyes of multiple characters and much of the story is pieced together through their memories.  Morrison's writing, it could be argued, is too aware of itself.  In particular, a series of `stream of consciousness' chapters near the end of the novel are dense and elusive, reminiscent of some of Faulkner's work.  Detractors may claim that these chapters are nothing more than an overtly pretentious attempt at `high brow' literature.<br /><br />I disagree.  I was spellbound by Morrison's mesmerizing prose and in particular was captivated by those same impressionistic chapters. Morrison effectively conveys the de-humanizing nature of slavery but resists the urge to be heavy handed about it.  Her characters, both black and white, oppressor and oppressed, are fully realized, imperfect human beings.  Morrison's narrative allows both victim and oppressor to confront their pasts.<br /><br />This is a powerful novel that forces the reader to confront the horrifying legacy of slavery.

But, her writing style is not.  Therefore, she manages to capture your attention in reading about horrible events and opens your mind to things which we ordinarily do not read about or learn: for instance, after majoring in American History, I learned for the first time in this book that black men would be punished by having a tack put into their mouth at which time their mouths became deformed, tongue dried to the point of needing weeks to repair, and became mentally humiliated to an unknown degree.<br /><br />There is a bit of Stephen King in this book - an apparition with the single name of Beloved returns to the family. To avenge? Or, to love? Or by her love is she an avenger? In any event, this character speaks few words but influences Denver and Sethe immensely, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.<br /><br />One force which seems to wrestle sanely in the insanely cruel world of slavery is Paul D. After having experienced worse tortures, mental and physical, than most others, he maintains a balanced perspective.  He is the ballast to Sethe's tumultuous inner conflict.  Sethe, we learn, experiences a \\""Sophie's Choice\\"" situation which others view with disdain, but which we learn to understand. Even though we may not agree to the same, we understand.  Morrison explains to us why good people can perform bad acts.  In most simplest terms, she writes their reason of being good people that do bad things is, \\"" That anybody white could take your whole self for anything that came to mind. Not just work, kill, or maim you, but dirty you. Dirty you so bad that you couldn't like yourself anymore.\\""<br /><br />But, those who had been slaves sought to protect their young - those who would be born free or became free before their memories jelled - from having this white-man manifestation of hate for self.<br /><br />Strong topic.

If this is any indication of her skill as a writer, I will certainly be reading more by her.  Initially the book is confusing, unsettling and leaves the reader with many questions - this is intentional, as Morrison wants us to experience the dislocation and chaos that was the daily bread of a slave in the mid-nineteenth century.  Stay with it; the struggle is richly rewarded.<br /><br />_Beloved_ on the surface is the story of Seethe, a runaway slave, haunted by her dead daughter.  As the story progresses, each character we encounter has a secret of their own that they are coming to terms with (or are trying to hide.)  Gradually the questions raised in the first 50 pages are answered and order made of the chaos, as the rich interconnectedness of the characters becomes apparent, and their secrets are exposed.<br /><br />Slavery plays a large role to be sure, as Morrison shows the scars the institution left on both African - Americans and whites.  But _Beloved_ is also about forgiveness, leaving the past, and coming to terms with past wrongs.  These themes are masterfully woven through the perspectives of a wide cast of characters, each wholly unique and human.  I am also dumbstruck with Morrison's way with words - at times poignant and touching, elsewhere horrifying and shocking, reading this book was an emotional experience.

Numerous scholars, critics and professors often make this well-known and well-respected novel, by award winning writer Toni Morrison, when the topic of slavery depicted in modern literature is front and center. There is a good reason for that. BELOVED takes a haunting and heartbreaking look at the life of Sethe, an abused, emotionally maimed African-American slave whose own child, Beloved, was taken from her in such a heartless way. This ghost from Sethe's past continues to haunt her in everything she does. It isn't until she has a chance encounter with Paul, also a slave, that all of her demons are truly exorcised from her memory.<br /><br />I would agree that BELOVED is an important piece of literature worth reading, purely because it so acutely depicts the devastation and human cruelty that takes place in spades in the business of slavery and slave trade. Sethe is an example of many women who were truly broken down by their experiences as human beasts of burden. Slaves (African-American men, women and children alike) were reduced to machines (if not less than that) at the hands of evil and violent slave masters. The effects of brutal beatings, rapes and horrid living conditions ravaged an entire population of people whose predecessors have not forgotten the ancestral scars laid on their heads, backs, and memories (through story and continued sorrow). Why then do I only give BELOVED three stars and not five? For starters, there are passages in the book that could have been more compelling. Yes, I know that many Morrison fans will argue with me on this point to the grave. I don't blame you. I just feel that there were episodes in the story that I felt a tremendous disconnect from as a reader. I wanted so much to feel more engaged and connected. Instead, Morrison maintained a heavy-handed distance between her characters and the audience. It was painfully orchestrated, and I found that quite disappointing, since I believe that slavery is something we, as American people, must acknowledge and come to understand in a sensitive way, in order to recognize the historical damage we did a great population of people in this country.

Set in the America before the Civil War, the story moves from the slave South to the non-slave North.  Free the North is not, as this book depicts, for slaves could be captured and returned down South.  The book is conglomeration of multiple themes and storylines.  First and foremost is the story of Sethe, a black woman who used to be a slave.  Second, the book focuses on her baby who died at birth, who goes by the name Beloved, and the reappearance of the baby as a ghost.<br /><br />Third, the book examines slavery, racism, and the politics of inclusion and seclusion.  In the South, Sethe is excluded from civil society in many ways by her color and the institution of slavery, but being a slave, is an integral part of society in general.  In the North, she is not a slave per say, but instead she is excluded from society in general by the ways of white people and their benign racism.  The storylines of this book also explore the physical punishments and practices used to enforce slavery at the personal level.

But even in the \\""free\\"" North, slaves can be found and returned to their masters, and the vulnerability of Sethe and her children leads to murder and a haunting.<br /><br />Morrison depicts white society as evil, and in her novel refinements like the law and education mask but do not change its racist nature.  Some of her white characters are psychopathically violent; others, like a pair of abolitionists in Cincinnati, are more benignly racist.  The only white character that Morrison portrays sympathetically is a disturbed white girl, utterly alienated from white society, who saves Sethe's life after she escapes across the Ohio River and helps her deliver her baby.  In contrast, Morrison's black characters demonstrate loyalty, spirituality, and perseverance as they negotiate the obstacles arranged for them by a hostile society.<br /><br />This novel effectively arouses a sense of horror and abhorrence in the reader, but its depictions of sexual assaults, torture, degradation, and more mundane forms of cruelty make it an exceptionally unpleasant book to read.

The harrowing lives of major protagonists Sethe and Paul D ring true and arouse both shame and sympathy that human beings were demeaned and subjugated to provide profit and ease for white Southerners.  But, of course, that is an old story.  The question this reader considered after finishing the novel is whether this story needed to be told again, even by such a talented writer.

I'm not sure this novel does that, nevetheless, it seems worth the reader's time because of the author's talent.

They befriend him and bring him home on a visit to their family.  While there, Hunter meets first their flirtatious sister Melissa and then their shy cousin Alannah who is terrified of all indians because of the slaughter of her family when she was a young child.  Attracted to Allanah but discouraged by her fear, Hunter returns Melissa's open flirtation and when it ends up with them sleeping together Hunter believes Melissa loves him and will want to marry.  He leaves on the military campaign with brothers Elliot and Byron never knowing Melissa was horrified of her actions with an Indian and immediately regrets them.  When she realizes she is pregnant, Melissa tricks a local soldier into marrying her.  Upon his return, Hunter is devastated by Melissa's betrayal and she tells him the baby is her new husband's.  Hunter leaves vowing never to return. <br /> <br />Melissa dies in childbirth and it is immediately clear her baby is an Indian child.

When they find Hunter, he denies the child is his and before they can convince him otherwise, Elliot is attacked and killed by enemy indians.

Melissa rejected him so he in turn rejects his son, even when he admits the boy is his.  Alannah is a likeable and strong girl, but the fact she is deathly terrified of Indians one minute and changes her mind and marries one the next, was too much to accept.

Full of a baby's venom.\\"" Nobelist Toni Morrison begins her 1988 Pulitzer Prize novel with a house haunted by the ghost of a dead baby. Sethe, who occupies the house outside Cincinnati, is a former slave who escaped from her Kentucky plantation Sweet Home eighteen years before, heavily pregnant with her daughter Denver, who now lives with her. At the start of the book she is joined by Paul D., also from Sweet Home, a good man who drives out the ghost and begins to bring back happiness to Sethe's life. But the specters of the past cannot so easily be laid to rest.<br /><br />Unlike other novels of slavery, Morrison begins her story after Emancipation, in a Northern city with a supportive black community, focusing on what happens after so-called Freedom has been obtained. In doing so, she asks what freedom truly means, and whether the events of the past can be expunged from the personal psyche simply by crossing a river or passing a law. And so the haunting continues. Fragments from the past come back in apparently random order; Morrison writes the way the mind works rather than following the chronological rails of history. It is essential to her purpose that the ghosts of the past should enter and leave freely, some resisted, some embraced, some mere memories, some taking apparent physical form. At times it is impossible to tell what is real and what imaginary; Morrison's Magic Realism hovers on the edge of hallucination, but the events that lie behind Sethe's trauma are very real indeed.<br /><br />My advice: surrender to this book, don't fight it. Give yourself to the beautiful writing and warm characters. The underlying story will become clear in time, but it will reveal itself as a rich web of connections rather than a single line. This is a horrific book, but it also contains moments of kindness, love, and beauty. It is a feminist book, but it contains men who are strong also.

The suspense is gripping: how do you continue to live after all that, and in particular, how do you negotiate the freedom in a world co-opted by Jim Crow?

Morrison takes us inside the minds of her characters with such insistence that the effect is analytical: it creates distance rather than familiarity. Though the horrors and inequities of slavery shock, for this reader the general tone is too artificial to truly move. But compelling it is.<br /><br />Some readers are apparently troubled by the constant use of flashbacks and memories; the discontinuous timeline does oblige you to pay attention, but in the end the complexity it creates is hardly more than superficial; this is, in essence, a fairly simple and straightforward story. Sethe, a slave who escaped from a Kentucky plantation, is now living in her mother-in-laws' house in Cincinnati, together with her daughter, Denver. For reasons that we learn of later, her two sons have gone away. Also, we are informed matter-of-factly on the very first page, the house is haunted by the angry spirit of a baby. Two arrivals upset the status quo. First that of Paul D., who has escaped from the same plantation where Sethe used to be. Then, that of a mysterious young woman who calls herself Beloved, and lays an increasingly exclusive claim on Sethe. As the story unfolds, we learn of the history connecting these people, and what drives them. We get acquainted with their friends, enemies, and families. The gruesome, merciless realities of the slave business and of racism are laid bare in all their inhumanity.

It hangs on the thinnest of narrative thread, and whenever a plot threatens to develop, the scene ends and we find out what happened later as an aside.  Most of the 275 pages are dense interior monologues, frequently repetitious, that sometimes degenerates into what seemed like random text.<br /><br />The characters are drawn with detail, each distinctive and real.  I feel I could recognize them on the street if one walked past.  But they are as closed to us as they are to themselves.  While they evoke my sympathy, they never gain my empathy.  We study them, we hear them, we even feel them, but we never are them.<br /><br />As an epic prose/poem, Beloved is amazingly successful.  Its images are strong and convincing.  As a novel, it's a long, tedious read with no payoff.  I would recommend Beloved to someone who enjoys poetry.  For someone looking for a story, even a difficult one, there are many far more readable.",2006-07-07

Revealing the story of Sethe and her family as they survive the brutality of the farm, only to encounter torments even more punishing than whippings after they escape, Morrison presents scenes in a seemingly random order, each scene revealing some aspect of life for Sethe, her boys, her dead baby Beloved, and the new baby Denver, both in the past and in the present. Moving back and forth, around, and inside out through Sethe's recollections, she gradually reveals Sethe's story to the reader, its horror increasing as the reader makes the connections which turn disconnected scenes into a powerful and harrowing chronology.<br /><br />As the novel opens, Sethe and Denver have lived in #124, a house in Ohio, for eighteen years, refusing to socialize and enjoying no company. When Paul D. Garner, one of the Sweet Home men and a friend of her long-missing husband, arrives on her doorstep and moves in, Sethe slowly reveals her long-buried nightmares, and the two share their stories of the events leading up to their escape. Most haunting to Sethe is the death of her young daughter Beloved, shortly after the escape from the farm, though the reader does not know for many pages the shocking manner of her death. When a ghostly figure who calls herself Beloved arrives at #124, shortly after Paul D., Morrison creates mystery and a heart-stoppingly tense atmosphere, when Beloved, too, moves in. As Beloved gradually takes over the household and seems to demand and then possess Sethe's soul, the sorrow which has burdened Sethe seems close to breaking her.<br /><br />The sadism of some slave-owners, the devices used to torture, and the desperate measures some slaves took to protect themselves and their loved ones come fully alive here, the horrors growing as the reader gradually discovers the real source of Sethe's torment.

This instance also relates to the theme in that it shows an experience that would rob the heart and round the personhood.

Morrison utilized imagery throughout the novel to form an image of the horror of slavery.  For example, Morrison compares Sethe's wounds to a chokecherry tree.

The plot follows Sethe, an escaped slave living in post civil war Ohio, with her daughter Denver. They are visited by one of Sethe's old friends, Paul D, and a stranger who goes by the name Beloved. Sethe is haunted daily by her past, which takes the form of a ghost, until Paul D arrives. When he comes to stay, every fear of Sethe vanishes until the arrival of Beloved, a mysterious girl who reminds Sethe of her dead daughter. As the plot progresses, Beloved slowly moves Paul D out of the house and then terrorizes Sethe and Denver. I enjoyed the ending of the novel; however, parts of the novel confused me.<br /><br />The most confusing part of the novel is Morrison has one of the characters named \\""Beloved\\"". She also uses a sentence, \\""Be loved\\"". \\""Beloved\\"" is when a person is greatly loved by or held in high regards by someone; however, to \\""be loved\\"" means to feel acceptance or closeness. Morrison also talks about various types of love in the novel; (1) a mother's love to her children, (2) the love of one's siblings, (3) the love that is shared between friends, and (4) the love felt between couples. Most people my age have yet experienced all these forms of love. This brings another question to mind, why would she mention all of these types of love when most people won't understand all of them? So with all of these thoughts of love in the novel, it is extremely difficult to pin down the meaning to Morrison's \\""Beloved\\"".<br /><br />There are many literary techniques used in Beloved; one of these is symbolism. There are several examples of this with words such as \\""tin can\\"" and \\""turtles\\"". A \\""tin can\\"" in someone's chest can be a harden heart. A \\""turtle\\"" has a hard shell, which can represent a shield or fortress, protection from the world.

I didn't particularly like the book, but Morrison really knows her craft.  She paints an intense picture in your head through strong imagery.

One moment you're in the present with Sethe talking to Denver and Beloved or Paul D; the next you're back at Sweet Home or in the middle of Sethe's escape from Sweet Home.  Later, you're back where you started.  The difficult part of the story line is that Morrison never clues you in on when she makes the switch.

She plays with many literary techniques like symbolism (Paul D's tin can), and allusion (Baby Suggs feeding the town), and uses them very well to control what and how much the reader knows.  Morrison is a very talented writer and I would read more of her books just to study her interesting, challenging, and thought-provoking style.<br /><br /> I would recommend reading this book for anyone, but especially those who like challenging stories which force you to think and take a step back and really look at life.  Morrison has a talent for bringing our attention to social inequities, and forcing us to come to terms with those and learn from the past.  Once again, an excellent book for anyone studying writing techniques.",2005-12-21

Ms. Morrison truly has the gift of confusion and she uses it to full advantage in her novel, Beloved.  The story centers around Sethe, an escaped slave who lives an outcast's life in her deceased mother-in-law's house (the aforementioned I24).  Her two companions in the beginning are Denver (her 18-year old daughter) and the \\""spiteful\\"" ghost of her murdered \\""crawling-already\\"" baby.  Paul D., a fellow ex-slave from the \\""wonderful\\"" Sweet Home plantation shows up, forces Sethe to remember her ugly past, and chases the ghost out.  Everything seems peachy until Beloved, an unlined young woman with a thirst for stories, shows up.  She hungers for Sethe's attention and despises Paul D.  Denver finds something to care for and call her own in Beloved.  The tentative happiness ends when Paul D. finds out about Sethe's dark secret which has kept so many away from I24.<br /><br /> This book is full of symbols.  The dominant symbol is water, which can represent rebirth, baptism, and cleansing.  Beloved speaks of looking through the water at Sethe on multiple occasions and Beloved \\""came from the river\\"".  Beloved can be a symbol because she represents Sethe's unwelcome memories.  Beloved makes it easier for Sethe to speak of her past and face it.  Beloved also speaks in her chapter of turtles (protection or shields), men without skin (whites), teeth (which can have many meanings, the darkest of which is the teeth of a saw), and the \\""hot thing\\"" which could be anything from love to blood.  This is one of the good aspects of this novel.  You have to grow up and realize that the author won't spoon-feed the entire story to you.  It forces you to think outside of the box and question every single sentence and character.  After all, if the event/person/thing didn't have any significance would Ms. Morrison include her/him/it in her novel?<br /><br /> I enjoyed this book on a simple level.  Beloved has a very entertaining storyline, especially with its supernatural layer.  However, once I tried to figure out what was going on between the lines and what every word could mean, it became more confusing.  I'm the type of person who has to know I'm right.  I'm not comfortable guessing something and being content with my assumption.  It helps to read this book with another person so that you can bounce your ideas off of each other and draw from your own experiences and beliefs to shape your interpretation of the novel.

Are there actually women who would do such a thing? The 20th century novel BELOVED, written by Toni Morrison, tells exactly how one emotionally unstable mother did just that. The only question left to ask is, \\""How could she do it?\\"".<br /><br />Sethe's reasons for putting a saw to her daughter's neck introduce one of the main themes of this story-a mother's love. Morrison emphasizes Sethe's reasons for killing her daughter to be an act of love. But how much love is too much? When does a mother's love get too thick? The conversation between Sethe and Paul D about love barely justifies what Sethe did, but it is still difficult to agree with Sethe's thoughtless actions. Sethe's love is what you call \\""corrupted\\"" love! Each person is entitled to live his/her own life, and should not be stripped of that right. Love is all a person needs-but to be loved is one thing; to be overloved is another. And too much love is obviously deadly.<br /><br /> In answer to the question, \\""How could she do it?\\"" one must be satisfied with the simple answer of, \\""She loved her\\"". There is no other explanation. Whether it was moral or right is up to you to decide. If Morrison's theme is one you would take pleasure in reading about, dive in and start reading!

This story takes place in rustic Ohio, a short time after the Civil War, so the tension between blacks and whites is still very fierce.  You are introduced to Sethe, an escaped slave, who has a haunting past, a past that won't let her forget, even though she tries so hard to not remember.  Denver, her daughter, is her only comfort until an old friend from Sweet Home, Paul D, appears.  Even the presence of these two people in her life won't keep her haunting past at bay.  Sethe committed the unforgivable; she killed her own daughter to keep her out of slavery.  Now the dead daughter, Beloved, is back; not in the form of an unseen presence, but as a physical being.  The chaos her attendance would bring, would greatly change the lives of those close to Sethe.<br /><br />  I found this story to be very confusing.  Toni Morrison would never tell you straight up what she meant, but rather dropped hints and left you to draw your own conclusions.  There is no doubt she is a very skilled writer for her use of allusions and symbols are greatly admired.  At the beginning of chapter 16 she makes an allusion to the four horsemen from Revelations.  Why she chose to make a reference to them at this point was ambiguous.  A symbol of Morrison's that had a lot of meaning was the \\""tin can\\"" of Paul D.  This symbolized his heart, which he felt could never be opened again to feelings.  Simple words like \\""teeth\\"" or \\""a hot thing\\"" could have multiple meanings, and it was up to you to determine what each really meant.  It's her style to let the reader experience the story from the Sethe's point of view which leads to much confusion.  If you had no prior knowledge of what happened to Beloved, you wouldn't understand why her returning as a ghost was so significant in the beginning.  It wasn't only the fact she waited to reveal things until a later time in the story, it was also her means of telling the story.  As the reader you aren't constantly moving forward to the future happenings, but you're exposed to memories of the past.  The line between reality and a memory was very blurred, causing the reader to have to look back to gain a better understanding.  As for a recommendation on whether or not to read this story it depends on what kind of person you are.  If you are like me, and have an analytical mind, you will have a hard time enjoying this story.  I like things to be black or white; everything presented straight forward, and no questions about it.  This meant I didn't catch many of the symbols or allusions the first time around.  I had to reread pieces before it started to make any sense.  Once I recognized the symbols or allusions I was unsure of what they stood for.  I couldn't be definite about their significance to the story, and this left me questioning many things.

Sethe, a bold young black slave escapes a plantation that is aesthetically pleasing, but beneath the superficial beauty, there is a terrible and devastating history. This history haunts Sethe as she runs from the plantation and attempts to start afresh, but can't seem to escape the heavy burden of memory.<br /><br /> This novel, if read critically, contains a powerful and innovative message. If a reader is to further explore this novel, he or she may discover an underlying theme often missed by the casual reader. The first thing a critical reader views upon opening the novel is the dedication. Morrison writes, \\""Sixty million and more\\"". Her wording is interesting. It is as though she is not attempting to be sentimental or overly romantic. She does not implicitly state, \\""In memory of\\"", or even \\""Dedicated to\\"", but she simply states the number. One can assume that this is a dedication but question who the sixty million or more are? As one familiarizes themselves with Morrison it is possible that she dedicates the book to the sixty million or more that die in the middle passage, or perhaps all slaves that died. But what does this number mean to a reader. Critics have thought that she is competing with other horrible acts against humanity. Perhaps Morrison is trying to find a seat among the sufferers of the Holocaust or those the victims of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Wouldn't one assume that slavery is among the atrocities listed before? I don't believe so because this is the first encounter I have ever had with a death toll. By presenting a number, Morrison validates slavery as legitimately among the others. Usually one associates the level of \\""horrible\\"" by the number of people that suffered. By never stating a number for those that died or suffered in slavery, the inhumanity can never be included among the \\""greatest acts against humanity\\"". Morrison smartly eases the issue into the museum of \\""fantastic and horrible events in humanity\\"" and creates the story of the suffering of one slave.<br /><br /> If a reader is looking for another sad story of slavery, this book will do the job. It is complete with eerie haunting, flashbacks of the life on the plantation, love, and a younger generation that doesn't seem to understand, which are all components of a successful \\""slave rememberence novel\\"". However, if a reader desires a fresh idea, or a stronger more thoughtful depiction and understanding of the sufferings of slavery, a critical reader will find this to be powerful and unsettling.

In fact, her memories seem to become embodied in a mysterious woman who calls herself Beloved. No one is entirely sure of who Beloved is.

You may feel as if you know a character because their emotions, actions, and responses to events are similar to the people around us everyday. Sethe, a hard working mother, portrays mothers today with a strong love for her children.  The children she loves so much are Denver and Beloved, with Beloved being the spirit of her dead baby.  Sethe and Denver live in 124, a house in rural Ohio.  At the start of the book \\""124 was spiteful\\"", but then it became loud and in the ending it was quiet. When \\""124 was spiteful\\"" Sethe and Denver lived alone in the house, except for the presence of Beloved who was Sethe's dead baby. Beloved comes back and makes life difficult for the family.  In the end she mysteriously leaves and  Sethe along with Denver feel as if Beloved hadn't actually been there.  Beloved is a very difficult book to read, time changes, symbols and dialogue make comprehending a not so easy task.<br /><br /> Time changes occur throughout the book and at times you may not know what is going on because it is so abrupt.  The first time change you see is in chapter one when Sethe is talking to Denver about the spirit. It then jumps to when Sethe was having a man engrave the name of her baby on the headstone which was a past memory. From chapter 14 to 15 there was a major time change. It starts with Beloved crying to Denver, then goes to Baby Suggs taking care of Sethe's beat up body when she came to 124 with newborn Denver. The gap between those two events was about 18 years. Time changes make it confusing as to when the events actually happened, because some time shifts are short and in the middle of an event going on in the story.<br /><br /> Symbols contribute greatly to the difficulty of the reading, because not knowing what they mean can lead you to different conclusions about an event.  When you hear \\""tin can\\"" you think of a metal can not a persons heart.  The old rusted tin can referred to Paul D's heart and how he thought it would never be opened to reveal  his past memories and inner feelings. Another symbol was \\""men without skin\\"", you can imagine just what it says, a man without any skin. It is actually Morrison's choice of words to say, white men.  \\""Men without skin\\"" comes about because Beloved thinks African-Americans are people with skin and the whites were people without skin due to their color.<br /><br /> Dialogue like \\""men without skin\\"" makes comprehending the story even harder than it already is.  \\""Rememory\\"", and \\""thought picture\\"" are words Morrison uses to mean simple things. \\""Rememory\\"" is Sethe's word for remembering the past and \\""thought picture\\"" is the image Sethe has of certain past events or maybe even dreams. The word choice in Morrison's work is crucial to the tone of the story, but it also brings confusion.<br /><br /> Time changes, symbols, and dialogue all contribute to the difficulty of reading Beloved.  It is hard to understand if you don't know the meaning of the symbols and get lost in a multitude of time changes.  Morrison definitely has a unique style of writing which brings out the life in the story. If anybody else wrote the story it wouldn't have the same effect Morrison has on her readers. Would I recommend this book to people? Well if you are the type of person who gets frustrated easily with a play on words, and you don't catch on to symbols, this book is not for you. If you are the type of person who enjoys reading a story with twists, and a much deeper meaning, this book is definitely for you. Overall Beloved is an interesting story with twists and turns which could take you on an unforgettable journey.an\\"" you think of a metal can not a persons heart.

Remembering the past is a thing some do not want to face.<br /><br />This is the challenge that Sethe and Paul D have to face in Toni Morrison's Beloved, awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for Fiction.<br /><br />Set in the late 1800s in rural Ohio, shortly after the slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, Beloved is a novel about Sethe, a former slave who once worked at a slave plantation known as Sweet Home.  Along with her daughter Denver, the two women reside at 124, a home haunted by the ghost of Sethe's murdered infant child.  Paul D, another ex-slave from the Sweet Home plantation, visits Sethe at 124.  It is he who forces Sethe to look back at her past experiences and reveal the secrets hidden within her.  One day, a young woman named Beloved arrives at Sethe's home.  Believed to be the embodied spirit of the dead child, Beloved's arrival causes chaos at 124.  In her own way, Morrison causes chaos in the mind of the reader.<br /><br />Many argue that Beloved is confusing and was not pleasurable to read, and I agree.  But this is why Morrison is so effective in Beloved: she allows the reader to experience the flashbacks (known as \\""rememory\\"") and the pain at the same time the characters are going through them in the novel.  I have yet to read another novel that can make the reader suffer as much as the characters do.<br /><br />Morrison varies her style of writing throughout the book to emphasize the thoughts of a certain character in Beloved.  Although most of the novel is written in the third-person view, Morrison writes as Sethe, Denver, and Beloved in these \\""stream-of-consciousness\\"" chapters.  Sethe's lack of education is easily seen as she rambles on.  Denver, on the other hand, seems to be an intellectual young woman who seeks to protect the loved ones she has.  Beloved's erratic and haunting section adds to her mysterious appearance.<br /><br />While reading Beloved, one must ask his or herself, \\""is Morrison racist?\\""  There are many instances which hint Morrison is attempting to degrade the white race.  Take schoolteacher, for instance.  The name \\""schoolteacher\\"" is not capitalized.  Morrison implies that schoolteacher does not deserve respect and is low in social status, but his actions in the book prove otherwise.  \\""Men without skin,\\"" a reoccurring image from the character Beloved, also refers to whites as being inferior to the blacks.  Morrison speaks to the reader as if whites are void of life.<br /><br />Beloved is a well-written novel that reveals the physical and emotional torture slaves had to endure, even long after their release from captivity.  However, Morrison's graphic, detailed descriptions of horrific events may be sickening to the stomach for some readers.  I was not fond of having to visualize human beings sodomizing cows, nor women bashing their own baby's head against a solid wall.  Just for Morrison's magic in delivering this story to the reader, I recommend Beloved for most readers (some may be offended by the graphic images and themes in this novel)./>While reading Beloved, one must ask his or herself, \\""is Morrison racist?\\""  There are many instances which hint Morrison is attempting to degrade the white race.

She is faced with the reality of how cruel,yet understood that killing her infant daughter was. She also tries to put her past at Sweet Home to rest. But simply can't bacause she has been scared so badly from her experiences that she has come to think of the one on her back as a chokecherry tree with different branches. As her daughter Denver is presented with some suspicious evidence, she then puts all the pieces together that would eventually lead up to the explaining of who the baby ghost was. She was indeed the ghost of the girl whom walked out of water from over there. Her sister Beloved. As Denver wanted to keep the secret dark and unknown, Beloved had other plans. She intruded in their house and came back for her family. As the story was brought to a close, it all made since to me why such actions had taken place.

And upon reading the opening chapter, the reader will be rendered confused, moved, horrified, and gripped in six or seven pages of fantastic writing. It is impossible to really say that \\""Beloved\\"" is the tale of the ghost of a baby, embittered and vengeful, or \\""Beloved\\"" is the tale of Sethe, an ill-treated black woman who is too afraid to \\""go inside\\"" and face her past. No. \\""Beloved\\"" is none of these. In fact, Morrison's novel (if indeed it can be called a \\""novel\\"") is written in such a way that it cannot be described as one story. It is a collection of memories, \\""rememories\\"", and haunting images, collectively compilled to create a harrowing reminder to the people of today that the slave trade must NOT be forgotten. It must be remembered.<br /><br />But to remember is to move on. And to move on is to forget.<br /><br />\\""This was not a story to pass on...this is not a story to pass on.\\""<br /><br />Morrison's non-linear narrative style plunges the reader into a world of memory. The book is non-chronological and therefore more than a little confusing to begin with, but, on delving deeper into the secrets of Sethe's past, the supressed memories of darker times are slowly uncovered. Aided by impressive language techniques and a unique style of writing, Morrison proceeds to break down the genre of \\""Slavery\\"" writing and creates a new, ingenious type of story. By combining the historical elements of a novel about black slavery and the chilling, spine-tingling terrors of a ghost story, Morrison draws the reader in hungrilly, thirsting for our attention and causing us to thirst for more...just as Beloved thirsts for Sethe, acceptance...and revenge.<br /><br />\\""Beloved\\"" is more than a book.

It makes the point that slaves were not expected to have human emotions - especially love. Many times the characters tell of families split up, children lost, until they become afraid to love anything at all, except inanimate things that won't disappear (a tree, in the case of Paul D, a former slave). The book also talks about self-love, self-esteem and worth, which was denied them as well. Paul D oftens muses what it means to be a &quot;real man&quot;.<br />The theme is illustrated in the actions of Sethe, a slave who has run away with her four children. She has been able to keep each one since birth, nurture it and love it. She loves them with all the more intensity because she herself has never really known the love of another person or love of herself. So when the slave catchers eventually track her down, she makes a drastic decision. Sethe knows that her children face emotional death at the hands of the white man, and she decides physical death would be kinder. She kills one of her toddlers &quot;out of love&quot;.<br />This theme certainly got me thinking, as I believe it was true and valuable. But when I stepped back from the book, what bothered me about it was the way it was delivered. The undertone seemed to be dogmatic, intended to arouse shame rather than sympathy or understanding. Reading between the lines, I felt like an ignorant child that was being reproved and educated. The author assumed I was apathetic and ill-informed about what happened during the time of slavery in America, and therefore needed pointing in the right direction. So I found the presentation of the theme a little patronising.<br />Also, the writing was on occasion confusing. Sometimes you had no idea who or what was being referred to, as Ms Morrison tried too hard to sound literary and symbolic. The characters, I felt, were little more than manequins on which to drape the book's message (can't spell, I know). They aroused no emotion in me at all - you would think sympathy for Beloved, killed at the hands of her mother, or for Sethe, forced to make the decision she did. Nope. Not at all. So read this book for the thought-provoking theme, but be prepared to be left feeling a little flat.son tried too hard to sound literary and symbolic.

As I read through it, I started thinking to myself, this is one of the best stories that I've ever read.  At first, I didn't think that it would be worth my time to read the book, but the more I read, the better it became.<br />Beloved is the story of a freed slave named Sethe who has had one of the roughest lives imaginable.  The theme of slavery already made me feel a need to explore the tale.  From what I know about slaves and their lives in the past, I wondered what this woman's story would be like.  What could have happened to this slave to make her life story different from all of the others that suffered the same fate as she did?<br />I soon found out what makes this story so unique.  Sethe's troubles come from her past, which haunts her.  She runs away from her master and takes her three children with her; another one is born on the way.  After experiencing a small taste of freedom, her fears suddenly return when she is found.  In order to keep her children from experiencing the same plague of slavery as she had, she takes matters into her own hands and decides to kill them.  Now, in the present, the ghost of the one daughter she managed to kill haunts her house causing her youngest child Denver and her to live in seclusion.  They have no choice but to live in the haunted house, which no one in the neighborhood dares to go near.<br />Symbolism is one of the tools most used in the novel by the author.  Morrison uses it to tell two stories at once.  The literal meaning shows the reader the story of Sethe, the brutal memories of her past, and how it effects the people around her.  At the same time, the alternate meaning being presented includes the evils of slavery and the injustice done to the blacks by the whites.  Although the past lives of the characters include slavery, the story is mostly about their present lives and the choices they've made in the past.  An example of this is clearly seen in the fact that Sethe killed her child to keep her from becoming a slave.<br />The novel is excellent.  Beloved is unlike any story you've ever read.  It gives you a better understanding of slavery and discusses gender and racial issues.  I liked it because of the author's unique style of writing.

There are explicit and offensive scenes throughout the book. I was appalled by the graphics and I pained me to have to continue the book. This is the main cause that I felt this book is for only the mature. I was constantly squirming at the pictures that had been created in my minds eye. It is a book filled with anger, hate, sex, violence, and offensive language. (How much more like a rated R movie can you get?)<br />The book is about a freed slave woman and her family. Sethe, the main character has to deal with the memories of her past and live with the choices she's made.<br />A plot that was as twisted and confusing as the labyrinth but unfolded to somewhat of being understandable was impressive. From the on set you are set in confusion. The complex plot was, at times frustrating. There were many random flashbacks and sometimes you dont know if its a flashback or not. It was a puzzle that was scattered out and ever so slowly, piece by piece it all came back together in the end. It was very intriguing in that sense, but frustrating because I was constantly going back to find out what was going on, and only when I had gone back did pervious things make sense. The author traps you in her sticky web where you are disgusted and would throw the book away but yet curious to see what will happen next.<br />The book has controversial themes to it, which are always mature topics. Some of the many themes that are encountered are: the supernatural, slavery, women's rights, prejudices with blacks and whites. Hot topics like these are difficult for the younger ones to comprehend.<br />With all these things bombarding me I felt like my poor brain would explode from all the pressure.<br />All in all I felt that it was a really well written book. The author allowed me to be apart of the story and to get in to it even though I didn't care for the content or to be apart of the story.

The images of brutality and prejudice are extremely intense, often distasteful, but what really shows you the dehumanizing aspects of slavery are the effects that it has on her characters.  The most chilling example is of course Sethe, who kills her infant daughter with a saw to keep her from being brought into slavery.  Many people say that this act was inexcusable, and in a way it was, but this only underlines the fact that we cannot ever fully comprehend what slavery was like.  The fact that a mother would kill her own daughter in order to keep her from slavery shows that it must truly be horrible, and, though you may never be able to reconcile yourself with that act, Morison's book may be the closest you get to understanding the experience of belonging to another human being.<br />The story rotates around Sethe, an ex-slave from a plantation called Sweet Home, her daughter Denver, and Paul D, another ex-slave from Sweet Home.  These characters are all affected by the ghost of the child Sethe killed, and her manifestation, Beloved. T Supernatural phenomena are an integral part of the book, and the characters accept these as normal, never questioning their existence.<br />The characters trigger frequent flashbacks in each other, and much of the background is laid in this manner, the story coming together like a puzzle as the  details supplied by each \\""rememory\\"" fall into place.  \\""Rememory\\"" and \\""thought-picture\\"" are good examples of the way that Morrison uses language to enrich the experience of reading the book.

Morrison uses powerful words of imagery so that the reader can empathize with the horrible treatment of slaves.  In this book, the main characters are haunted by their past lives of slavery.  The dehumanization leaves the reader with an unsettling feeling.<br />Morrison also uses a lot of racist slurs and ideas in this novel, to implement the idea that slaves were property.  Slaves were called [derogitory names ] and treated like creatures.  Due to all of the racial slurs and ideas in this book, it would be easy to generate the assumption of Morrison being racist; however, she uses racial slurs and ideas to present a historical view into the actual conditions of slavery before and after the Civil War.<br />Although the reader may be repulsed by certain parts of the novel, this repulsion is necessary.  Morrison does an excellent job of writing a novel that greatly impacts its readers.  The novel is very educational in a historical sense.  The words and imagery in this novel force people to look for racism in their own lives, just like the characters in Beloved who were forced to deal with the effects of racism in their lives.",2003-12-12

But without these scenes and images that portray all the horrors of slavery, the story is incomplete and not as powerful. If the story lacked these scenes and images, it would make the resurrection of Beloved less believable and not as creepy. It would also make it harder for the reader to understand why Sethe could have possibly wanted to kill her children to keep them from a life of slavery.  Slavery is awful, but doesn't seem that bad until you read about the chained black slaves who, when faced with the decision of performing oral sex on white guards, chose a bullet in their brain instead. Or, when slave owners used females slaves as breeders.  Still, with all of the horrible images that Morrison provides, infanticide is probably the most shocking, although other scenes make it less horrific.  Many readers are turned off or insulted by the author's graphic, offensive, and obscene incidents.<br /> Readers learn about Sethe's disturbingly graphic and tragic past. Sethe has had to let a stranger use her body in exchange for some letters on a headstone. She has had her own milk stolen from her. She has been beaten until her back has split open. She has been so scarred by the horror of slavery that she felt killing her own children would be better then letting them live in slavery.  Not only Sethe has had to go through with these atrocities. Her mother has been hanged, and her fellow slaves beaten, raped, tortured, murdered and burned alive. Everyone around her has been affected, as black men, women, and children all suffer because of their skin color.<br />Readers are drawn in as Sethe's past comes back to haunt her, and as the pieces of the story click together.  The story is constantly delving into her and other character's thoughts, feelings, and pasts, and then resurfacing in the character's present time, and although this may be a little confusing or overwhelming, Morrison is able to relate the character's experiences of the past with the character's actions and decisions of the present.<br />I don't recommend this book for the easily offended or immature reader.

The images she created were often distasteful and took away from the impact the story had on me. I believe the author intended to provoke mixed emotions and mixed reactions. If this is so, she succeeded. However, Morrison failed to get her point to the reader. She suggests many things, but never displays the courage to express what she is really trying to say. She was inconsistent in her opinion towards white people. She portrayed whites as cruel and evil at times, and at other times had her characters express gratitude towards them.<br />Beloved was a good book, but not a good story.

With such powerful topics to cover, one question is asked:  Is Morrison pushing her book too far?<br />  Obviously, slavery is a major issue in \\""Beloved\\"".  Set in the Civil War era, in a time where slavery plagues American life and Black people are made to feel its wrath at the hands of white people simply because of skin color,  \\""Beloved\\"" revolves around Sethe, a Black mother who, while fleeing from a life of slavery, becomes pregnant.  Not wanting her newborn daughter to have to endure the horrors of slavery, Sethe does what she feels is the right thing and kills her, believing that even death is preferable to a life of slavery.<br />  Life is the issue at this point.  A question that still is being asked today is \\""Who has the right to life?\\""  Does a baby have the right to make his or her own choices, even though they aren't clear, or should adults be able to make those choices?<br />  Another critical issue is the role gender plays in the story.  With men being portrayed as being passive in the face of injustice, as when Halle, Sethe's husband, does nothing to prevent her from being raped by white boys, or ovely agressive, as when Paul D., a former slave, pushes Sethe to remember her past and not just to forget it, and women being portrayed as caring, as is the case of Sethe's mother-in-law Baby Suggs, who devotes her life to aiding those coping with slavery, or the case of Amy Denver, who, though despite being White, aids Sethe in giving birth to Denver, is Morrison trying to reverse the role of the sexes to strike back at sexism, or is she only trying to reverse the cycle of sexism by lifting women up and cuting men down.<br />  Lastly, with the story told from the perspective of the slave rather than that of the master, the reader is able to witness the evils of slavery.  Again, controversey arises.  Is Morrison using the story as a realistic satire in hopes of alreting people to the harshness of racism, or is she, with the use of anti-White language and imagery, trying to lift up Black status by cutting down White people?<br />  In closing, no one can doubt the power of \\""Beloved\\"", but much can be said and debated over how that power is used.s.

Having confessed that, I would now like to say thank God I am not a critic because they often have terrible taste, as is the case with this particular novel. It is simply unoriginal.<br />First I was disgusted by the grotesque episodes, but gradually decided they were excusable considering the fact that slavery and everything that came with it was absolutely horrendous. Then I thought I enjoyed Morrison's writing style; it seemed unique, poetic, and not at all as difficult as some make it out to be. The seemingly random flashbacks add to the theme of &quot;rememories.&quot; After a while, though, the style became tiring, even silly. The chapters that appear to be narrated by Beloved are irritating rather then touching, the sudden shifts to stream-of-consciousness are abrupt and unexcused, and most vexing of all is Morrison's lack of point. She obviously has many themes running through the story but does not make any new statements, and everything is stated in an overly dramatized manner. Take, for example, the entity Beloved. Without technically affirming Beloved's identity as that of the murdered little girl, Morrison piles on hint after blatant hint; they become, not merely repetitive, but an insult to the intelligence of the reader. &quot;I get it: Beloved is the crawling already? baby! now please get on with it!&quot; And yet she still tries to make it mysterious by insinuating that Beloved's appearance may be interpreted as a freakish coincidence.<br />I am sure that there is much more meaning in this novel than I have extracted so far, but since just about every sentence seems to be open for interpretation, isn't the reader practically making up the meaning for himself? Why can't Morrison just SAY something? Her symbols (Paul D's &quot;tobacco tin&quot; and \\""red heart\\"" - come on now) are often so unexplained and, well, banal, that I want to laugh. I refrain, however, because I am still a lowly teenager and, though I consider myself well-read, I must also be extremely dense to miss whatever sensational and \\""shattering\\"" message was supposed to be conveyed through Beloved.

That book is Toni Morrison's &quot;Beloved.&quot; This may seem like a lofty placement for a novel written less than 20 years ago, but people were calling &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; the greatest movie ever made only 20 years after its release, and we think that's okay too. Put simply, &quot;Beloved&quot; explores a theme that many books hardly dare to touch (maybe because of how much it scares their authors...) - the notion that our past is something that is completely inexcapable. Morrison could have easily expounded upon this idea in a thoughtful essay or short story, but instead she brings us the sprawling, complex, and beautifully rendered &quot;Beloved.&quot; That theme that runs through her wonderful novel is the main thing that stays with you after reading it, but for me the things about &quot;Beloved&quot; that still haunt me are the little moments: Paul D caressing his hands gently over Sethe's mangled back, Whitegirl massaging Sethe's feet back to life, the shadows holding hands on the way to the carnival. In a magnificent stroke, Morrison brings the emotional truth and point of her novel not through vast lines that stretch through the narrative, but through little &quot;smashed mirror&quot;-type moments and flashbacks that combine to form the final product. &quot;Beloved&quot; is fantastic as a collective experience, but reading the novel entails not just the psychological and emotional journey of its characters, but of the reader. Few books out there have such a devastating emotional impact as this one, and that lies within certain sentences, words, and moments that Morrison expertly crafts. You don't have to be African-American or a woman to enjoy this book - I'm an 18 year old white male and felt it meant as much to me as it would to an African American grown woman. That's the great thing about &quot;Beloved&quot; and all of Morrison's works (read them all- she hasn't written a bad one yet) - one needs not to match the characteristics of their protagonists, but simply be a member of the human race.

Sethe's past haunts her and forbids her from ever leading a &quot;normal&quot; life.  Ever since Sethe escaped slavery she and her daughter Denver have been trying to live a &quot;normal&quot; life in Ohio. Many years earlier Sethe murdered one of her children,a girl, so that the child would not be sold into slavery. In the house that Sethe and her daughter live in a ghost disrupts thier lives. Sethe and Denver believe that that ghost is Sethe's murdered child.  Later in the story, a young woman shows up at Sethe and Denver's home.  The young woman goes by the name of Beloved. Sethe and Denver take in the young woman and she stays with them.  It is not until later in the story that Denver figures out who the girl is, but she does not know exactly what the young woman wants.  The girl causes many disrupptions in the household.

This novel is based upon a true story of infanticide and slavery. This book is full of gothic elements and acts of terrible violence. Sethe's present and past have caused her to be abandoned by the community. Sethe escaped from the farm \\""Sweet Home\\"" with her four children, but after only twenty- eight days of freedom she was captured by her old master. Rather than allowing her children to be returned to slavery she attempted to kill all of them, succeeding only in killing the baby girl \\""Beloved\\"". After her master decided that she was no longer fit to serve, Sethe was released to raise her three remaining children at 124. Beloved's ghost began to haunt the house causing Sethe's to sons to flee after encounters with the ghost. Sethe's busy career as a cook didn't allow her to spend time with her daughter Denver. Denver the only one left in the house is eighteen years old and terribly afraid to even get up enough courage to leave the yard. All of the characters of this novel, are former slaves, children of former slaves, and suffer a troubled relationship to their own past.  Morrison does an excellent job in portraying the trials and tribulations of slavery shortly after the Civil War. Toni Morrison's realistic venture through slavery in this book has definitely made it a masterpiece of its time and history as well.",2003-05-16

Sethe's past haunts her and forbids her from ever leading a &quot;normal&quot; life.  Ever since Sethe escaped slavery she and her daughter Denver have been trying to live a &quot;normal&quot; life in Ohio. Many years earlier Sethe murdered one of her children, a girl, so that the child would not be sold into slavery. In the house that Sethe and her daughter live in a ghost disrupts their lives. Sethe and Denver believe that that ghost is Sethe's murdered child.  Later in the story, a young woman shows up at Sethe and Denver's home.  The young woman goes by the name of Beloved. Sethe and Denver take in the young woman and she stays with them.  It is not until later in the story that Denver figures out who the girl is, but she does not know exactly what the young woman wants.  The girl causes many disruptions in the household. Sethe's past is mainly told through flashbacks that take place throughout the novel.  Toni Morrison avoided using &quot;flowery&quot; words  to describe events in Sethe's life.

What they fail to realise is that the Africans of that time believed and accepted spiritual occurrences and so the ghosts were part of everyday life..<br />  Beloved is packed with symbolism and metaphors. This is what makes it such a challenging read because the reader can never let their guard down, or else they might miss out on valuable and subtle clues about the characters' pasts.<br /> One example of the use of symbolism by Morrison is the house 124. To all the characters, it did not feel like just a house or a structure to live in. It was a person by its own right and meant different things to different characters. Denver approached the house, regarding it, as she always did, as a person rather than a structure. A person that wept, sighed trembled and fell into fits. (Page 29)<br />  To many runaway slaves, 124 was their first taste of freedom after a life full of the horrors of slavery. To townsfolk, it was a place not only of childhood memories, but also of the murder of \\""Beloved\\"" and Sethe's craziness.<br />  To Baby Suggs, it was her first house that came at a hard price. It was a place where no one was allowed to come from the back door. Everyone was welcome to come and stay. It was the first place in which she was truly free, where she could block memories of slavery. (Slaves were forced to come from the backdoor of a white person's house, which is why Baby Suggs blocked the backdoor)<br />  To Sethe, it was two things. She believed it was her freedom. By shutting the front door, which had remained open to outsiders and the neighbourhood when 124 was at its hey-day, she had shut herself away from the world. It was her first ever house and that was significant to her. I think Sethe's the kind of person who needs something to show milestones in her life. For example, when she married Halle, she really wanted a proper marriage and as that was not possible, she made a dress on the sly. It was important to her that there was something to affirm this marriage. Similarly, I think that as the dress was important to her, the house must have been too, which might be one of the reasons that she was so adamant that she wouldnt leave it. It was her first taste of freedom and the first time she was able to feel secure, away from white people.<br />  124 was a form of repression for Denver, who yearned to be loved and enjoy the companies of people outside of the house.<br />  As you can see, there is more to the house than meets the eye, and this is just one of many examples of how Morrison uses symbolism to get her message across and to help you form your opinion about the characters. You just have to have the patience and the time.<br />  Who do i recommend this book to? It is not an easy book, so i do not have an easy answer. Mainly, i would recommend that this novel be discussed in a group, because sometimes you might miss out on an important detail that another person might have picked up..<br />I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a quick read or anyone who does not want to learn the truth about slavery. It IS grotesque in many places and touches many tabboo subjects.<br />However, I would recommend it to mature readers who like a challenge and who are willing to be immersed in a novel.<br />  So I really hope that you read it because it rewards you in the end. It is a captivating novel if you allow it to be.. Take your time and let the novel speak for itself.and let the novel speak for itself.",2003-05-11

Powerful, evocative, painful, and beautiful","Beloved, Toni Morrison's beloved Pulitzer Prize-winning story of the south about one woman's life during the years on both sides of the Civil War, sucks readers in and doesn't spit them out till it's good and ready. Mesmerizing style of writing with the story-line weaving in and out, back and forth through time and location. That loose time thread sometimes makes for confusion in the reader's mind - as indeed it confuses Sethe, the protagonist with a deep dark secret that loosened the anchors of her mind.<br />The story begins with hints (well, more than hints) of a dead child, a ghost, a runaway slave, and all the horrors associated with those issues. But the writing, Oh, the writing! It reads like poetry, words wrapping around images, caressing them from all angles, shaping them like wet river clay into the precise phrases needed to reshape the structure and flow of the story.<br />Parts are so graphic that it becomes difficult to continue reading; parts are so touching that rereading is desired; parts are so lyrical that they just flow along like a slow, sultry river in Louisiana<br />And most readers don't quite see the end coming till it's right upon them. There are a bazillion hints as to what's really behind Sethe's often inexplicable words and actions and memories, but they are leaked out one by one, like slow drips from a leaky faucet.

I felt the story was too brilliant, uncomfortable, symbolic, just plainly TOO DEEP for the majority of people. But that's ok, that's what makes \\""Beloved\\"" what it is. Unique. This book took my breath away. Pure genius. Dark genius.<br />Who am I? 44 yr. old white female surrealist artist (full time), loves history, classics, Jung, mythology, and science for non- scientists. Live in Fells Point, Baltimore. Believes in reincarnation. This is the general picture of where I'm coming from.<br />I enjoy black history. I don't get defensive about the slavery thing because I'm certain we all are, have been and will be, many things. Back then the only people on the entire planet who weren't cruel were Quakers and Tibetan monks. We are now becoming civilized because of a combination of education and mass-media communications which can breed empathy. So stepping into these characters heads that existed in those circumstances in that culture at that point in time is completely interesting to me. Then, to have this deep, beautiful, hideous, haunting story take me on this journey that I couldn't have dreamed of myself was a privilege.<br />I believe it's important to consider parts of the story as a manifestation of the symbolic, not just simply viewed as a fantasy. The daughter comes into her life from somewhere;ie,  the daughter  \\""haunts\\"" her. The daughter's character has sex with Paul; symbolically, the daughter (the murder of the daughter) haunts Sethe to the point that the daughter even \\""comes (psychologically) between them\\"" in bed. What the author has done is have these characters act out the symbolic events in physical form. This realization makes everything deeper, more interesting, and really creates new questions with no answers. This is not something of interest to people who want to have a fun read, seek escapism. You escape here into a kind of nightmare.<br />So yes, I recommend it to people that thrive on these kinds of things. But one thing I want to add, which was a touch of pure genius in the book, without giving the whole thing away; on the last page, if you have come this far, you have been deep into these characters, have gotten to know them, feel their pain.  Then Tony Morrison wings that description, that physical detail at your head, knowing if it was even mentioned earlier it would have tainted most people's ability  to empathize with this character. Most people would have mentally compartmentalized the character in a kind of \\""freak show\\"" category, allowing a person to dismiss the character because it would be so hard to imagine that character's particular plight. She doesn't let you get away with it. If you have come this far, you have been there with the character the whole time. This master stoke was not acknowledged in the movie; it would have been almost impossible to present it visually, and one whole chunk of psychology was omitted and this is what makes the writing genius.

Slavery was a horrible crime against African Americans it is an important part of American history and should never be sugar coated. With that said I think that Ms. Morrison wanted to paint a picture that showed to true horrors of slavery; the worse form of human suffing imaginalbe. especially the psychological aspects.

I took an African American women history class in college and I know that there are factual accounts of slave women commiting infantcide but Ms. Morrisons horrible description of Sethe murdering her daughter as an alternative to having her taken back by the slavers that had abused her was too much.

It takes place shortly after the Civil War.  It is a story of slavery and love, and how they affect you.  Events in the story make you think about how hard life is for a black person.<br /> Sethe is one of the main characters in the story and she has a lot of things going on in her life.  She has had a hard life of slavery and memories that haunt her.  Sethe has a lot of emotions bottled up inside of her that she tries to forget, but she can't seem to let go of the past. She kills one of her children because she loved it so much. She thinks about her murdered daughter a lot. That event is one of the times when you have to ask yourself, was it out of love or was Sethe just crazy.<br /> Beloved comes back to life and that is when things really start to change.  Denver, Paul D, and Beloved admire Sehte.  Whenever Sethe Spends too much time with just one of them, the other two get jealous.  Sethe, Denver, and Paul D are suspicious about beloved.  One day Denver realizes that Beloved is her sister that Sehte murdered.  Later in the story Sehte slowly starts to realize that Beloved is her daughter and she gives up everything just to please Beloved.  Sethe get sick and weak because of all the sacrifices she makes for Beloved.  Sethe starts to forget about Denver so Denver goes out to get some help from people to try and save her mom.  One day beloved disappears and no one knows what happened to her.  You have to wonder to yourself, is Beloved real, or was she a ghost to get revenge on her mother for murdering her.<br /> The book is well written because sometimes while you are reading you can actually feel what a character is feeling.

She pushes them deep inside, and when they come up they shake Sethe and her family. Sethe lives in a house with her daughter in seclusion. They are separate from the outside world with only the ghost of Sethe's dead baby for company. This changes when Paul D., Sethe's old friend from Sweet Home, comes to stay with them. He chases the ghost away, and begins a family with Sethe and Denver. All is looking good until they find a young lady with baby-like skin who changes everything.<br />This book focuses on memory and tells things through flashback and remembrences.

The novel shows how hard a slave's life really was. The slaves suffered through so many hardships, such as losing family members, getting beaten-up, and for the females- being raped. Most of the whites treated slaves as if they weren't human at all, but rather a piece of property, which they could do what they pleased with. Luckily for Sethe and the \\""Sweet Home men\\"", their kind slave-owner, Mr. Garner treated them with respect, though it angered other slave-owning whites. Sethe and the \\""Sweet Home men\\"" did not realize how fortunate they were till Mr. Garner was gone. Their new slave-owner's cruelty caused Sethe and the \\""Sweet Home men\\"" to run away and pursue freedom. For many blacks that were slaves on a plantation in the south in the early 19th century, freedom was only a dream. A dream, which was wanted by all, but owned by few.<br />The novel has many twists and turns to it. The reader can never be quite sure what will happen next. When one of the \\""Sweet Home men\\"", Paul D, arrives at Sethe's house he overpowers the baby ghost who has been haunting the house for the past 18 years. That would seem to be the end of the baby ghost, but the next day the baby ghost shows up in flesh and blood, calling herself- Beloved. At first nobody realizes Beloved is the baby ghost as well as the crawling already baby. Denver is the first to discover Beloved's secret. It takes Sethe, Beloved's own mother, a few months to come upon the true identity of Beloved. By then Paul D has found out what Sethe did to her crawling-already baby and left. Once Sethe figures out who Beloved is, she is overjoyed because she can now spend time with both of her daughters. Each of the three girls- Sethe, Denver, and Beloved, enjoy happy fun filled times. They go ice-skating, stay up late talking, and Sethe cooks and eats with them. However the fun doesn't last. Sethe loses her job and they start to run out of food in the house. This food shortage combined with Sethe's failing health convinced Denver to go out into the real world to find help. Denver finds a job and brings food home, and then the neighbors come to help her get rid of the disease-causing Beloved. With Beloved gone, Paul D returns. Sethe, Denver, and Paul D become a family who have made it through the hard times, and now have a bright future in front of them.<br />Toni Morrison wanted her opinion on slaves to be heard, and it is heard clearly. The style she uses to express her opinion through her novel Beloved is loud and strong. She didn't like how white men treated blacks and especially black women back in the 19th century. She believes like I do, slavery was a very wrongdoing by the whites that lived in the United States. The slaves were treated worse than animals and had no rights at all.

Some of these detestable accounts include Paul D being forced to perform oral sex on white jail guards, and a pregnant Sethe being raped and nursed by her owner and being beaten so unmercifully that the cuts on her back resembled a Chokecherry Tree.<br /> This tree could also represent the family that Sethe longed to keep safe from slavery.  Sethe wanted to be the base of this tree, providing her children with the protection they needed and a foundation on which to start a new life of freedom.  She tried to keep her own children from slavery by killing them because she believed that what was in the next life was better then a life of slavery.<br /> After successfully killing her \\""crawling already\\"" daughter, her two sons Howard and Buglar run away.

The powerful story of a woman named Sethe, her loved ones, and the community definitely raises a few eyebrows with its daring contents and horrific scenes of brutality mixed with absolute love.

Love is dangerous in the house of 124 yet love is their only hope for a `family\\"" in the end.  <BR>The beginning of the novel was unmistakably disturbing.  It is possible; Morrison purposely made the story confusing in order to force the reader to take numerous pieces of a puzzle and assemble it to create something beautiful.  When I was in the process of reading Beloved, I could not help but question whether Toni was angry, racist, or cynical.  It is astonishing how a writer can take a well-known, well defined, subject and create a turbulent flow of question after question of the graphic treatment slaves encountered and how it influenced each character's behavior and personality disorders.  The mind behind such a daring masterpiece seems bold and again brings up questions of whether something may be wrong with her.   <br />Beloved is not a novel easily understood.  You are forced to use clues in her writing to realize the total effect of the plot.  Sethe's attempted murders of her children and actual murder of her daughter, exhibits the severe life of a slave which a mother could not bare, her children endure. Morrison writes scenes pertaining to current issues such as euthanasia and infanticide.  I could not help but examine whether Sethe's actions were understandable or psychotic.<BR>The novel Beloved can be viewed upon in many different ways and aspects.

Sethe and Denver lived alone and isolated in the condemned house until Paul D, who used to live at Sweet Home with Sethe, arrived at the house and scared the ghost off.  Finally it seemed like the characters could move on with their lives, but then a strange woman, who said her name was Beloved, appeared in their front yard and the characters were swept into a tidal wave of emotions dealing with their pasts.<br />Beloved is like the daughter Sethe thought she was protecting with murder, the sister and companion Denver never got to know, and the seductive young girl Paul D yearned for when he was living at Sweet Home.

Morrison has worked very hard in producing a well-written novel.<br />Beloved opens the story with the sentence,&quot;124 was spiteful.&quot;  124 is the house where Sethe and her daughter, Denver, live.  A baby ghost, Sethe's daughter who she killed, is haunting house 124.  Sethe, being a former slave wants nothing more then the best for her children.  In a flashback, we discover the many secrets that Sethe does not want to face and the hardships she has overcome.  She looks to a friend and lover named Paul D for comfort and advice.  Paul D serves as her confidant.  He is described as the type of guy women could cry to.  In the difficult days of slavery, Sethe sees the danger that her children are in if they grow up.  She wants to subdue their sufferings by taking their lives.  She is successful in taking the life of one of her daughters.  Beloved, a reincarnation of her dead daughter, comes to live with Sethe and allows her to deal with her past.<br />One of the major themes in this story is memory.

When her owner comes to find her and her children all she cares about is saving her children from slavery.  Trying to save her children, Sethe kills her oldest daughter.

With the use of metaphors, allusions, flashbacks, symbolism, folklore, magic, and mysticism Morrison's Beloved requires very deep thinking and forces you to take the time to comprehend everything you read.  The story line of the novel is very enjoyable, but some of the obscene language used and events described is almost enough to ruin the novel.  If you can get past all the vulgarity, Beloved is a great story about slavery, but if you cannot I would not suggest reading it.

The novel tries to explain the horrors of the institution of slavery, and the horrors that lived on long after slavery was dead.  This novel has a brilliant purpose, but that purpose is overshadowed by the vulgar and grotesque sexual actions constantly being displayed in the book.  The novel is about an ex- slave woman named Sethe, the protagonist of the novel, and her struggles to escape from slavery and keep her children from becoming slaves themselves. Later the hidden struggle between beloved, one of the antagonists of the novel, and Sethe emerges and is clear to the outside reader, while it is oblivious to the latter.<br />  The novel is set during the reconstruction era in a small town outside of Cincinnati, Ohio.  Through the use of flashbacks, brought on by Paul D, an old friend of Sethe's and another antagonist in the novel, the author lets us visit Sethe's past life and learn what she went through while she was enslaved.  The horrors of Sethe's life, past and present, are also conveyed to the reader through the author's use of symbolism, foreshadowing, mysticism, and other literary devices.

Beloved portrays a former slave through the struggles of life during slavery and post-slavery. Sethe, who manages to avoid the cruelty of slave life, lives it with the memories of the past. With the novel told in bits and pieces of memories, disoriented, and confused thought of Sethe. No longer bound under the cruel, overpowering \\""Schoolteacher\\"" from the \\""Sweet Home\\"" plantation, Sethe however is still a slave to the images of the past.<br />The existence of slavery creates a disturbed and disputable moral issue of the novel. The questionable action of Sethe murdering her daughter Beloved as to protect her from the outside world of slavery sets the idea of how cruelly they were mistreated that would lead to killing their own child.

Either way, Sethe has kept her children away from slavery, but she, on the other hand, is still coping with it.<br /> Like a flood, Sethe's emotions and images of the agonizing, unforgettable past comes all at once, rushing to her, in which she has no control over. With that, the intensity of all the tortured events they faced are surfaced to the top, which forced her to relive them. The presence of Paul D, who has a rusted metal box for a heart, and Beloved allows Sethe to open up and tolerate through the memories.<br /> With the issue of slavery, the theme of anger is dominant throughout the entire novel. With the many losses of lives in the novel, it's no wonder why the characters face many angry emotions. Anger may be seen in the author in how she portrays the white characters and black characters.

The books description of slaverys effect on the characters, both physically and emotionally was strong and clear.

Whether that daughter returns as a ghost or not doesn't matter much. My feeling is that everything, or almost everything, about Beloved is explainable without supernatural intervention.

It gave me a real sense of how terrible a thing slavery was, so terrible that it is hard to believe that one human could do that to another. In my opinion, I think that white Americans have to accept that this was truely an unforgivable act and no reparation can erase the harm that was done.

Still, many good readers find Beloved difficult to follow. However, after much patience, its clarity finally comes full circle. I think for Morrison to hear that her story Beloved is dark, disturbing, crass and confusing, is justly satisfying. That her writing is consistent shows that her style is intentional rather than incompetent. Her characters are confused, lost, sick, and beleaguered. It's as if she is literarily attempting to put her reader in a similar state. Understanding this, the flashbacks, sudden changes, twists and turns among her characters can be read with patience. It is a symbolic work in part, the characters, and the style of writing.<br />I don't think it is a mandatory read, but it does address two fundamental positions in the American dialogue of race relations.<br />The first is that America has still not reconciled itself with racism and slavery. Even though laws have been written, amendments passed, and equality promoted, this does not answer past injustices. The pain and hurt run too deep, and the injustice felt by descendents of slavery calls for more. The gap is still too wide.<br />The other position accepts the fact that racism and slavery were ugly and horrible and that there is no excuse good enough for what happened. To understand it like those who suffered it is impossible. However, laws have been made, amendments have been passed, equality is promoted, and change has come and is still coming to pass. The nation dawns a new day and should not live in the pass, but look to the future.<br />Aside from whether one thinks the book is a good one, or a poor one, it gives one an understanding of those who are proponents of either these two positions.

Instead, I'd like to share why I think this novel works.  As a white person, my ideas about slavery have come from the same sources I would suspect most others have visited: history books, television, and movies.  In my experience, these options have diluted the concept of slavery to &quot;it was terrible&quot; and &quot;it's over.&quot;  Even Roots, groundbreaking for its time, did not for me get to the heart of what slavery might really have been about.<br />Beloved reached me.  It changed me.  Why so effective?  Because it starts out with a story about slavery that is very Gone With the Wind in tone, very comfortable for white folks to read.  And, little by little, the real horrors of slavery are revealed, so incrementally that when you get to the worst of it, you find you are drowning in sorrow without realizing you'd waded in.  An immediate in-your-face depiction of the tragedy that is slavery could have been literally shocking - causing the reader to withdraw into a more psychologically secure place, a place where one could say &quot;this is just a book&quot; without truly absorbing the tragedy.  Morrison wisely opts for a more subtle, gradual approach that drags you in and reveals exactly why slavery will simply not go away because it has died, but must be actively confronted to be put to rest.  For me, that is the metaphor of this more-than-a-ghost story.<br />After reading this book, I will never again be able to say &quot;slavery is over and we all need to move on.&quot;  This book has put the cyclical and hereditary tragedy of slavery into the same light as child abuse; how many generations does it take to stamp out the repercussions of abuse? and how many will it take to stamp out the repercussions of the systematic abuse of an entire race?<br />Morrison doesn't provide the answer, but she finally got me asking the right questions.  At the risk of sounding fatally P.C., I really believe all white people should read this book to get an understanding of why we, as a nation, have not &quot;gotten over it and moved on,&quot; and will not until we confront what actually happened, instead of what we're comfortable remembering.ly P.C., I really believe all white people should read this book to get an understanding of why we, as a nation, have not &quot;gotten over it and moved on,&quot; and will not until we confront what actually happened, instead of what we're comfortable remembering.",2002-10-02

I think Toni Morrison is a sick person who has nothing better to do than complain about slavery and the horrible condition of African-Americans in America today.  I watched an interview recently with Toni and i was sickened by her prevailing and redundant thoughts that blacks are treated so terrible and that white people are monsters.  Yes, you read correctly, she didn't say white people &quot;were&quot; monsters, she said we ARE monsters.  I find this very offensive and while I am admittedly embarassed that this nation went through the cruel period of slavery, I was not part of it, nor were any living blacks, including Toni Morrison.  Toni is like a disabled person whose only ability in life is writing.  I wont argue anyone that the book is written in a brilliant fashion, but the content and subject matter are demented and sick.<br />Having given my opinion of Morrison herself, I would like to say a few things about this book (since the book is what I'm supposed to be reviewing, I think it would be a good idea for me to put a little bit about it in here).  As I have already stated, I think the book is written very well and maybe even deserves the Pulitzer.  However, I still believe it is nothing more than an attempt by a liberal black woman to cry bleeding-heart, feel sorry for me, it's all your fault (white people), to a society that treats blacks more than fairly.  The whole story this book tells, of a mother killing her child to save it from the horrors of slavery is twisted to say the least.  Further more, the book goes on to portray this as the &quot;ultimate act of love by a mother.&quot;  I think not.  I appreciate the debate this arouses, but then again, not really.  I do realize that this story is not something Toni thought up herself, but i still dont agree with it.  Actually, the only thing I really agree with in the book, is when Toni says, &quot;This is not a story to pass on.&quot;  Next time a thought crosses your mind to write Toni, take your own advice, and don't.s not a story to pass on.&quot;  Next time a thought crosses your mind to write Toni, take your own advice, and don't.",2002-09-25

The plot moves as slow as sorghum, and the characters never come to life.  Ms. Morrison is a talented writer and a decent narrator, and occasional passages in Beloved sizzle, but mostly this book falls flat.  It is not helped by the fact that the narrative can come to a halt while Ms. Morrison ticks off lists of things or events, nor is it helped by verbal tics such as the use of phrases with an adjective preceding \\""thing,\\"" as in \\""a beautiful thing,\\"" \\""a precious thing,\\"" or \\""a best thing.\\""  The clunky writing and uninteresting characters are a strange contrast to the overheated, sensationalistic plot.  Perhaps the characters are so flat because Mr. Morrison sacrifices their humanity for the sake of the symbolism she wants to guide the novel.<br />Despite the novel's obvious pretensions, it is a middlebrow affair, with some passages (as in Baby Suggs's speech in the forrest opening) coming across like the monolog of an earthy... guest...<br />Also disappointing for a ghost story is that there is nothing creepy or suspenseful about this tale.  Some critics might respond that this is meant to capture the fact that many antebellum blacks took for granted that there were ghosts all over the place, so from the perspective of the main characters in Beloved the ghost is not terrifying.  But even if that is so, does the ghost have to be so darn boring?<br />Slavery is a blight on American history that weighs heavily upon the present, and Ms. Morrison is right to sympathize with slavery's victims, but it does not follow that a novel about an important subject is itself important.

Some pieces you have to pick up and put down again because you don't have enough of the puzzle created to understand where they go. And some pieces you just stare at endlessly, caught up in the vision of this small part of the picture that you might have ignored had you the whole thing in front of you. It is not a new way to write a novel, but Morrison's subject is aptly suited for such treatment.<br />The subject, in case you have not followed some of the literature on this critically acclaimed novel and missed the movie, is slavery and its aftermath. Morrison's goal is the reconstruction of a slave narrative through the form of a novel. While I think that Morrison succeeds in this goal, I found that the novel was not quite as affecting as it could have been, mainly because it is set in 1873 and earlier. The effect of slavery in the U.S. is still with us today and, while Morrison recreates the past, it seems all too simple to dismiss it as the sins of our grandfathers.<br />To return to the method used in the telling, which I was much more impressed by, Morrison's events benefit from the slow uncovering of the facts. Supposedly, the novel grew from a newspaper clipping that Morrison ran across (and the same, I'm guessing, that provides the climax of Part One). The clipping, as mentioned by the characters, was likely intended for the titillation and scandal of the white people who were its likely audience. By recasting the story in the manner which she does, Morrison saves it from its sensationalism and reveals it as the tragedy--for all involved--that it truly was.<br />Finally, regarding the supernatural elements, I have to agree with the critics that link this novel to the tradition of South American magical realism. Why? Basically because the characters treat the fantastic only as another part of life--rather than questioning its existence, they embrace it or deal with it. Their attitude towards it is active. I'm somewhat interested in Morrison's other work, especially something set in the present, to see if this approach to fantasy is contained therein as well.e to agree with the critics that link this novel to the tradition of South American magical realism.

I'll try to stick to the primary highlights and pros and cons, and let you be the judge. Set in the US after the Civil War, blacks are technically free, but not really as they is still oppression from the white majority. However, in Beloved, that's only one aspect of the oppression, as it also comes in the form of the black community within its self, within people's personal lives, and from... a ghost.<br />A very unique, but powerful form of prose that Morrison uses is that the storyline is not linear. Meaning you jump around from present to past and from different points of view almost constantly. It works, but you can read it like a regular book and will have to read more slowly. It can be worth it, but it can also be frustrated at times. But by the end, you realize it couldn't have been written any other way, and still have the impact it leaves upon you.Now let me say right now that my description above is a VERY shallow scratching of the surface. There are tons of issues throughout this book for the read to think upon, which is why this book earned both a Pulitzer and the National Book Award. So do not classify this as a \\""ghost story\\"" as it's much, much more. Indeed, it is more of a post-Civil War story on the black experience than anything else, if you can believe that.

It may be accurate of the times, though I don't know, but it is disturbing regardless. All in all, a very good read, and I can see why it's fated to be an instant classic.

Sethe decides to run away from her owners hoping to find a better life and future for her children, but when she is caught, she makes the decision that death must be better than the life of a slave. &quot;Out of love&quot; she tries to take the lives of her children, succeeding in only one. This decision comes back to haunt her as Beloved, the ghost of her baby daughter. In this novel, Sethe battles with guilt put on her conscience by Beloved and is willing to lose everything to regain the love of this lost child.<br />When I started reading this novel I soon realized that this was not going to be an easy one. Morrison's style of writing is quite difficult, she jumps back and forth in time without warning. However the flashbacks she uses represent the things that have helped to form the characters. I think that Morrison wrote this novel like a puzzle. Throughout the story, she would give bits and pieces of information to the reader and would leave it up to the reader to put those pieces in place. This style is at the same time the most frustrating, and the most rewarding part of the story. I constantly found myself flipping back and forth through the pages trying to make sense of what Morrison was trying to tell me. I have never read a book with this style of writing before so this made me stress and get frustrated a lot. But, when the pieces finally started to come together, I felt proud that I was able to do so. It's hard to judge Morrison's book. Judging it would have to depend on an individual's opinion. If I had to choose, I would likely not read another book by her again. Don't get me wrong, Beloved was a fantastic book. I just don't like to have to constantly keep flipping back and forth because it starts to get annoying. One positive thing about Morrison's style is that she was able to keep the reader in the book and always have her asking herself questions. The content of the book was excellent. Morrison described her characters well. I really got to know and understand the characters. Morrison's descriptions of her scenes really painted pictures in my mind. The story itself about how Sethe, the main character, killed her baby girl to protect her from the hardships of slavery was shocking.

Throughout the book, I was trying to ascertain the purpose/message of Toni Morrison. Was the book meant to merely depict life and times of that era for a post-Civil war slave and to document slavery? Or were there messages of healing, hope and transcendence? These were the questions I kept asking myself throughout my reading. I have to admit I was disturbed by what I found.<br />Certainly the writing was excellent. It held my attention. It was rich with imagery, poetic passages and excellent characterization.  Certain parts of the novel were, however, confusing, as the narrative goes back and forth in time. But this to me wasn't as disturbing as the rather one dimensional white characters, the lack of complexity in dealing with a consciousness of people (on both sides of the equation). So, that the white characters are easily hated and the black characters easily understood and acceptable.<br />It seems to me our country (and world) has a long history of oppression - whether of Indians, women, slaves, etc. To me, it would be up to writers to have vision for the future to show the way for some healing, a reframing of the old story of blame and a<br />movement beyond hatred and prejudice - and certainly to challenge readers with complex (more readily human) characters living in a world of predetermined (and unfair to a larger group than just this one) limitations and prejudice.<br /><br />I got stuck feeling maybe I was being unfair to the depiction of a true story. But it seems to me that any individual or group thereof who have not developed self (whether through oppression or their own personal limitations of fear, etc.) will find a difficult path to walk. And, certainly many factions of oppressed people's stories have been forgotten, and I know Morrison wanted to make sure the reality, agony and despair were never forgotten from American history.  I understand and commend this voice documenting the story.<br />Still, we can see abuse, beatings, rape and even shaming acts in families, schools, churches - everywhere. I found the questioning of Paul D. about Mr. Garner's calling the slaves of Sweet Home \\""real men,\\"" to be one of the signs of a person beginning to find a self. And, I found Sethe's running away to be the hopeful signs of a spirit aware on some level that life can be different.<br />Ok. I know. This was based on a true story but it seemed to me that the novel gave voice to blame and not to forgiveness or even better, to the personal growth, the evolution of soul (or even a nation, like ours has slowly with steps forward and back over time), development of self and increase of consciousness of a people. It is doesn't seem to help find a way beyond.<br />The characters to me seemed to get stuck in their denial of story, just as so many rape victims, abused children do. Paul D. kept his story in the tin in his heart until Beloved. And though his interaction with her was seen to be negative, I actually found the opening of that tin to be his salvation, as how can one go beyond a story until going through it?<br />And that seemed to be the justification of Sethe's killing of her daughter. She couldn't imagine a life better for her daughter. She didn't want her to have to live a life enslaved.<br />Now, I can logically understand this and I can forgive the character her moment of insanity. But if we said she had just had too much and snapped because of the pain in her life, then we would have to do the same for the many others in the world who had a very painful childhood and who chose destruction as a path, no matter what they called it - protection, the desire for that person not to do a certain thing or live a particular life.<br /><br />I thought one of the truly wonderful parts in the book was when Paul D. went back to Sethe (after knowing about her killing her daughter). I alsothought the community of women coming to help Denver and Sethe was another hopeful message. It seems to me<br />these two passages were very subtly played out but love and community seem to be a message of possible hope.<br />Overall, I found Beloved to be a beautifully written story that didn't have the courage to take on a message much beyond trusting your own color and to voice the suffering of slaves and the shameful behavior of the group of people in power in our society at that time.<br /><br />To me, anger is certainly a necessary emotion to change a person or a group of individuals life and for the growth of a soul (or group of people) just awakening to personal power and a consciousness of self determination. I commend the book for helping echo that necessary first step but wasn't able to show possible alternatives beyond anger.<br />And, in fact, it seems many (people with a background of oppression such as slavery) have gotten stuck in the anger and are not able to take a step beyond towards a deeper healing and liberation from the past. In fact, the anger gets handed down from one generation to the next.ught the community of women coming to help Denver and Sethe was another hopeful message.

No family likes to air dysfunction in public let alone takes responsibility for any harm down to its family members and certainly no country, especially one taunting that all men are created equal, likes to acknowledge its hypocritical history.  No one wants to slice open the American apple pie and find maggots.  Back in high school, sitting comfortably in my suburban northeastern classroom, the history books emphasized the triumph of the North not only winning the Civil War, but also freeing the slaves from a life of imprisonment.  Good had triumphed, the country made whole again, and everyone lived happily ever after.  There was no contemplation of the hardships suffered by the newly freed men, women, and children, who after having been &quot;owned,&quot; were tossed into society, given no or little resources and greeted with a great deal of animosity, for while Lincoln's leadership eliminated slavery it did not abolish the racist belief system of our country that sadly continues to this day.  Morrison's Beloved, a rich, lyrical tale, dares to pressure the reader to face the forgotten and ignored reality of those post-war slaves.<br />  The former slaves of Sweet Home, Sethe and Paul D., deal quite differently with their physical freedom from slavery but both remain equally haunted by the pain, humiliation and abuse they have endured.  Memories of the horrific dehumanizing mistreatment-brutal beatings, rape, imprisonment and murder-flood them each and every day, even twenty years of living slavery-free.  By alternating the point-of-views within the chapters, including the ghost, Beloved, the story's core, the frightening truth of the soul annihilation of the slaves is masterfully unveiled by Morrison's pen.  Morrison shows how the unspeakable abuse haunts the slave survivors.  By the book's end the past has conquered Sethe and the story center's of infanticide while living in freedom from slavery has been logically rendered as the most loving gesture of protection Sethe could have given her eldest daughter.  Because as Baby Suggs had told her, &quot;No bad luck but white people.  They don't know when to stop.&quot;<br />  Unfortunately, while beautifully rendered, the narrative line becomes more and more jagged as the main narrator, Sethe, loses her sense of reality. The traumatic memories heighten the pitch of the story.  This is a complex, tragic story based on the horrid reality of our country's history.  Why make it any harder for the reader to face the atrocities and devastation that attacked a people long after their birth right of freedom was legally declared?  Morrison's story reveals how unbelievably resilient the human spirit is and how cruel our white ancestors were. However, as a literary work, the piece falls a tad short by making the reader plow through the frequent narrative time changes and at times, an unreliable narrator. While the story's integrity is maintained by Sethe losing her mind, the actual story time becomes fuzzy, creating a parallel process for the reader perhaps, but at the same time unnecessarily clouding the clarity of the narrative.  This reader became confused and had to re-read passages to regain her footing, asking: Are these delusions of Sethe in the story's present?  Or traumatic memories?  For instance, Sethe is headed for the Clearing where Baby Suggs preached and Sethe is remembering Baby Suggs just prior to her death laying in bed in her room at 124 and obsessing about colors.  Within the same paragraph the story jumps to the past within the past to Sethe's arrival with Denver to Baby Suggs' home.  This literary masterpiece is not as fully realized as it could have been because these flashbacks within flashbacks push the reader away from an already difficult topic.  The abrupt time shifts mar this masterpiece by disengaging the reader from the story's natural progression.  Dialogue is never transcribed literally because it would bog down the narrative, nor should the process of remembering be literally transcribed because it confuses the narrative line and in Morrison's case, unnecessarily tarnishes a profound literary work.

That is not the case with &quot;Beloved,&quot; which won the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.  Renowned author, Toni Morrison, writes powerfully affecting prose about slavery and its aftermath, drawing you in and holding you from first to last page.  This novel is aging well, and deserves ever more readers.<br />  The tale revolves around Sethe, all she has felt and witnessed and does not want to remember.  These &quot;rememories&quot; come out piecemeal during the early years of the Reconstruction era, when Sethe and those who slaved together at Sweet Home farm are freed, dead or missing.  &quot;To Sethe,&quot; writes Morrison, &quot;the future was a matter of keeping the past at bay.&quot;  Supressed memory, too painful to retrieve whole, is forced to the surface bit by bit, by circumstances that keep the story flowing.<br />  Sethe escapes Sweet Home before the end of slavery and gives birth to her daughter, Denver, en route to the home of her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, in Cinicinnati, Ohio.  Loneliness pervades the lives of Sethe and Denver, after Baby Suggs's death, until two people show up unexpectedly to unravel their self-imposed isolation.  First Paul D, a former slave from Sweet Home arrives and captures Sethe's affections.  Later the eponymous Beloved, a mysterious young woman who befriends Denver and comes to dominate the household.<br />  As the details of the past acrue for both Sethe and the reader, we come to understand the full measure of pain and burden that has shaped this woman and those she loves.  Her heart, body and soul, formed in the cauldron of slavery, are permanently scarred, and drive her to the terrible deed at the center of the story.<br />  In &quot;Beloved,&quot; Morrison has created a North American version of the mystical realism style for which South American writers are acclaimed.  The physical world is animated, ghosts are real, and nature is a character, particularly through the eyes and hearts of Paul D and Baby Suggs.  Morrison weaves a rich metaphysical world that recalls Michael Ondaatje's &quot;The English Patient,&quot; particularly in the way she captures a haunted mind, roving different parts of its past, all the while suffering physically in the present.  In syntax and rhythms that are never heavy handed, we enter a world full of folk wisdom, and an abiding and fulfilling intimacy with nature.<br />  Many know of the horrors of slavery--including branding, whipping, seperation of families, rape--a world where, as Morrison puts it, even a rooster has more selfhood than a black man.  This story dryly chronicles those horrors, and shows us how intrinsically Sethe's and Paul D's ability to survive and love are shaped by their emotional and physical scars.<br />  This heart-wrenching tale should be read by all Americans, not because it would be good for them to understand this piece of our history better, but because of Morrison's unforgettable characters and powerfully poetic prose.re is a character, particularly through the eyes and hearts of Paul D and Baby Suggs.

But Morrison doesn't expect us to fully understand the story, at least not in a single reading, only to experience it and to feel the same frustration and terror her characters feel.  She doesn't attempt to explain or unravel slavery; what Morrison does is merely show it to us, not from the circumspect historical perspective, but from the perplexed individual experience.  Admittedly, the structure of the novel is dreadfully confusing, but Morrison is making a statement here: See if you, any of you, can get your bearings in this world where the ultimate expression of love is murder.<br />  To further complicate things, Morrison doesn't prepare us for anything, particularly the elements of magical realism.  Instead, she delves right into a ghost story.  But realize that the supernatural is not only accepted as realistic in the African tradition from which these characters were uprooted, it is welcomed.  Baby Suggs holy remarks that having a ghost is nothing extraordinary.  She tells Sethe to be glad the spirit is that of an infant's and not a full-grown man.<br />  I must concede that even with the advantage of first reading this novel in college, with the added wisdom of my professor, Beloved was still a bear of a book to read.  Shifts in voice and point-of-view baffled me, particularly the section in which the voices of the three women merge.  The story does not offer itself up easily, but neither does the subject of slavery itself.  Neither is linear, at least not to the individual memory, which moves in and out and often overlaps or reinvents itself.  This is what Morrison calls rememory.<br />  In spite of the difficulties, Beloved is a story that every literate person should undertake.  Morrison's lyrical prose is nearly reason enough to recommend it, but for the student of literature, especially, the book should be teased apart and combed for the multiple layers of meaning.

In many ways, the stripping away of hardwearing manhood is even more poignant than the demoralization of women.  A rooster named Mister, which walks about freely on the plantation, mocks at the male slaves, who, though sexually depraved, manage to refrain from raping Sethe, the only woman among them.  For me, this section of the book was the most painful to read.  In another section, Paul D. says to Sethe: &quot;A man ain't a goddamn ax.  Chopping, hacking, busting every goddamn minute of the day.  Things get to him.  Things he can't chop down because they're inside&quot; (69).

Only one actually makes its presence known, a baby daughter, killed many years earlier, who dumps bowls, throws things, and makes handprints in cake icing.  But Sethe's mind is haunted, also, by the ghosts of her past.  There is her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, whose life is forever altered when Sethe makes a horrible decision one fateful day; Halle, Sethe's husband, who didn't meet her in the cornfield to run away like he'd said; her mother, whom Sethe saw hanged for a reason she never knew; her sons, Howard and Buglar, who ran away and never returned; and perhaps most importantly, the ghost of herself, the Sweet Home girl whose precious mother's milk was stolen away the night Schoolteacher and his nephews chose to use her for sport, an experience so unspeakable, it culminated in Sethe's act of desperation in the cold house.<br /> When Paul D arrives unexpectedly, he breathes life back into a house long dead, and hope back into a woman whose indelible emotional and literal scars have forced her long ago to dispense with wishful thinking.  When a second unexpected guest arrives, Beloved, Sethe, still entertaining ideas about how even she can build a life, with Paul D and Denver, doesn't pick up on the uncanny aura surrounding the strange girl; her name, her new shoes, her difficulty walking, her knowledge about details of the past she could not possibly know unless...she was a part of the past...<br /> Through poetical prose that evokes magical imagery and the horrific truth of slavery, Toni Morrison creates a riveting story.  She takes admirable risks in writing technique, such as stream of consciousness and dialect, and though at times it is hard to follow, like a maze, it is well worth the effort, when the labyrinth opens up on a field of enchanting enlightenment.  Morrison relies on beliefs of folklore like, \\""people who die bad don't stay in the ground,\\"" and facts of history surrounding pre and post Civil War times to weave in and out of past and present, imagination and reality, thought and conversation.<br /> There is so much underlying the surface of this story.  It is not just a ghost story or a romance, though both those elements are present.  It is a story so overwrought with devastation that sadness is almost a character itself.  But it is also a story about the strength of the human spirit.  Through sheer determination, Sethe escaped death and made it to Ohio, and it was determination again that would not allow her to let her children suffer an existence like hers had been.  When her determination falters, usurped by the demands of Beloved, it finds a foothold in Denver, who overcomes her fears of leaving the vicinity of the house.  She takes comfort in a vision she has of Baby Suggs telling her to accept what she is afraid of, to \\""know it and go on out the yard.\\""  Denver does, resolved to do whatever necessary to prevent all that is embodied in Beloved - cruelty, sorrow, and anger - from finally and absolutely overtaking her and her mother.und,\\"" and facts of history surrounding pre and post Civil War times to weave in and out of past and present, imagination and reality, thought and conversation.<BR> There is so much underlying the surface of this story.

This complex and troubling novel has a unique story to tell.  However, Toni Morrison's unorthodox, and sometimes lewd writing style has made this story appropriate only for the most mature readers.  But, for those who are mature enough to delve into this book, the writing style proves quite effective.  She quickly sets the reader in the culture and emotional mindset of the characters.<br />Though the writing is powerful, it loses its effectiveness as the story progresses from moderate believability to complete fantasy; I'm mainly referring to the concept of ghosts and reincarnation in the story.  Morrison also causes the reader to miss some of the novel's symbolism due to her subtlety, while her blunt and obscene descriptions of some events stick in their mind.  But, those who can grasp the unorthodox writing style and the implausible story will find that the overall themes conveyed in this novel are fairly intriguing, and provide a fresh and original perspective in this stereotypic genre.  Younger readers, however, may find this novel tedious, as the story line alone will not supply quite enough action and engagement to hold their interest.<br />Even if the novel becomes tedious, you will still need to apply intense concentration in order to avoid re-reading sections.  Flashbacks usually come without warning, and the point of view shifts from character to character and from present-tense to past-tense at unusual times.  As the reader, you must first get used to the style, and then you will come to know the order in which the events occur.  After that, the novel becomes much less vexing.  At first, it's extremely hard to put together the pieces of the puzzle.<br />Many of the scattered events in this story leave the reader longing for more explanation.  Reasons for some of the character's decisions are never thoroughly explained, and the strange supernatural occurrences are simply thrown into the story as if they are normal, everyday occurrences.  These all prompt questions of \\""How?\\"" and \\""Why?\\""  These ruminations play an important role in making this novel what it is, but they also create an incomplete and unconvincing story line.<br />Not everyone will enjoy reading Beloved.  If you are looking to read a story about slavery with an unconventional and provoking plot, you might enjoy this novel.  On the other hand, if you just want a typical, generic story of a struggling slave oppressed by whites, you probably won't find what you're looking for in this book.are normal, everyday occurrences.

It casts a spell, engaging the reader as only Morrison can do, inviting her to follow the labyrinth of memory, storytelling, and repetition to the center and out again.<br />Beloved has been called many things -- a ghost story, a story about slavery in America, a love story.  It is all these.  Its central figure, Sethe, an ex-slave living in Cincinnati, had a short taste of freedom and happiness before binding herself in guilt and grief.  The reason for her grief is the reason for the ghost that haunts her home and for the solitary life she lives with her daughter, Denver.  And it is this mystery that unfolds in a winding trail of \\""rememory\\"" and storytelling that begins with the entrance of Paul D, a man Sethe knew from a plantation called Sweet Home, and Beloved, a young woman who appears one day leaning on a stump in the yard.<br />If you like linear - beginning, middle, ending - novels, don't read this one unless you relish something different.

It's not a straight-forward &quot;here's the plot and here's how it ends&quot; kind of book.  The plot or central theme of the book is simple enough, a slave-woman escapes to the free north and the aftermath of her supposed freedom.  As in Song of Solomon, Toni Morrison uses magical realism to drive her story, it's reminiscent of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende.  I think it adds an element to the book that heightens its emotions.  Slavery is a difficult subject to write about, and to write about it from a personal viewpoint, rather than a historical viewpoint is even harder.  I think Morrison has successfully done that in Beloved.<br />To those who didn't understand the book or wanted to force it into something commonplace so it's more palatable to their pop-culture minds, I say to them, you're missing out on a great piece of American culture and literature.  Those who didn't like it are probably young, undergraduate or high school kids who simply don't have the patience for a story that requires a lot of thinking and feeling.  Also, I believe you have to know suffering or have the capacity to understand and relate to other people's suffering to fully appreciate this book.  A young person or a person who has lived a life of privilege, be it financially or emotionally, will have trouble sharing the meaning of this book.<br />It's true that the style of the book is different and combines elements of different writing formats.  Morrison uses poetry and stream-of-consciousness style writing in parts of the book.  You just have to take it for what it is and not fight it too much.  It's a personal voice, a personal story, a personal pain.  You don't have to get everything everyone writes.  Focus on the beautiful story-telling and the emotions it stirs in you.  American writing needs this willingness to experiment to create a different and distinct voice.",2001-08-15

This design makes for some confusion at the beginning of the text, and especially on a first read.  But because the action at the heart of the novel, the infanticide, is so horrific, it seems Toni Morrison wanted to approach it slowly, indirectly.  We find out much more about the aftermath of the murder, and the events of the mother Sethe's life leading up to it, before fully comprehending the events that take place in the barn at 124 Bluestone Road.  The way Morrison tells the story mimics the manner in which Sethe deals with this moment of her past, where central events are danced around, moved in on.<br /><br />I'm fascinated by the way Toni Morrison has been able to create, within the context of a ghost story, a novel about the inheritance of culture, and how today, we might grapple with the history of slavery we all share.  The characters in this novel straddle two worlds, one of freedom and one of former slavery, life in Ohio and bondage in Kentucky.  The first section is preceded by two epigraphs-\\""Sixty Million and more,\\"" and on a separate page, a quote from Romans 9:25, \\""I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.\\""  Indeed, the Beloved that appears in the story is a ghost and feels she has not been loved right.

The house, its moods and shifting atmospheres take prominence at the opening of each of the three sections of the novel.<br /><br />Beloved deals pointedly with the atrocities of slavery; so much so, that the reader may begin to debate whether Sethe's \\""prideful\\"" act to keep her daughter from it was actually a merciful one.

Those who have heard of Toni Morrison but perhaps been a bit intimidated by her literary reputation can be advised that this book is as good a read as any and just as accessible on various levels.  On the most basic level, this book is a ghost story.<br />It begins with Sethe, an ex-slave who has found her way to Ohio. Behind her she left Sweet Home, as close a utopia as one can get for a slave-master relationship.  Sweet Home contains a past that begins positively, (Sethe is able to choose her husband and is left alone by the other men on the plantation).  Yet as the novel continues the reader learns the darker side of Sweet Home which developed after the master passed away and the mistress became too ill to take care of the plantation.  Ahead of her in Ohio Sethe has several children who eventually leave and a one Baby Suggs, her husband's mother, who evolves from a type of minister to a dying woman who has denounced the white world completely.  Left in the house is Denver, her young daughter and Sethe.  It is implied that her boys have left home because they couldn't stand it anymore. \\""It\\"" is the spirit that has inhabited their home for several years.  It takes many shapes and forms, and has become a sort of companion for the lonely Denver.  Its presence is short lived once Paul D, a survivor from the Sweet Home days, arrives. He cannot stay in the home as long as she is there and physically removes her spiritual presence.  But the ghosts presence revisits the home, this time in the form of a young woman.  She has the mental and physical capacity of a toddler, and becomes a permanent fixture in the home of Sethe, Beloved and Paul D. Who this mystery woman is and what she represents is the great mystery of the book, one that is solved by the readers early, and by the other characters later. Unlocking her mystery will take a community effort, one that hasn't been seen around Sethe's house for over a decade.<br />This novel is a great exploration of the past, present and future and how those three interact with each other within the hearts and minds of the characters.  Sethe must understand her past in order to have a future and this struggle is played out in dramatic turns which credit Morrison's creative genius. At times this book seems almost epic in size. Morrison flies back in time with every turn of the page. As a result, the reader understands characters' entire histories, and one feels as if they have known them for quite some time.<br />Morrison's non-linear writing can at times be intimidating for the reader.  Yet for those who stick with the book they will be heavily rewarded.  Her language use and non-traditional sentence structure left this reader in awe.  Descriptions are unique, honest, and accurate.  She describes the trials of an ex-slave with seemingly effortless grace.<br />I highly recommend this book to both veterans of Morrison's work as well as new comers.

Determined to protect her children, Sethe does the unthinkable--an act which poses serious questions in terms of morality.  Her actions create nearly unbearable consequences for not only herself, but her teenage daughter Denver as well.  Their home, once filled with love and constant companionship becomes inhabited by the spirit of an angry baby lamenting her premature death.  Strangely, the dead baby holds so much control over Sethe and Denver, and succeeds in making them miserable and nervous, even from the other side of the grave.  Skillfully, Toni Morrison enters the realm of the super-natural, transporting her reader to a lonely house where strange visions, inexplicable occurrences, and constant terror are commonplace.  But somehow, in the midst of these unusual and frightening events, Beloved maintains a power of meaning and sense of reality.<br />Unusual events are the driving forces behind the novel's success.  Beloved's return nineteen years after Sethe held her in her arms as a baby is a major turning point in the novel, as Beloved has power over everything that she wishes.  Beloved's control over Denver and Sethe raises so many questions in terms of what she is capable of.  Her physical presence alters the dynamics of the family so dramatically that Denver, Beloved's sister, must intervene to avoid certain harm.  Beloved's strange presence introduces an entirely new element to the novel, as the reader unravels the mystery of her origin and purpose.<br />Another level of Morrison's storytelling power relates to a recurring theme.  Interspersed throughout the novel are references to Sethe's uncontrollable \\""rememory.\\""  These are the memories that Sethe feels obliged to carry, even though they cause her great pain.  For whatever reason, she feels the responsibility to keep them alive.  In her dedication to the<br />preservation of these memories at whatever cost to her, Sethe is immediately established as a loving mother tragically consumed with love for her children.  She seems unable to control herself any time that her kin are involved.  She wants so desperately to be a family, or at the very least, she hopes to create one.  It is only through Beloved's return that Sethe is able to feel relief about the decision that she made so many years ago and finally let go to the most painful parts of her rememory.

After reading this novel I believe that this is a great piece of literature to experience and judging from this single piece of work alone, Toni Morrison is an excellent writer for today`s readers.<br />I absolutely loved this novel! I read the entire book in less then four days because I simply could not put it down.  At first the novel is quit slow. The beginning seems to drag a little and I found it very hard to want to continue to reading.  However, once I got past the first 6 pages or so, I found myself unable to put this book down.<br />This novel is a very enticing read, that deals with many vary interesting and somewhat gut wrenching ideas.  For example, the idea of slavery and running for freedom or the unlawful deed of murder that is found within the story line.  Or what about the idea of ghosts and spirits of the dead, coming back to haunt those who are still alive and thriving in the human world.<br />This is a book that is immensely hard to follow and takes a lot of concentration to understand where the plot of the story is coming from and where it is going.  Morrison uses a style of writing that is very hard to follow because of its constant movement. For example, one moment, the character is physically in one place doing one thing and the reader can see this happening, then the next minute the character is having a flashback and is mentally somewhere else, in another time, doing some other kind of action.  Morrison allows this type of movement to happen within her writing without giving any type of warning.  These kind of occurrences that happen throughout the novel are liable to cause some confusion for the reader, forcing he or she to stay on their toes at all times while reading this particular book.

It seems to me the object of writing a review is to give a prospective reader an idea of what the book is about. On that note.......<br />  Beloved is the epitome of perfect literature. Reading it is like listening to a Beatles cd or being inside a Van Gogh Painting. It is not only an interesting story of spiritual enslavement,  Civil War era African American Culture and mysticism, the human condition, redemption, and time. It is a book full of amazing imagery( beloved's rebirth into Sethe's life), symbolism( beloved is the symbol of the repression Sethe felt from slavery)  and language use, such as &quot; grown men whipped like children; children whipped like adults...,&quot; a simple, yet very clear statement.<br />  A breif summary: A young woman named Beloved appears upon the doorstep of Sethe, an escaped slave and mother of four. Beloved is a reincarnation(or gohst, some say) of Sethe's first baby girl whom she killed in order to save from the abominations of slavery. Besides her obvious reason for coming back, Beloved ultimately becomes a healing proccess and a redeemer for many.<br />  Also, I wouold like to say, although I understand what Ilana(reviewer a few people down the list) is saying about trying too hard to create symbolism and double entendres, I disagree. When someone's writing does have so much symbolism and creative diction, yet it still flows so freely and fastly, like Morrison's novel, there is no way it was written purely to win the merit it did. So many people search all of their lives to find their purpose in life and never find it, but when someone writes as well as Morrison, it is not only a blessing for her but all of her readers as well.",2001-04-11

At the same time, it's so hard to put down that I found myself up late at night just waiting to see what would happen.  Morrison pulls no punches here, from the evils of slavery (and they are depicted in this book as I have never seen them before... with a spare, unflinching look that maks you feel that you are down in the mud and blood with them), to the confusion and turmoil of the post-Civil War years. At its heart is Sethe, and the secret that she carries.  (It would be more fair actually to call it guilt, it's only a secret to the readers... not to most of the characters.) This book will wear you down, but not in a bad way.  The depictions of the horrors are bloodcurdling. This book also is so densely written, and so full of images, and stories and visions that its also hard to put it down with your first reading and say, &quot;Wasn't that pleasant?&quot; and go on and never botehr with it again.

By the same token, not knowing every spice that a great steak was seasoned with does not mean I can't appreciate the steak. You seem to have missed the most central point in the novel, Beloved is not simply Sethe's child, she is slavery personified. Beloved is as you put it &quot;annoying,&quot; but really annoying is flagrant understatement. You were right to negatively react to Beloved.  She is kniving, greedy, selfish, and yes even &quot;revolting.&quot; And every one of those words, and worse, could just as easily describe slavery. It is actually slavery, not Beloved that comes back to haunt Sethe, and it is only once Sethe learns to value herself, to reverse the devaluation that was a result of slavery (&quot;you your best thing&quot;) that Sethe can let go of Beloved and of slavery. You question Sethe launching into her life story, but it is the only story she knows, the one that is branded--literally and figuratively--on her. A life of subjugation has left her with nothing but that subjugation. It is her inability to move past that story--of reliving and fearing it--that speaks even today to the black condition. It was the evil she knew, and the psychological basis for some enslaved Africans, even upon emancipation, remaining with their masters often becoming sharecroppers. It was not because slavery was in any form or fashion humane or kind to those whom it enslaved. It was all that they knew. Years of maltreatment, of being told what to do, when to do it, and where, left many slaves hopelessly lost. Sethe hated Sweet Home, hated Schoolteacher, but despite her efforts otherwise, both seemed to always control her, always haunt her.<br />That Sethe would lose control of her bladder when confronted by this pervasive and evil apparition is, in effect, a mild reaction.  I assume that you have no historical understanding of slavery in the United States. I can especially assume so from your description of &quot;black&quot; slavery as &quot;noteworthy.&quot; Slavery, although, not often acknowledged, haunts the United States just as Beloved haunts Sethe. The Americans fought and died over this &quot;ghost,&quot; and this &quot;ghost&quot; still plays into so much of how race is viewed in this country. And although, again, often not acknowledged, slavery was the birth of black people in this country, and still factors into how we view ourselves and approach this world. On the surface, slavery provides free labor, but enslavement meant much more.  It was to deny them their family, their history, any sense of self-worth, independence, or community, to ensure that they would remain enslaved.  Enslavement does not just trap a body: it holds the mind and the spirit captive, as well, long after emancipation. &quot;Beloved&quot; captures that on so many levels. I would suggest that you read a book on slavery. &quot;Africans in America&quot; by Charles Johnson and &quot;From Slavery to Freedom&quot; by John Hope Franklin are primers on African American history or for a more specific look at slavery &quot;Slavery and Social Death&quot; or &quot;Rituals of Blood&quot; both by Orlando Patterson. Further, the mysticism you criticize is also an acknowledged part of African American culture. The power of dreams and insults to ancestors, while not as strongly believed in as it once was, is still a central and integral part of black history. This book could have instructed you, if you had allowed it to do so. Instead, you bought into some sort of hype as to what this book was: Pulitzer prize winning, yes, written by a Nobel Prize winning author, most assuredly, but an easy text to read, one you can skim, or even read once and still understand, most definitely not. More than that, it is a statement on the enslavement of not just this one woman, or even simply of black people, but the racial enslavement of this country for nearly 500 years, from the moment the first African set foot on this continent...lack people, but the racial enslavement of this country for nearly 500 years, from the moment the first African set foot on this continent...",2001-03-07

Sethe and Paul D are people who have both survived slavery though at a heavy cost. Both had to flee their homes and everything that was familiar because \\""home\\"" is not completely \\""sweet\\"" as its name wishes to make it but then again it is not all sour. Both have been raped. Now, together, they are trying to find a way to look to the future. Paul D is constantly pressing to this end in his naturally patriarchal way, but he is stopped in his progression to make a home by a spiritual invocation that is nothing less than a living memory: Beloved. The make-shift idealistic home is not a proper enclosure for memories that are so terribly large. Lost somewhere in the middle is Denver who has been raised on the retelling of these memories. Through her a process of recreation takes place that elevates the memories of her mother to a present time through oral storytelling. Beloved subjects all the characters to a trial that forces them to look at the past that they alternately avoid and wallow in.<br />The true power of this novel is created in the skilful way it is constructed by Morrison. Never fully in the past, never fully in the present and never looking through just a single pair of eyes. The reader is shifted constantly through time and perspective in a way that makes you feel you are really experiencing the chaos and painfully disordered lives of the characters. You may feel at first what a lovely thing it is that this baby has returned to her mother to create a second chance for them all, but she turns out to be a troubled presence though not an entirely sinister one. The community that rises together to expel her do not have bad intentions, but their intentions are not pure. This is the deep complexity of the novel because the characters are trapped in these paradoxes of aspects to their past and identity that are not all good and not all bad, but work against each other to make existence a painful thing to live with. Somehow, through this, the characters are expected to construct a life for themselves that doesn't let itself be clogged by the onslaught of a difficult past.

I found Morrison's style very unique and refreshing..  Some of the passages were dreamlike, like listening to a beautiful song or reading a beautiful poem..  Terrific imagery..  Sometimes, however, I felt lost in her verbeage, a similar feeling that occurs in me when I read Joyce.  Some of this can be attributed to her technique of jumping around in time, pieceing together the lives of the characterics and their relationships with one another..  Aside from her style, I found the concept of killing your own children in order to save them very compelling..  A disturbing, animal-like act, yet at the same time I was convinced of the act's incredibly human compassion..  Something I believe Morrison accomplished with her unique gifts.  Although I find the topic of race generally boring, I found the story line to be legitimate and tender.. I felt great compassion for the characters in the novel..  I felt Morrison did a great job in revealing to the reader little intricacies about the character's lives and their importance.. i.e. The use of butter on one's mouth to help take away the slave's physical pain after having their mouths locked up with steel traps..  I realize that Beloved's spirit physically coming back should probably be interpreted as metaphor, but I had a hard time taking the story very seriously once I realized who the girl they met on the way home from the carnival actually was.. (I remember a scene near the end of the book where a group of women from the neighborhood had decided to confront Beloved's spirit in the flesh..)

The reader starts off the novel in a state of complete confusion, as the story takes off leaving you in the dust, wondering what's going on.  This ingenious way of writing the novel makes the reader feel gratified as they read on and begin to discover the tragic story of Sethe's life.

Think of a black man being burned alive by his master as punishment for trying to escape.  And finally, there is nothing more conceivably horrible than the slaughtering of your own child.

Although a tough read at first, the unique story telling style really makes this novel standout. You'll hear that Beloved is confusing, hard to understand, and strangely different. If you'll let this scare you off then stop reading this review now and go find another typical slavery text that is little more than a documentary. However if you're not afraid of something new and original, continue on as Beloved is one of the few great books told by the human spirit.  In the beginning of the story you're introduced to 124. The haunting of this infamous house is a part of the greater story of the character's lives. Living in the house are Sethe, Denver, and Baby Suggs. All were a part of the peculiar institution of slavery but are now trying to live as free blacks during the ante-bellum period. Not staying on one idea too long, Morrison brings Paul D. into the story. Paul D, a former slave who used to work at Sweet Home, a plantation, with Sethe, brings with him memories of a past that Sethe spends her life trying not to remember. As emotions and memories are stirred up, the plot begins to unfold. The lives of the characters are told through their memories, and Morrison's style of writing creates a feeling of confusion and struggle with these ideas in the reader similar to what the characters are feeling. By doing this she pulls you into the story so well because you feel what they feel. Soon the harsh reality of the memories is coming from everywhere. You hear of a dead baby, murdered, by her own mother? Then the haunting of the house stops with the appearance of a strange girl who calls herself Beloved. Beloved, the same thing Morrison carved into her unnamed dead baby's gravestone. Paul D, now living with Sethe, has bad feelings about the girl and the events keep building to the unexpected conclusion.

Beloved is a story that thrusts ideas and events towards you with no explanation. For example, the main character in the story, Sethe, has many flashbacks from the past.  A paragraph in the story may start with an event in the present time and then bring in something from the past without notice. Because of this, I had to flip back to pages and re-read the paragraphs in order to get the idea. Amongst the confusion, I got one basic idea from the story-the past will come back to haunt you if you don't face it and come to terms with it.  Morrison puts this idea into action by her impressive writing style.  The confusing flashbacks to her days as a slave, to killing her own child, to the present (not necessarily in that order) all conspire to force Sethe to let go of the past.  There are some things I didn't like about the story.  The idea that Beloved, the daughter whom Sethe had killed, comes back is great, but there could be other scenarios to that idea.  Why did Morrison settle on making Beloved return as an ungrateful person?  Would making Beloved a loving character change the emotional emphasis on the characters?  There would be more guilt on Sethe's part if the latter idea were chosen.  Also, I disagree with Sethe's decision in killing Beloved to \\""protect\\"" her.  Sure, we want to protect our children, but we shouldn't be the one to decide for them whether we live or not-the one affected should decide.  There's also the idea of afterlife-Morrison could have expanded that idea.  After all, the fact that Beloved remembers (after all, Beloved was only two years old) everything about Sethe and her past opens up the question, \\""What happens after we die?\\""",2000-11-29

The reader is required to put it together in-order to understand this novel.  From the beginning of her novel Morrison confuses the reader throughout the story by randomly throwing different pieces of the puzzle (story), only to confuse the reader.  As the story progresses, the literary puzzle is soon revealed to the reader.  But this book is no ordinary puzzle.  It is one that requires great skill to put together.  I was required to read this piece in my AP English class and I could not link fragments of the book from the very start.  There were times when I thought I had pieces of the story connected together, only to realize that the pieces were not of the right shape and size.  Like the time when Paul D. was first introduced in the novel.  This character just popped out of nowhere and throughout this chapter of his appearance it was never mentioned who he was and why he was there.  At first I thought that Paul D. was there just to trouble the women by always bringing up the past and trying to hit on Sethe.  But as I progressed through the story I finally understood who and why Paul D. is. He was a former slave and his role in the book is important to Sethe.  Another example of \\""puzzling\\"" parts is when Sethe talks of a tree growing on her back.  This will definitely confuse the reader.  I won't tell you what Sethe is talking about.  If you want to know go and purchase or borrow the book and find out for yourself.  I don't think this book is a very good book at all but I would recommend it to readers that want a good challenge.

I finally understood why everyone was telling me it was a difficult book to read. Beloved was about a fight between a woman and her past memories.  Morrison wrote this novel like a puzzle.  Throughout the story, she would give bits and pieces of information to the reader and would leave it up to him to put those pieces in place.  This style is at the same time the most frustrating, and the most rewarding part of the story.  I constantly found myself flipping back and forth through the pages trying to make sense of what Morrison was trying to tell me.  I was never involved with this style of writing before so this made me stress and get frustrated a lot.  But, when the pieces finally started to come together, I felt proud that I was able to do so.  It is hard to judge Morrison's book.  Judging it would have to depend on an individual's opinion.  If I had to choose, I would likely not read another book by her again.  Don't get me wrong, Beloved was a fantastic book.  I just don't like to have to constantly keep flipping back and forth because it starts to get annoying.  One positive of Morrison's style is she was able to keep the reader in the book and always have him asking himself questions.  The content of the book was excellent.  Morrison described her characters well.  I really got to know and understand the characters.  Morrison's descriptions of her scenes really painted pictures in my mind.  The story itself about how Sethe, the main character, killed her baby girl to protect her from the hardships of slavery was shocking.  How can someone kill their own child in order to protect them from the undetermined future?  Was Sethe a murderer or a hero?  This and other bad memories of slavery plague Sethe everyday.  The quality of Beloved is based more on the reader's opinion then anything else.  If you love being critical with books and love to read \\""in between the lines,\\"" this book is definitely for you.  This novel is filled with mind twisting scenarios.

This book was a confusing book to read and very hard to follow.  With her own mesmerizing style, she confuses the reader as well as the characters in the story.  So when the characters in the story seems to be confused, Morrison wants you as the reader to feel the same way as the character is feeling in the story.  From the start of the story Morrison throws out a lot of information within the very first paragraph.  She gets most of the information out there and leaves you to fiddle with it and put it in your own understanding.  While reading the book I found myself going back and forth to figure out what kind of sense Morrison was making.  Half the time Morrison had the characters jumping back to past memories and suddenly awaken to the present where the conversation would pick up where it left off.  This was one of the most confusing things about the book in which I found.  It is up to you as an individual reader to critique this book.  If I gave my honest opinion on Beloved, I would have to say that this book is well worth reading.  Morrison gives you bits and pieces of information throughout the story and leaves you to fill it.  With this the reader can use his/her own imagination and thoughts to fill in the missing bits and pieces.  This is one of the styles Morrison uses throughout the book that entices the reader to go on.  Although this was a good book that Morrison wrote, I would probably not read another book like this again because of the confusing style.  Morrison brought her characters to life throughout the story.  She used vivid imagery and went into extensive detail in the story.  With this kind of imagery, this is what held me on to reading.  The story is about a woman name Sethe and how she kills her infant daughter rather than putting her through the hardships of being a slave.  Living with a conscious of killing her daughter, Sethe is bothered by it and tries to let go.  Her daughter comes back to haunt Sethe in a form only to be known as Beloved.d tries to let go.

I had never read one of Morrion's works before and was unfamiliar with her style; what I read surprised me.  Morrison jumps right into the story without introducing the reader to any of the characters first. Because of this unique style the first few pages were a whirlwind of names and events I knew nothing about. I had to pause after the first chapter to try and make sense of everything. However, the more I read the more the book, and its characters, pulled me in; and the characters are what make this book good. Each character has many sides to his or her personality; Sethe, strong yet haunted by the past, Paul D, nurturing yet wanting to leave, and Denver, jealous and alone. Each character is believable and anybody can relate to them on some level. The book, however, is not perfect.  Although Morrison's unorthodox style is beautiful, it's also confusing. Morrison is like a juggler tossing all these balls into the air, yet never telling the reader which ball to focus on.

The newly freed slaves were depending on the Constitution to give them the rights that every man is born with, but daily life for the ex-slaves continued to be a struggle.  This is the case for the main character of the story, Sethe, who had to confront the demons of her past.  In 124 Bluestone Road Sethe and Denver are haunted by the ghost of her baby daughter whom she killed in an act of love and mercy.  Sethe, unwilling to take abuse from School Teacher, decides to runaway from Sweet Home with the rest of her family.  When confronted with the reality that they may be caught, she takes the life of her two-year-old daughter to prevent a life of slavery and injustice for her child.  The baby ghost prevents Sethe and Denver to have any friends but the ghost itself.  This changes when an acquaintance of Sethe's comes to 124.  Morrison uses Paul D. as a tool to get a feel of Sethe's emotions.  Within a little while of his visit, Paul D. rids the house of the ghost.  This creates tension with Denver because the baby ghost was her only playmate.  He becomes a major factor in forcing Sethe to talk about events of her past.  Paul D. is the person that provokes emotions from other characters: happiness with Sethe, anger with Denver, and resentment with Beloved.  A touch of the supernatural is evident with the flesh and blood reincarnation of the baby ghost in Beloved.  The characters in the story don't question whether the ghost is real or not because they all believe in ghosts.  Beloved comes as a young runaway slave and is offered shelter with Sethe.  She then dominates the household so forcefully that Sethe and Denver are at the verge of starvation.  Sethe, without even trying, lets Beloved take charge in the household.  Sethe loves Beloved so much and maybe feels guilt for her actions so Beloved is able to dictate her mother's life.  It appeared to look like Beloved would literally kill them but that all changed when Denver decides to get out of the isolation that she has lived with all her life and do something to help her with her family's situation.

As Sethe takes us back to her past, we learn about her unconceivable choice to slaughter her baby girl.  Sethe wanted to spare her child the burden of slavery, but can her dead daughter accept that?  Sethe is forced to deal with Beloved, as she comes back to haunt her mother, until Paul D chases her away.  However, Beloved refuses to be separated from Sethe and comes back to her in the form of a young lady.  Beloved definitely encompasses the burden of slavery in a controversial way.  One might say that he/she can understand why Sethe slaughtered her child and tried to kill her other children, but I absolutely can't understand her actions.  What kind of mother could actually slaughter her own child with a hand axe?  That is such a gruesome death.  Furthermore, I would never be able to understand how a mother could carry her child for nine months, bring in into the world, and be the very one to kill it.  Sethe's psychological problems would be the only way that I could justify her actions.  I'm not a black person, so I would never be able to understand the effects of slavery from a personal perspective, but you don't need to be black to know that no one deserves to be slaughtered.  I somewhat understand how much the black slaves suffered, and I definitely understand why Sethe didn't want her children to go through the things that she experienced.  However, if Sethe really wanted to protect her children she had another option.  If Sethe was in her right state of mind, she could have simply self-inflicted a miscarriage.  Despite my refusal to accept the reason why Sethe killed her child, her choice of action definitely challenges my thoughts.  Her choice of action makes me wonder about the depth of slavery.  Killing a child in order to protect it reflects the unimaginable hardships and separations that black families experienced.

Two things of value emerge from the reading experience: the coming of age story of Sethe's daughter, Denver, and the use of Beloved as a metaphor for the holocaust that was the pre-emancipation African-American experience.

This is the question Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winner (and probably the greatest woman novelist of the twentieth century), Toni  Morrison, explores in her rich, densely-layered novel, Beloved.<br />Set after  the end of the Civil War, when slaves were freed by emancipation, but still  victims of random acts of violence, the book also serves as a metaphor for  the legacy of slavery and asks the chillingly relevant question:  Why is  the leading cause of death among young, African-American men murder by  another black?<br />Beloved's protagonist is Sethe, an escaped slave and  mother of four.  Her joy at successfully escaping her former master while  pregnant and giving birth before finally finding refuge at her  spiritually-nourishing mother-in-law's home, vanishes a mere twenty-eight  days later.<br />The sight of a cruel white slave owner's hat sends Sethe and  her children running to a woodshed where she is forced to confront demons  no loving mother should ever have to face.<br />Sethe's demons do not  disappear when she emerges from the woodshed, however, and settles down in  a small Ohio town.  Instead, they remain to both haunt her and help her to  understand the violence that occurred so many years previously.<br />Morrison,  as skillful a storyteller as ever lived, spins a gorgeously heartbreaking  tale in Beloved, and one whose plot is impossible to predict.  With a  mastery of language given to only a few, this extraordinarily talented  author weaves subplot upon subplot and brings each exquisitely created  character to life.<br />There is Paul D, another slave who escaped from the  same plantation as did Sethe but who has not seen Sethe for more than a  decade when he once again encounters her and the two of them contemplate  what they hope will finally be a bright future for both.<br />There is Denver,  Sethe's daughter, a troubled and isolated teenager whose life encompasses  little more than her immediate surroundings and whose social interactions  have dwindled down to embrace only her mother and the ghost of her  long-dead sister.<br />And then, there is Beloved, the centerpiece of this  exquisitely wirtten, lyrically beautiful book.<br />While Sethe appears to  embrace a logic that says, &quot;Before the while man destroys you, let me  do it,&quot; Morrison, herself, tells us that it is time for us to look  beyond the past and move on.<br />Today, more than twenty years after the  passage of the Civil Rights Act, African Americans are, in many ways, worse  off than they were before.  The question plaguing most black Americans  seems to be whether to cast their lot with the whites of the community or  to separate, turn inward and seek their own redemption...alone.<br />In  Beloved, Morrison uses the character of Ella, one of the leaders of her  small Ohio community, to metaphorically explore this issue.  &quot;Whatever  Sethe had done, Ella didn't like the idea of past errors taking possession  of the present...Daily life took as much as she had.  The future was  sunset; the past was something to leave behind.  And if it didn't stay  behind, well, you might have to stomp it out.  Slave life; freed life;  every day was a test and trial.  Nothing could be counted on in a world  where even when you were a solution you were a problem. 'Sufficient unto  the day is the evil thereof,' and nobody needed more; nobody needed a grown  up evil sitting at the table with a grudge.  As long as the ghost showed  out from its ghostly place, shaking stuff, crying, smashing and such--Ella  respected it.  But if it took flesh and came in her world, well, the shoe  was on the other foot.  She didn't mind a little communication between the  two worlds, but this was an invasion.&quot;<br />Beloved is first and foremost  a brilliantly crafted and mesmerizing story, faultlessly told by one of the  world's most gifted storytellers.  It is a story of ghosts--those that  haunt Sethe and those that haunt all of us.  Beloved is not magic realism,  nor does it contain elements of magic realism.  Magic realism, by its very  nature, requires that the fantastic be accepted as mundane by those  experiencing it.  There is certainly nothing mundane about Morrison's ghost  and her acceptance by Sethe.<br />Although most of the novel's characters  ostracize Sethe and blame her for her past, Morrison, herself, does not.  Instead, she wisely extends a vision of harmony to the black community that  exhorts them to let go of their past, no matter how painful, and move  ahead.<br />Beloved and Sethe must, eventually, come to terms with the past  and with each other, just as the community must come to terms with  itself.<br />In the end, Beloved's protagonists decide on different paths to  follow, some of which are quite surprising, although always  heart-rending.<br />Morrison, however, remains true to the vision she created  in Beloved:  those who cannot let go of the past will ultimately  self-destruct; those who can respect its lessons and mourn its loss but not  feel indebted to right its wrongs, will find themselves endowed with  unexpected, joyous freedom.hosts--those that  haunt Sethe and those that haunt all of us.

The story itself is  all right, but I found it rather uninspired.  Obviously the author has an  axe to grind about the way African-Americans were treated in the days of  slavery (whom among us wouldn't, especially those of African heritage?),  but I thought the artifice of using a ghost as a means of addressing the  evils of slavery rather far-fetched.

(^_^)","Beloved, an unimaginable tale of slavery and it's aftermath, is truly a heartwrenching and astounding novel.  Sethe, a former slave, escapes from her life of slavery to Ohio only to be haunted by her past all over again.  Through all the hardships Sethe has faced, her only weakness is her  children.  Sethe is haunted by the decision she made years earlier, the  decision she believed at the time was best for her child.  Sethe's past  comes back in the form of a ghost (Beloved) and is determined to never let  Sethe forget about her past mistakes.  When I first started reading this  book, I had a hard time understanding the story line because of the way  Toni Morrison brings about her characters and plot.  She uses  &quot;rememory&quot; and many complicated metaphors to bring up important  subjects that are vital to the story.  For instance, she constantly and  unexpectedly shifts from present to past tenses which often confuses the  reader.  Also, she introduces new characters into the novel unexpectedly  and does not explain them until later on.  Extended metaphors are used to  force the reader to actually think and try to figure out the true meaning  of the book.  For example, throughout the book, Sethe keeps mentioning that  she has a &quot;tree&quot; growing on her back.  Readers are left  dumbfounded and curious about what she is talking about.  It is not until  later in the novel that we find out that the &quot;tree&quot; on Sethe's  back is actually the scars and markings from when she was whipped by the  schoolmaster and his boys back at Sweet Home, where she used to be  enslaved.  The permanent scars, which formed the shape of a  &quot;chokecherry tree&quot; on Sethe's back, not only refers to the  physical scars but also refers to the mental scars that will serve as a  reminder of slavery that will never be erased from Sethe's mind.  Even  though Morrison's use of &quot;rememory&quot; and metaphors can be  confusing to some readers, these little touches are also what make's  Morrison's style so unique and enjoyable to read.

Everyone has forgotten about the young babe, but the slayer's barbaric image still lingers fresh on the  minds of observers and only grows fresher when the infant's ghost returns  to haunt her mother's home. Sethe and her only remaining child, Denver,  have grown accustomed to the always-present sense of evil that floats  bitterly through their home. All of that changes though, when Paul D, an  old friend, arrives unexpectedly at Sethe's door and scares the infant away  with his rage over the constant injustices in life. For a single mother and  former slave, who has lost all of her children but one, and who is  constantly plagued by the haunting memory of her past, this liberation  proves to be the gift of life. That is until, Beloved, a mysterious girl  with no one else in the world, and who seems to know everything about  Sethe, appears suddenly and re-imprisons Sethe's joy.<br />  Through the  feeling created on Sethe and Denver's livelihood, by the infant's ghost,  and by Beloved, Morrison leaves the reader with a sense of an aggressive  authority fixedly breaking the life of a less omnipotent figure. During  Sethe's fugitive days when her former master hunted her like a hungry  savage, Sethe attempted to save her four children by unmercifully killing  them. Although a lasting memory, all her efforts were unsuccessful except  one, her eldest daughter, who was only a little over one year old at the  time, perished during Sethe's brutal rage. While the child was alive, Sethe  constantly feared the presence and power of white authority, but the moment  that the child's last breath rolled from her lips, that authority faded  away like a forgotten dream.  As Sethe and her surviving family  painstakingly moved on with their lives, an evil, lonely and unwanted  presence moved in to their home, and although, with the death of her baby,  the physical authority, had disappeared, the threat lingered on in their  minds, when the ghost arrived. Their joy was never quite satisfied; it was  as if it was always shaded over by a somber shadow, the sun never shone on  their souls. That is until, one bright day, Paul D, an old acquaintance,  suddenly appeared, like an angel, on Sethe's porch and, distraught by the  constant and never ending challenges blacks have been plagued with,  wrathfully breaks out, and chases out the infant's ghost. As soon as the  presence has left, it is like a giant weight was lifted off of Denver and  Sethe's shoulder, their joy finally radiates from all of the dark shaded  years it was quieted. For the first time since Sethe was had her child, and  for the first time in Denver's life, they are bursting with joy. The  removal of the ghost removed any of their lingering fears of white  authority, or any other powerful master figure. Unfortunately, the baby  returns, not as a ghost this time, but as a mysterious young woman who is  lost in the world, but whom both Sethe and Denver feel attracted to by  something deep inside them which they cannot control. This mysterious girl,  Beloved, they can not see it themselves, but removes the light and  happiness which has shone in them for this short time, her presence entraps  them, and at the same time separates them from one another. So, just as the  feeling of authoritative threat vanished with the infant, it returned.  Beloved and the baby are like government officials, when they have spent a  considerable length of time monitoring one place, and they feel that they  have scare the people enough that they no longer feel that their presence  is needed to enforce the law, they move on. For a while, that threat  lingers, and the fear stands in people's minds, until, one day, a person  who is has not yet made the acquaintance of these officials, arrives and  gives rebirth to the people's joy. It is then evident that they are not  longer weaker than their government, and that they too can have fun, but it  is when the officials return, that it is the hardest.  The harder people  resist the authority, the harder they will fall when they break anew.  That  is what happened to Paul D. Beloved was blunt towards him, and when she  over powered him, she broke him for good.

Each main character's consciousness is like a separate instrument in a jazz ensemble and Morrison improvises within each character's consciousness upon the melody of Sethe's story.  Escaped from slavery, Sethe has buried the memory of her experience  and in this tale the memories slowly, in fragments, without chronological  order, begin to emerge, thanks largely to the appearance of Paul D, a man  from her slave past.  The story moves through Sethe's consciousness as well  as Paul D's, Sethe's daughter Denver's, the ghost's, and the consciousness  of other characters.<br />As readers, we learn about slavery from the inside  out.  Not only do we learn about being enslaved, but we learn about the  experience of being free.  This story is about codes of conduct and we  witness Baby Suggs, and then Sethe, violate the former slaves' code and we  see the community of former slaves betray Sethe and her family as a  consequence.<br />Morrison's exploration of Sethe being betrayed and shunned  by her own people is courageous and moves us into the complex history of  African-American community relationships.  Can this community welcome Sethe  back into its fold?  Can Sethe ever be ready to accept others into her  intimacy again? Can Sethe heal from having been treated atrociously and  from committing an atrocity herself?  How is memory an agent of healing?  And, finally, how does Toni Morrison explore all of these questions in the  context of a ghost story?<br />This novel is deeply internal.  It resides in  the memories, dreams, thoughts, and stories of its characters.  As the  fragments begin to cohere, we see a profoundly moving and, I think, healing  tale unfold.<br />In this novel, Toni Morrison has beautifully reconstructed  history so that we imaginatively experience slavery from the inside of  those who experienced it.  The lyrical language of each character's soul  vibrates with joy, suffering, longing, desire, and hope.  I consider  *Beloved* a divinely inspired novel.

Some people might think what she  did was crazy but,I think if I or anyone in her shoes might have done the  same. I believe probably if anyone was suffering in life so bad they would  want to die rather than suffer. If you were in a coma with wires all around  you and no chance of ever becoming normal again would you want someone to  pull the plug for you? Or if you know that your child will never be free  and will be under someones power for the rest of his/her life would you try  to do something about it?

US,50553123,R9IDTVXI5L01G,0452280621,675572194,Beloved,Books,2,1,3,N,N,"how beloved is this book","BELOVED BY TONI MORRISON: BOOK REVIEW<br />Toni Morrison sets the story in post-Civil War Ohio of Sethe, an escaped slave who has risked her life in order to save herself from a living death.  This living death is described  as her lost husband and a buried child.  She now lives with her daughter,  Denver, her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, and a disturbing, apparition  \\""Beloved\\"".  Morrison focuses the theme on relationships between a master  and slave, and marriage. Different views are introduced between Mr. Garner  and School teacher's belief of slavery.  Mr. Garner treated slaves as human  beings as School teacher sees slaves as inferior.  Sethe says the teacher  would wrap string all over her head, cross her nose around her behind, and  number the teeth she had.  The image that the author reflects is the  different white masters of that time.  Morrison wanted to explain how  people behave when they are given absolute power over other people.  Both  Mr. Garner and School teacher begin believing in superiority and later  justifying their decisions by it.  Mr. Garner gives an example when he  doesn't use violence to get his slaves to work but listens to them, allows  them to use guns, and calls them men.  On the other hand, School teacher  demonstrates his power immediately and separate himself as superiority as  he tells his nephew to list Sethe's human qualities on one side of a paper  and her animal qualities on the other side.  Acknowledgement by masters of  marriages between their slaves was not to be.  This is evident when church  or community didn't recognize Sethe's marriage to Halle because there was  no ceremony, nothing to mark their union.  Morrison also shows the reader  that slaves were of minor importance to their masters as Sethe is sent to  prison for damage to Mr. Garner's property when she killed Beloved.  Throughout the work, Morrison creates an idea that human beings are  merchandise, where everything has its own price.  The statement that  Morrison points out by linking these relationships is that slaves were the  ones caught in the middle of the war even though the whole point of the  Civil War was to free the slaves.  Like Stamp Paid says, there were still  black refugees who didn't know the war was over and it didn't seem any  different.  Morrison's work reflects history from the black viewpoint as  she showed psychological and long-term damage slavery made on black people.  Physical damage was expressed through the \\""chokeberry tree\\"" that was on  Sethe's back from whippings.  I believe Morrison makes good use of flash  backs where she links the past to the present but she could've been more  clear in defining characters because the reader sometimes gets confused as  to which character is doing what.rison points out by linking these relationships is that slaves were the  ones caught in the middle of the war even though the whole point of the  Civil War was to free the slaves.

Toni Morrison ties all of these elements together into the mosaic called Beloved. Morrison's work flourishes with literary techniques that bring the story to life, but  occasionally throw the reader into a spiraling confusion because of its  occasional anachronisms and chronological imbalances. The intertwining  story gets under your skin and tempts you to ponder thoughts and issues  Morrison illustrates through factors such as symbolism or her own personal  style. Brilliantly written, Morrison unveils the life of Sethe, a woman  haunted by her past of slavery, hardship, and murder. Ohio, plagued by  post-civil war corruption and graft, is where Sethe tries to raise the  remainder of her family in 124, a structure haunted by the ghost of her  child. The child whose throat she slit in order to prevent her from  enduring the same torture of slavery, the child for whom she exchanged ten  minutes of sex to give a decent title on her grave stone, the child who  comes back to poison and corrode Sethe's own being and destroy her hope.  Symbolism erupts in constant allusions to Sethe's enslaving past and her  memories of the trials she endured. Just the simple task of describing  Sethe's wedding dress becomes a maze of symbolism to the difficulties of  the past. Sethe, determined to have a different dress on her wedding day,  searches for scraps of fabric which could be borrowed to creatively  construct a dress that only would have to be taken apart and later  returned. &quot;Now the back was a problem...I couldn't find a thing that  wouldn't be missed right away&quot; but finally a piece of mosquito net  used as a jelly strainer was sufficiently allotted for the task. This  refers to Sethe's life and her struggle for escape from the monotonous  torture of slavery. Her bits and pieces of experiences and tragedies were  not even her own but merely lent to her, forcing her to suffer and learn  about hardship. Her past, a time of monotonous torture which she tries with  her utmost might to cover up, puts all her efforts to no avail as she  cannot hide a past which will always be visible despite her attempts to  disguise it. Another evident symbol is Paul D's tobacco tin, which he uses  as a prison for harboring his own past. He does not want to remember the  hardships of the slavery he endured so he keeps all of his memories locked  away in his tobacco tin, rusted shut, forbidden to be opened.  He  &quot;never worried about his little tobacco tin anymore. It was rusted  shut.&quot; However, it is in the weak moment of Beloved's seduction that  his guard is let down and he gives in. When he calls her name, he doesn't  hear &quot;the whisper that the flakes of rust made...as they fell away from  the seams of his tobacco tin. So when the lid gave he didn't know it.&quot;  He couldn't prevent his past from resurfacing, and because of his  carelessness in such a needy time of strength, his past was brought to his  attention, forcing him to realize his mistake.  Yet another aspect  highlighted in the book is Morrison's personal interference in the plot of  the story. Upon reading certain selections it can be assumed that the  author may incorporate some sense of bitterness toward whites because of  the savage acts used against the descendants of slaves. The mere fact that  Baby Suggs, in her days nearest death, would lie in her bed and contemplate  color, is just one fact that may (or may not) depict Morrison's bitterness  toward whites. &quot;Winter in Ohio was especially rough if you had an  appetite for color.&quot;  A winter's white snow was not sufficient for  satisfying Baby Suggs's craving for color. And an even clearer example is  in Sethe's reminiscence of Baby Suggs's words: &quot;There is no bad luck  in the world but whitefolks.&quot; Still, these could be exaggerations or  coincidences, two of many throughout the novel, but each reader has the  freedom to his own judgment.  After reading this work of  implausible conviction, a deep impression sets in on its readers. An  impression so strong, our focus on certain issues such as slavery and  freedom, living and letting go, may be dramatically altered.After reading this work of  implausible conviction, a deep impression sets in on its readers.

These are all things a reader may associate with Toni Morrison's novel Beloved.  But how can so many extremely different views be given to one novel?  A reader will  encounter all of these  different feelings as he reads this novel, which  will most likely come in an order.  This is not a novel for a reader who  needs to have a threaded plot which can be easily connected.  The style  that she uses is new, and requires patience on the reader's part.  Morrison  uses very impactful imagery and metaphores in the story which requires very  critical reading in order to comprehend the depth.  The everlasting effects  of slavery that scars the human soul are picked apart by Morrison during  the story.  Furthermore, she explores how one can never truly be free once  a horrible experiece has scarred your life.  The feeling the reader  will have for the story will come as he comprehends the novel.  At first,  the novel is very frustrating and confusing due to the constant  &quot;jumping&quot; Morrison does from past to present and the constant  changing of views during the story.  Her style is very hard to flow with,  as it seems to be broken apart and pieced back together wrongly.  When you  finally feel that you are getting in touch with a character and starting to  understand what is going on, the point of view is suddenly changed, or you  may find yourself suddenly in the past.  The large gaps within the story  are finally filled in much later, when you may have already forgotten about  it.  Questions you may ask in the beginning like: &quot;why did Sethe kill  her child and try to kill the others?,&quot; or &quot;who is  Beloved?,&quot; are finally answered toward the end of the novel.  Although very difficult to understand, Toni Morrison's style in the novel  is very clever and hypnotic.  You only fully understand how Morrison's  style in the book is being used after you understand the plot and how she  comes across telling it.  Also, the plot and style are so closely connected  you are able to see the plot more clearly if you understand the style.  When the reader is done with the novel, he may finally understand why  Morrison used the style of cutting back and forth, from past to present, in  her novel.  The reason for this is: the whole novel is about memories, and  how those experiences which have scarred Sethe, plauge her soul.  Everything that happens in the book, acts upon a character as a stimuli,  triggering memories back to the horrible days of slavery at Sweet Home.  This style also brings us the theme, which is &quot;you are never really  free of slavery,&quot; because, the memories and fear, stay with you  forever.  Toni Morrison fully explores the lasting effects slavery has  upon the human soul.  Those effects are the theme.  Those memories of  slavery which scarred Sethe's life, forge her future.  Sethe was never able  to move on with her life and forget the memories.  Ultimately, the  hardships that scarred her within caused her to kill her children.  When  she saw those white men coming to 124, all those memories buried deep  within the chasm of her heart resurfaced and the fear she had once  experienced at Sweet Home returned.  She killed her children, because she  never wanted them to experience the horror she had to endure. These events  would stay in her memory and haunt her for the rest of the story.  The  experience of slavery led to chain of events which ruined her life, because  she was not able to leave the past in the past and move on.  The  brilliance of her novel only comes to life when you have read her story  very critically.  Although you as the reader may be tempted to pass by  parts of the story you do not understand, if analyzed critically, those  sections may lead to the most critical and interesting imagery and  metaphores in the story.  One such event is the two turtles coming out of  the river.  &quot;The gravity of their shields, clashing, countered and  mocked the floating heads touching.&quot;  The shells of the two turtles  keep them away from each other even though they are trying to be with each  one another.  Their shells are the sheilds people put up in a relationship  to keep themselves from being hurt.  Because of past experiences, people  are afraid to give all of themselves in the fear that, when they are fully  exposed, at their most vulnerable, they will be hurt.  Even though they  love each other, their past still controls their future.  This novel,  to me, included all that has been stated in the preceeding paragraphs.  It  was frustrating and confusing at first, when the plot and theme could not  be made out easily.  Her style confused me, so I read on without thinking  about anything else.

Indeed, Morrison faced a difficult task before she sat down and began Beloved, since she was not the first to write about the hardships  of colored people.  She had to incorporate something into her novel to set  her apart from all the other authors.  A unique style would surely make it  an original work...but only if it was executed properly.  Morrison fell short  of a masterpiece because her novel was too confusing and frustrating.  By  trying to be different, she failed to accurately convey her ideas to her  audience.  I found I was always lost in the plot.  In fact, by the time I  got to the fourth page, I was already fed up with Morrison and her style.  Due to Morrison's many narrators and time frames, I had a lot of unclear  pictures forming in my mind as I read.

Although Morrison told the story, she referred  to the white girl as Amy, and I wondered where Sethe had gotten Denver  from.  Finally, in the last paragraph of the chapter, she tells us Denver  is Amy's last name.  Not all of my questions were answered.  Some remain  unclear even though I've already finished the book.  For example, what  happened to Halle? Morrison doesn't say what became of him.  Did he die?  Why did Sixo laugh when he was being burned?  Morrison mentioned that Paul  D guessed what Sixo was laughing at, but she never disclosed that  information.  Why did Baby Suggs call herself a liar?  What is the  &quot;hot thing&quot;?  All of these questions drift in my mind,  unanswered.  While I was reading, I often felt like I was playing Memory  with Morrison...and I always lost. In Memory, when I stumble upon a matching  card, I have already forgotten where the first card was.  Likewise, in  Beloved I couldn't remember what subtle hint Morrison had left 70 pages  beforehand, so I often didn't make the significant connections.  I had to  wait too long to find out what was happening, and in some cases, I'm still  waiting! I disliked the book and wouldn't recommend it to anyone as  impatient as I am.  Beloved is too befuddling and unsatisfying; Morrison  left me guessing way too many times for my liking.

Morrison brings to life the struggles and pains of slaves through the lives of her characters.  She creates a story filled with imagery, clearly depicting their struggles  and giving her readers a deeper understanding. Morrison's style of writing  forces a reader to read on and solve the mystery of Sethe's past.  The book Beloved has a unique style where its details are revealed to the  readers one after another.  Morrison uses a &quot;jigsaw puzzle&quot; type  of writing where details of the story are given to the readers piece by  piece.  As the story progresses, it is the reader's job to slowly piece the  puzzle together, leaving a clear picture of the whole puzzle at the end.  This style of &quot;putting the pieces of a puzzle back together&quot; is a  great example of how Morrison illustrates the life of a slave.  A person's  life after entering slavery is filled with struggles and pains, resulting  in a life that is literally shattered into pieces.  After freedom, this  person must then put back the pieces of his life together and find his true  self once again.  Not only is this true for slaves, but for anyone who has  had to overcome an obstacle in his life.  In addition to Morrison's  style, Morrison's use of imagery clearly shows the struggle that not only  Sethe has had to overcome, but slaves and people in general.  For example,  Sethe's wedding dress. In the novel, Sethe describes her dress by stating,  &quot;the top was from two pillow cases...the front of the shirt was a  dresser scarf...old sashes...(59).&quot; Here, Sethe's struggles are  clearly depicted.  The pieces of different materials are good illustrations  of her life and how she tries to piece it back together; however, Sethe  also states, &quot;Now the back was a problem for the longest time  (59).&quot; The back of her wedding dress represents Sethe's past and how  when everything is finally over, Sethe is having the hardest time  overcoming it. Another struggle depicted in the story is the struggle that  Paul D and Sethe must overcome.  Morrison writes, &quot;The embracing  necks--hers stretching up towards his...No height was beyond her yearning  neck, ...the gravity of their shields clashing, countered and  mocked...(105).&quot; The shields of the two turtles signify the barrier  between Paul D and Sethe. This is how Morrison depicts the yearning and  struggle they have to overcome.  Equally important are the themes  Morrison tries to convey in her novel. Morrison covers various themes, but  one theme is the issue of power relationship.  For centuries, power  relationships are one thing a person will always come across.  In Beloved,  Morrison focuses on the power relationship between master and slave, white  and black, and between husband and wife.  One example where Morrison shows  the power relationship between master and slave is between the  Schoolteacher and Sethe.  The Schoolteacher separates himself as superior  and slaves as a sub race, as shown when the Schoolteacher tells his nephew  to list Sethe's animal qualities (208). However, after the Civil war, the  master and slave relationship changes to white and black relationship;  still, with the whites having more power over the blacks.  Furthermore, by  showing Paul D is the only man to get Sethe to let down her guard a little  and the only person who could drive out the spirit, Morrison is able to  illustrate the power relationship between husband and wife.  However, in  life, no matter where anyone goes, there will always be someone you must  answer to, meaning no one is really ever free, except within his self.  All in all, Morrison uses a style of writing, which is able to keep her  readers on their toes throughout the novel.  She creates a novel so compact  with detail that it seems almost overwhelming and unbelievable, but quite  relevant. Although, Beloved may seem favorable to blacks, especially former  slaves, Morrison covers the issues of struggle, pain, and love.  Morrison  creates a story everyone can relate to in one way or another; so, not only  is Beloved a book about slavery, but it is also a book about life and what  everyone must go through.rrison covers the issues of struggle, pain, and love.

Readers are drawn into  Sethe's life as she tries to overcome the guilt of killing one of her  babies as well as deal with her past so she can have a sense of healing  thus allowing her to move on to her future. Although, Morrison's  inconsistency of time periods and character point of view may be a bit  confusing, her complex characters and stunning use of symbolism within her  plot somehow acts as a magnetic force drawing the reader into the story.  Morrison sets the story with Sethe beginning to move on with her life by  ignoring her past. Beloved, the daughter she killed, then unexpectedly  arrives in the flesh forcing Sethe to reveal things she wanted to forget.  Beloved untangles Sethe's web of secret feelings and experiences. Thus not  only allowing Sethe to heal but also giving Denver the opportunity to hear  stories she was always denied of knowing about and allowing her to grow  with the knowledge of the pain her mother went through. Morrison creates  this theory by writing, \\""Denver spoke, Beloved listened, and the two did  the best they could to create what really happened, how it really was,  something only Sethe knew...\\""  As the reader becomes more aware of  Sethe's secrets, Morrison uses flashbacks to make bigger impressions.  Impressions to give readers an idea of how unbelievably unfair slaves were  treated. Such experiences as Sethe's milk being stolen could not be left  with a simple one-sentence description. Morrison cleverly uses a  conversation between Sethe and Paul D. to show the reader just how cruel  white men were to slaves. \\""They beat you and you was pregnant? And they  took my milk!\\""  Morrison intertwines into her plot an incredible use  of symbolism. It seems as though almost event could symbolize something if  you really think with an open mind. A simple thing like Sethe's home made  wedding dress mean more than it seems. One may think it is just pieces of  scrap material pieced together, but in actuality it represents Sethe's  life. Each piece of material is a part of Sethe's life and the back of the  dress being hard to find is Sethe's past as it is also hard to deal with  and causes great struggle in her life. Morrison's symbolism allows critical  readers to take one step further to totally understand where Sethe is  coming from.  One factor that causes readers to be discouraged to  continue the book is that as Morrison flashbacks to different time periods  the reader has the tendency to become confused. Along with the time periods  the character point of view also sporadically changes. Readers are forced  to pay close attention to detail to figure out where they are in the story.  This is a factor that causes readers to be discouraged to continue the  book.  Whether the response by a reader is good or bad, the reader is  curious as to what the conclusion to the story will be or at least  intrigued as to why Morrison would use certain events or dialogue.

US,50553038,R2K8TLYXQEL7CV,0452280621,675572194,Beloved,Books,2,2,3,N,N,"Beloved is more frustrating then entertaining.","Beloved is a beautifully written story about the horrors of slavery. This description barely scratches the surface of Toni Morrison's enchanting yet confusing tale of slavery at its worst. The novel mainly tells of Sethe, a  freed slave that is struggling with her past. A past that she desperately  is trying to forget in order to move on and protect her daughter Denver,  the only of her four children that has remained with her. The others,  Howard and Buglar, had run away from the ghost of Beloved, who was murdered  by Sethe's hand. This little amount of information alone is not made known  to the reader until after the first few chapters, where the story finally  starts to take off, but in too many directions. Morrison's style is as  complicated as the story line of Beloved and is as branched as the scar on  Sethe's back. It is as if Morrison just wrote down what came to her in no  particular order. There are many different &quot;mini&quot; plots going on  at once, such as Sethe's and Paul D's stories, which makes the reader  confused. It is especially confusing when one chapter talks about Sethe and  the next chapter tells of Paul D's chain gang, mentioned chapters before.  More so, Paul D's and Sethe's voices aren't the only ones in the book. The  story changes points of view many times from Sethe to Paul D to Denver,  Beloved, Baby Suggs, and even Stamp Paid. Baby Suggs is dead and Stamp Paid  is not even a main character; yet we know more about him then we should,  while we know less about Beloved and Halle, important characters in which  Morrison leaves us guessing about. What happened to Halle? How did Beloved  come back and why? These are just two of the unanswered questions Morrison  fails to answer. It is not as if there were no opportunities to answer  these questions. In fact the story is so full of flashbacks, that it is at  times hard to tell the difference between past and present. Sure,  Morrison's style keeps the reader waiting for answers and anticipating to  find out what happens or happened, but at times in leaves the reader  surrounded in confusion that makes the novel frustrating. Adding to the  frustration and beauty of Beloved is the heavy symbolism Morrison uses.  Every page seems to have something with a double meaning. Readers are  forced to read between the lines and to try and figure out what they mean  and how important it is to the story. Trees are used often in Beloved to  symbolize barriers such as those between Sethe and Paul D, Sethe and her  past, and Denver and the world. Similarly, the turtles trying to mate  symbolizes the barrier between Paul D and Sethe, which is the past. Beloved  herself could symbolize the past, due to her causing Sethe to speak of her  memories which she rather forget. All this symbolism adds to the richness  of the writing in Beloved, yet can annoy readers. Trying to find the  meanings of all these symbols can be disturbing, leaving you wondering if  you caught on to what Morrison intended to imply.  I had a love/hate  relationship with Beloved. Overall, I liked it more than I hated it. It was  more than just an angry slave story. The characters were realistic, I  sympathized with Sethe, but I don't think killing her child was the right  thing to do. I felt sorry for Denver and her loneliness, and I could not  believe that Paul D. could sleep with Beloved and not tell Sethe. The  story, although most times confusing, paid off in the end for me. I got a  satisfaction when I put all the pieces together and understood most of the  story at the end. The slavery, the escape, the murder, the haunting, the  return...it makes better sense when you have read everything and can put it  in order. Of course , not everything is summed up perfectly. The last  chapter is a loss to me, and the chapters with Beloved's point of view is  too confusing; punctuation and complete sentences would have helped to make  it clearer. Also, I would have liked to see what happened in the futurewith Sethe, Paul D, and Denver. I think ending the story with a bright hope  for the future would have been good since it was filled with the horrors of  the past. I would recommend this book to those who are tired of the regular  style of writing and who enjoy stories about slavery and human struggles,  but be prepared to be frustrated; this book is not for the impatient.with Sethe, Paul D, and Denver.

I don't think so.","&quot;A brutally powerful, mesmerizing story...read it and tremble,&quot; says People magazine about Toni Morrison's Beloved. Why, I ask? Powerful and mesmerizing? The only thing I trembled about was the thought of reading  the story. Beloved is not the first book about colored people that I have  read. Those I have read before, I enjoyed. However, because Toni Morrison's  style is so unique, it's also hard to comprehend its uniqueness. Others  have read Beloved and have been mesmerized by it. I'm not one of them.<br />  The story is full of holes and parallels that take a critical reader to  fill as one reads it. This makes Beloved hard to read because there is a  lot of back flipping of pages when information may be hiding. As I read  Beloved, I began to get lost. I formed questions in my mind about  characters such as Halle. The story never mentions what happens to Halle  other than him going on with an original plan to escape from Sweet Home.  What became of Halle? Also, a part of the story mentions Baby Suggs as a  cobbler. She is spoken of as &quot;Baby Suggs holy.&quot; A cobbler is the  mender of shoes and soles. Someone told me that in the first act of Julius  Caesar, someone calls him the mender of souls and asked if I thought that  Morrison had read Julius Caesar and was comparing Baby Suggs to Julius  Caesar. Who would have known this fact unless you happened to be reading  Beloved and Julius Caesar at the same time? Reading between the lines is  something that not everyone does as one reads. I sometimes read between the  lines, but this story just left me hanging.<br /> Because the story is  about colored people, it seems as if the author still holds contempt for  what white people had done to African-Americans in slavery. One example of  this is Sethe's wedding dress. It was mad of a scarf, a sash, pillowcases,  and other stolen items could find. The wedding dress does not have a back  at some point and this may symbolize how Morrison could not let go of the  past because of the emotional pain she may feel about the slavery issue.  Baby Suggs says in the story, &quot;There is no bad luck in the world but  whitefolks.&quot; This statement makes the author' feelings of white people  even more clear to readers. The slavery issue is not longer an issue  because slaves were freed from the outcome of the Civil War. There are  still hard feelings about the slavery issue, but it's over and one just has  to make the choice of overcoming it and getting on with oneself.<br />  Morrison also changes the point of view in Beloved. Most of it is done in  third person. However, in part two of the story, Morrison begins a chapter  with, &quot;Beloved, she my daughter.&quot; The narrator of the story is  changed all of a sudden.

It takes place in 1873 in Ohio.  The two main characters are Sethe and Beloved.  Sethe is a black run away slave who escaped from  her home in Sweet Home, a place where she was a slave, to live with her  mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, and reunite with her family.  Beloved was  Sethe's oldest daughter of four children, two boys (Buglar and Howard) and  two girls (Beloved and Denver).  When Beloved was a baby she was killed and  now haunts the house that Sethe and her family live in.  Sethe says that  Beloved's spirit is not an evil spirit but a sad one.  An incident  that happened in the book, which exemplifies why I enjoyed the book is sort  of disturbing but shows, in a strange way, how much Sethe loved her  children.  Sethe and Baby Suggs were working in the yard one morning when  the schoolteacher, the one who used to own Sethe, showed up to take her and  her children back to Sweet Home.  Sethe saw him coming from down the road  so she quickly grabbed her children and ran into the shed as she started to  kill them.  She knocked the two boys unconscious, killed Beloved by  slitting her throat and almost killed Denver but was stopped before she  could.  Sethe did this because she wanted her children to be free.  Sweet  Home was a terrible place and she didn't want her children to live or die  there so instead she tried to kill them.  I recommend this book to  people who want a challenge and have a lot of patience.  It took some time  having to read pages over at least twice to understand what was going on.

No one should enter into &quot;Beloved&quot; with a chip on their shoulder, not that way  at least. The story is not about the slave, it's about the human. I think  the novel's focus is coming to terms with past actions in the way that  Sethe is made to come face to face with having killed her baby, no matter  why she did it. The reappearance of Beloved represents an incredible  mixture of pain and joy for Sethe, and she becomes practically enlaved to  Beloved, just as she is in a sense enslaved to her past. Denver, also, is a  wonderfully drawn, fascinating character in that she does and seems to have  always lived in the shadow of this brilliant, burning, beautiful thing that  her mother has been obsessed with for 18 years.<br />The sex between Paul D  and Beloved is totally functional to the plot, not only to Paul D's  character, but especially to Beloved, who is the most basic, hedonistic  part of all of us who knows only hot, cold, love, pleasure, pain, warmth,  etc. While Beloved is a complete and total handful and at times a real  nightmare, she hardly knows REAL wrong.

I went on the suggestion of Oprah.  She stating she was able to  relate the events in the book to her own life.  That statement mystifies  me.  All I can say is, both she and Ms Morrison have severe psychological  problems. The stem core of their problem is of a spiritual nature and deals  with the occult.  I had to wait until I was 54 years old to see Danny  Glover's naked butt.  The audience in the theater all responded negatively  when he stood up naked, so my feelings were shared by others watching the  movie.  Not to mention the naked scenes of Beloved; especially her last act  where she appeared pregnant and crazy.  There are enough films that put  blacks in a negative and deragotory light.  This film did nothing to  educate or depict blacks, as anything but a bunch of crazy fanatics.  In  talking with others who saw the movie, my feelings were not alone.  In fact  a radio station in Columbus, OH told its audience to save their money.  I  wished I had waited.  Toni Morrison may be a wonderful and prolific writer,  but I personally feel she deals too much with the occultic world and with  Satan and his influences on people's lives.

The catch-22 of &quot;Beloved&quot; is  that slavery as an institution inherently prevents its victims from crying  out, and the reader knows that Sethe's daughter never would have had a  chance.

How many things can she represent--things which will represent that which must be told, yet be in conflict with each other.&quot;<br />Does Toni Morrison hold points of conjuncture of race, class, and gender in balance?  No.  Nothing is ever in balance.  It is the constant imbalance between and within her characters caused by slavery and the memory of slavery that is the essence of Beloved.

Her spotty recollections of being among bodies and death and of maybe being a sex captive are evidence of this.<br /> Beloved also is the ghost of slavery that haunts history and our consciousness--not blacks alone, but also whites.  The repression of this memory causes psychosis in not only those who were slaves or who owned slaves, but also those who think about slavery, who have extreme opinions of it, who feel or felt demeaned by it, or empowered by it.  This repression allows a human to rationalize animal attributes to another human and thereby justify inhuman treatment.  This repression allows one who is or was a slave to survive, but in a way which does not permit a valid existence.

I found the language to be haunting, and the cyclical structure was engaging and kept me guessing through the beginning up until the dramatic climax in the middle of the book. What I found most interesting was how the novel discussed the necessity of facing painful memories, but not letting those memories completely drag you down and trap you in the past. This is an interesting take on the slave narrative, because it represents the time period that it was written. During the end of the 20th century, diverse voices of previously oppressed groups and individuals began to come to the forefront of media which allowed these voiceless groups to tell their stories. Toni Morrison is advocating for the telling of the dark story of slavery in America, while not becoming so overwhelmed in the anger and frustration that the American people cannot move forward. All of this was beautifully told through the ghostly manifestation of Beloved, who represented both the baby girl Sethe murdered to save her from the chains of slavery and also the plight of blacks as a whole during the harrowing Middle Passage. This reinforces Morrison's belief in a present that is constantly informed by the past.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this important work of American literature. However, I found that past the climactic scene where Sethe's attempted murder of her children was recounted I felt kind of bored due to most of the holes in the plot having been filled in.",2015-06-26

There are my sex partners, more angst, and I appreciate a good bodice ripper to break up my trove of less believable historical novels [men did stuff like that back then and it was accepted!].<br /><br />I gave this novel three stars because I did not like the way Small quickly swept her lovers under the rug.  There was never any connection.  I did not even feel as if she actually hated the men raping her--the main character was very cookie cutter 'I am woman, hear me roar' and I was disturbed by her lack of feeling.  She was either really strong or mad and nothing in between. Of course she was living in a time where women had little voice, but even in private she was never vulnerable.  I failed to see how these men could be so enamored of her when she didn't bring much to the table other than her beauty.  She was pretty much flat and one-dimensional. The author did not seem to care about her characters and seemed more interested in events.<br /><br />And now I am venting, but this novel could have been a fiver.  It had great villains--I know women balk at rape in books but it is nothing like real life rape [obviously because women don't fall in love with rapists] and Small does not promote it.  Women like to have control over their fantasies in novels--which is the big difference with real life rape.  You have no control, and that is horrific.  I support warnings if novels contain rape so women better can control what they read and what they don't read. So I shamelessly like a good villain, warts and all--I only wish that the novel had been better developed.",2014-07-03

Toni Morrison won a Pulitzer Prize for Beloved. It is the type of literature which belongs in every classroom of the English student.<br />I could not wait to read about Sethe and her daughter Denver. The setting is in Free state of Ohio. Sethe and her family are runaways from the enslaved state of Kentucky. They leave behind the torments of slavery but unknowingly bring with them a demon from whom they shall never escape.<br />At the time, superstitions and the supernatural were embedded as deep in the Appalachians as Jesus is in the church. Beloved enters Sethe’s life from the past by living in the present. The spirit of a child was destroyed several years ago. Is it possible this spirit has grown into a young woman. Sethe this young lady and brings her into her home. I the beginning they are not sure what to think of her but as time passes Beloved becomes embedded in the family just as slavery is in Kentucky.<br />The more deeply rooted and loved Beloved is the more she begins to take over and her true spirit appears.<br />The story gradually unravels while picking up speed and nears its peak just as Sethe’s mind when the horrors from her past take over the present, sending her into a dangerous state of mind.<br />This is a powerful story. Some parts may need read over more than once to make sure the meaning is understood. It is not a difficult read, but following the various narratives to require one’s full attention.

Slavery is a topic that is either misinterpreted (either too extreme or not enough) or it is completely brushed under the rug (those who say, &#34;That was forever ago!&#34;).  The life of a slave is not simply appalling, but it affects the enslaved.  This is what you see in Toni Morrison's &#34;Beloved&#34;.<br /><br />In the beginning of the novel we are thrown into the life of Seth, an ex-slaves, and her struggle to let go of the past that has left scars so deep within themselves that every day living becomes a task.  The imagery is amazing, and the torrent of emotions that is woven into the story are heart felt.  There is a moment towards the end of the novel in which it becomes a little confusing, but the effect is meant to be so.  Morrison explains as much in her forward (I sincerely suggest anyone reading this book read the forward.

At one point 23 year old virginal Darcy gets a hard on for 15 year old Elizabeth. The love scenes have WAY too many ridiculous comments on their pleasure. For example Darcy explains why he keeps so many handkerchiefs beside the bed so his seed doesn't ruin the bed, after chasing Elizabeth around their bedroom, Darcy says \\""I love to watch your breast sway when you run. I want to eat them, mmmm.\\"" Ugh! Caroline Bingley & Mrs. Bennett are both \\""soap opera insane\\"" wanting to harm Elizabeth.  Despite everyone trying to keep her safe Elizabeth sneaks off to take a walk alone...you can imagine what happens next. Of course there is eventually a baby, and Caroline tries to steal it. In other reviews, someone commented on the charming character Sara.  She is actually scary! She is trained by Mr. Worthington (Elizabeth's adopted father) in the arts of defense so that she can be a protector to Elizabeth. Sara is always wielding a knife and cutting or threatening anyone that is rude to Elizabeth. To top it all off, Andrew (raised as Elizabeth's twin brother) conveniently falls in love with Georgiana, 4 years his junior under the same idealistic (or you could call it creepy when Georgiana is only 15!) manner in which Darcy fell for Elizabeth. I don't understand the other good reviews...I don't even think this would be a good novel on it's own without claiming to be a P&P variation.",2011-02-06

Her use of literary techniques are incredibly brilliant and if not for the advanced Literature classes I have taken in college, I would not \\""get it\\"" either.  I have read The Bluest Eye 3 times and Beloved twice.  She is my favorite author by far, but do not pick up one of her books and expect to be entertained.  The literary techniques she employs are quite effective in bringing to life a very powerful subject and no one does this better than Toni Morrison.",2010-12-19

Instead of breaking it down into three parts with individual chapters in between, they chose to split the book up into three chapters.

This novel is an incredible story of suffering, healing, and hope. To the reviewer who said that this book was only revered because it's by a black person and about slavery, shame on you (I'm white, by the way). Given some of the questions you expressed about the narrative, you obviously weren't really paying attention and if you think the plot is \\""ridiculous\\"", then you don't understand that this isn't meant to be realistic. That's ok, but say that the book isn't for you or that you didn't get it or even that you didn't like it. Just don't insult the undeniably great Toni Morrison by saying that the esteem of this novel is based on her skin color.",2009-03-05
