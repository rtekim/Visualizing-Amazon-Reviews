Processing the intense feelings and experience I had reading this piece was difficult, as I was reading it during the two weeks or so before and after my newest baby boy was brought into this world - and in no way did I expect the book's powerful statements to knock me down and drive over me like the ka-clack of a steam engine towing a hundred cars with wheels that cut and sliced my heart.<br /><br />When I started the book I was completely uninterested. The first twenty-five pages of the action was a street pickup basketball game, but I am the type of guy that always needs to finish a book regardless of how much I hate it. Besides the needless (and frankly out-of-place) Matt Christopher opening, the book continues by delving into a desperate series of life choices that lead events that are so terribly American and so tragically male. While I almost put it down at the beginning for sheer disinterest, I am so glad I stuck with it.  It wasn't until later that the meaning and the need for the opening  became clear.<br /><br />As the young retail salesman Rabbit Angstrom travels through his life, a once popular and record breaking high school basketball star who pushes kitchen trinkets to afternoon housewives, he learns that his life has not had the amazing sparkle and energy that he thought it would. He is a father, and is expecting another child, and recognizes that his job, pay,  marriage, possessions, and family - all of the elements that make up the life of a man - leave him disaffected and dissatisfied.<br /><br />Many would likely hard time feeling bad for some of the frustrations that Angstrom has throughout the book - but there is no mistaking the feelings of boredom and isolation that resonate through Updike's pages about his protagonist as a part of the American male psyche. It gets strange, of course, as Updike (and myself) are both highly educated professionals, and we have Rabbit complaining about his life choices and situation regardless of the fact that he has done nothing more than graduate high school to further his professional and social goals... But the main undercurrent of his frustrations of &#34;is this it?,&#34; running on a hamster wheel of mediocrity, resentment, and the inability to process his sexual, social, emotional, and marital disappointments throughout one's life is almost definitively part of the American male idiom. Angstrom seems to be a secular man whose struggle with the expectations of the others around him, and in reality he is incredibly immature. But Angstrom’s immaturity arises from a grand unfulfillment based on a cistern of popularity and success that was an illusion - rising through the ranks of his high school basketball team to the siren song of the cheers and the notoriety of broken records and fame. In his small circle, Angstrom was a god, so he did not need god to supplicate his hungers and his satisfaction with his life on earth.<br /><br />The importance of his new lifestyle, his wife's life choices, and the overall binary opposite of the involvement of the family's minister and his wife highlights the importance of the themes of Updike's novel. What is good? What is satisfying? What is real and genuine, and what is the artifice of happiness that we worship behind our picket fences? Where are the true emotional, spiritual, and physical fulfillments?  Do we leave them in the halls of our high school, along with the promises of The American Dream, safety, irresponsibility, and luck?<br /><br />Updike answers this with the sugar-rimmed gun, introduced in the first act that must go off by the fifth.<br /><br />As I finished this book, I found that I had set myself up as the emotional avatar of Angstrom as a man whose dreams and needs sometimes peter into daily routines and disappointments (and who has a child and whose own wife was due to have a child any day), the shocking tragic endingturned me inside out. I was a man who picked this book up thinking that he was on keel to ride constant references to basketball, bored to death, and by the end I was destroyed at the cruelty of fate and how we all must pay some sort of price for our lust, vanity, and greed. It seems that do avoid this, one only needs to be satisfied with the miracle of being here, and that the promises of high school and a future of similarly artificial industrialized camaraderie is, for most of us, an illusion.<br /><br />Heartbreaking and true, Rabbit Run is a masterpiece of the bravado and ignorance of the loneliness of American New-Adulthood, and what happens when our social, emotional, and sexual repressions - or at least the unfulfillment of high school’s folklore of these - get the better of us.<br /><br />A beautiful masterpiece of plot, storytelling, and language.turned me inside out.

What was trending then and in short stories with odd pictures has been replaced by a faster society that knows more than children of the 1930s would be able to print. Rabbit, Run is always associated with basketball. What this novel produces about basketball would not fill a girl’s middle school PE class. Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom is tall, at one point in the book is described in his whiteness, and the pickup game in the beginning has none of the characteristics of current basketball and its cool points. The references to his high school prowess don’t develop his character or any reader’s interest in the sport. He could have been a rugby player for all the connections made to the storyline.<br /> After the game, the uninspired plot leads to the first episode of drifting. But it’s just Updike recreating what could have been one afternoon’s road trip across Pennsylvania or Maryland. By page 100, I was highly disappointed and bored, waiting for some element of surprise or intensity, waiting for a scene any writer could not have contrived. The book is published in 1960, so I suppose the appeal was from the “groundbreaking” taboo of a man whose mind is open to adultery and fantasy. The language and the sex will get there, and the intensity of the character’s aimlessness persists so that by page 200, coupled with the interference of a priest who could play opposite Clint Eastwood for all his own challenges, Rabbit is a dynamic character that temps me enough to want to see him succeed. Ruth, the random and ordinary call girl who took him away from “dumb” Janice, is not an opposite but just a respite. This can be tedious too. His job, at which he never works, is tedious. Even the baby talk from Nelson reminds me of writing that I have to humor, like children’s literature. Eccles’ wife is the page-turning character in the book, the real taboo. Eccles himself meddles like the overly-involved mediator from Light in August, so I feel pretty strongly that Updike was reading from Faulkner.<br /> This is a linear, one-dimensional tale that can be summed up in one paragraph. The language is not as superior as Philip Roth made it sound when he said that Updike could write the world’s most expressive sentence. John Updike was simply confident in his idea. I can imagine him pushing through page after page insisting that this is all a modern novel has to be. There is no research involved in morality.",2015-01-15

Redux is very much an artifact of its time, the tumoltuous end of the 60s, as well as of a man approaching middle age with little in the way of prospects, either personal or professional.   Whereas Rabbit Run had focused on Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom’s attempt to break out of his life path when still in his mid 20s, Rabbit Redux is about a similar attempt by Rabbit’s wife Janice, who leaves him to live with a smooth talking salesman. Meanwhile, Rabbit, now in his mid-30s and set in his ways, is left to take care of their on-the-brink-of-adolescence son Nelson.  He also gets involved with Jill, a teenage runaway, and Skeeter, a black would-be revolutionary. Frankly, I wasn’t totally sold on either of these characters, especially Skeeter, who talks like how a white egghead thinks a smartass black guy from the streets would talk. Meanwhile, the waif-like Jill is an almost too conveniently carnal corrective for the suddenly spouseless Rabbit.

Fortunately, the farther the reader gets into it, the better it is.  Throughout the book, Updike demonstrates that he is a master of descriptive detail, something that his command of language enables him to apply to just about anything that life has to offer in the small, not particularly interesting city, where his story is located.<br /><br />Too often, however, especially in the first half of the book, Updike becomes so intricately involved in finely nuanced descriptions that one loses sight of the context and wholeness of whatever it is that's caught the author's interest.  There is a good deal of sex in Rabbit, Run, but Updike's disposition to capture every shadow, reflection, curve, ringlet, twitch, thrust, vocalization, shift in the position of an elbow ... sometimes disassembles it until it's almost unrecognizable and decidedly lacking in eroticism.  No, Updike has no obligation to write in a way that his readers find titillating, but there should be a reason for his determination to capture every discrete part of every performance, and sometimes there is none.  His lengthy visual deliberation on the scene when Rabbit Angstrom, his protagonist, first makes love to Ruth is so thoroughly dissected that the whole is almost unrecognizable.  Yes, it's really clever of him to be able to accomplish this transformation, but what's the point.<br /><br />On the other hand, when Updike brings his remarkable linguistic and descriptive skills to bear with purpose, as on pages 245 to 250, we see vividly, in just a few paragraphs, the oneness of Rabbit's wife with his suckling baby daughter, the uncharacteristically joyous religious fervor prompted by Rabbit's momentary gratitude for his familial good fortune, and the excitement roused by brief glimpses of the partial profile of the Episcopal minister's wife as shielded-and-revealed by the brim of her straw hat.  Updike uses words masterfully, sometimes to good purpose and sometimes as if he were engaged in an exercise, complex combinations as ends in themselves, a virtuoso who wants to make sure that the reader knows he's a virtuoso.<br /><br />But perhaps I'm misinterpreting Updike.  Rabbit Angstrom is engaged in a never-ending search for meaning, purpose, a foundation that won't wobble, tumbling him into a void of meaninglessness where nothing really counts and any sense of permanence is chimerical.  Maybe this explains why Updike sometime overdoes his descriptive detail, deconstructing commonplace activities:  both he and Rabbit want to see if there is anything durably consequential to be found.  In short, this is the author's search and his protagonist is his instrument.  One can think and explore with fictional characters, even with their own needs and limitations, and that may be what Updike is doing.  The world he is creating, after all, is one in which even some clergymen are not convinced that there is a God or a hereafter, with some actively rejecting both.  Others, however, remain rigidly, even angrily steadfast in what we are told is their faith.  Whatever the makeup of the clergymen, however, their congregations are dutifully respectable and publicly obedient.  Deconstruction does seem to be in order.<br /><br />Updike enables us to see and feel the uncertainty, uneasiness, and discomfort of his characters, as well as their inability to reliably understand those around them,  He does not, however give us much of anything or anyone to like.  Ruth the prostitute is honest, forgiving, though not to the point of self-destruction, and she doesn't go  out of her way to hurt anyone, nor does she hold grudges over trivial matters.  She is the closest thing to a whole, rational, and compassionate person that we find in Rabbit, Run.<br /><br />Ruth's willingness to risk pregnancy and degradation while unmarried and without prospects are things she does for Rabbit, though only in response to his quirks and sillyselfishness.  Evidently, for a time, she really is afraid of losing him, though she's smart and experienced enough to see him for the lost, self-serving soul that he is.  Still, in spite of this lapse in self regard, she remains the only character worth caring about in this small-city menagerie taken from the 1950's.<br /><br />The last thirty or so pages of Rabbit, Run are a linguistic tour de force.  Again, however, they lead to nothing but a road that Rabbit has traveled before.  Rabbit is free, and for the moment his lack of fetters gives him joy.  He has achieved an existential coward's victory, and it suits him quite well.  The reader can only ruminate over the damage he will do and the prices he will refuse to pay in the future.  As for his sense of emptiness, perhaps he will accept it and turn it to his advantage, construing the cruelty and the harm he inflicts on others as just transient epiphenomena in a world devoid of meaning and purpose, a place where nothing really counts.<br /><br />This is not the sort of book I would seek out.  Updike sometimes writes like an established and deserving master, but other times like a marvelously precocious amateur, someone too short on life experience to give his characters substance, someone whose talent lets him stumble unharmed from one literary misadventure to another.  He's a lot like his creation, Rabbit Angstrom, except that Angstrom plays with people's lives.

It is also the first in the series of books centering on the life of Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom. We first meet Rabbit as a 26 year old married man with one child and another on the way.  A former star high school basketball player, he now works demonstrating kitchen appliances and feels trapped in his marriage and life. Rather than face up to his responsibilities he leaves his family and “runs” away from them. At one point he sums up his life by saying he was a big success as a high school basketball player but now his life is not at that level. Rather than trying to find a more substantive meaning, he wallows in self-pity and self-centered behaviors.<br /><br />Toward the end of the book, when a great tragedy has come to Rabbit and his wife, he is confronted by his old basketball coach, Mr. Tothero who tells him, “Right and wrong aren’t dropped from the sky. We make them.”  Norman Mailer displays another perspective in the comment on the back cover. Mailer says, “The power of the novel comes from a sense, not absolutely unworthy of Thomas Hardy, that the universe hangs over our fates like a great sullen hopeless sky.”  Here we have the contrast between free will and fate.  Hardy’s characters are doomed from the beginning by their status in life. Their doom is predetermined. But Updike, as Tothero,  says we have a choice. Rabbit’s choice is to run; but it is a choice, not something that is predetermined and that is why the old coach is angry. I think we are also left angry by a man who constantly runs from his responsibilities.<br /><br />This character has been described as an “anti-hero” in the sense that he is not likable or  in any sense admirable. The book itself may be distasteful to some readers. Updike is not necessarily saying that such behavior is the American condition, but rather creating a character that will be continued in subsequent books.

He feels entitled to a good life (even if he keeps no-show no-calling at work), entitled to adventures (regardless of how they affect and further constrict others), and most of all, entitled to women.<br /><br />He impulsively decides to quit his life and go on an adventure, but he doesn't get very far, just far enough to complicate more lives with his presence. He is not a calculated sociopath; instead he acts almost entirely impulsively, can't keep true to even the simplest of promises. He is selfish but not on purpose, and has just enough charm and good intentions that people give him multiple chances. His idealism shows in burst of inspiration that give him a sanctimonious streak in addition to all his other personality flaws.<br /><br />So much of the prose is filled with descriptions of women's bodies. I don't criticize that because it is a description the character's mind, and paints the picture of him being a creep; also, the author spent time describing the females' viewpoints which criticized him. He is obsessed with women, sometimes thinks he loves them on a shallow, macho level, but tires of them when they show themselves to be individual people with characteristics that aren't all about him. His hypocrisy isn't obvious enough to punch you in the face but it is evident enough if you read the whole book and follow along with his thought processes.<br /><br />I disagree with any claim that this is one of those \\""universal\\"" books, and any claims that this is a universal men's experience are just insulting to men. It may give people insight into the jerks in their livesand how their brains work, but it is a specific story about a specific jerk.",2013-10-29

Rabbit's not an \\""everyman,\\"" and he's not nearly as wistful as that description would have you think.

After all, he's 10 years older and has a child to care for on his own. He's more open-minded, but he's still a chauvinist, a racist, and a big baby.<br /><br />This book made me physically uncomfortable at times, which is Updike's signature. The new characters were fantastic - a black criminal with a God complex, a white teenage girl who comes from money but is a drifter (and prostitute). This novel spotlights the rampant racism in America in the 1960s; the fact that Rabbit is living with a black man is far more scandalous than the fact that Rabbit's in bed with a prostitute. It deals with the multitude of perceptions of Vietnam and how it affected the men who lived to tell about it. It deals with guilt - white guilt over slavery, a son's guilt over the decline of his mother, a man's guilt over his choice of bedfellows.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the role that Rabbit's parents played here. Really, Updike draws the best characters, and there's no way to know where he's taking them. That's why his books are so jarring but so honest.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next in the series.",2013-09-08

How he reacts to it - by constantly running away - is demoralizing and depressing.  His actions are motivated by his still-lingering youthful selfishness, and never does love enter into his relationships, which are created more out of convenience and need of a partner - any partner - than anything else.  The characters in the book are normal, typical people, and their flaws drive the story.  This ultimately results in a rather depressing story with little redemption, and it's just about impossible to like anything about Rabbit.  About the only character I felt empathy for was Ruth.

In this introduction to Angstrom, we meet a young man in his mid-twenties, a resident of late 1950s Mt. Judge, Pennsylvania.  Rabbit, a former high school basketball phenom, has followed up with a stint in the Army before settling down to marry a high school sweetheart.<br /><br />Taking a look at his pregnant, alcoholic, prematurely aging train wreck of a wife, his young son and his dead end job as seller of household kitchen appliances, Rabbit decides to bolt.  Initially deciding to drive south to the Gulf, he only gets as far as West Virginia before turning around and returning to Mt. Judge, though not to his wife.  The rest of the novel is an attempt by Rabbit to avoid responsibility for the current state of his life.  Twenty-five is too early for a mid-life crisis.<br /><br />I can't help but be reminded of the Flashman series of novels, written by George MacDonald Fraser, in which we follow the exploits of one of the greatest ne'er-do-well wastrels in literary history, Harry Flashman.  Unlike Rabbit Angstrom, however, Flashman is well aware of his shortcomings and actually celebrates his cowardice, selfishness and dishonesty.  As a result, you can't help but like the fellow.  No chance of that here, as Angstrom is simply a miserable human being who thinks he deserves better, when he deserves no more than his current set of circumstances, in fact even less.  Nevertheless, it IS possible to enjoy a novel while despising the main character.<br /><br />While much of the writing is entertaining, it must be noted that at times, Updike seems to fly off on wild screeds of florid, almost unintelligible prose that leave the reader simply rolling his eyes; that does not even mention some of the bizarre punctuation.

He abandons his pregnant wife and young son to explore his desires and possibilities in an early 1950s spring in a gray industrial Pennsylvania valley.<br /><br />Harry's running a lot, to and from things he hasn't taken the time to identify, or doesn't want to identify.  He's too busy living in the now, just having fun being without any real responsibility.<br /><br />The truth of a real, pedestrian, routine life as an independent adult has finally landed on Harry, and it does not measure up to what he expected--and he seems to think he was promised--after his fantastic high school launch.  His coach is unstable, quite possibly a repressed pedophile.  His parents are beaten and angry, his in-laws ugly and distrustful snobs.  All of this takes place in a stereotypical Pennsylvania industrial town, built on the side of the mountain, with another town on the other side, full of \\""them\\"" and the typical, predictable, inescapable small-town jealousies, rivalries, resentment, class issues, etc.  It's depressing and crushing, so what's the point, right?<br /><br />Updike's characters are magnificently defined, perfectly described, and utterly human.  It is hard to decide if you like or dislike any of them, because at any moment they are lovely and loving, tender and kind, mature and self-sacrificing, but in the space of a page, and even from one sentence to another they turn ugly, resentful, scheming, immature, hateful and cruel.  I know these kinds of people--they are everyone around me.  And it's me, too.  Updike makes his characters so fascinating because he unflinchingly makes them so human, showing us their inner observations and monologues, the things we never say but want to.<br /><br />Updike is exploring sexuality, mostly male sexuality, although he has a go at women's, too.  It's not cheap or prurient, but (again) honest and straightforward, his narrative clear but not pornographic, getting at a fundamental aspects of who we are as living creatures, and how the rutting brute inside each of us really does struggle with the rational, moral and polite.  The book's overall POV is masculine, as this is Harry's story.<br /><br />Updike has so much going on here: the burden of dead-end existence; the weight of adult responsibility; the pain and hypocrisy of dutiful wedlock; human sexuality; fulfillment and purpose; the nature of attraction; love, and its source and evolution; mortality and its incessant approach; yearning for growth; lost youth; the futility of life; the duality of beauty and ugliness; and a lot more.<br /><br />This being my first book of his, I loved Updike's detailed, lingering prose, so poetic and beautifully crafted, but also cinematic in its structure.  It is not flowery, but has a wonderful texture and cadence, and surprisingly, is great to read aloud.  The subject matter and the language of the book are adult (specifically sexual), but this is not too much for an older, mature high school student.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a wonderful book, if anything for its magnificent writing.  For a seemingly trite story of a low-end salesman in an unremarkable town, the story is compelling, but in the end there is no answer, no true resolution, which after all, is the only possible ending to Rabbit's run.d its incessant approach; yearning for growth; lost youth; the futility of life; the duality of beauty and ugliness; and a lot more.<br /><br />This being my first book of his, I loved Updike's detailed, lingering prose, so poetic and beautifully crafted, but also cinematic in its structure.

And that made this book powerful, like it or not.  It actually gave me a pain in my stomach reading it---seriously, it felt like it was giving me an ulcer!  The only other book to give me that kind of physical sensation while reading it was Anna Karenina.  So, while Updike's artistic vision is still not exactly my cup of tea, here it is really *artistic*, and that made reading it worthwhile.  I'm almost looking forward to reading the rest of the Rabbit series!  I hope he managed to keep it up.<br /><br />This audio edition narrated by Arthur Morey is excellent.

The series, much like Rabbit Angstrom, ran away with itself and became a landmark of the twentieth-century American novel.  By the time of his death in 2009, Updike's Rabbit tetralogy was best-selling and the recipient of two Pulitzers.<br /><br />First published in 1960, 'Rabbit, Run' was the second novel of Updike's career and broke ground in ways similar to his 'Couples' of 1968.  Never one for self-censorship, he laced 'Rabbit, Run' with an audacity and sexual frankness that writers such as Philip Roth, Norman Mailer, and William S. Burroughs also championed through the 1960s and 70s.  Updike was certainly not alone in overcoming literary taboos, but he stands apart from his contemporaries in using a Protestant, middle-class perspective that combines issues of family, sexuality, and politics with bourgeois life and religion.<br /><br />'Rabbit, Run,' written by Updike in his mid-twenties, was a reaction to the social climate of America as it moved out of the 1950s, a decade marked by vast prosperity and, to many, extreme conformism.  Updike made reference to Americans feeling 'stuck' in the 50s, when the United States advanced through early phases of the Cold War to become a military and economic superpower.  His characters from this period, usually middle-class suburbanites, lack direction and personal fulfillment in a post-Second World War malaise that overshadowed the Eisenhower administration.<br /><br />Set in the fictitious Pennsylvania town of Mt. Judge, Updike often uses the word 'net' to describe a late 1950s atmosphere that Harold 'Rabbit' Angstrom feels trapped in.  Harry, once a star on his high school's basketball team, is now 26 years old.  He is dabbling in the working world as a kitchen gadget salesman while caring for his pregnant, alcoholic wife Janice Springer and 2 ½-year-old son Nelson.<br /><br />Harry, from the opening pages, is facing a mental and spiritual crisis.  While swamped in an unhappy marriage, he deals with flak from his parents and in-laws to keep the Angstrom and Springer names unblemished, pressure from his Christian faith, and demands by society to have a chicken in the pot and two cars in the garage.  Unable to cope much longer, he hops into his Ford and drives to the Mid-Atlantic states with no intention of returning.<br /><br />Dogged by family obligations, Harry drives back to Mt. Judge and joins Marty Tothero, his old basketball coach who is living in the attic of a social hall.  Harry always looked to Tothero for advice but finds his pep talks outdated and stale. Yet it is through Tothero that he meets Ruth Leonard, a heavy-set woman who seems to make ends meet through prostitution.  A morbid affair, based on domination rather than love, begins and Rabbit finds himself more at odds with his conscience than ever.  This guilt is heightened by Jack Eccles, an Episcopalian minister who has been asked by the Angstroms and Springers to 'convert' Rabbit back into family loyalty.<br /><br />It does not take long to sense an absence of emotional depth in Harry, which causes his undoing in 'Rabbit, Run' and over the three later novels.  Still living on the glory of his basketball days, Rabbit seems to lack consideration for most anyone outside of himself.  He has no patience in helping his drink-quaffing wife and is repulsed by her second pregnancy.  Except for his son Nelson, he cannot seem to form any direct connection with another person's feelings; men are negative forces that pose threats and women are vessels for his rampant sexual desires.<br /><br />His behavior is impulsive, almost animal, and the work of Eccles to steer him onto the righteous path seems hopeless.  Yet Rabbit is himself aware of what is lacking.  Unhappy with his life and clinging to what little of his Christian faith is available, Rabbit senses a reality beyond Mt. Judge but cannot find his way.  Against a static backdrop where there is little hope of improvement, it is no wonder that Harry feels like skipping town.  Updike asks whether our ties to other humans are truly strong enough for Rabbit to go back.<br /><br />While an engaging, often funny, and ultimately painful book, 'Rabbit, Run' is a product of the early Updike, the writer who has not fully set down his method.  Like Updike through all periods, the novel is rich in detail and brings us to the heart of its protagonist, but it does not have the total balance and polish that his later fiction carries.  Updike had published just one earlier novel, 'The Poorhouse Fair,' in 1959 and was still a distance off from the pristine narrative and impeccable form of 'Rabbit is Rich,' a superior, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel released in 1981.<br /><br />As usual, Updike does not divide the novel into chapters but into loosely-based sections that run for dozens of pages.  'Rabbit, Run' is told in third-person semi-omniscient, telling most of the story from Harry's point of view but stepping away to relate other characters' predicaments, such as those of Janice and Eccles.  This keeps the reader fully aware of the developments.  The book functions well as a unit, but Updike might have created a more suspenseful novel by revealing some of the events after they happened.<br /><br />Updike, who thought of 'Rabbit, Run' as a film on printed pages, admitted that the novel was written 'carelessly' in order to gain a narrative freedom.  At times, his writing seems too free; besides detail-packed sentences that leave out punctuation to maintain flow, Updike tinkers with stream of consciousness to describe characters' innermost thoughts.  This actually breaks the narrative rhythm more than it sheds light.<br /><br />These problems are overridden whenever Updike gives meaning to drab, ordinary lives.  Updike's characters and settings are unpleasantly real and cause us to think we've been in the exact situations before.  While his narration is a bit too verbose, Updike's dialogue is some of the most beautifully conceived in American literature.  A typically Updike combination of pleasure and pain, 'Rabbit, Run' and its three successors make up a commentary that will remain popular for at least the near future.<br /><br />Those interested in the social history of America should read at least one of the Rabbit novels, beginning with 'Rabbit, Run' in 1960 and ending with 'Rabbit at Rest' in 1990.  A novelette based on the Rabbit series, 'Rabbit Remembered,' was also published in Updike's 2001 collection 'Licks of Love.'

We see this from Rabbit's interaction with Jack Ecles, an Episcopalian minister who despite a sincere desire to restore his broken relationship with his wife and in-laws, fails miserably in his efforts due to a defective view of man, sin, God and atonement. The people Rabbit grew up with are also a big influence that makes him the person that he is; his buddies in the army and his high-school basketball coach Marty Tothero. All these factors seem to work together to mold Rabbit into an irresponsible person who can't stand the painful realities and responsibilities in personal relationships, specifically in marriage that tragically leads to the death of his baby.

It's clear from the beginning that this isn't a novel of the casual-reading variety that will allow your eyes to dance across rapidly turning pages. It doesn't pull you in like that. Updike has a gift for descriptive prose (in fact that's what you're going to get throughout the novel) and as such you have to invest time and effort to absorb and immerse yourself into the whole of it. By committing and submitting yourself to this narrative you allow Updike to use his primary vehicle for relating his characters.     The prose can be challenging, especially at first, like listening to a foreigner trying to speak English, you have to shift gears and give yourself time to attune to the flow and pattern of this delivery. As such, I viewed the approximately first 30 pages as a disembodied, boastful and self-serving exercise in prose designed to show off the prowess of a clever writer as opposed to the delight encountered upon finding a novel that has an ability to grab you right away and immediately begin advancing the story. The descriptive text can be numbing and I catch myself reading individual words and individual sentences, focusing on the wordplay instead of absorbing the character and story. I force patience in myself and as the characters and style become more familiar the verbosity of prose begins to feel less burdensome.    If you're the type of person whose heart sinks at the sight of a paragraph that extends a page or more, and there are definitely a few of those in here, then this book is probably not for you. But it's not just that the paragraphs can be (and feel) long, rather it's the feeling that each paragraph and each descriptive little nugget within seems to relate a quality or feeling of grotesqueness and distortion, and the longer the paragraph the longer you're submerged, held under, gasping for breath. Some might say 'that's the point, to be unsettled' and I can understand this argument but the story is filled primarily with this manner of textual undertow, and, combined with the accompanying tragic characters (even the children are made to feel tragic), the reader is pulled relentlessly into an unsatisfying, spiraling morass. At the end, characters' positions may change but the changes are slight and circumstantial at best (not dictated by realization or self-determination) leaving the reader to ponder only the lack of growth, reward, justice, and ultimately payoff.",2010-02-25

I mean there is virtually nothing likable about this guy.  Why should we care about him?  He was a big fish in a tiny basketball pond in high school and drifted into marriage with a woman to whom he refers often as a \\""mutt.\\""  He likes the idea of being married, but not the specificity of it.  I wonder if this book gave Philip Roth the courage to write Portnoy's Complaint.    One reader made reference to Updike's use of stream of consciousness, thus showing his ignorance.  Clearly this reviewer never read James Joyce or Virginia Wolff and has no idea of what real stream of consciousness is.    It is Updike's portrayal of time and place that evokes such a strong feeling in us; that and the wonderful supporting cast he gives us.  But it is the men who are badly damaged here as well as most of the women.  The two fathers, Springer and Angstrom seem like tired, depressed old men who are just plodding along.  Their wives are more sharply etched by Updike, but they only seem alive when angry.  Harry's sister seems much like an empty shell.  His old coach, Tothero, is a sick, depressed old man, living in the past and takes up with a woman who has contempt for him.  Eccles, the reverend, is busy trying to repair the chaos in the Angstrom house while blissfully unaware of the crumbling of his own.  Only his wife, Lucy has the appropriate response to Harry:  she hangs up on him.      This book is a sign of its time.  In 1960 when it was first published, the country was coming out of a recession and the malaise of the Eisenhower years.It had just elected a vigorous and young new president, but small town America had not quite climbed on board yet.  This is not merely a novel about Harry Angstrom.  It is a novel of time and place and in that regard it is very much like Jack Kerouac's first novel, \\""The Town and the City,\\"" although Updike's characters are more finely drawn.    The writing throughout is simply exquisite.  Few American writers have been able to evoke such feeling in so few words as this sentence:  \\""The hours that follow are so long they seem to contain the same incidents over and over.\\""        In the Republic, Plato likens the artist to a Wizard and he says the Wizard holds a mirror to nature.  That is what John Updike has done.  Rabbit, Run is a mirror held up by a Wizard to a small American town in a certain time and place, warts and all.",2009-08-27

Since then he has married a woman he doesn't really love and is trapped in a life he doesn't want.  He has not lived up to the expectations he had of himself.  Most men simply settle for this but Rabbit doesn't.  One night, he simply walks away from his pregnant wife, 2 year old son and extended family.  He begins a short life with a woman who is basically a prostitute.  He probably loves her though he loves himself more.  He is torn between his love for Ruth, the woman with a suspect reputation and the duty of staying with his family.    Rabbit continually makes bad choices and is completely self absorbed.  He is not a likeable character.    Ultimately, I was torn between cheering and jeering Rabbit.  In a way, I applauded his courage in resisting a typical life that will not make him happy.  On the other hand, it is hard to cheer for someone who has no regard whatsoever on the effect of his words and actions on others.

One night, instead of picking up his young son, he runs; his all-night automobile journey is almost directionless but he returns by morning to his small town in Pennsylvania, where he struggles over the next few months to understand his situation and get his life together.<br /><br />Rabbit at first seeks refuge with his old coach, through whom he finds Ruth, a rather down and out young woman - the anti-Janice - who wants nothing to do with him, but who finally provides Harry some stability. He also encounters a youngish Rev Jack Eccles, who sees core goodness in Harry, prods him during weekly golfing sessions, and builds bridges between Harry and Janice and her family. A reconciliation with Janice is short-lived with tragic consequences, leaving Harry still, literally, running at the end.<br /><br />The book has the author's typical highly nuanced descriptions, which can at times be very awkward and difficult, making the book a bit of a slow read. Despite lengthy descriptions of the fictional towns of Brewer and Mt. Judge, they remain rather muddled.

I dunno, but for some reason I loved the story of hapless Harry Angstrom, who, like a small fearful animal, \\""lived inside his skin.\\"" Was that a quote from the book? Maybe, it seems familiar anyway. I have read probably a dozen or more other Updike books since 1967 - certainly not all of his stuff, but enough.

And I did a senior paper on COUPLES, a book which was thought to be quite scandalous at the time, what with all its combinations of multiple couplings, bed-hopping (and laundry pile) adultery, and a seeming obsession with oral sex. The paper I wrote was pretty awful, as I remember, but at least it gave me a valid excuse to read what was then Updike's newest offering without feeling too guilty. RABBIT, RUN became required reading in most of the English classes I taught in the early 70s. I found that many of my students didn't share my enthusiasm for Updike or his Harry creation though.

The book seemed to drag on, had there been less unnecessary detail, it would have gotten a better review.  Instead I feel I read much more about a particular thing than I needed to.  I loved the way John Updike expressed the detail, but I think he went overboard in some cases.  Especially since there is no real action in the book and are only a few main events that happen.    I'm not sure I would particularly recommend the book to somebody.  I will mention it and tell them my lack of reaction to it.  The characters can be interesting, and in some aspects I wish I could hear more about them.  I do not think I will pick up the other Rabbit books anytime soon though.    Some of it can be a bit detailed about sex, if that is of concern to anybody.  I had to chuckle at some of the euphemisms used.    If you want a book where the main character is indecisive, escapes, but does not really move away or change, then this book would be of interest.  Every character has their annoying qualities, even Rabbit.  Surprisingly my favorite character was the minister.  There is some decent deep thought play that is spoken but never really discussed from him.  Especially for the time period.",2008-08-09

The marriage not only deadens his spirit but also accelerates his descent into decadence.  Harry's vital life spirit totally rejects the encumbrance of a forced marriage; however, in early 1960s working class America, quick divorces are not the common panacea that they are today.  And with a young child and second on the way, Harry's only escape through a labyrinth of guilt and social mores will be a secretive and ultimately an internal one.       Everything about Harry Angstrom speaks of spring--it is no accident that Updike sets the action of the novel during spring--and he finds himself married to the dead of winter.   It is this commonly experienced conflict, crystallized through the eyes of an astute Everyman, that calibrates the smoldering action in Updike's masterful study of a fallen society.  There are no Hollywood endings here; Updike's mission is not to offer hope or solace but rather understanding.  The internal monologues served up so plentifully in this novel are a precursor to the \\""Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus\\"" studies that would come 40 years later.      The present-tense narration is lyrical and poignant, playing out like a 250-page prose poem, replete with unforgettable descriptions of the commonest things.  While reading this novel, I was constantly in awe of how great a student of humanity and its foibles Updike kept proving himself to be, acquiring such an extraordinary amount of intimate knowledge of the mental workings of men, women, toddlers, clergymen, the elderly, the decadent, the square, the working class stiff--and all astoundingly by the age of 27.  But even compared to later laureates, they just don't write them like this anymore.  My favorite line in the entire book comes from the last page; it sums up the dilemma not only of Harry Angstrom but also of modern society as a whole in one simple, memorable sentence:  \\""Funny, how what makes you move is so simple and the field you must move in is so crowded.\\""",2008-02-27
US,44959166,R1YYHS38XZ15S8,0449911659,437546793,Rabbit, Run,Books,5,14,14,N,N,"A Literary Gem","I suspect that many people don't know how to approach or evaluate a work of this type.  Updike is a realist, which is to say that the fiction he writes is a reflection of the way things are, not a parable of the way the writer thinks things should be or a construction of an imaginary world.  The reader will look in vain for an honorable protagonist, a fascinating mystery, many laughs, world-shaking events or major crimes.  Updike's books are pretty much limited to tales of ordinary people doing ordinary things.  This has brought complaints from both readers and the critics, throughout his long career, that his subject matter is trivial.  But limiting the subject matter like this  means that the books have to succeed based on their literary merits, and that is a very difficult thing to pull off.    Updike has wonderful skills in characterization, a poet's love of words and a musician's feel for their sound.  The artistry of his prose is superb, better than that of nearly all of  his contemporaries.  Some of his finest phrases, although they may start out sounding rather mundane, contain delightful unexpected semantic twists that bring them to life.  Two examples from Rabbit, Run are:  From the first page:  \\""The scrape and snap of Keds on loose alley pebbles seems to catapult their voices high into the moist March air blue above the wires.\\""  From the first chapter, a sentence concerning Rabbit's intentions in his mad, aimless drive south:  \\""He doesn't want to go down along the water anyway; his image is of himself going right down the middle, right into the broad soft belly of the land, surprising the dawn cottonfields with his northern plates.\\""        Rabbit, Run is the first novel of the Rabbit series (there are five of them at this point by the way, not four as you might guess by the fact that only the first four have been published in the same volume) and in some ways I like it the best.  Updike's trademark long run-on sentences, which can seem confusing or even annoying, are here cut to a minimum.  Also I like the way he uses the mountain so effectively and consistently as a symbol of the line between innocence and vice.       As is the case in  most of Updike's novels, this one has religion as one of its central themes.  There is an ongoing debate in it about the existence of God.  One interesting twist, though,  is that the profligate, Rabbit, is the believer and the minister, Eccles, is the skeptic.     James Joyce, the pioneering twentieth-century English-language realist, whom Updike has acknowledged as one of his influences, once remarked that if the city of Dublin was destroyed it could be rebuilt from the information contained in the pages of his novel Ulysses.  I'm not sure whether or not one could quite do that with the Reading, Pennsylvania area with the Rabbit novels.  But I do know that, back in 1977, I was driving for only the second time in my life through southeastern Pennsylvania.  I had read Rabbit, Run and Rabbit Redux, the only books of  the series that had been written at that point.  I didn't know where they had supposedly taken place.  For all I knew there may really have been a Brewer, PA.  But as I rounded a corner on the highway, I gasped:  There, spread before me, was the flowerpot-red city nestled along the river and the mountain rising directly behind it with a hotel at the top.  The city was called \\""Reading.\\""  When I saw on the map that the town directly on the other side of the mountain was named \\""Mount Penn,\\"" I was sure that it must have been the prototype for Updike's \\""Mount Judge.\\""  It wasn't until nearly a decade later though, after I had relocated to a city not far away, that I verified that I had been right.    All of the Rabbit books, which were written at ten-year intervals, are also fascinating encapsulations of the eras in which they were written and their effects on the characters.  So it is with Rabbit, Run.  If your impression of small-town American life in the 1950's is epitomized by Leave it to Beaver on the one hand and Grease on the other, this book will give you a more realistic idea of it.",2008-02-08

His success on the court has not translated into success in life, perhaps making it harder to accept his current situation.  Once adored as a top athlete and hero at his high school, Harry has evolved into a mediocre salesman living in a decrepit apartment with an apathetic wife.  With this drab existence, Harry spurns his commitments (and responsibility to his family) and decides to run.  Run where?  Run for how long?  These do not enter the bewildered mind of Harry Angstrom.   <br /> <br />John Updike delivers a masterful job of telling the story of this ex-jock and his current struggles with everyday life.  He presents the raw emotion and feelings of a drifting young man.  Harry is no hero.  He is narcissistic, selfish, and immature, to say the least, yet Updike manages to elicit sympathy for Harry and his situation.  Equally as intriguing as Harry Angstrom, is the character of Jack Eccles, a local Episcopal minister.  Updike delves into the complexities of this man of God, as he struggles not only with \\""reforming\\"" Harry, but also of his own doubts and inferiorities, as well as his embittered relationship with his agnostic wife. <br /> <br />Religion and sex emerge as the dominant themes.  Religion, neither lauded nor condemned, proves a pivotal role in shaping the lives of Updike's characters.  The ideals of God's role and God's will perplex Harry and Jack.  Even the existence or non-existence of God becomes a central role in the novel.  Sex, undoubtedly, is the catalyst behind Harry's abandonment of his family.  Updike does not describe sex as a sacred or meaningful, but instead describes it in rather graphic detail as a physical act without meaning or purpose.  Indeed, for a book written in 1960, the sexual details are explicit, much more than the much-aligned \\""Catcher in the Rye.\\"", written a few years earlier.

As much as I enjoy Tom Robbins, who graced us with Another Roadside Attraction at roughly the same age, this stands above that as a precursor to what would come later. Rabbit, Run is a great start to what turned out to be an outstanding writing career. <br /> <br />The book deals with middle America, the loneliness and sexual frustration which exists there. This seems a common theme for Updike, as his book Villages, written 45 years before this, addresses many of the same topics, albeit with a somewhat different twist in a similar but not identical setting. One thing we can assume is that Updike subscribes to the adage to write what you know. But then he also penned the Witches Of Eastwick as well as his latest, Terrorist. So take that for what it's worth. <br /> <br />In any event, Rabbit, Run deals with a Twenty something Everyman unhappy in life and unhappy in marriage, living unhappily in a blue collar Pennsylvania town. Once the star of his high school basketball team, Rabbit has not gone on to bigger and brighter things. More accurately, Rabbit is mired in a rut, burdened with the every day slump many in the same situation find themselves in. To escape this rut, he does as the title suggests.

Behind him, nothing remains but a path of destruction. <br /> <br />This book is a brilliant example of required American literature. Given the plight of society, this book - which is now 46 years old - is no less accurate than the day it was written. As we move to the later half of the book, the pages turn faster, even though they're often devoid of dialog and thick with narrative.

I seem to recall thinking how strange it was that, although Updike was widely considered a classic American author, we were reading a book about a completely immoral (or, at the very least, ammoral) main character who leaves his pregnant wife, and lives with a prostitute, with whom he engages in some fairly explicitly described activities.  However, even then, I figured someday I'd read it again when older and wiser.      Not quite 30 years later, while browsing at a bookstore, I came across the 1500 page \\""Rabbit Angstrom, The Four Novels,\\"" which I figured would serve the dual purpose of not needing to buy another book for over a month, while reading quality literature. After completing the first book, \\""Rabbit Run,\\"" it's not that I regret starting this lengthy work, but rather that I give more credence to my earlier self.     Now I know that Updike is considered one of the great American writers of the second half of the twentieth century.  Perhaps that's true, but I don't really see it in this book.  Of course, I do notice the unique use of stream of consciousness, shifting of character perspective, heavy use of metaphor and simile, and interesting descriptive observations; but I've seen it elsewhere, presented in a more compelling style.  Updike reminds me a bit of Kerouak, Fitzgerald, and Tennessee Williams, all considered to be classic American writers, and all whom I think are somewhat overrated.    Let's look at a typical example of Updike's prose in \\""Rabbit, Run\\"" (page 167):      \\""The St. Joseph's parking lot is a striped asphalt square    whose sides are lined with such city trees; and above their tops, in this hard open space, he sees the moon, and for a second stops and communes with its mournful face, stops stark on his small scrabbled shadow on the asphalt to look up toward the heavenly stone that mirrors with metallic brightness the stone that has risen in his hot skin.\\""      Okay, obviously Updike has superior descriptive writing skills, but just maybe he can do a little better with syntax, and break his thoughts down so the reader doesn't have to read the sentence three times in order to figure out what the author is trying to get across.     Then there's the story itself.  I'm not usually the type of reader who needs to like the main character to enjoy the book (I'm a Harry Crews fan, for crying out loud!) but I have to understand his/her motivations and sympathize just slightly.  Rabbit Angstrom exudes a self-centered \\""I don't care about the consequences\\"" attitude that makes him abhorrent, even though certain people seem to like hanging out with him.  Sure, we can understand why a man marrying in his early twenties to a vacuous woman (pregnant with their second child) -- already showing signs of alcoholism and losing her looks -- can feel trapped and decide to escape.  I can even appreciate why he might seek solace with a prostitute.  But what about pretending to fall in love with the prostitute, whose life he also almost ends up destroying?  Or returning to his wife (who has given birth), only to go back to the prostitute at the first sign of trouble?  Not to mention the horrible thing Rabbit says to his wife after the seminal event in the book.  I'm sorry, the only rational way to deal with someone like Rabbit would be to show him complete disdain, or total rejection (think about if someone you knew behaved like this).

Glancing over my line of Updike's Rabbit novels, of which this is the first, that seems to be the case, but time will tell whether those later books successfully trade the taut intensity of this novel for a more spacious feel.  The Rabbit novels take up four books, all tracing the life of Harry \\""Rabbit\\"" Angstrom, a man growing up in the latter part of the twentieth century, with each book taking place in a different decade, highlighting not only the changes in Harry but the changes in the country itself as it winds through the crazy years of the 1900's.  This book takes place in the early fifties or late sixties and introduces us to the man himself, Rabbit, who does his best to fulfill the verb embedded in the title and run as far as he can.  Harry feels trapped in his marriage, with a three year old already present and his wife heavily pregnant and drinking all the time, he takes a look at his dreary life and wigs out, trying to drive as far away as he can before coming back and attempting to find himself, with increasingly flailing results.  His quests lead him to encounter a priest, a prostitute, an old coach and his parents and in-laws, all of whom have advice and none of which seem to have the right advice.  So Harry tries to forge his own way but that might not be right either.  The book doesn't have so much of a plot as it consists of shifting stream of consciousness impressions, all told with Updike's carefully controlled prose, lunging from beautiful descriptions of the outside world and the people in it to searingly brutal internal monologues that are only matched by the terrible things people say to each other.  There's hardly a likeable character in the entire novel and that's where the real truimph comes in because even when you have all these imperfect people you keep reading anyway, watching them trying to find meaning in their grey lives, with nobody really sure what to do.

None of the characters are angelic, all hide their own motives and quirks and it only makes them more sympathetic because they're dealt flawed cards to begin with and sometimes in trying to make the best of it they only muck things up further.

Whether or not you like him-- and there isn't a lot to admire in this selfish young man-- he is as real as the people with whom you attended high school and as much a part of our culture as Willy Loman. Anyone discussing American literature in the last half of the 20th century has to deal with Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom, who obviously has a transparent name.<br /><br />When the novel opens in 1959, Rabbit is 26 and married to Janice Springer. They have a son Nelson who was born seven months after their marriage in 1956. Janice is now seven months pregnant and has a drinking problem. Rabbit demonstrates a kitchen gadget called the MagiPeel Peeler in five and dime stores. He got his nickname because of \\""the breadth of white face, the pallor of his blue irises, and a nervous flutter under his brief nose. . .\\"" His big moment came in 1951 when he was the hottest thing basketball had ever seen in the town of Brewster, Pennsylvania. His life has beeen downhill since then. He tells Reverend Eccles, the Springer family's Episcopal minister, who befriends him after he leaves Janice: \\""I once did something right. I played first-rate basketball. I really did. And after you're first-rate at something, no matter what, it kind of takes the kick out of being second-rate.\\""<br /><br />There is a lot going on here that has to do with religion. Rabbitt spends a lot of time with the Springer family's minister Reverend Eccles of the Episcopal Church, getting advice and counsel, not always solicited. Rabbitt \\""believes\\"" in a higher power although not much in his actions would support such a belief. Reverend Eccles does much good in his role as a minister although his heart isn't much in a lot of what he does. He is much better as a good shepherd on the golf course with Rabbit than from the Sunday morning pulpit. His wife is a nonbeliever. Rabbit's parents are severe Lutherans. There are references to religion on practically every page of this novel. Rabbit's mistress Ruth lives across the street from a church where Rabbit can watch the congregation coming to and from the church on Sunday mornings. So is this 1960 novel dated? Not when a large majority of Americans believe in literal angels and President George Bush is considered the leader of fundamentalist Christians in this country. Also, Rabbit and Janice in 1959, given their background, would have sought the advice of a minister, rather than a psychologist for help with their marital problems.<br /><br />No writer in America creates more complex, three dimensional characters than John Updike. We know hundreds of details about everyone in this novel. Ruth doesn't break the back of books when she reads them. Janice cannot cook weiners without their splitting open. Her mother-in-law has never cared for her. \\""I never liked that girl's eyes. They never met your face full-on.\\"" Rabbit always folds his trousers carefully before having sex.  Minor characters are as richly developed as he is.<br /><br />We also never forget that Updike is a poet. (William Maxwell said he wouldn't read a novelist who didn't write poetic prose.) So we have \\""the wreckage of the Sunday paper\\"". A waiter goes away \\""like a bridesmaid with his bouquet of unwanted silver.\\"" There is the description of a \\""true\\"" pink rhododendron in Mrs. Smith's garden where Rabbit works briefly. The Smiths had driven their Packard to New York City to get the plant off the boat and had put it in the back seat of their car \\""like a favorite aunt or some such thing.\\""<br /><br />Updike has written about a little piece of America. We know what products are in the grocery stores, what movies are playing, (Janice, for example, goes to see SOME LIKE IT HOT, what television programs people watch, and what cigarettes (Newports) they smoke.<br /><br />RABBIT RUN is as timely as it was in 1960.

Will this former basketball star find a way to make his life better, or will he run like a rabbit?  The title says it all and Harry Angstrom does indeed run whenever things don't go his way.<br /><br />Leaving the house to pick up his son, he impulsively drives from his Pennsylvania home to West Viriginia.  He wants to run to the sunny shores of Florida to live the life he feels he deserves.  Surely a man like Rabbit deserves more in life, or so he imagines.  Unable to complete this journey, he runs to his former coach, a tired and washed-up man who introduces him to a part-time prostitute.  Rabbit moves in with Ruth that very night and they begin a relationship they flaunt and thus humiliate his very pregnant wife and both sets of parents.<br /><br />Is there an ounce of unselfishness in Rabbit?  The reader may think so when he returns to his wife the night she goes into labor.  Their reunion is bittersweet and because in large part of Rabbit's inability to see beyond his own needs, their reunion burst apart in a senseless tragedy that is horrific but so beautifully written the reader is glued to the page hoping against hope this terrible thing is not happening.<br /><br />Will Rabbit be able to grow up and realize he is no longer the high school hero?  Will he be able to comfort his wife, to provide a home for her and his children?  Will he forsake Ruth, the hooker who accepts him as he is but is now pregnant with his child?  In which direction will Rabbit run this time?<br /><br />In addition to the novel's main character, Updike gives us as fine an array of secondary characters as can be found anywhere.  He elevates Janice and Ruth so that they are not stereotypical \\""bad wife\\"" and \\""good-time girl\\"" but sympathetic characters the reader can relate to.  Most notable among the secondary characters is the minister, Jack Eccles, who takes upon himself the task of saving Rabbit.  He becomes Rabbit's friend and marvels at the paradox of this character.

Now, several years on, he is married, frustrated and unsure as to how it all ended up this way. One day, arriving home to his alcoholic, dreary wife and his meager home, he snaps. He will leave his wife, his responsibilities, his child. He will run. <br /> <br />Rabbit turns to his former coach for advice, the old lecher introduces him to a part-time prostitute. He moves in with her the same night and they develop a dominant-submissive relationship, his affection existing only because it allows him to demand, hers because she knows no better. Like most of the other events in the story, this one is sad, gritty, and very real. Ruth, the plump good time girl, is a sympathetic character, and there are enough flashes of hard iron in her make-up that any sensation of her being a caricature or place-holder character fades. <br /> <br />What Updike has done here is to create the dreary reality of a life that turned out not quite how you expected. Rabbit is a man at turns puzzled, the confident, then angry, then confused, but his emotions are never directed at himself. It is almost as though he is unable to analyse what lies within for fear that he will find something he doesn't like or - worse - nothing at all. When he acts, it is quick and unpredictable, but oddly, never out of character. Because he rarely internalises in the narrative, for the first half of the novel he is as much an enigma to us as he is to the other characters, but as the story develops, we begin to learn what makes him him, and while his actions never really lose that exciting touch of randomness, they always feel right in hindsight, justified. <br /> <br />While evading his marital responsibilities, Rabbit and his wife's priest, Jack Eccles, form an unequal friendship. The priest is there to save Rabbit, to return him to the fold, to where he should be, but it is clear that the young man is as unsure about his world as anybody else. He doubts himself, he doubts his God. It is interesting that Rabbit actually draws strength from this indecision, allowing him to help as he is helped. It is made very clear that if Eccles had of been secure in his faith and in himself, he never would have been able to relate to Rabbit. <br /> <br />When the novel was first printed, there was a lot of discussion about the overt, explicit sexuality of it. Forty years and more later, it is both difficult and easy to see why. Rabbit is a conscious sexual predator, an animalistic man who thinks about sex often, and loves women for being women. But today, that sort of outlook from a twenty-one year old man is not surprising, and is all but expected. Perhaps what still has the capacity to shock is his domination of women, his calm, measured attempts to make them submit - and they do. I can't help but wonder if that is another taboo that in a few decades will fade, just like the rest. <br /> <br />Eventually Rabbit returns to his wife, but not in a triumphant, 'all is resolved' plot twist at the end of the novel. No, Updike does not take the easy way out, instead reuniting the pair a little over halfway through. And for what? A birth. His wife Janice is pregnant, to a little girl they name Rebecca. The events immediately preceding Rabbit's return to his wife are both sad and delicate, happy and horrifying. <br /> <br />There is one scene that deserves special mention. I won't reveal what it is so that the plot can remain a surprise, but I must mention its power, both on the novel, the characters, and the reader. It is an urgent scene, horrible in its inevitability. From the opening paragraph, it is clear what is going to happen, and the fact that we, the reader, knows about it, makes it all the more terrible. I cannot praise Updike's skill as an author in this particular section, and it is worth the price of admission alone. <br /> <br />To continue on that, Updike is an amazing wordsmith. He captures the unfriendly reality of everyone's life with ease. Only rarely dipping into lengthy sentences and almost never using literary tricks, Updike keeps his sentences short and sharp, his metaphors clear and crisp. Yet he never strays from what is real. Nobody is 'luminously beautiful', instead we have, 'Her hair in sunlight sprays red, brown, gold, white, and black across her pillow. Smiling with relief, he gts up on an elbow and kisses her solid slack cheek, admires its tough textures of pores.' In those two sentences, we are introduced to both the beauty and the reality of this sleeping woman, and it is wonderful. Throughout, Updike concentrates on reality, never fancifying or making a scene glib because he can. For every positive a character reveals, he shows us a - not a negative, never - but a neutral, a real, a grey. If a character was perfect, why would we care? <br /> <br />The ending was, unfortunately, a little confused, and I am uncertain as to how he could have extended the story of Rabbit to three more books. However, based on every page, every sentence, every word that Updike used to create his marvellous narrative, I am convinced that he can pull it off. He was only twenty-nine when he wrote this book, but there is a wisdom and sensitivity throughout that many never touch - truly a stunning author.",2004-11-09

It definitely starts slow, with descriptions and monologues overrunning the plot for a time.  But it doesn't take too long for the reader to fall in love with Rabbit.  <br />Rabbit is a young, married father who is unhappy with his lower middle class life and unexpectedly deserts his wife and son while on an errand.  He moves in with the town floozie and plays house while trying to figure out exactly what to do.  He is befriended by a priest who tries to set him on the right path during weekly golf rounds.  Despite his selfishness and arrogance, Rabbit manages to be immensely likable; somehow i was rooting for this adulterer and liar to succeed in the end.  This is mainly due to Updike's skills as a writer.  He doesn't paint a pretty picture of his characters or make them bastions of morality.  Instead, they are entirely human, which makes them incredibly easy to relate to.  I underlined several passages in the book as being remarkably insightful.  Updike is able to describe the human condition in three sentences when it would take three paragraphs for even the most skilled writers.  At least in this respect, Updike is very similar to my favorite American author, Richard Russo.  <br />Updike peppers his book with humor and tragedy, making &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; a bit of a roller coaster and always surprising.  His cast of characters (especially the minister's wife) are colorful and dynamic.  Appropriately, there's no great moral at the end (again: Russo), leaving the way open for the other Rabbit books, which after this great opening salvo, I can't wait to read.<br />4 stars.",2004-05-19

Both talk about the cold feet that husband and wives have after a period of being married. This is not the only thing they share in common, they are both brilliant. Using a polished and beautiful prose, Updike wrote a novel that grabs you by your rabbit ears and never let you go. You don't have to be a young male American to feel related to Rabbit's life. I believe that most people go through his very same issues sooner or later in one's life.<br />Sure Rabbit is selfish --who isn't? -- but his motivations are his fears, rather than his egotistical feelings. His fear of failing as a father, a son, a husband, actually, as a human being is what makes him move from one point to another; to change things is his life. His unhappy marriage, his dead-end job are just symptoms of a bigger disease, and in this angst that lies the central spine of this splendid novel.<br />At the beginning of the narrative when Rabbit is thinking of going somewhere --he's not sure where -- far from his family, he ask for directions in a gas station. The attendant, an old man, simply says: \\""Figure out where you are going before you go there.\\"" And, while Rabbit keeps that in mind, he fails to follow this advice. The fact that he goes through the motions in his life --he never seems to do anything with passion -- only proves that, like most youngsters, he is still trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life. This is one of the biggest qualities of this novel, to portray someone's life so full of truth.<br />Updike writes with his heart and his brain, making a colorful prose and characters so believable that you don't want them to go when the book is over. Every character is believable, the wife, the parents, the in-laws. I think his idea has worked so well, that he expanded that in his more books, creating The Rabbit Tetralogy. \\""Rabbit, Run\\"" is highly recommended to those who like literary and good books.

Yet, for those of us who lived through the Sixties and continue to watch the ebbing away of those primary values that once underlaid our country, reading RABBIT, RUN today is small potatoes.  Similarly, the sexual `explicitness' that had everyone talking back at the time of publication, would hardly raise an eyebrow today.  Various sexual acts that have become part of US national lore, for better or for worse, were still not given a name in this novel.  Rabbit Angstrom, a former highschool basketball star, is stuck in a boring, tawdry marriage and a dead-end job.  His lower middle-class parents expect him to follow in their footsteps; his in-laws look down on him as a no-hoper.  A few years later, the answer would have been obvious---tune in, turn on, and drop out !  But in those more serious times, a mere five years before the tidal wave of change began, Rabbit's flight can draw no social or political sympathy.  There is no Haight-Ashbury in view.  He drives into the night, only to return sheepishly.  He soon takes up with Ruth,  a \\""loose woman\\"", who, again five years later, could have been seen as a \\""hip chick doing her own thing\\"".  Everyone condemns him, the woman condemns herself.  She gets pregnant, but does not tell Rabbit, even when he runs from her to rejoin his wife in the hospital as she gives birth to his second child.  Family grudgingly accept him back, but things have not really improved.  A do-good minister with a bored, flirtatious wife tries to help Rabbit resolve his inner conflicts, but is too weak to accomplish much.  A final tragedy occurs.  Rabbit runs off to Ruth yet again.  The ending is a little predictable.<br />In my opinion, Updike hovers always on the edge of greatness.  He is forever caught between the desire to write supremely well and to be popular.  I love how he catches the feel of a small American town or city in the late `50s, the mores and expectations of the people, their goods and habits.  But as a young man, perhaps, Updike loved his own skill rather too much, he loved to sit back and watch himself create these verbose passages, these descriptions of old ladies on porch gliders, of upper class gardens, or of Pennsylvania country gas stations.  He revelled in those descriptions that somehow ring a mite \\""over-literary\\"".  His reach for the perfect word sometimes extends too far.  I feel, as an older man, that Updike before 30 could see beauty only in very young women, perhaps thanks to Hollywood and the printed media.  Each description of an older woman is tinged with disgust, discoloration, and deterioration.  That said, Rabbit Angstrom is an unforgettable character.  Updike's choice of name is very clever.  If you sympathize with him at first, his utterly brainless selfishness and weak indecision, his lack of any backbone whatsoever, tend to make you despair.  He is a real antidote to the American dream, to the \\""log cabin to White House story\\"" that we love to love.

I found Updike's style entrancing, powerful, beautiful.<br />If you need to like the characters in a story in order to enjoy a book, don't read this book. If you need to read about characters who reflect your moral beliefs, don't read this book. Updike's style takes the ordinary everyday (many reviewers here have noted the mundaneness of the plot), takes the subtle evanescing experiences of life, and crystallises them, slows them down, so we can see, ponder, wonder, re-examine. Updike neither condones nor condemns any character in this story: each of them is described in a way that reveals or suggests the mystery and wonder (not necessarily wonderful!) of the universe that is a human being. Most of the characters have little self-awareness, with protagonist Rabbit having the least. Yet Rabbit has a very alert instinct that can sense attitudes and intentions behind the words and movements of others. Abandoning his prostitute companion, Rabbit returns to his wife, and contritely stays with his wife's parents while his wife is having their 2nd baby in hospital. The in-laws are glad Rabbit has returned yet still censure him in their hearts for having left in the first place. Updike describes the atmosphere in the house as a shifting in the furniture and the air to make a space where Harry can fit in, if he makes himself very small. This is how Rabbit lives: he sense things instinctively but rarely questions whether what he is doing is right or wrong. He can't, his instincts are too strong. He feels good when things &quot;click&quot;: when he nets a perfect basket, when he hits a perfect drive in golf. When things don't go his way, he feels uncomfortable, trapped; his disappointment is instantaneous. <br />Despite Rabbit's unpleasant character, the dilemmas he faces are common to many (as are those of his wife and Ruth, the prostitute heshacks up with for a while): what should he do about his wife's drinking? And about his own distaste for her drunkenness? About his wife's untidiness and the distaste this arouses in Harry? Should Ruth tell Harry she's pregnant with his child? Will this make him want to stay, or run? Is the woman who invites him in flirting with him? Or is he misreading the signs? No answers are provided, rather we just see Rabbit living out his life instinctively, and while we see the mess this leads him into, I felt sad when Rabbit returned to his wife.

Running around on his wife and essentially killing his baby girl did not make me feel for his plight.  If he feels so strained by domestic responsibilities then why put yourself in such a position from the start.  If Mr. Updike's intention was to make one feel sorry for Rabbit, he failed completely.

This would be tolerable, possibly, if he had even the slightest sense of humor about himself; as it is, the combination of severity and (unintentional) absurdity is more than a little trying.<br />Updike lathers on the details, though he's far from his best in this early effort, and as a result the novel hasn't aged well at all.

Rabbit Angstrom is a former high school basketball star whose glory days are in the past.  Rabbit is a poor man's Gatsby, a man of small means and abstract dreams too large for his mind to handle.  He becomes prey to the dangerous and rebellious tradition of self-exaltation - Raskolnikov without a scheme and an aim.  <br />Rabbit suffers from an early onset of mid-life crisis - one so confounding he does not know what he does or why he does it.  He runs away from his family, but he can't even leave the small-town milieu.  His escape is localized and small-scale, perhaps admissive of personal limitations and insignificance.  Updike doesn't quite denigrate small-town America - he clearly has appreciative affection for his small town life (though he often gets a little too cathartic with his self-assurances of religious truths).<br />Updike's language is a slow progression of action and aimless colloquial triteness with interspersed moments of pulsing, raw but poignant stream-of-consciousness - that's when Rabbit is really on the run.  In the eventlessness of small town life Updkike makes even scandals look like events of mundane existence.

The problem:  I found Rabbit remarkably irritating and shallow, and the supporting cast (Ruth excepted) one-dimensional and unremarkable.  The prose, with occasional exceptions, is drab and lifeless--perhaps it was a stylistic choice made by Updike to complement his dreary story, but I doubt it.  Suburban malaise, the restlessness of American Everyman, marital hypocrisy--all of it has been done, redone, and re-redone in American literature before (talk about redux), and often with far better results (check out Richard Yates' &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; for a glimpse of an unusually brilliant example of this type of novel).  Maybe &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; was sharper when first published in 1960; but as a reader in 2002, I am unimpressed.  There's nothing in particular wrong with this book; but in my opinion, there's nothing much extraordinary about it either.",2002-03-10

He has a rare ability to transpose ordinary experiences into rarefied grounds without falsely heightening experiences themselves. Each sentence, each event in the novel is carefully considered and calibrated, so that no sentence or description seems wasteful. The technical facility of Updike is truly something to marvel at, even surpassing the lyricism of Cheever. The way he writes about sex, adultery and guilt in this book is unparalleled in 20th century American fiction, and I haven't seen any other writer come close.<br />Taken as an individual novel, however, it fails to rise to the status of a 'great american novel.' Although the writing is unsurpassingly beautiful, the plot is a bit thin, and ideas it expresses, commonplace. Minus the prose, the story tracks the  wanderlust and guilt of Harry Angstrom, a man who still wants to hold on to his glorious boyhood, and seeks to escape his oncoming adulthood and life of ordinariness. It's a well-traveled premise for a novel, but executed and polished to a hilt. <br />As we see Rabbit Angstrom struggle to keep apace with his given life, we are meant to see the social milieu that he lives in. Readers do get an acute sense of time and place, but what of it? Not that all fiction should strive for the Meaning of Life (how dreadful would that be?!), but the feeling you get after reading 'Rabbit, Run' is that of caffeine rush which you know will fade. And it does.<br />I don't mean to slight Updike's legacy - he is one of the best writers we have in the States. And read as a tetralogy, the Rabbit books do encapsulate four decades of Americana with a sprawling and lyrical sweep. It truly is an accomplishment. As an individual novel, 'Rabbit, Run' is emotionally involving and a hell of a good read.

He misses his youth -- the adrenaline rush of sports, the sense that life is full of possibilities.  He doesn't know what to do about it.  He tries to make some kind of change, with what's left of his youthful energy. He's self-centered, but he's also a dreamer.<br />The book is sad, in that it offers no &quot;solution&quot; to the frustration of leaving youth behind.  But it's also reassuring and poignant, because the theme is so universal.<br />Updike manages to keep this apparently ordinary story interesting without being philosophical or tedious.  His vivid, compassionate descriptions of characters and their neighborhoods are phenomenal.  He has a way of illuminating the inner workings of American optimism (sports heroes, suburban consumer culture) without looking down on it.  In fact, he seems to cherish it, focusing his lens on the  unspoken dreams that make our society and our personalities what we are.<br />This book -- along with its sequels -- is one of the great pieces of American literary art.<br />PS If that's not enough to grab you, read it for Updike's incomparable descriptions of lovemaking.  Arrestingly specific and vivid.  Only a handful of authors can actually describe sex -- I mean, really describe it -- and show the way people's personalities are played out in bed just like they are anywhere else.  The main character is a charismatic, self-absorbed yearner, in search of his lost youth at all times -- even during sex.  In Updike's world, sex isn't pornographic -- it's part of life.",2002-01-06

Rabbit exists in a moralistic void, a near-complete vacant solipsism making him react in ways more animal than human. Rabbit fails to choose a particular path simply because he never seems to realize that he has choices to make.

What a mistake!  First, as many other reviewers (here and elsewhere) have pointed out, Updike is an amazing, powerful, beautiful prose stylist.  In my opinion, and admittedly having only read one Updike book (\\""Rabbit, Run\\"") now, I would say that he ranks up there as one of the greatest American fiction writers of the 20th century.  In some ways (stylistically and thematically), Updike reminds me of another great (albeit problematic) American 20th century writer, Norman Mailer (his masterpiece, \\""The Naked and the Dead,\\"" specifically comes to mind).  Second, I'm just in awe of how clearly, accurately, and powerfully Updike - at only 28 years of age (!) - was able to say so much in \\""Rabbit, Run,\\"" capturing the zeitgeist of a time and place (drab, grey, conformist, late 1950s suburban American hell, as epitomized by Brewer, Pennsylvania), and presenting his characters with such nuance, balance, wisdom, honesty, and - most importantly - truth.  Incredible.  Finally, I don't feel that it's an exaggeration to say that \\""Rabbit, Run\\"" (and its sequels, which I haven't read, but have read about) is one of the most important achievements in American literature EVER.<br />So, what is \\""Rabbit, Run\\"" about?  In terms of themes, we've got a huge amount of material here (this is one big, meaty \\""rabbit\\"" of a book!).  Life, death and sex -- in fact, lots of sex (\\""Rabbit\\"" is  certainly an appropriate nickname in this context!!).  Courage to face life (and marriage, children) vs. giving in to \\""rabbit-like\\"" fear.  Commitment/responsibility vs. freedom/running away.  Religion vs. true faith (and what, if anything, such true faith might consist of).  Sin vs. redemption.  The fate of an individual attempting to find meaning and identity while fitting in (or not) to a stultifying, stifling, conformistic society (and ones' particular place/role in it).  The romantic fantasy of busting loose, hitting the road, and finding a better place. (Personal note: as a huge Bruce Springsteen fan, I was strongly reminded in \\""Rabbit, Run\\"" of \\""Born to Run,\\"" \\""Darkness on the Edge of Town,\\"" etc. with their many similar themes). Physical perfection/athletic achievement as potential sources of meaning, especially when you're past your \\""prime\\"" (\\""Rabbit\\"" was a high school basketball star, but now mainly relives his fading \\""glory days,\\"" as Springsteen would say).  Growing up vs. remaining an eternal youth.  Order vs. chaos.  And, ultimately, the difficult balancing act between ones' quest for PERSONAL happiness and fulfillment vs. the needs of family, friends, employers, society.  And much more.<br />Is this book, as some reviewers here have stated, \\""depressing?\\""  Well, actually, I'd have to say yes.  For one thing, Updike presents no definitive answers to all the important, dark, disturbing questions he raises here (nor could he, nor, as an artist, SHOULD he, in my opinion!).  Meanwhile, almost everything his main character (Rabbit) touches somehow turns out wrongly, or tragically (the misery and alcoholism of his wife, leading to the book's climactic tragedy, being the greatest example).  Plus, the setting of \\""Rabbit, Run\\"" is inherently gloomy (dreary, \\""dung\\"" colored apartment buildings which smell of \\""cabbage cooking\\"" or \\""something soft decaying,\\"" a deserted ice plant with \\""rotting wooden skids on the fallen loading porch,\\"" etc.).  People are mainly unhappy, or trapped, or scared, or confused, or looking for a little excitement to brighten up their dreary existences, or all of the above.  So why read such a depressing book?  Here are just a few reasons: to learn, to experience the world through the eyes of a great artist (Updike), to challenge yourself, to enjoy the sheer beauty of top-notch writing.  Finally, a philosophical question:  is the point of reading (or any other activity) simply &quot;pleasure?\\""Should we run, like a rabbit perhaps, from anything that might scare us, or threaten us, or even depress us?  Or should we stand our ground, look those things straight in the eye, and - unlike Rabbit Angstrom - NOT run.  Personally, I vote for the latter option!",2001-07-14

Everything, in Updike's hands. Rabbit Angstrom coasts through his post-school life before waking up suddenly one morning and asking what it's all about. He suddenly yearns for salvation, which he confuses with greatness - and grasps for both in one of the most bumbling, destructive yet heartfelt spiritual journeys ever portrayed in American fiction. <br />One of the signatures of this book is something I found compelling in certain filmmaking, such as Lumet's NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN: An ability to take your emotions from 0 to sixty in no time flat. Lumet suceeds by contrasting sudden bursts of violence with minutes of dead calm. Updike takes radical left turns with a long elliptical orbit - it takes you a minute to realize you've suddenly shifted direction. Rabbit's sudden interstate voyage aimed at the Florida keys, or his callous rebuke of his wife at the funeral, take you aback in their brashness, but then, suddenly, they come alive with their own inner logic. When Harry tunes into the news and wonders along with the broadcaster, &quot;Where is the Dalai Lama?&quot;, you learn just how far gone he is from understanding both the world around and the world inside him. <br />Rabbit is a typical American male in many respects: trapped by images of former glory, resentful of his &quot;normal&quot; life, unable to relate to women outside of a sexual context. But what Updike captures best in Rabbit is the universal human trait of equivocation. Bad fiction rests on a single, life-turning momentous event, after which any struggle the hero endures is external. Running back and forth between his wife and Ruth, between family and &quot;freedom&quot;, and finally running away from the whole sordid mess born of his own indecision, Rabbit reminds us just how hard it can be to change one's oldest habits.",2000-12-14

Gratifying his selfishness and feebleness in solving ethical  problems, he leaves behind only disenchantment, pain and even death. His  former lover fairly tells him: 'You're Mr.Death himself. You're not just  nothing, you're worse than nothing. You're not a rat, you don't stink,  you're not enough to stink.'<br />One of the main characters of the novel is a  priest, there are a lot of church-goers (including Rabbit himself) on its  pages, they speak about God but do not have faith. Their sanctimony  corrupts people. Even such unbelievers as Ruth, a call girl and Rabbit's  lover, and Lucy, priest's willful wife, look more sincere than their pious  milieu (Lucy about Rabbit: 'If he's a Christian thank God I'm not  one').<br />So, who is Rabbit? A monster? No, the author tells us, he is just  an ordinary modern man devoided of moral responsibility.",2000-09-19

A former high-school basketball star, Harry  (&quot;Rabbit&quot;) Angstrom realizes that his life is in a rut when he  plays against some youths.  It also dawns on him that his marriage is also  lifeless and empty -- his pregnant wife is an alcoholic and his job is  insipid.<br />Seeing nothing for him, Rabbit's solution to the problem is to  run away.  Living in Pennsylvania, he drives down to West Virginia and then  back to help clear his mind.  He meets his former coach who introduces him  to Ruth, a prostitute.  Rabbit and her  have a passionate relationship.   This unconventional situation only rooks him into a new routine -- one that  he feels he must escape from. Despite help from the local minister, Rabbit  feels that people are trying to con him into a pattern into life -- one  that he isn't happy with.<br />I couldn't make up my mind whether to root for  Rabbit or look at him as a sorry individual.  He is struggling for an  identity, but every time he escapes, he leaves disaster and grief behind  him.  In addition, Updike asks the question, what moral responsibilities do  people have versus their personal freedom and indentity?  Updike's writing  is strong and often times poetic.  However, I found some of the symbolism  and ephanies a little hard to grasp (even after several rereads).  Some of  the tense scenes were also written abstractly.

Well, here is a man that does it all for you, Mr. Harry \\""Rabbit\\"" Angstrom.  He is the man for running away from just about anything  that is a conflict for him.  Updike investigates this unfortunate soul of  the suburban middle-class with the use of many similes, metaphors, motifs,  and imagery.  In &quot;Rabbit, Run,&quot; John Updike's simple language  brings reality to the central character of Harry and his boredom and  disgust with his present life.  In his early years at Mt. Judge High  School, Harry was the star basketball player and this game was his life.   In the beginning scene of the novel, Rabbit tries to recapture his ex-hero  illusion of himself as a basketball star by playing basketball with a group  of teenagers on the court.  In this scene, we get a taste of Updike's use  of rabbit imagery to enhance the rabbit qualities of Harry.  When he  arrives home, he regains the sour reality of his unfulfilled marriage, and  his animal instinct tells him to flee.  Like an animal, he can be gentle,  but when he goes off on his own, he is the cause of all problems.  In  fleeing from his home, he experiences marital infidelity (a cental theme of  many of Updike's books), the death of his baby, and ends up not a  born-again-hero, but a man fleeing in panic from the realities of life.   The quest motif is an important part of the novel in that  Harry escapes  from the imperfections in his life in search for a higher purpose. Because  he is extremely sexually driven, he finds himself in the arms of Ruth, a  prostitute that fulfills his need for an experienced cook and lover.  Some  of the scenes with Ruth are graphic and X- rated so I don't recommend this  book to young children. Throughout the novel he possesses rabbit twitching  and nervousness that causes others around him discomfort and pain.  At the  end of his quest, Harry does not find his higher purpose in life but endsup running aimlessly into the night. <br />  Even though Harry was quite  depressing , I found this book very enjoyable because of Updike's detailed  use of imagery and motifs.  This is just the first of the Rabbit trilogy  books by Updike, and this novel drives me to read the other Rabbit books  just to see what happens to Harry next.   This is a must read on my reading  list, and I recommend this book to all high school students and adults.",2000-05-16

Although I understand that everyone enjoys different types of reading, I find it hard to believe that anyone could truly enjoy wholeheartedly this long trek through one man's  life.  I chose this novel because of an excerpt from it I read that I  liked.   I enjoyed Updike's one-point-of-view, stream-of-consciousness  style, although I found the repetitively depressing, anticlimactic events  to be boring and disturbing. A man of easy caricature, Rabbit Angstrom,  flows through the changes in his life brought about by marriage, the birth  of a child, and the consequences the choices he makes hold.  The repeated  sexual references and graphic description might appeal moreso to the older  reader than they might to me, yet I cannot understand how any reader would  enjoy the pauses in the smooth, blanketing style of the writer's flow from  one event to the other and the way it effects his character.   The  employment of deep emotion and feeling is prevalent in the novel, which I  liked. The novel also presented many sarcastic universal truths throught  the course of it in which Updike qualifies his understanding of humanity  and bitterness towards it.  One of the truths he states near the opening of  the book, between major scenes, upon pondering right and wrong: &quot;We're  all in it together.  Fraud makes the world go round. The base of our  economy.&quot; Updike also seems to understand that bad luck, once begun,  fails to end for a long time, but that it is brought upon by oneself.   Rabbit's sexual conquests and consistent lack of responsibility for himself  definitely come back to haunt him with the loss of his wife and child.   Rabbit also flashes back to the past, remembering the only fond thing about  his early life, basketball.  This comparison of things in his current life  to that before makes life appear to Rabbit as a game, and as though each  step he takes in it is like a foul in the basketball games he usedto star  in.<br />Perhaps the thing that Updike most fully understands, though, is the  human tendancy to fear the unknown.  Throughout the entire novel, there is  hardly a single page that doesn't describe Rabbit's fear of any one thing,  situation or person.  Rabbit continues to present himself in risky  situations and try his sense of right and wrong by scaring himself into  doing things.  When Rabbit is presented with these uncomfortable  situations, his natural reaction, like that of a rabbit, is to run.   Updike's flowing style and colorful descriptions make everything appear  normal until he adds the element of fear into his novel, which allow for it  to be interrupted, and real life to play back into the picture of Rabbit  and his game of life.  One of Rabbit's few statements of true contemplation  is that of a flashback to his basketball coach who said &quot;Run, run,  run.  Run every minute their feet are on the floor.  You can't run  enough...Give the boys the will to achieve.  I've always liked that better  than the will to win, because there can be achievement in defeat.&quot;   This sums up how not only was Rabbit scarred by basketball into later life,  but how his memory of &quot;achievement in defeat&quot; validates the  presence of death, fear, and pain in Rabbit Angstrom's life.",2000-05-09

Though we might not choose to exist in this  brown-gray environment, neither would our twenty-something protagonist, and  that's precisely the point. That we can be disgusted and frustrated along  with him is what gives substantial balance to his sometimes unlikable  decisions, and helps us react to them fairly.       Updike's ability to  paint with broad strokes of reality is simply astounding. No other author  I've read can so painfully probe into the most intimate of human  motivations and behavior. Every sentence is sculpted so beautifully, that  even this early work, occassionally revealing a pinch of effort as his more  recent works never do, could still serve as a manual for writing fiction.       But perhaps best of all is the well-crafted plot, something I'm now  discovering as an Updike trademark.

Lucy Eccles' brief summary of those events is both accurate and frustrating. Essentially, she blames Harry Angstrom for something he didn't actually DO, and absolves his wife, Janice, of everything except being an idiot. Obviously, Updike wants this paradox to be noticed but it is unclear what conclusion the reader is to draw. Because Janice IS an idiot. But so is Harry, even if he's a charming one. I guess we're supposed to contemplate the merits, or lack thereof, of a culture that can quietly absorb the set of events described here.<br /><br />The characters are not unremarkable but their actions are. Excepting Harry, and perhaps his elderly erstwhile employer, the characters mostly plod through their listless lives. Some of them find outlet in trite debauchery while others don't appear to have much outlet at all. But they all seem to have fairly rich inner monologues and Updike does a good job of making that clear. Again, there's a paradox. Why are these characters with such deeply held convictions and strong senses of self so trapped in mediocrity?<br /><br />Updike's Rabbit Angstrom is an earlier generation's Frank Bascombe. The problem with that is neither character is particularly compelling. Both Updike and Richard Ford grapple with the tedium of the suburbs, perhaps, but that can make their depictions tedious. Sometimes, the reader struggles to care enough to continue. That said, Updike gives his characters enough depth that we have to bear with him.",2013-12-01
