This book was a great book although it did not gain my interest too fast, once i got far into the book it got interesting. The beginning of this book was one of the most boring sections of a book i have read. I read two books over the summer, this being one of them. The other book seemed boring, but turned out to be good, this only took my interest by the beginning of the middle. A Clock Orange is great book, it gains my interest about this troubling boy named Alex, who is sentenced to fourteen years in prison. I do not relate to this book one bit, but I still do enjoy this very much. The real question this book got me to think is; is being good, actually good, if it is not by choice than is being bad not by choice either? That is the way I see the book and how it effects me.	2015-08-27

Teenagers roam in packs committing horrific acts	I found ACO to be a bit too artsy for my tastes.  Burgess creates this dystopic, violent society without giving any indication about how it got to be like that.  Teenagers roam in packs committing horrific acts of violence as if this is a perfectly natural human impulse.  His offerings concerning the interplay of morality and choice are interesting.  The MC's conversion into a &#34;solid citizen&#34; simply because he becomes an adult is a bit of a stretch.	2015-08-25

For anyone who wants to read it but isn't sure I say go for it. The hardest part of reading this amazing novel was the nadsat slang used in the book. Gosh!  What a way to start a book, having to look up  almost every other sentence to figure out what exactly this crazy teen was saying. Once you get deep into the novel and get used to all that slang, the book is an easy read and amazing at making a good argument. Should criminals have a say in how they're treated, and should the government take away their right to choose? Violence is all this crazy teen has in mind as he both rapes and beats innocent people. He becomes the subject of some sort of experiment in where he is forced to feel sick while witnessing violent films of very real situations. I was left both feeling bad for this kid and wanting him to stay a &#34;good boy&#34; forever. The ending is brilliant and it left me wanting the next chapter of Alex's life. If you haven't read this you are missing out.	2015-08-16

This book is very dark, thought-provoking, and ultimately sad. It offers a first-person perspective of a violent criminal, but the steps taken to neutralize the threat he poses are questionable. The author does a great job getting us to actually feel empathy towards the character, even though by the standards of most people he is a horrible human being. The question is left to the readers, does free will encompass the freedom within one's mind? This book will forever hold a place on my Favorites shelf.	2015-08-11

I was not disappointed.<br /><br />While there are small differences between the book and movie, the story is essentially the same. The book adds more context and details, which make it worth a reading if you're a fan of the movie. Among those inclusions: An explanation of where the book's title comes from. But the movie at the same time left very little out of Anthony Burgess' original story. Of course, the book itself is barely 200 pages, so the film doesn't have to slice and dice the story to cram it in, a la &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; or &#34;Harry Potter.&#34; The added details, the changes, and Alex's additional first-person musings make the original novel worth a read.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the book adds the final chapter that was missing from the movie and the American version of the book. I have mixed feelings about the &#34;redemption&#34; chapter, but I don't believe it makes the book any worse.<br /><br />The hardest part of reading the book is the Nadsat. My copy of &#34;Clockwork Orange&#34;, the Penguin Books version, had a Nadsat glossary, which was handy — even though it slowed down reading considerably. Most of the Nadsat words' meanings can be guessed or just glossed over, but if you want to know what's really being said, Google &#34;Nadsat glossary&#34; and have the reference handy.	2015-04-11

Burgess has created a beautiful challenge language that builds up throughout the first couple pages and just keeps on giving.‘Nadsat’ spoken by Alex does more than draw readers to attention it urges them to search up the mean of ‘Nadsat’ and also help the readers m possess as a means of determining the sense of those unfamiliar words. As know A Clockwork Orange is a well-known classic. It is a book I can not reconvened everyone. Not that many people would enjoy to read. In other words, it took me a time to read this book because of the different vocabulary. I had to have openA Clockwork Orange - Wiktionary on my laptop to be able to enjoy the chapters. I did appreciate the message behind the book and the unique style of writing. Burgess put in this book a high amount of suffering, violence, and immoral behavior among the book. Burgess also hints humans morals and good vs. evil upon this book, he shows twisted side of human nature. He deeply explores violence and human moral. Lots of people might find it disturbing and look at the underlying message of freewill and moral choices.I like this book and the theme it takes on over being able to make decisions by yourself.  It will be hard to pick at first,but it will get interesting and easier to understand. I highly recommend it!	2015-03-06

Unfortunately this book is so poorly written that I stopped in frustration a little ways past part 3 (chapter 23ish). Every sentence has 'like' in it, so much so that I couldn't even concentrate on the story being told. &#34;I tried to like read, but like couldn't like concentrate because the like author sounded as if he was an like uneducated like fool.&#34;<br />On top of that the author repeats many words for no apparent reason other than to fatten up the word count. Instead of saying 'and the camera went flash' he would say 'and the camera went flash flash flash' and he uses this toddler form of description dozens of times through what parts I could bear.<br />My biggest gripe is that the author thinks it's cute to make up long winded slang for simple words (again, probably just to fatten up the book). 'Viddy' is slang for 'see', 'slooshy' is 'hear' and so on. He makes up a compacted word for nearly everything and it's up to the reader to figure out what he means.<br />If the author would have left out the issues I've detailed here this book would have probably only been 100 or less pages. My advise, skip the headache this book gives and just watch the movie or better yet just read a better book by a better author. Have you read Don Quixote?	2015-02-04

US	11191604	RMUT2IHUIVKG2	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Totally Horrorshow	Of all the early 1960s novels made famous by later movie adaptations (The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and One Flew Over the Cuckoos's Nest come to mind), A Clockwork Orange is perhaps the one most able to stand on its own. Irrespective of Stanley Kubrick's unforgettable cinematic version (and Malcolm McDowell's star turn as Alex), Anthony Burgess' achievement in this book cannot be overstated.    A dystopian nightmare of frightening plausibility, it explores the nature of free will through the experiences of its protagonist Alex, a juvenile delinquent who is maneuvered into undergoing aversion therapy that in effect forces him to be \\"good.\\" A number of characters opine that such conditioning severs a man from choice, eliminating his humanity. \\"Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness?\\" asks one. \\"Is a man who choses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?\\" One need not believe in a God to understand the philosophical stakes implied by those questions.    Burgess does a great job of stacking the deck to make the point. Alex is undeniably despicable. By age 15 (his age at the start of the book) he has committed numerous acts of \\"ultra-violence\\" that has left at least two people dead, participated in a brutal gang-rape, molested a pair of 10-year-old girls and perpetrated numerous acts of theft and gratuitous vandalism that have terrorized his community. He is clearly a cancer on society and society has a reasonable rationale for taking him out of circulation through incarceration (or perhaps, at the extreme, execution). But does it have a right to remove his free will? That is the uncomfortable question Burgess asks.    Clockwork Orange is the second dystopian novel Burgess published in 1962. The other, The Wanting Seed, lacks Clockwork Orange's tight structure, consistent theme and anything close to Alex as a dramatic center, something made even more unforgettable by Alex' first-person narration in an idiosyncratic Slavic/English polyglot slang. The only two book-length first-person in-character narrations I can compare it to in 20th century English language literature for sheer end-to-end brilliance are Holden Caulfield in J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye and Humbert Humbert in Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita.    The book also exposes the generational rift emerging in British society in the late 50s and early 60s. If one watches some of the \\"kitchen sink dramas\\" being made around that same time by directors like Tony Richardson and John Schlesinger (The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, also dating from 1962, is an excellent example), one can see the utter befuddlement of the older generations, still clinging to king-and-country traditions, when faced with the aggressive, cynical attitudes of the young, particularly the young of the lower classes. Gangs like Alex's \\"droogs\\" had their real-life counterparts in the Teddy Boys and the early Mods.    Clockwork Orange can also be seen as an indictment of the kind of secular, scientifically planned societies then in vogue, which Burgess exposes as breeding cynicism by weakening traditional checks on amoral behavior such as religion and parental authority, setting the stage for authoritarianism (a cultural/political cycle that he explores more overtly in The Wanting Seed).    A Clockwork Orange is a bravura achievement as a philosophical meditation and also a hell of an entertaining read. What more can one ask?	2014-12-31

Anthony Burgess’ novella, A Clockwork Orange, attempts to expose the corruption and weaknesses of government and the manipulation it can bring upon society. By creating a futuristic city that is ruled by a totalitarian state, Burgess is able to reveal his beliefs on Man’s free will and choice that distinguishes Him from lower animals and machines.<br /> At the very start of the book, the reader is introduced to the main protagonist Alex, who seems to lack any of the usual traits that the main character would often have. We find Alex the perpetrator of numerous crimes of theft, rape, and harassment throughout the first part. And yet the reader is supposed to believe that Alex is the protagonist, or hero, of this dystopian society. However, Burgess is able to brilliantly maneuver past these obstacles by implementing the Nadsat language used often by Alex and his droogs. The Nadsat is an apt usage of diction in which Alex’s brutal crimes have been censored (i.e. rape is ultra-violence, gang violence is twenty-to-one) and the reader is almost brainwashed into believing that these acts aren’t as terrible as they actually seem.<br /> Burgess’ extensive use of symbols and motifs are incredibly effective in his purpose of the novel. The most evident recurring symbol would be Christ and how Alex is the “savior” of his society. Burgess connects these two figures in a multitude of forms. In the final 3 days of Jesus’life, Christ is killed, buried, and resurrected. In the 3 chapters that Your Humble Narrator describes for us, Alex is captured, imprisoned, and returned to normal. The crucification of Jesus is analogous to Alex jumping out of the window of his apartment. Both acts were a result of the cruel government in which they were ruled by, and both actions labeled them as martyr figures. The idea of Ludovico’s technique, or conditioning is a powerful theme of the entire novella. Man’s free will and choice of whether to be good or evil are aptly explained by Burgess. After Alex is put under this treatment, he is not only forced to do good, but cannot commit the most basic of human abilities such as self-defense, and emotional expression. Burgess makes a strong note of this lack of free will when Alex is beaten by Officers Billy and Dim, and Alex’s lack of musical expression.<br /> Although Burgess is able to aptly reveal his beliefs on free will and government structure, he fails to effectively reveal other themes in the novella. Alex obviously undergoes an epiphany/catharsis event in which he believes he has outgrown the childish actions of crime and evil. However, he never denounces the practice of his inherent destruction as a child, but claims that it will pursue in a continuous cycle among the youth. Along with the notion of cyclic torment, the current totalitarian regime’s fate of reelection was never mentioned and has remained a mystery. In fact, the reader may possibly assume that the Minister of the Interior was voted in again because he made amends with Alex in the 20th chapter, and F. Alexander is restrained due to his epiphany that Alex raped and killed his wife.<br /> Ironically, Burgess never intended for A Clockwork Orange to be his greatest or most renowned works of his literary career. In fact, he denounces this novella as flawed, but he accepts the unexpected glory it has received. It is plain to see why the book has received an enormity of recognition. The text contains a unique writing style and twisted plot that invokes inner thinking and realization of the world around us. Yet there are noticeable faults in plot, theme, and author’s intention. So it can best be described as, simply, a happy accident.d by Burgess.

I had seen the movie but all my friends insisted i read the book. So i bought it and did just that. It took me a little while to finish it due to all the school work i was bombarded with, but it was worth it. I would read this book a hundred times over and never get bored. The language is a bit confusing at first, but you will quickly get used to it.<br /><br />The story goes that a young boy, Alex, and his friends are in one of a few gangs of the area. He is already on parol, so when his gang turns on him and leaves him to be found by the police, he's almost immediately sent to prison. After a year there, an opportunity comes for one prison member to be set free if he agrees to take part in a controversial experiment.<br /><br />I'll stop there so i dont spoil it anymore :3 Anyway, i highly recommend this book!	2014-11-23

When I first started reading it I found it difficult because of the constant slang in the book, to get used to this I used a dictionary online meant for words in the book. This was very helpful at the beginning but eventually you pick up on it and get used to it. This book was very interesting, it was a mix of many things and could be considered multiple genres. It is sometimes dark, funny, sad, and even scary. This is one of the reasons it is constantly interesting to read. It is not a book for everyone however I must say. It goes over very touchy subjects and includes violence and worse. This is all used to portray the story and the message so personally I think it works out. I would recommend this book to somebody if they were looking for a novel that is different and are prepared to read some pretty crazy stuff.	2014-05-27

There is an invented language in here, and some readers might struggle to figure out what some of those words actually mean.

I intend to look into other works by Burgess since he values those books more than A Clockwork Orange. I completely understand where he is coming from. It seems like many artists are cursed by one particular work that simply gains more fame than any other.<br /><br />I think the 21st Chapter is essential just as the author intended. I understand that it seems like a copout to some but if that is the intention of the writer, so be it. At the very least, we should not be deprived of an entire chapter that leads to our subsequent understanding of the book.<br /><br />Overall, I like the book although I am not as high on it as others are. The Nadsat really turned me away at first. I recommend reading the book with audio assistance to get the terminology down. It's easier to picture the dialogue that way. Just YouTube the audio and something will come up.	2014-05-12

The story sucks you into a world in abject fear of criminals at dark, leaving a very resentful population of young and old people. To remedy this the government creates this new but crude technique that sends the protagonist into a downward spiral of misery and pain and makes you wonder how far one can and should go to &#34;cure&#34; the criminal mind. For these reasons I gave it four out of five stars. The only downside I found with the book was that the slang utilized by our beloved narrator almost prevented me from moving further on in the story. It took me a while to fully understand it, like what in the world a gulliver was, but I managed to adapt. Not only did it almost ruin the story for me, I might have missed important context in the beginning due to the extensiveness and complexity of the slang. All in all, I would recommend this to those that are interested in reading a great classic with a unique take on the good vs evil theme. If you truly enjoy and get into the book, you will find yourself speaking nadsat, Alex's slang, without even knowing. Overall, the story was good, very deep and revealing and I recommend you find an edition with the real last chapter as well for a truly whole experience.	2014-05-02
US	48142661	R1OG7GBMQQO8F1	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A Clockwork Orange	A Clockwork Orange is a different unlike any other. Anthony Burgess has a very unique writing that you won't find anywhere else.  The book is separated into three parts that take you through the three major sections of the main character's (Alex) life. Alex is a teenage boy who has a taste for violence. Although Alex is a teenage miscreant, Burgess manages to have you sympathizing for Alex after every punishment.  For instance, after a failed heist, Alex finds himself in some trouble with both the law and his friends. Even though Alex had brought it upon himself, you still feel emphatic. Once you understand the foreign slang Burgess uses, you will love the book all the way through just as I did. Highly Recommended.	2014-05-01

A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess is a novel that is well written but hard to comprehend what is happening due to the “language barrier” that Burgess created with the nadsat speak that goes on throughout a majority of the novel. It is broken up into 3 different parts, all with unsettling actions, consequences, and questions that will make you wonder what kind of world they are living in. Part 1 consists of introducing the protagonist, Alex, he is a young man who fears nothing whilst around his gang, consisting of three other boys his age. There weekends consist of drinking drug laced milk, beating people on the streets, breaking into homes and raping unwary citizens, and getting in brawls with other gangs just like them. All behold to Alex though, he makes his gang very unhappy which results in them setting him up, which lands him 14 years in prison. The first part of the book is the most difficult to understand, for it uses the largest amount of nadsat throughout the entire novel I believe. Once you get a hold of what they are saying, it will be easier to understand what is happening. In the second part Alex deals with the real life consequences of hard prison time. He has to deal with other prisoners, constantly beating him, and trying to rape him. With guards not even willing to help, he is on his own for his first stretch of prison, fending for himself from other prisoners and corrupt guards. Once the prison offers him a deal to cut back on his time in prison, he accepts it almost immediately, even though he has no ideas the consequences it will have on him later on his life, changing him forever. Over the course of his time in prison, Burgess really shows character development for Alex, how he becomes a changed man vividly by depicting what goes through his head the whole time he is getting the treatment. The rest of the novel shows Alex’ life slowly spiraling back into his previous life, being bad, until he finally thinks about one thing that makes him change his thoughts a bit. This is a good novel to read due to how it goes about solving issues dealing with yourself, or a man vs. man deal. Alex doesn’t necessarily choose to be bad, he just naturally is bad, and not much can change that. You get the sense that the whole time he has a moral struggle of whether or not it is good to be bad or good? If he chooses one of those how will it impact his future, that’s what is comes down to for Alex, thinking about the future and what it will bring to him. You don’t discover the main theme until later on in the novel which deals with the humanistic nature and how bad people will always be that bad person until they can find something that they look forward to, other than doing the things that make them bad. Again, once you get past the “language barrier”, you unveil a novel that explores ideas that are shunned upon in our society today.	2014-04-30

I recently reread the book and this time came away thinking that Anthony Burgess is somewhat of a modern day prophet.  &#34;Clockwork Orange&#34; is a dark fable about good vs. evil.  The book asks what is human freedom really worth? I suggest you read it or re-read it.  Guaranteed, this book will get you thinking.	2014-03-22

Like many, I had seen Kubrick's film version long before settling down to read Burgess' book. Because of this, I considered A CLOCKWORK ORANGE to be a black comedic masterpiece of sociopathic glee / anti-social behavior, mixed w/ a political message about state control. Now, after reading the book, w/ the restored twenty first chapter, my view has changed a bit. Burgess had intended to present Alex as a purely id-driven human being w/ free will. The horrific crimes he commits, along w/ his droogs, are done out of a choice to commit them, and not due to any outside forces. Alex is happiest when stealing, hurting, and / or raping people, pure and simple. Along comes the government w/ its &#34;cure&#34; for those like little Alex (he's only a kid after all) which involves mind-altering, chemically induced &#34;goodness&#34; in place of &#34;evil&#34;. Burgess' central questions seem to be: Are we still human if we have no choice? and Is &#34;goodness&#34; really of any value if it has to be induced? While state control is evident, it is secondary to the idea of losing one's humanity in order to be a decent citizen. Chapter twenty one shows us a completely different person in Alex, when set against the marauding, insanely violent boy of the previous chapters. Burgess leaves room for growth, evolution, and the wisdom of age. Actually, he leaves us w/ the possibility of hope...	2014-03-04

Why did I wait this long to read this?<br /><br />This is one of the most brilliant books I have ever read. Ingenious in the way it is written, executed, and created. Anthony Burgess created a fascinating, gruesome world, in which he sucks you right in leaving you feeling sick to your stomach but intrigued nonetheless. He created an entirely new language, confusing you and entertaining you all at the same time. I was at first very confused and put off with the lingo used, and it was hard deciphering all the words and making sense of it, but soon enough you get the hang of it and you start to enjoy reading and decoding it. Like the book cover said, it will take you no more than fifteen pages to get used to the language.<br /><br />Our honorable narrator, fifteen year old, Alex is an ultraviolent hooligan who goes around with his droogies (gang) causing havoc around town every night. Beating people up (no matter the age and gender), thieving, raping, and ultimately, killing. Violence is in his blood, he can't help himself.<br /><br />But Alex does have one weakness, and that is classical music. Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, and the like transport him to a completely different world, demonstrating a much softer side to this violent criminal.<br /><br />When Alex is set up and betrayed by his droogies and is caught by the millicents (a.k.a police) and is locked up in prison, he thinks his life is over. Two years in however, he attempts to stay on his best behaviour with the hope he can leave sooner than intended - that is until he is set up once again, this time by his droogies in prison, and is blamed for the death of one of the prisoners. He then agrees to undergo an experimental treatment called the Ludovico Technique, which is a form of aversion therapy in which Alex receives an injection that makes him feel sick while watching graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to suffer crippling bouts of nausea at the mere thought of violence. As an unintended consequence, the soundtrack to one of the films, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, renders Alex unable to listen to his beloved classical music.<br /><br />The prison chaplain is against this treatment accusing the government of stripping people of choices, and what's the point of good and evil if you can't make the choice?<br /><br />Upon releasing Alex, we then experience the aftermath of this treatment and how it affects his life outside of prison. As a result, we witness Alex unable to defend himself as he is abused and beaten up until he can't take it anymore and attempts to end his life.<br /><br />It is fascinating experiencing this journey with Alex from violence to non-violence, from control to helplessness. There is so much controversy around this story, people analyzing and judging and deciding what should have happened to Alex and whether he deserved to be let go, or whether having him undergo that treatment and become a &#34;good&#34; person makes up for all the crimes he has committed in the past.<br /><br />I won't sit here and analyze, but I found it interesting that when put in any given situation, anyone is capable of such violence. Such as the elderly people in the library, who held Alex against his will, and beat him to a pulp to avenge the old scholar he assaulted earlier in the book.<br /><br />This is a great dystopian novel, and now that I've finally read the book, I look forward to watching Stanley Kubrick's controversial adaptation.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange is a must-read. I thought it would take me a long time to get through, but it only took me a couple of days. Easy, quick and entertaining, this book will make you laugh, cringe, gasp, curse and most importantly, it will get you thinking and put a smile on your litso.intended consequence, the soundtrack to one of the films, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, renders Alex unable to listen to his beloved classical music.<br /><br />The prison chaplain is against this treatment accusing the government of stripping people of choices, and what's the point of good and evil if you can't make the choice?<br /><br />Upon releasing Alex, we then experience the aftermath of this treatment and how it affects his life outside of prison.

This book is one of a disturbing type. I would not necessarily recommend it for young readers because of some of the content. For people who are older this book is disturbing, thought provoking and brilliant all at the same time.<br /><br />The story is told by the central character Alex who is violent and bad just because that is who he is. Him and his gang go around creating havoc until Alex is mutinied by them and left to be arrested. The story talks in a a brutal invented slang that at first can make the book hard to understand, but adds to his and his friends different social pathology. Through all the different writing techniques that arise some very important questions and brought up: to what extent do people go to make everyone &#34;good?&#34;<br /><br />In a very interesting way the author shows a duality between the government and the young people who rebel. It is shown in a dark twisted way the freedom that the boys want and at a point have. The police are trying to reign in this horrid behavior and are wanting to fix the ones who are caught in violent heinous acts.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange was in the end a good read. It kept me interested in what was going on and really had an effect on some of my thoughts regarding freedom and how a person is. It will appeal to people for many different reasons. It will effect people in completely different ways; but it will effect them.	2013-12-03

The film's central moral question (as in many of Burgess' books) is the definition of &#34;goodness&#34; and whether it makes sense to use aversion therapy to stop immoral behaviour. A critical target is the behaviourism or &#34;behavioural psychology&#34; propounded by psychologists John B Watson and B F Skinner. Burgess disapproved of behaviourism, calling Skinner's book Beyond Freedom and Dignity (1971) &#34;one of the most dangerous books ever written&#34;.<br /><br />Kubrick fell by chance on the novel. &#34;I was excited by everything about it: The plot, the ideas, the characters, and, of course, the language. The story functions, of course, on several levels: Political, sociological, philosophical, and, what's most important, on a dreamlike psychological-symbolic level&#34;. Kubrick wrote a screenplay faithful to the novel, saying, &#34;I think whatever Burgess had to say about the story was said in the book, but I did invent a few useful narrative ideas and reshape some of the scenes&#34;. Kubrick based the script on the shortened US edition of the book, which missed the final chapter (restored in 1986). The film's Ludovico technique is widely perceived, however, as a parody of aversion therapy more than of classical or operant conditioning.<br /><br />Burgess reports in his autobiography You've Had Your Time (1990) that he and Kubrick at first enjoyed a good relationship, each holding similar philosophical and political views and each very interested in literature, cinema, music, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Burgess's 1974 novel Napoleon Symphony was dedicated to Kubrick. Their relationship soured when Kubrick left Burgess to defend the film from accusations of glorifying violence. A lapsed Catholic, Burgess tried many times to explain the Christian moral points of the story to outraged Christian organizations and to defend it against newspaper accusations that it supported fascist dogma. He also went to receive awards given to Kubrick on his behalf.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick, writing in Saturday Review, described the film as: &#34;...A social satire dealing with the question of whether behavioural psychology and psychological conditioning are dangerous new weapons for a totalitarian government to use to impose vast controls on its citizens and turn them into little more than robots.&#34; Similarly, on the film production's call sheet Kubrick wrote: &#34;It is a story of the dubious redemption of a teenage delinquent by condition-reflex therapy. It is, at the same time, a running lecture on free-will.&#34; A Clockwork Orange was photographed mostly on location in metropolitan London and within quick access of Kubrick's then home in Barnett Lane, Elstree.<br /><br />The above text is a very shortened excerpt of four slightly edited paragraphs of the original Wikipedia text. I have concentrated on Burgess and Kubrick, who were two extraordinary people, and on the main format. The full review runs over many pages, and also discusses some of the useless, but at the time (I was around when the film first came out) extremely heated lengthy debate about censorship. I found it very indicative at the time that governments, which, through the police, are the executors of censorship everywhere, were very touchy on the subject and mostly unhappy that “pornography” (of which there is hardly any by today’s standards) was their only handle for intervention: They would all have preferred to ban the movie altogether for subversiveness – like Eastern Europe would have done/did, but that was out for the free and liberal West…<br /><br />257 - A Clockwork Orange (Stanley Kubrick, 1971, 137') -Customer Review #806, very positive - 19/11/2014phy” (of which there is hardly any by today’s standards) was their only handle for intervention: They would all have preferred to ban the movie altogether for subversiveness – like Eastern Europe would have done/did, but that was out for the free and liberal West…<br /><br />257 - A Clockwork Orange (Stanley Kubrick, 1971, 137') -Customer Review #806, very positive - 19/11/2014	2013-11-19

His three accomplices, along with himself, go on an evening of brutal beatings, rapes and robberies, which land him in jail. Whilst in jail he befriends the chaplain, and accepts the bible, but gets pinned for a murder and gets picked for a new reform program. Ludovico's Technique it is called, and it involves elements of associative learning. Alex is eventually released back into society, being unable to think about violence without becoming sick. When two of his old accomplices find him, they are still upset about the destructive evening they had two years ago. So they beat him and leave him for dead. Unknowingly, he wanders into an old shack where he finds a man by the name of Alexander. Alexander finds out that his wife was raped and beaten by Alex and locks him away in an old apartment. Alexander then decides to torture Alex, forcing him to leap from the window but does not die, although the state has undone his reclamation treatment. I enjoyed this book because it was really intriguing and it makes you want to see where he will end up. Though the book is graphic, so if you do not like violence being vivid, then you may want to find a new book. So will he start a new gang and go back to his old ways? Or will he begin life anew? That is for you to read and find out.	2013-11-01

One of the most fascinating dystopian novels on the par with George Orwell's \\"1984.\\"<br /><br />  Although the superficial perusal may reveal simply a complex plot involving evel-ish protagonist -- \\"Little Alex,\\" a somewhat deeper look at the author and social issues involved at the time of the novel's writing will reveal a complex lace of multiple subplots and ideas.<br /><br />  Something to consider: for a long time Anthony Burgess was a member of Her Majesty's Secret Service. Despite long assignments to Far East and Middle Eastern countries, Anthony Burgess' specialty was Eastern Europe and Slavic languages. Hence the language of the \\"hood\\" in this novel: \\"Nadzet\\" -- translated as \\"teen.\\" (e.g. triNADZAT' \\" = 13; chetirNADZAT'= 14, etc...). Why do the major characters speak this lingo? Well the simple answer is that they are teenagers themselves. Hence the angst, aggressiveness, unbridled sexuality, the ugly behaviour, etc...<br /><br />  Something else to consider: why pepper the novel with Slavonic root-words? Why not use Arabic, French, or German? Possible answer: To those \\"in the know,\\" it may have looked as if there may have been a small but real chance that good old England may go Red (Philby, Burgess (different and unrelated Guy Burgess), and McLean have just defected [not in that order, of course]; the students and the unions are taking over the streets; Soviets are going into space and are arming every anti-colonial movement possible; etc, etc, etc.) As a specialist on Eastern Europe, Burgess had deep knowledge of miserable life behind the Iron Curtain, which he masterfully recreated in and transposed upon Great Britain in the \\"Clockwork.\\"<br /><br />  Trivia 1: it is rumored that while posted in Egypt, Burgess had a nervous breakdown. This led to his resignation from working for the Crown and the beginning of his literary career (this was brought up in several media interviews with the author later in his writing career).<br /><br />  Trivia 2: the original printing of the book differed greatly between the US and the UK versions as the American Version lacked the final chapter of the book! It is unclear why,  but the readers in the U.S. had to wait until 1972 to read the book in full.<br /><br />  Trivia 3: the superb film adaption of the plot by Stanley Kubrick  (the one that stars young Malcolm McDowell in the title role) was based on the American and NOT UK version, therefore it (the movie) lacks an absolutely key point of the book obvious to the reader in the last chapter of the original \\"Clockwork Orange.\\"<br /><br />Trivia 4: No connection was ever made between Guy Burgess (the Secret Service man who defected to the USSR) and Anthony Burgess (Secret Service man who had a nervous breakdown and then wrote this book). As far as I know not even the most paranoid counterintel John Bull has ever raised that question. Hm... Now that I see it written down,,, I wonder...<br /><br />  Overall, this is one of my most favourite books ever!	2013-09-29

Alex is thus incapable of any sort of aggression, even in self-defense. \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" thus asks the reader: Would it be better for us to be always non-aggressive, or should we be able to choose whether or not we are violent?<br /><br />This edition includes the twenty-first chapter that was previously excluded from the American editions of this novel. When considering this final chapter, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is also about growing up. The maturing Alex tells the reader that youth walks in a straight line and cannot help itself or be helped; it will do what it does and hit everything that gets in its way. The mature adult, however, is not so helpless, and thus Alex reevaluates his life and his goals.<br /><br />A word of warning: \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is a violent book, and the \\"nadsat\\" dialect spoken by Alex and some of the other youth might seem a bit awkward at first until you get used to it; the vocabulary is based off of Russian.	2013-09-06

My only wish would have been if this book had come with a glossary of British slang (which I believe I read that the author had actually mostly made up).  It was pretty tricky figuring out what was going on, when the narrator used so much uncommon slang.  I'm going to give it another read though, because it was quite interested once I got going in the book.  (Perhaps I will make my own glossary nest time?)	2013-07-14

A Clockwork Orange is one of those books that is chiefly aimed for brainless teenaged fanboys that have absolutely no idea what is cool or like to label uncool whatever as &#34;cool.&#34; Henceforth the oversaturation of love for Stanley Kubrick's vision of Anthony Burgess' heap of trash.<br /><br />It took me fifty pages into A Clockwork Orange to get used to the language and another 150 odd pages to get through the dreck of a read. Alex keeps referring himself as &#34;Your Friend...&#34; when he is never a one. Violence, actually ultra-violence, abounds on every page throughout the book while the slangy, viz. nadsat, words are being used for descriptive purposes.<br /><br />Because of the impossibility of almost every situation that occurs, A Clockwork Orange is one of the most unrealistic books I've had the displeasure to read. It is also manipulative in terms of human emotions, criminal proceedings, and physics.<br /><br />On the other hand, A Clockwork Orange comes in two different editions: the British and the American. The former consists of 21 chapters and the latter with one less. So there starts the debate: which one is better?<br /><br />Well, in my opinion, A Clockwork Orange should have ended at chapter 19 when Alex threw himself out of the window. Good riddance, right there.<br /><br />Philosophically speaking, the novella fails on so many levels that I began to laugh in spite of myself.<br /><br />All in all, A Clockwork Orange is one of those stories that has gotten way too much overpraise for all the wrong reasons although the only positive aspect about it is the clever usage of language.<br /><br />O my brothers, keep on peeting that chasha of real horrorshow cal.	2013-07-06

If you pick this book up, good luck putting it down. It has a great storyline, amazing characters, and the fact that it is written in a slang derived from Russian is just the icing on the cake. The book is much more violent than the movie, so if you had a problem with that in the movie don't read the book. If you love the movie, then read the book. This book really makes you take sides with the main character, even though he is a sadist, and a rapist. You see him actually believe that he is right in on part, when just a few pages ago he was proved that he was wrong. Yet you still side with him. There really isn't anything else I could say that wouldn't be clockwork. It is definitely the most entertaining book ever, in my opinion.	2013-05-14

This book, however, is honestly the best it can get.<br />It is written in a weird and crazy format, but somehow reminds me of the way I write poetry, so I actually enjoyed it. It is written on a blank canvas, with ideas pointing to what it is trying to say, while also being fully open to interpretation. The points about life it raises are remarkable and are hard to go unnoticed. For example, one day my mom asked me if the government should legalize the use of marijuana.<br />I said of course!<br />My mom said that is not Christian of people to do.<br />And I responded:  Mom, just because people don't do things they shouldn't, simply because they are not allowed, does that make<br />them a better person? No, it makes them A Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />And that is what this book is all about, choice and will. Freedom, it's extent and limitations. What do the acts of each and everyone of us really say about the kind of person we are? Does society have any effect on decisions that can lead to happenings not intended upon?<br />The answer is for you to decide by gathering evidence buried deep in the many hidden gems of this story. There is so much to learn from this book, and that is why it is truly unique. But oh ya, there is a heck of a lot of digging to do with this story, and that is why some people hate it so much.<br />*******NOTE: This book is also extremely explicit, repulsive, and spectacularly horrifying.  Kind of scarred me for life. Involves grotesque rape and murder scenes, be wary.	2012-12-06

It's not a long novel, and not a difficult read, aside from the use of unfamilar slang; I never had too much of an issue with the slang, but a few words took some heavy contextual reading to figure out for me, when I first read the book at the age of 14.<br /><br />The beauty of this book is that, despite its simplicity, it still presents philosophical points about morality and the development of a young teen in his maturing to adulthood.  The choices he makes have a great impact on his present and his future.<br /><br />I would agree with other reviewers that this is one truly left best to the imagination.  If you have the opportunity to read the book before seeing the movie, you won't regret it.  The book became one of my favorites before I ever saw the movie, and I don't have much interest in the movie as a result.  I don't know what your experience will be if you view the film first, but my recommendation is to read the book first to capture the elegance of Burgess's writing at certain points which, while novel in film, do not strike the same philosophical cords as strongly in my opinion.	2012-03-02

This book hardly needs another review, but I am compelled to write on it's behalf.   There is so much to list! This book started me off with a challenge. That is, as many reviews (good and bad) have stated, the slang. The slang threw me off a bit at first, as I am sure it would any reader. However, if you keep reading and look for context clues as to what the words mean, it becomes easier and easier to understand. And, to be honest, it also becomes fun, being able to read and speak the slang that is so prominent in the book is like being one of Alex's droogs.  This book will throw you for a loop when it comes to the violence (sexual and non-sexual). However, I would ask anyone, even those who are sensitive to violence, like I am, to please see past that and read on, as the extreme violence has it's place, there is a reason for it. I would not, however, read this book if violence or sexual violence is, in any way, triggering for you.  This book comes, so I've heard, in two forms. There is one in which the last chapter has been removed. The addition of that original last chapter totally alters the tone of the entire book and I suggest getting the book with that chapter (the 7th chapter of the 3rd part).  This book will make you think long and hard about morals and ethics. I came away liking Alex more than hating him, even though I hated him in the beginning of the book. Any book that can do that, I think, is a good book.   Give it a try, but please, I beg you, don't stop reading it a third of the way through or half way through... Doing that will leave you completely unfulfilled and with only a pin-hole's peek at the big picture.  If you read it through, and don't like it, fair game. But give it a fighting chance.	2012-01-07

I read a little bit each day, until I reached the point of Alex's transformation. That night, I sat right there on the floor and read the rest of the book in one go. It's that engaging.  Now, I've read a lot of books, and while this may not be the single greatest work of literature that I've ever read, it is certainly one of the most haunting. The main question that Burgess asks is a very difficult one to answer--it's easy to reject something like the Ludovico method when your victim is innocent, but what if he happens to be a killer, a rapist, and generally just a bad guy? Do we take the road of pragmatism or moral integrity? This book feeds on a fear you may not have known you had. It's not the fear that someone like Alex will waltz through your front door and kill your wife while singing a merry tune. It's the fear of not knowing the lengths to which a government will go to maintain order. It's the fear that you could be building a future where the concept of rehabilitation has been lost completely.  Of course, if you're reading this review, you're probably familiar with Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation. It is an outstanding piece of art, and stands on its own very well. However, readers of the novel will discover several differences, some subtle, and some not so subtle. This is inevitable with any book-to-film adaptation. Out of respect for Burgess's work, I would recommend reading the novel first (in its original 21-chapter format), as the two works take vastly different opinions on the question posed above. Both are well worth your time.  As to the final chapter. I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't read the novel yet, but I can understand its lack of popularity. Alex is such an extreme character throughout the rest of the novel, it does seem very unlikely that such a change could come about, and so suddenly. I ask only that you read Burgess's introduction to this edition before you pass judgement. Besides being a very interesting read, and unexpectedly eloquent for an introduction, it contains valuable insight regarding his intent with that last chapter.  To summarize: a fascinating read, deeply haunting, and well worth the effort it takes to get the hang of the slang. But by the end, it'll be like a second language to you.	2011-12-07

WHile I was flipping through reviews on here I read one titled \\"you should watch the movie first\\". Are you kidding me?? That movie was completely unwatchable to me! I never finished it. The movie was focused more on the unthinkable deeds done in this book than the idea behind the book (oh I know shocking coming from Stanely Kubrick (this is sarcasm)). The book is one of the few that I try to read almost every year. I have read it countless times and come away with something new and interesting every time. It has a feeling of accidental profoundness. The reason I picked it up before was because 7 years ago when I was in high school it was banned from school libraries and curriculum because of it's \\"racy content\\". I like every other teen in my high school found something exhilarating about reading a banned book... SO of course I picked it up and finished it in two days!  The book follows a group of delinquent misfits who run around the city wreaking havoc on all it's inhabitants. It is written in a sort of made up slang which at first is difficult to follow, but after a chapter you start to easily imply it's meaning by connecting the words with their context (not nearly as complicated as some reviews on here would make you believe!)... ANYWAY... The leader of the group is arrested and subjected to visual brainwash. In the end the reader is presented with the concept of right and wrong and how the line can be occasionally blurred based on beliefs and backgrounds. It shares a sense of classical epic-ness in the same way \\"1984\\" and \\"A brave new world do\\"... but in my opinion it is easier and more rewarding a read than the other two!	2011-12-02

A Clockwork Orange has twenty one chapters, yet the version released in the United States has only twenty.  Stanley Kubrick's movie was based on those twenty chapters.<br /><br />The reality is that the book is a philosophical novel and is, as some others have noted, rather funny in places.  Anthony Burgess created a second language with Nad-Sat, still spoken today among his fans.<br /><br />Watched the movie, then purchased and read the book and much prefer it over the stylized violence on screen.	2011-10-11

Many people talk about how hard the slang is to understand but I first read this when I was about 16 and I had no trouble at all. Being from a small town in the U.S. with no real exposure to Slavic languages it only took me reading the first chapter to get used to the slang. So don't let the language discourage you from enjoying this masterpiece of literature. It is a bit graphic and quite violent but (unlike the movie) there is a purpose to it all.	2011-10-10

I'm not going to go over the book, most here know it, I'll just discuss the idea behind the last chapter.  So liitle Alex grows up at the end and sets aside his violent ways?  Just like that?  The previous acts that under any examination are those of a sociopath, so easily cast aside upon reaching the age of 18?  This simply makes no sense at all.  No wonder Kubrick wasn't buying it.  Alex is evil, he is a sociopath.  Sociopath don't \\"mature\\" out of violence, they either get worse or discover how to control their actions (if they get the appropriate mental help).  I understand what Burgess was trying to demonstrate (free will, yada, yada), but he insults the readers intelligence in the last chapter.  The type of crimes Alex committed, the intensity of the violence, his estatic pleasure he derived from committing them are not things that are outgrown.  Burgess asks us to suspend belief, but after one reads the book, it is too difficult a task to do.  The last chapter,  IMO is a cop out.	2011-08-07

To have the author of the book blast not only the director of the film adaptation, but also the publisher in New York in the first pages, I was already intrigued. Understanding the vision of an author and to have that altered can really be a shame.     Like most of the reviewers, I read the first page of the actual novel and I was very frustrated with the slang of \\"your most humble narrator\\". However, I found that after using the context clues as well as looking at some of the other reviews to get some insight on the book, it was quite easy to read. I found that having to reread the phrases helped me focus on reading the novel. Though it was a very grimm subject matter, I couldn't stop reading.     The question of justification on the government's part is still an active argument in today's society. Should one's morality be controlled by someone else if it means turning them 'good'? Everyone is going to have a different opinion on this and Burgess is great at the visuals of explaining the consequences of brainwashing even the worst criminals. I enjoyed reading the book and though the subject is gruesome, the avid reader should get a chance to viddy themselves to open their glazzies and rots to something new.	2011-04-12

The society that Burgess creates is both intriguing and sadly believable, and there are many questions that the reader is left asking about agency, violence, and humanity in general. Alex, the main character, goes through a maturing process, which makes this a good example of a coming-of-age novel. For that reason, I would recommend this book to both teenagers and adults that are interested in the sci-fi genre and want to have a brain-twisting, creepy experience. However, Alex speaks in a language called Nadsat, which is a mix of English and Slavic-based slang. It can be difficult to understand, especially at first, so I would not recommend it to people who are not willing to put a little effort into the novel to get something out of it. It is also extremely violent, so the faint of heart might want to find another book with butterflies, rainbows, and the like.	2011-03-03

I saw the film numerous times in my less-literate punk-rock influenced youth, which does follow the book closely enough--up to a certain point. However, as is usually the case with books subsequently made into films, &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; far exceeds Kubrick's interpretation (of whom I am a fan, but &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; is certainly not his best film). Enough about Kubrick--going forward, I studied Russian for 2 years, so I understand the most common words of simple Russian that Burgess converted into his slang speak. So I'm glad I read the book after having studied Russian, instead of before. Which is not to say that I would have been lost with knowing any Russian. Despite the unique ambiance created by the &#34;Nadsatsprache&#34;, the overarching theme of the author's disillusioned view of humanity takes precedence. Alex is more precocious that any 15 year old I've ever known. However, since he inhabits a vaguely futuristic dystopic society, I'll assume that the youth of that world grow up even faster than in our current time. A 15 year old with violent tendencies who listens to classical music also seems oxymoronic--especially in the context of the present day, when the notion of the &#34;classical arts&#34; is fading into oblivion more quickly than ever. Nonetheless, in the case of Burgess's fully fleshed out and credible pseudo-fascistic-fantasma-fantasy world, suspension of disbelief becomes that much easier. And Alex is a classic anti-hero, a leader with a fierce, aggressive intellect, ironically probably the same kind of person that becomes a CEO, which would involve taming the wild animal (IE Alex) with the proper indoctrination so that he grows up to become a powerful, albeit mainstream, and savage corporate beast. After all, nature rewards aggression, provided that impulse can be correctly channeled--ultimately, &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; ponders the possibility of finding that balance. The final chapter does hint that the previously anti-social characters of this world will be absorbed into mainstream society.<br /><br />Stephen C.

But, lately I've been into dystopian fiction and this one seemed like a classic that I needed to be able to say I've read.  I have never seen the movie either and I figured I'd better read the book first.  When I first pick it up... I honestly could not get past the first page or 2.  The nadsat language really through me for a loop.  So, I put it aside for a few weeks, then came back to it and tired again.  I decided to just go for it and see if it started to make sense.... and after about a chapter I had the flow down.  In the end, the language of the book really hooked me.  It made it that much more fun and interesting.  So, if you too have a hard time at first, stick with it.  I promise it's worth it.<br /><br />I really liked this book.  It was much more thought provoking and intersting that I thought it would be.  The character Alex starts off real arrogant and annoying in the beginning... really asking for it.  But as the story goes on I really felt sorry for him.  He really makes his own bed the whole way through, but you still can't help but feel for him.  What I find really interesting is that the final chapter was originally left out of the American version fo this story.  Personally... I don't think I would have liked the book as much without that final chapter.  For me, it really made the whole story.  But I don't want to give anythign away so that all I have to say.  :)	2011-02-04

Burgess does all of this in the number of pages that few authors have proven possible.  The depth of Burgess' writing is something that I think has not been reproduced since.  When it comes to literature, the only thing I value more than complex, flowery poetry and abstraction in the guise of a novel is depth, in the sense that every sentence gives the reader many tidbits of information about the literary construction of the novel's world.  I also think that Burgess' understanding of psychology is unheralded.  Many of brief notes, often subtle, speaks volumes about the uman condition and man's response to it.<br /><br />I also like that Burgess uses the russian language as slang in this book, because I have a penchant for the language.  I thought it was an interesting and original implementation.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone!<br /><br />(note: that there are two versions of this book; the original and the american version.  The american, or Kubrickian version, does not have chapter 21.  I have been asked on many occassions why I speak of hope and free will when discussing this book, and this is due to chapter 21, which entirely changes the meaning of the book.)	2011-01-06

However, don't let that discourage you from reading this book. Burgess artfully crafts a unique slang which starts out confusing, but the book is so engrossing that you'll find yourself using the terms he creates in your own mind. This printing includes the final chapter that was omitted from the movie. I won't spoil the ending for you, but it definitely adds to the book, and you can choose to ignore it if you so choose. This book most certainly deserves to be called a classic, as it is really quite excellent, though not quite as impactful in the long run, I think, as other similar books such as 1984, Fahrenheit 451, or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Still, if you're looking for an entertaining read that has more substance than your average modern novel, this is a good book to turn to.	2010-11-01

And for those of you who haven't seen the movie but have an idea of what it's about. Be prepared to be lost on your first read-through, or at least for the first quarter to half of the book. As learning the nadsat language is quite the challenge...albeit a fun one. Once you learn it, it's such a breeze to read through this or watch the movie and not have to stop and think about what exactly one of the characters said, or what it means.<br /><br />Now, if you have no idea what this book/movie is about...go into it with an open mind. Yes it's very adult oriented and lots of graphic rape/torture going on. But that doesn't mean it should be looked down on. It's a brilliant story about something that no one has even touched on before. The story will just keep you going and going and you will soon find yourself at the end, wishing it wasn't over...as I found the book a little short compared to the 2hr. 30min. version that Kubrick has directed.<br /><br />Overall, a very great book, brilliant and intriguing.	2010-10-19

It had been a long time since I'd seen the movie (25-30 years), so aside from a broad remembrance of Malcolm McDowell raising holy hell and undergoing \\"reconditioning\\", I remembered little of the story.  In fact, in an introduction to the 1986 edition of the work, Burgess explains that previous American editions, as well as the Kubrick film, neglected to include the 21st chapter of the story.<br /><br />MILD SPOILERS, FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE STORY<br /><br />The story is set in a near future dystopia, in which our humble narrator, Alex, epitomizes the rampant lawlessness and thuggery of society.  After several instances of extreme antisocial behavior, he is arrested, convicted and incarcerated.  Faced with political backlash as a result of the high crime rate, the powers that be have concocted an effective rehabilitation technique to combat recidivism.<br /><br />Alex is the perfect lab rat for the new technique, which utilizes harsh negative reinforcement to forestall even the thought of violence.  Effectively cured, he is released into society, where he becomes an unwilling tool for both the current administration as well as its opponents.  At issue is the morality of the treatment itself.  As the prison chaplain opines:<br /><br />\\"It may not be nice to be good Alex.  It may be horrible to be good.  And when I say that to you I realize how self-contradictory that sounds.  I know I shall have many sleepless nights about this.  What does God want?  Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness?  Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has good imposed upon him?  Deep and hard questions, Alex.\\"<br /><br />And later, a former victim of Alex's wrongdoing states, \\"They always bite off too much.  But the essential intention is the real sin. A man who cannot choose ceases to be a man.\\"  In any event, after a political struggle, Alex's conditioning is reversed.  The previously omitted 21st chapter deals with Alex's free choice to be good or be bad, and the inclusion of this chapter, in effect, changes the entire book, in my opinion.<br /><br />No review can be complete without reference to the style of language used throughout the novel.

'A Clockwork Orange' appears on a number of the lists. There have been times when I read a classic novel, and it just doesn't connect with me. It is a great pleasure when a classic book turns out to be...just that a classic.    'A Clockwork Orange' is the story of Alex, a young hooligan who spends most of his evenings/nights reaking havok. Alex and his 'droogs' beat people, fight rival gangs, steal, rape, and murder. We see some tension and a budding power struggle in Alex's gang. This leads to Alex's eventual capture and imprisonment. The state has a new treatment to reform the ultra-violent inmates. Will this change lead Alex down the right path?    This novel is a great look at loosing ones freedom. Whether from the gangs who inflict violence on the innocent, or from the prisoner who looses the ability to choose. We watch Alex move from a gang leader, to a prisoner, to a test subject, to a government pawn, to a political pawn, and back to violence. While this book is nearing 50 years old, it still sends a strong message. It a very enjoyable read!	2010-08-12

The grim Soviet England of the twenty first century is ruled by a puppet Labor Party bent on restoring order at any price. The price is the adoption of compulsory brain surgery to control rampaging, restive youth crazies who threaten the stability of the state.<br /><br />State-provided hallucinogenic milk apparently does not pacify the youth gangs that plague London. Alex and his \\"droogs\\" become the unwilling experiments in the state's surgical pacification scheme. CLOCKWORK raises the question of whether free will or state madated determinism rules the human soul in a dramatic showdown between priest and commissar. As in WANTING SEED, medicine becomes the grim handmaiden for the state and a constant nemesis for the prolife Burgess.<br /><br />This book works well as linguistic fiction with the future culture of England defined by the newspeak of Russian/cockney slang. We visit CLOCKWORK'S crumbling, socialist England as witnesses to its unique newspeak language defined in a glossary at the end of the book. The slang puts us in scene. CLOCKWORK is classic dystopia and succeeds where its sister dystopia WANTING SEED, also written in 1962, fails.<br /><br />The american book edition drops the last chapter as does the movie, but it is here for you to read. The reflective Alex decides to grow up and apparently look for a wife to propagate his kind as society has been supressed. As in ONE HAND CLAPPING we are left in a moral desert created by the working class and the mass culture that allows them to flourish. The elitist Burgess would have nothing less.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0393315088 The Wanting Seed (Norton Paperback Fiction)]]	2010-08-11

In the case of Clockwork Orange, I think Anthony Burgess is dancing very merrily along the thin line that separates the two.<br /><br />I won't pad my review by rehashing the plot as so many others have already, but I do want to address a couple things. First, there's the frequent use of certain Russian slang/gibberish which the reader is assaulted with from the very first page. To some it may seem contrived and jarring, but if you plod through it long enough it becomes second nature with the help of context clues and it really does give the main character of Alex a distinct voice as Your Humble Narrator. I can be very impatient, so if I can get through it, anyone else should be able to. However, I don't feel there was much else to go on in terms of why I should care about or feel for Alex, and this is where I feel as if having seen the movie first works as an advantage. Clockwork Orange strikes me as a very visual story, and the Stanley Kubrick film adaptation really went over the top with its disturbing sexual imagery and bizarre costumes and set pieces. Love it or hate it, it sticks in your mind. In the novel, which I realize came first of course, Alex comes off an \\"everyman\\" and is quite forgettable once you close the cover, and is overall quite tame in terms of sex and violence.<br /><br />Thematically speaking I also felt the film version had the bigger impact. Maybe the whole idea of good and bad and the choices each one presents is better illustrated visually than on paper, I don't know, but perhaps Burgess tried to be a little too deep and profound which caused the whole thing to build up only to fall flat at the end, whereas the film presented it in a wink-wink, nudge-nudge kind of way all along. I will give props to the book for presenting a number of memorable and thought provoking quotes on the subject though, which I have since passed on to my friends for discussion.<br /><br />In itself, Clockwork Orange was not a bad read. It's a unique and imaginative social commentary and I can certainly see why it's heralded as a classic. But because of its inflated reputation and the fact I had the film so ingrained into my brain going into it, I suppose I couldn't help but be slightly underwhelmed. Still, I'm reluctant to come right out and say the movie is better at the risk of sounding like I don't \\"get it\\" because I most certainly do. I just happen to think the visuals of the movie enhance the characters and theme. In fact I'd probably recommend checking out both in order to get the fullest understanding of what's going on, because one helps to fill in the gaps of the other.since passed on to my friends for discussion.

I would read the first two chapters...and then decline by frusturation. and I felt that way because it was sooo discouraging to start reading and be completely confused on what exactly was being said! Last night I got a little down and wanted to escape...so I went to my bookcase and couldn't find anything quite right to read, everything was too...nice...so then i saw \\"A Clockwork Orange\\"...I was so depressed, bored, and down, i didn't give up on the book because i was honestly so annoyed with my current predicaments that i didn't really care just wanted to get my mind off things, ya know? so i began reading...and reading...and reading some more...i passed that line i never got over...and let me tell you, though the book is hard to understand at first, the book really is a little brilliance of a thing. some people write for the sake of their own imagination, some people write to let out their feelings, some people write because they WANT to be brilliant, but he wrote something intricate and with purpose and he also wrote something that really tricked you into thinking about..things. he is brilliant because he was so clear in purpose and pure. it was very natural. and i ended up loving nadsat (the lang. that confused me at first) my bit of advice in capital letters in case no one wants to read this...PUSH YOURSELF THRU THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS, AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY AND JOYFUL. :)	2010-07-05

No matter how many books I've read, A Clockwork Orange has been and I believe always will be my favorite book of all time. First and foremost, it is different from any other book you will read, ever. The first time I read it, I put it down halfway through because it was so difficult to follow. Anthony Burgess does a complete 180 on the English language (not something uncommon for him I have come to find out) and the characters in it speak in a made-up language throughout the entire book. Being me and hating to leave a book unfinished no matter how terrible it is, I had to come back to it some 6 months or so later and start re-reading it from the beginning.  You start picking up the language that is used and the book becomes one of those can't-put-it-down, makes-you-rethink-your-life sort of book.   The main characters are early teen gang members who do some pretty horrifying things, yet when you read it you're not as horrified as you think you should be because you can sense that these are just kids and they don't understand the gravity of what they're doing, they think they're just having fun. They beat up the homeless, break into people's homes and rape innocent women, all in the name of good fun. Then they go home, drink some milk, listen to music, and don't think twice about the things they've done. But then on the other hand, that is exactly what IS so horrifying about it. A part I like about it also is that these kids are not getting drunk or using drugs and then going out and ruining their lives, this is just the way they are, they actually enjoy it. Anthony Burgess does a great job of not letting you think of these kids as perverted juvenile delinquents, you can't help but like them, and sometimes feel sorry for them.    This book is well worth the effort that must be put forth to enjoy it- If you have trouble halfway through, start over, YOU WON'T BE SORRY.	2010-06-09

It's been hanging out there for a while, but I've never really attempted to read it before. I found that completing the book was a challenge for me.<br /><br />The writer of this book uses lots of colloquial phrasing and made-up language. Most readers can figure out the meaning of the words from their usage, however some readers will get frustrated and choose not to undertake the challenge.<br /><br />The book is somewhat violent, following Alex, a 15 year old through the streets as he and his friends beat and rape innocent people. They break into houses and steal from whoever is unlucky enough to be in their path.<br /><br />Some people categorize this book as a science fiction dystopian novel. Big words that basically mean it's set in the future. However in reading this book, I can see that it might fit in any time period. I was reminded of The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton. I can imagine youth of the 50s and 60s acting this way, just as I knew a few youth who in the 80s and 90s acted this way.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't thrilled with the book. I feel a sense of accomplishment for finishing it, but also disappointment that it was such a waste of time.	2010-04-16
US	44361791	R2FN3KZCZHTGVY	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	2	6	6	N	Y	The Prodigal Twenty-First Chapter	This version of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" opens with an historical controversy in the forward and introduction.  The forward is written by the author, Anthony Burgess, and tells his story of the initial publication of what he calls his prized novella.  Burgess claims that the U.S. publisher forced the exclusion of the twenty-first chapter, which added a psychological twist to the ending.  The publisher, in the introduction, then claims that dropping chapter twenty-one was merely a suggestion and not a condition of publication.  Regardless of how this actually played out originally, I think it's obvious by the end of this book that the additional final chapter in question would have been better off left on the cutting room floor.    This novel does have much to recommend it including a famous movie version, sans the added chapter twenty-one, and a reputation as a classic horror story.  Written in 1962 and intended as a dark vision of the future of mind control, it does work towards this purpose to a certain extent.  However, it is also an exercise in cryptography as much of the included slang is as indecipherable as it is obsequiously obfuscating.  Perhaps this was what it took forty years ago to get these descriptions of violence and sex to be acceptable to the publishing industry, although the film was still rated X.  The result is that much of the book reads as if it was in a foreign language, which while it provided added interest to the story for me will probably be off-putting to the more typical reader.    The appended chapter twenty-one actually detracts from the impact of the story in a weak attempt to turn it into a fable on the human condition.  It turns a fairly interesting psychological study of violence and destructiveness in the young into a simplistic fantasy.  This fantasy involves the false dichotomy between right and wrong in human behavior.  The implication being that maturity and social consciousness are determined by age and an evolution of individual thought processes that occurs somewhat naturally.  This elevates a very minor subsidiary effect on personality to an overriding importance that only wishful thinking can preserve.  The central character not only changes his point of view and approach to the world completely in the added final chapter, but he does this with no deterministic external nurturing event to spur him on towards change.    The result is that this amounts to a quaint fantasmagorical fable in which nature runs rampant over nurture.  The moral of the story being that all individual actions depend solely on internal motivations, even in this extreme case where external events seem to drive the entire storyline.  This book is much more effective as an allegory without the addition of the twenty-first chapter, which is probably why the publisher, and Stanley Kubrick in his film version, quite correctly decided it was best left out.  It appears to be a clear case of an author not being able to see the forest for the trees and yearning for the addition of a legacy ending that detracts at least as severely from the story for the reader as it adds some warm cuddly nostalgia for him.  Editors and publishers apparently do serve a purpose sometimes and this updated version of an old story proves that point definitively.	2010-04-07

The movie is a wonderful interpretation of the book, but, like most instances when a book is converted into a movie, the movie does not fully capture the book's raw, unbridled brutality nor the intensity of its incisive criticism of totalitarianism, profligate consumerism, and youth culture, nor does it raise quite the same questions regarding the ethics of controlling morality.     The book is narrated through the eyes of Alex - recalcitrant youth extraordinare. He and his gangs he tenderly calls \\"Droogs\\" galivant around, inciting chaos, creating mayhem, and carrying out heinous acts of violence that they convey through a rather facetious slang called nasdat. The slang itself is indicative of their situation - it's ironic, brutal, and a bit unsensical and serves to mitigate the overt cruelty of their acts, which, until part two, range from beatings, theft, and even rape which they execute with a disturbing enjoyment. However, a deeper examination of Alex's character reveals perhaps Burgess' intended assertion: Modern youth culture is defined by its meaningless shenanigans (in this case amplified to the extremes of violence, however the droogs do not see it as such), a shallow morality, an egocentric personality, and a seemingly meaningless purpose in life. Burgess only intenifies such a culture through the book's autocratic government. Each adult is forced to work, life has little to no significance in the grand scheme of things. Indeed, Alex's morality is implied to be corrupted via his vapid future.     Alex's fortunes shift after he is arrested and convicted of murder following a raid of an affluent old woman. However, he finds his niche in prison, and endears himself to the prison's chaplain, and is afforded utilities that other prisoners are not. Ironically, Alex's prison settingis almost idyllic for him - a stark contrast to the gritty streets in which he ruled. Yet, a new prisoner is implemented into Alex's cell, and a subsequent brawl leads to another indictment of murder for Alex.     His following punishment serves as Burgess primary form of commentary on the totalitarian state. Alex is subjected to psychological conditioning by association. By pairing savage scenes with a nausea inducing serum, Alex is inculcated to have an averse biological reaction when he thinks of violence - and tangentially, classical music which he adores. The novel's central theme is henceforth revealed - Is it ethical to restrict the free impulses of man if it benefits society as a whole?     Without revealing too much of the rest for those of you who have not read it yet, Alex's apparent cure is not all that it seems.     All in all this was a tremendous book to read, and I quite enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys dystopic type settings and novels whose themes deal with broader social issues. Be warned however, it is not for the squeamish nor the faint of heart. A Clockwork Orange is one brutal, yet satisfactory read.	2010-02-26

Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: 0 days.    Days spent reading it: 3 days.    Why I read it: I enjoy dystopian society novels, like 1984 and A Brave New World. I heard that A Clockwork Orange was in the same vein, so I checked it out.    Brief review:  A Clockwork Orange was a great gem for me to discover. While it can be compared to the types of worlds described in 1984 and A Brave New World, this novel stands on its own for me. I loved the main character of Alex and we are in his mind during the whole novel.    Essentially this book asks one question: What if we could solve all crime committed by humans, but the cost was our free choice? Would the price be too high ? In this novel, Alex is a juvenile punk, and when he gets caught in the act of breaking into a home, he is sent away to prison. While there he is offered a treatment that will get him out of jail in 2 weeks. He takes it, but in the process loses his ability to act out in violence. He gets physically sick when he thinks about hurting someone. He also loses his love for music (one of his few redeeming qualities before his incarceration). He then revisits his previous life, but there are some surprises in store for him as he encounters people who he attacked or knew from his earlier life.    I love how this book explores the big ideas of good and evil as they are presented in humanity. I love how it explores freedom and bondage. I love how the themes could be taught in a theology class and not miss a beat, and a theology class would be all the richer for it. Is this book for everyone? No way. The language is difficult (Burgess made up a kind of teenage slang for the book) and the events include senseless violence and sexuality. But for those willing to get past the first few pages of slang (which oddly enough actually mutes the violence and sexuality present in the pages), the book opens up into a wonderful treat that is both entertaining and philosophical.    Favorite quote: \\"What does God want? Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness? Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him? Deep and hard questions little 6655321.\\"    Stars: 5 out of 5.    Final Word: Liberating.	2010-02-15

It has been hailed as genius satire and denounced as violent exploitation. Some read it as Burgess's own depraved rape fantasies. Other people will argue that it's an attempt to get into the heads of the young men who gang-raped his pregnant wife. Others read it as a piece of chaotic, post-modern art to be appreciated by the edgy and the hip.    A Clockwork Orange may be all of those things and more. What it is most of all, however, is an amazing, sweeping, page-turning read.   Burgess takes the reader inside the mind of Alex, the leader of a small youth gang, all of whom enjoy nothing more than imbibing mind-altering substances, giving women a bit of the old in and out (whether they like it or not) and beating up the poor. This all changes, however, when Alex is arrested and given the chance to participate in an experiment to cure his sociopathy and turn him into a fine, upstanding member of society.   While Alex's violence and the moral quandary posed by the experiment form part of the sick, prurient excitement of the book, none of it would work nearly as well without Alex's cynical and humorous tongue-in-cheek narration, told in a fictional Slavic-inspired slang language that may be difficult to comprehend the first few pages, but soon becomes readily clear.   With Alex, Burgess takes the anti in anti-hero to new levels, to the point where he can barely be called a hero if not for the fact that his observations and asides are strangely and hilariously charming.	2009-12-11

Your Humble Narrator - or, Alex - and his three droogs spend their evenings and nights beating, raping, torturing and stealing from any person unlucky enough to be in Alex's path. One evening, however, the gang turns on Alex and he is set-up, with the police arriving just as he murdered an old woman in her house.     Off to jail he goes, having to serve over a decade in a prison over-stuffed, with six or more people sharing a cell designed for two or three prisoners at most. Alex, however, is given the choice to take part in a new program that will get him out of the prison in two weeks, and back to the outside world to live his life as he sees fit. This new program, however, is not something Alex expected; Alex was tied to a chair, with his eyes taped open and forced to watch horrible acts of violence and murder - acts all-too familiar and enjoyable to Alex - as an injected chemical makes him feel nauseous and sick. After two weeks of this treatment, Alex would feel sick at the mere thought of violent acts.    The treatment worked, and Alex's life became a living nightmare, as his former friends were now police officers and old victims were able to exact their vengeance upon Alex. A failed attempt at suicide left Alex in the hospital - cured of Ludovic's experiment - and a return to the life of violence and crime he once knew.    So ends the previously published American version, short one chapter that had been published in the UK. Burgess claims the American publisher made the decision to leave out the final chapter while the publisher claims it was \\"merely a suggestion made for conceptual reasons.\\" Regardless, the American version misses a chapter that is vital to the message: the power of choice.     One of the characters - the prison chaplain - asks the questions, \\"Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness? Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?\\" Through the experimental punishment to rid Alex of his evil ways, he no longer had a choice in his actions. This brings a moral dilemma, discussed by a panel after Alex has completed his punishment. \\"He ceases to be a wrongdoer. He ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice,\\" argued one person, but the general consensus was that, \\"We are not concerned with motive, with the higher ethics. We are concerned only with cutting down crime...and with relieving the ghastly congestion in our prisons.\\" This moral dilemma, the ability to choose right or wrong, good or evil, is the message of Burgess' work. The final chapter completes the story and how Alex chooses and acknowledges this moral choice.    A Clockwork Orange is written in a peculiar way - the entire book uses the nadsat language created by Burgess. Not so much a language, rather heavy slang influenced by Slavic languages, the use of nadsat creates a unique world the reader becomes entranced in. It also helps to alleviate the gruesome nature of Alex and his friends, putting more focus on the message rather than the brutal acts of violence. While some may be put off by the confusing language at first, Burgess does an excellent job introducing it and using each new word in context easy to understand and grasp, and before long the reader will be reading at his/her normal pace.	2009-12-09

US	24314482	R47VXT15006HG	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	3	4	6	N	N	A CLOCKWORK ORANGE FORTY-TWO YEARS LATER	I first read Anthony Burgess's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE at the age of seventeen, several years before Stanley Kubrick's movie made the book famous. I even wrote a book report on it for my English class, though I cannot recall any details. When I started to reread the book recently, I at first put it aside as I had no stomach for reading about sadistic beatings, rape, and murder. However, since it had once made rather a strong impression upon not only me but a large segment of America's youth - I know of men who rave about A CLOCKWORK ORGANGE as the greatest movie ever made - I decided to read on to see if I could thereby visit my younger self. It is an ugly truth that the average man, more so younger men than those over forty, is fascinated and even excited by rape. This is probably even true of women. Ayn Rand's heroines typically drive the men they love into raping them; it is not only men who read and reread those passages. Men are often earnestly attracted to women who sneer at them, to which revenge fantasies are an almost reflexive response. (Whether a man is repulsed by such fantasies or enjoys them surely seems to be a matter of personal disposition rather than choice). Although both men and women, the normal ones anyway, are repulsed by the violence of real rape, the popularity of Burgess's novel rests upon its readers' fascination with fantasy rape. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is little more than a glorification of violent rape.    In Burgess's Playboy interview, shortly after Kubrik's movie came out, he stated that his wife had been violently gang-raped and left physically crippled. Apparently this was the event that triggered the writing of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Burgess emphasized that such violence is an act of free will, which is his religious conviction as a Catholic. This was also the conviction of Alex, the narrator of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Alex scoffs as he listens to a media report that tries to blame youthful violence on the deteriorated moral values of the city, saying it would make just as much sense to blame the more prevalent human kindness on the conditions of the city. This is the free will doctrine, that evil is always entirely personal choice completely irrespective of one's culture. This is a very odd idea that is negated by even the simplest consideration of evidence. It is simply an observation that violent cultures produce more people who are prone to violence than nonviolent ones. After breaking into a couple's home, gang-raping a woman and beating her husband half to death, Alex and his droogs indulge in a rampage of destruction because they are full of, like, hate. So Alex presumably believes that he freely chose to be full of hate, and that other people choose to feel love, and it is entirely up to each individual to choose whichever way one likes. This might well be, but being the sort of person who likes to be full of hate is not a free will choice. People who routinely engage in violence because they have been nourished on violence, and not because they are violent by nature, sometimes reform when their empathy for their victims finally wins through. Alex narrates acts of disgusting brutality with such relish that he seems to be evil by nature, a psychopath completely lacking any sense of empathy.    As the story goes, Alex is arrested and by a combination of drugs and Pavlovian conditioning, his violent nature is forcibly reformed, so that even daydreaming about rape makes him violently ill. Of course, he has not really reformed because he still wants to be evil. He is still full of the juices of life but has been reduced to an automaton a clockwork orange. The prison chaplain opposes this treatment on the grounds that a person who chooses brutality freely is somehow more moral than a person who wants to be brutal but cannot because his free will has been taken from him. Apparently the movie audiences agreed; when Alex's treatment is reversed and he gets his free will back so he is once again capable of brutal rape, people cheered, and not merely the men. At the very least, if it were possible to artificially condition a human to non-violence, it is certainly just as possible that one could be naturally conditioned to violence by haphazard cultural conditioning.  It is certainly grotesque that Burgess's response to an attack on his wife was to write a novel glorifying violence. That was not his intention, though it is hard to ascertain just what his intention was. I get the impression that he wanted to mock the modern tendency to accredit violence to cultural conditioning rather than free will. If this is the case, he does not succeed. At the very least, if it were possible to artificially condition a human to non-violence, it is certainly just as possible that one could be naturally conditioned to violence by haphazard cultural conditioning. The behaviorist school of psychology denies a human has any nature except that which has been conditioned by the interplay of one's genes and the circumstances one's life, hence free will is a mere delusion. However, we can believe in man's capacity for free will and still recognize that few people have developed this capacity to any significant extent. Few people have sufficient insight to question the familial and cultural-conditional that has shaped them. We are even discouraged from such questioning on the grounds that it amounts to disloyalty to our family, religion, and country. An analogy that I sometimes use is that everyone has the capacity to do calculus, but few people develop the actual ability. The difference is that people who do not know how to do calculus know that they cannot do calculus; nearly everyone takes it for granted even hysterically so, as Alex does - that they act according to their own will.    The novel is in no way realistic, and that was apparently Burgess's intent. It is replete with the sort of wildly improbable coincidences that were standard in nineteenth century literature. Though this is a convention that I do not appreciate, it is not necessarily a flaw. What is a flaw is that Alex is not a believable character. The last chapter, in which Alex reforms, was omitted from the American version of the book that I read in 1967, as it was from the movie. I gather that Burgess feels that including this chapter in which Alex reforms somehow redeems his novel from being a mere glorification of violence. Alex was fifteen when he went into prison for murder, and he is eighteen when he reforms. Though he does observe that young people are like wind-up toys who behave as they do without thinking, which suggests that he now believes that his violence was conditioned rather than willed, he experiences no epiphany of insight. Alex experiences no remorse, no urge to atone for the pain that he has caused; he simply grows out of his violence and starts carrying pictures of babies around with him. Even if this had happened at the age of fifty it would not be convincing.	2009-11-22

Alex is, \\"Our humble Narrator\\" who takes us on a journey through his youth in London (set in a future time period).<br /><br />We read as Alex goes through what I'll call an extreme rebellious period - his reformation and subsequent life choices. Sometimes when I read what others call \\"a classic\\" I'm left wondering why exactly the book was given that honor, but I can see why A Clockwork Orange was. It's a gruesome but cautionary tale of violence and government repression (in some sorts). Alex is originally allowed the choice of good or evil before others try to take it away, which makes the question of this novel. Is it better to have the choice of good or evil, even if people may pick evil?<br /><br />The storyline and character actions often go to the extreme but I think there is a great point to be found within these pages that is still functional today.<br /><br />One caution: Burgess uses many of his own slang words through the novel - I found a great online site and spent most of the first six/seven chapters translating from their dictionary.	2009-09-11

The movie poster presented a violent psychedelic trip from the 60's, and I was deeply intrigued, immediately attending a showing during the weekend.  That experience prompted me to find the book as soon as possible.  The author Anthony Burgess writes in his introduction (and this is paraphrasing) that he makes no affiliation to Kubrick's interpretation, and rightly so.  This edition of the work contains the 21st chapter that was originally cut from printing and later in the film adaptation.  Unjust!  Reality takes the grand finale in the life of the \\"humble narrator, Alex\\" and the 21st chapter symbolizes the natural change from adolescence into adulthood, deep into the unknown.  It does not provide hope, only speculation, as Alex finds futility in the \\"shopcrasting\\" and \\"ultraviolence\\".  This is the real \\"horrorshow\\", this edition and comments from it's \\"humble\\" author.  Enjoy the \\"old in-and-out\\" Burgess works on your mind and the classic language \\"Nasdat\\" as you read about Alex, the clockwork orange.	2009-08-03

It's funny how people gave this book such a low rating because they couldn't understand it. Yeah, Burgess basically made up a language for it but it's not hard to grasp if you have more than eight brain cells.     A Clockwork Orange is an amazing book. It had me basically on the edge of my seat, just waiting to see what's going to happen next. It's very rare that a book is able to hold my attention and this one dad a great job of it. I did not want to put it down and it left me wishing that there would have been a sequel of sorts.    I would recommend this book if  1. You have a good sense of humor/can easily detect sarcasm.  2. Don't mind violence.  3. Are at least somewhat intelligent and able to think logically.  4. Have a good grasp on the English language (in order to better understand the made up slang)    I would not recommend this book if  1. You are an idiot and can't understand basic English, ala the people that have written bad reviews about it.    Overall, it's a very interesting book and if you've yet to read it, you should definitely consider buying it right now.	2009-07-27

Mainly because every time I would attempt to watch the movie I would fall asleep, and never even get past his time in jail. So I decided to try and read it, and it was great. I had the edition with the final chapter that was once edited out in the American versions, so there is a different ending for the book, which I think made me ultimately like the book more than the movie.    The language was a little hard to get through in the beginning but once you get a hang of the words it's a lot easier. Also if you go on Sparknotes.com they have a glossary of what all the words mean. But by that time, I had already figured them out for myself. I would recommend this book, but I would suggest reading it before watching the movie.	2009-06-12

Although I agree that this work is certainly deserving of the term \\"enduring\\", having read the re-published \\"British\\" edition I feel that it falls short of deserving the categorization of \\"masterpiece\\". In the introduction, Burgess himself claims that he is unhappy with the fact that Clockwork is his best-known work and insists that the original \\"American\\" and Kubrick movie versions were incomplete. Those versions end with the 20th chapter, instead of the 21st that the British and most other editions were published with. To not risk giving out spoilers, I will simply say that personally, I disagree with Burgess and feel that the book would have been more of a masterpiece if all versions ended with the 20th chapter.<br /><br />The dialect that the narrator uses is at first hard to understand. Thankfully, I quickly got used to it, but the first few chapters were rough and I honestly think the book would have been just as good if Burgess had used proper English and not the made-up slang he actually used. Also, it was admittedly a bit difficult to read through the extreme amount of violence written into the story, although of course the novel would not have had the same impact without that. In the end, although I think this book raises interesting questions and was a great story, because of the aforementioned things I simply can't rate it at more than 3 out of 5 stars.	2009-06-11

Beyond the detailed violence (very well written on Burgess' part) I REALLY enjoyed this book especially the slang (Nasdat). A Clockwork Orange is a dark and humorous tale which when given a chance expresses deep insight on government, free will, moral choice, and much more. I can't really think of much more to say except that if you are considering seeing the movie, read the book first...in my opinion the book is much better. Also, don't let anyone's tales of the violence depicted be a reason for not reading the book, because beyond that, is so much more.     A real horrorshow book. : )	2009-06-03

I found the main character's weakness for music a bit unplausible, as was his 'rehabilitation', which seems to me to be discordant with the whole Pavlovian conditioning concept.  Today, the shock value the book provides feels more like someone yelling guttural slurs rather than singing in a twisted melody, like Portishead, as I'm sure it seemed in the early '60 (please excuse the imprecise and very subjective simile).  Lastly, the really cool lexicon used by the main characters also seems too academically rendered, since slang usually evolves to decrease syllables and increase ease of speaking, while the language here was a bit laborious, you viddy?    All in all, these are minor annoyances.  The story offers a piercing glimpse into our own psyches, where we push down many taboo impulses in hopes of maintaining civility around us.  The character ends the novel (in the non-american version) not necessarily learning anything (in my opinion) but realizing how tiring it is to be rebellious.  Now that is a realistic.	2009-05-10

When I started reading this book, I was inclined to put it down, because it didn't feel as something I would like. I'm glad I didn't, this is one of those classics that gets better with every read.    I know Russian language, but after first couple of chapters it was still hard to follow the 'nadsat' talk. 'Nadsat' is slang language invented by Burgess, it is a mixture of Russian and English. After You get used to this talk, it adds a lot to this book: it makes You think with both side of Your brain and follow more closely the text, because You're looking for clues what certain slang words mean. I think people who have given low mark because of the slang talk haven't given enough effort to read the book.    After reading the book, I also watched Kubricks movie and got the same initial impression as reading the paperpack, that I don't like it. Everything seemed so theater-like, artificial, but the more I got into the movie, the more I like it. It is a classic as is the book. They supplement each other nicely: the more You read the book or watch the movie, the more You want to do it again.	2009-04-11

Dialect is rare and difficult to do well, and this is the best job I've seen of it since the Uncle Remus tales.<br /><br />As far as the philosophical ramifications of the novel, at first I'd say, heck yeah, brainwash those criminals into being pascifists.  But then again, what if brainwashing criminals isn't enough for the government and every civilian becomes brainwashed to the point of being incapable of self defense?<br /><br />It's always tough to find a balance for this kind of thing.  But you know, a society can only take so much pointless gang violence before resulting to drastic measures.  You want to avoid a potential 1984 type future?

Let me tell ya... the language takes a bit to sink in.  Even at the end of the book there were bits and pieces that I had to mentally translate to myself.  Burgess wrote this from the POV of Alex, a nasty little 14 year old who enjoys theft, burglary, assault and battery, rape and then the dabbles into manslaughter.  I say manslaughter because I don't believe that Alex and his friends intended to kill anyone, they just laid on the beat down a bit too hard.<br /><br />Oh, and Alex speaks directly to us... the readers, who he refers to as \\"my brothers\\" but Alex speaks in a slang that I hear is a mish-mash of Eurasian languages, particularly a lot of Russian thrown in.  It takes a while for your brain to process this language.  It's not hard to figure out through context what each of the words means, but it will certainly slow down your reading.  The version I read was 149 pages (the original European publishing that DID include the final chapter) and it took me close to a week to finish it.  Now I had been told that this was an ultraviolent book... and at the time it may have been... but I didn't find it to be any more violent than \\"In Cold Blood\\" or some other classics that I was encouraged to read.  However, the book keeps referring to the goings on as \\"ultra-violence.\\"  True there are several beatings, a knife fight, a few rapes, drug use, etc... but with the mental translation it took to figure out exactly what was occurring... sure I knew it was wrong, but it didn't \\"horrify\\" me.  Then again I grew up in an age where this kind of thing actually does happen.  I believe that when this was written, they had a belief that the world was a better place than those of us from later generations believe.<br /><br />The underlying theme is the question of - if you could force someone to be good... force them to only be capable of doing the right thing... is that good?  Or is it better to allow them the option to do evil, provided they have options.  What is the \\"Christian\\" thing to do in this case?  Would God be pleased to see his creations only doing good when they have no choice but to do it?  There are other themes running amok through this book, childhood, growing up, the violence inherent in the system, and the futility of rehabilitating prisoners when our prisons are overcrowded and unmanageable to name just a few.  There is a lot of meaning in this book, if one can manage their way through it.  Some will be turned off by the difficulty of reading the made up language, others will be turned off by the violence... but those who make it through certainly are left with quite a few tidbits to mull over in their minds.

It centers around the dealings of a young man, approx. 15-16 years old, involved in gangs in the not too distant future. Alex, the sadistic protagonist, is a teenager who enjoys beating, stealing, and raping the innocent, until a tragic murder is on his hands and he's thrown in jail. While in jail, he defends himself from getting raped and accidentally kills his assailant. Because of this crime, Alex is forced into a radical new treatment which promises to change society for the better. Anyone who undergoes this treatment cannot commit or watch any violent or vulgar acts with feeling a sensation similar to that of death (drowning specifically). Once he finishes this treatment, Alex attempts to return to his former life only to find himself surrounded by the very people he hurt, unfortunately for him they decide to get even (involving an orgy of violence begun by very old men). Once Alex attempts suicide, the government's doctors cure him and give him a job, in hopes of gaining some badly needed good P.R.. After a while of being his original self once again, Alex seems uneasy, as if the acts of ultra violence no longer satisfy him. Then he meets an old friend who seems to have grown up, has a wife, good job, and a promising future. Alex then decides to abandon the life of a scoundrel youth, considering he is now in his either late teens or early twenties, for a more upstanding life.                This novel explores the Adolescent Psyche showing the thought process of a teen and how, with age, that seems to change so dramatically, like dropping the use of some strange form of slang. It also explores the moral question \\"Is it worse to be bad by choice, or be good by force?\\" and the questionable actions of the government (i.e. the Vietnam War).            If one could get past the abnormal dialect, it took me about half way to truly understand what every word meant, 'droog' means 'friend' ; 'korova' means 'cow'; 'golova' (gulliver) means 'head'; 'malchick' or 'malchickiwick' means 'boy'; 'soomka' means 'sack' or 'bag'; 'Bog' means 'God'; 'khorosho' means good, 'prestoopnick' means 'criminal'; 'rooker' is 'hand', 'cal' is 'crap', 'vec' is 'man' or 'guy'; 'litso' is 'face'; and so on.

After getting used to the lingo created by Burgess, the book has a great flow to it, and the chapters are the perfect length.  I found myself lying in bed, reading, and coming to an end of a chapter, deciding \\"ohhh they're short enough that I can read just one more\\".

This sentence from the second-to-last chapter of our modern Dante's journey through Hell sums up this book in many ways. Intellectually stimulating, violent, fun, beautiful, dark and open; you won't find a better dystopia.<br /><br />The problems I tend to have with dark novels about possible futures are that the authors tend to be extremely proud of themselves, and this smugness can ruin a book--and also that the changes in society often seem too clever or silly for me to actually enjoy the story.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange, however, pleases the ear as much as it does the mind. Maybe this is because most of Burgess' new words are actually words stolen from other languages.

I could never get into a flow because too often (every paragraph for at least the first seven chapters) I had to stop and figure out what the protagonist was trying to say.  I nearly put it down for good when I got about halfway through it.  I'm glad I pushed on, though, because the last third of the book--the point in which I had finally figured out enough of the protagonist's language to not have to work so hard--was pretty good.

The book was much better than I expected. Though the film is visionary I must say the book is more fascinating and original; both gruesome and hilarious. Interesting to note is the very different ending in the book compared to the movie - obviously Burgess and Kubrick had different ideas. Go see the movie, then read the book, or vice versa!	2008-06-26
US	12011007	R3UE6HZITB5ABG	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Dark but Philosophical	Warning: This book is not for the faint of heart or the uptight. A Clockwork Orange is a very graphic and dark depiction of a sophisticated young man named Alex, who commits brutal acts of \\"ultraviolence\\" with his friends for pure aesthetic pleasure. However, it is also one of the most philosophically poignant books I've read, dealing with issues such as the nature of good and evil, the importance of free-will, and the inherent evils of government. This is definitely a must-read.    The most compelling aspect of the novel is Burgess' heavy use of a made-up teenage slang language called Nadsat (very appropriate commentary for our time, where today's teenage language of hip-hop vernacular and IM acronyms continues to puzzle adults). Although difficult to read at first, once you learn the Alex's language, you will become so absorbed in it that you may find yourself actually using Nadsat words without realizing it.    Also, if you have already seen Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of A Clockwork Orange, do not pass over the book! It is much better in both style and meaning. At the very least (if you don't want to buy the book), stop by the bookstore and read the final chapter of the book, which Kubrick unfortunately decided to omit from his film. It fundamentally changes both the story and its message.	2008-06-08

The epic journey of the protagonist Alex from his extreme highs to his disembodying lows serves as the focal plot throughout the novel. The themes of violence, mischief and revenge leave the reader anxious to see what happens next. Burgess is able to evoke an array of emotions from the reader toward Alex such as anger during his reckless days to empathy after he is left a shell of himself as a result of Ludovico's Technique.

The book takes place in the future where the main character, Alex, and his fellow \\"droogs\\" cause chaos and use their own invented slang throughout the book. Alex cannot help being violent, it is just who he is. He and his \\"droogs\\" go around beating people up, causing disturbance to the society around them, and rape. The book then takes a turn and Alex tries to change who he is and redeem himself; yet can you change who you naturally are? It offers the question of free will and the struggle between good and bad.

This treatment doesn't change the fact that he is inclined to commit violent acts, it just prevents him from doing so, taking away his free will. great imagery, i enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />its also cool how the author creates his own language. this effectively encapsulates the terms created by youth and only understood by youth, without putting a timeframe on the story by using actual slang from a certain time period.<br /><br />great story, definitely check it out.	2008-03-19

Wow, this book goes after some truly weighty subjects in a short time frame.  Burgess tells the story of his narrator, Alex, who is a clearly intelligent young man who has focused his youthful talents on setting out each night to terrorize the innocent citizens of a futuristic London.      The book is famous for Burgess' heavy use of a made-up slang that a committed reader will pick up quickly using context clues.  It actually serves to focus your attention on the book rather than as a distraction.  Further, Burgess uses the slang to differentiate groups of characters within the book and, in some of the book's most interesting moments, one side of a character from another side within himself.  The dichotomies created are very clear without being ham-fisted.  Very well done.    Burgess really creates a gritty, enveloping sense of place and mood as Alex and his pals meander through the city.  As the reader, you simultaneously feel their sense of power (empty though it may be) and the victim's sense of fear and helplessness.  Another great exploration of the duality of character within each of us, and yet this is still just a warm up for the main event!    The story hits its peak once Alex is sold out by his pals and captured by the police (who aren't really good guys).  Alex volunteers/is chosen for a new procedure which will \\"cure\\" him of his evil tendencies.  The scenes of brainwashing that follow are wonderfully crafted and this whole segment of the book artfully asks whether it is better to have a choice between good and evil when only a portion of us will choose good, or whether it is better for all of us to be good even at the cost of our free will.  It's a tremendous look at freedom vs. authoritarianism in all its forms.    As Alex is released back into the world, we see the flip side of his original self, someone incapable of any form of evil.  The string of events that follows brings up as many penetrating questions for the reader as any other portion of thebook.  Alex finishes (if you get a book with the 21st chapter - make sure you do) slightly older, with more perspective on his situation.    A book about the two sides (at least) we all have within us and the freedom some of us have and some of us lack to let the two sides out.  Highly recommended, you can see why this one has stood the test of time.	2008-03-05

He is an extraordinary novelist, essayist, and a very interesting (though overly pompous at times) person.  He wrote over 40 novels during his lifetime, which is remarkable considering he didn't start until his late 30's.  This is (obviously) his most famous novel, which he found somewhat annoying, as there were other books he was most proud of, but it's still a great novel, worthy of all its praise.  I especially like this new edition, which eliminated the Nadsat glossary (which was included in the initial American version of the book), and it reinstates the 21st chapter, which Kubrick didn't know about until filming was well under way.  The final chapter works very well.  It makes perfect sense that Alex would indeed grow weary of his punk/violent teenage days.  Occasionally, people refuse to grow up, but more often than not, they do mature and decide that things they did as youths were ridiculous and naive.  Youth, in my opinion, has always been terribly overrated (something Burgess agrees with), and that as one grows in experience and time, wisdom comes (for most, anyway), and that the silliness of youth can be set aside for a more intelligent, thoughtful, and open minded stance on life.  I feel the older you get, the more liberal and open minded you become, because you see more things and feel more things.  I really do like that final chapter quite a bit.<br /><br />Ironically, when the novel was released in Britain, the reviews were brutal, especially over the Nadsat language.  The reviewers felt that Burgess was committing sacrelige on the English language (which was ridiculous).  The American critics, however, loved the work, praising it for its vision and its inventions in language.  The American publisher did insist on adding the glossary (against Burgess's wishes), and cutting off the final chapter, which they felt softened Burgess's argument.  The final chapter makes it more of a fable (something Burgess talks about in his new intro \\"A Clockwork Orange Resucked\\"), but without the final chapter, the ending is creepier and more ambiguous.  Usually it's the opposite with editing for an American audiences.  Publishers/distributors dumb down for American audiences (when I don't think they should), but here, dropping the final chapter did make the ending darker.<br /><br />The book and the film should be read and seen as often as possible.  Kubrick wouldn't have been able to make such a great film without such strong source material.  And the differences between the film and the book are quite minor compared to most other adaptations.

Even though I knew this was supposed to be one of those \\"must be read in your lifetime\\" kind of books, I was always hesitant to pick it up due to the violence I knew lurked between the covers.  Not because I feared it, but because I could never quite find the right \\"mood\\" to tolerate it (especially with the newspaper, Kiterunner and such one picks up these days!)  However, the book came highly recommended (mostly by men, including the 30-something librarian who I checked it out from: \\"oh, you're going to love it!\\" I don't know how he knew, but he was right).  I finally cracked the cover.<br /><br />Lo and behold, what indiscernible argo did I discover on the first page! For such a short book, I told myself, this would be a long read.  After two or three pages of the futuristic, Russian-based slang I found that, like reading Shakespeare, the reader adjusts to the rhythm of the language.  It did not prevent the story from absorbing me, and I didn't need to know the definition of every word to grasp the meaning.<br /><br />Alex, the charming teenage sociopath narrator, spends the first third of the book inciting nightly acts of \\"ultraviolence\\" with his hooligan friends.  In the second part, he is caught, punished, and rehabilitated.  In the third, he must deal with the consequences of his violent past, and his present as a man who can no longer defend himself from them.  Although written in the 60's, it's hard not picture a 1980's London backdrop complete with the punks and hooligans bringing anarchy in an alternate socialist dystopia.<br /><br />A quick word on the violence.  Although the narrator gleefully partakes in some terrible actions, his use of slang to describe it actually keeps it rather slapstick and prevents it from becoming overly graphic (like Fightclub, for instance).  What I didn't expect at all was the humor.  Some of Alex's observations are riotously funny.  I even got a few strange looks while reading in public, either because I laughed too loudly, or reacted to Alex's deepening predicament with an \\"aah!\\"--a pretty good sign that I'm captivated.  This says something about the skill of the writer, that he had me empathizing with (if not exactly rooting for) a depraved character who I had no business liking under normal circumstances.<br /><br />The only thing that didn't quite sit with me was the inconsistent (yet original) 21st chapter.  Some say this ends the novel on a lighter, more hopeful note.  I don't think it needed to.

I got interested in Burgess from his non-fiction works on Shakespeare and Joyce.<br /><br />Even the title here is complex, and According to Burgess himself, the title is from an old Cockney expression \\"as queer as a clockwork orange. Burgess wrote in his later that a creature who can only perform good or evil is \\"a clockwork orange -- meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with color and juice, but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil; or the almighty state.\\"<br /><br />So, the novel is about good and evil and as a vehicle he uses a young man Alex, who leads a life of crime and random violence including rape. He sets the story in the future but using realism. Alex narrates the tale and does so in a language called \\"Nadstat\\" which is not English but a sort of street slang. That adds to the ambiance or flavour or  setting of the story.<br /><br />The novel contains three parts: the narrative on Alex and his illegal activity or street crimes,  the imprisonment and attempted rehabilitaion of Alex, and finally the retribution of his victims.<br /><br />What does it all mean? First and foremost it is a work of art so keep that in mind. It includes various themes such as the power struggles between old and young generations, the corruption of social institutions, and  politics. It is supposed to make us think about the direction of society as a whole.	2007-09-06

This book will give you a glimpse of gang violence (beating, raping, and killing by teens) in a futuristic time. The book explores the meaning of free will and the conflict between good and evil, which is often not apparent. It also poses the following important question: can a person be forced into being good, and is being good truly good if it is not by choice?     The main character in the novel, Alex (a 15 year old boy who is a rapist and killer), is injected by prison doctors with a drug that makes him experience nausea and headaches, and is then forced to watch violent flicks. He associates nausea with violence, and can stand violence no more! He is therefore restricted from his free will and forced to become good! According to the author, we all have a sense of what is right and what is wrong, so do we need to be forced into being good?    Interestingly, readers in America and the rest of the world will read different versions of this book. In America, the editors edited out chapter 21 all together, giving the novel 20 chapters in all. In Britain and the rest of the world (including all translated versions), chapter 21 is included in the novel. Readers in the rest of the world will therefore get a different ending. The movie version of the book by Stanley Kubrick was based on the American version of 20 chapters. I will recommend readers of this book to read the British version to get the ending the author meant for us to read.     Another interesting fact is that the author wished this book to go away - but obviously it is not, accumulating fans from all over the world since its publication in 1963. The book has been translated into many different languages, including Russian, Japanese, Spanish, and Italian, to list just a few. Many of the latter books written by the same author (32 novels in all) have not succeeded as much, even though the author believed them to be much superior. The book he believed would fail succeeded and the ones he believed would succeed failed miserably compared to A Clockwork Orange.     Many will find this book difficult to read and understand (me for one). The dialogue is quite unique but difficult to understand because it is slang, with most of it invented by the author (was the slang taken from the Russian language?).    The title, A Clockwork Orange is a cockney word meaning to the limit or hilt. For example, he is queer as clockwork orange (a saying often used). The author believes that we cannot be evil as clockwork orange; that is, pure evil with not an inch of goodness in us. Similarly, we cannot be pure good with no evil in us. We all live with a balance of evil and good, with some displaying more evil while others more goodness. And we all have free will to choose whether we want to be evil or good.    A lot of people have liked the movie more than the book. Read the book first though (the British version), and then watch the movie. You'll get a much better flavor of the book this way. And if you gave up reading the book, watch the movie. It might just make you want to give the book a second chance!	2007-07-25

Rarely have a film and book inhabited such distinctive worlds of their own as those of 'A Clockwork Orange'. As a youth, I felt lucky to see a film so bizarre; as an adult I feel like I appreciate what so many others cannot. Burgess makes it clear through the introduction that Stanley Kubrick ignored the book's final chapter in his film, in which Alex grows up and grows tired of the ultra-violence and such. I was happy to read the 'lost' chapter, but the film had a lot more impact by letting the viewer guess where Alex's life would lead, that cheeky grin and those gleaming eyes hiding a new monster. I still enjoyed the book, although the film is so vivid it seems like the book is based on it, not the reverse. The liberal use of slang might put some people off, but it's repeated often enough that you'll catch on in no time. The story itself is impossible not to be intrigued by: do we prefer absolute morality in our society, or do we value choice so much that it sometimes comes at the expense of morality? I'll leave the tough questions to you, but there's no question this book deserves to be more widely-read. The film is so famous for being graphic and controversial that it often overshadows the story, which should always be the real star of the show.	2007-07-21
US	20311826	RTQO3130ULD0G	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Great Read	A Clockwork Orange (\\"orange\\" referring to a seemingly normal outward appearance, \\"clockwork\\" referring to the idea that, on the inside, human beings are controlled by either God, the Devil, or the Almighty State) is a classic work of fiction known mainly for its rich use of \\"Nadsat,\\" a language created by Burgess and used throughout the entire novel, and its controversial elements of rape and violence.<br /><br />The book takes place around, and is told by, Alex, who at the beginning of the novel is fifteen and by the end of the novel is around eighteen. The book starts off with a series of events that set the tone for the state of law and order in the novel (Alex and his \\"droogs\\" rob, rape, and pillage with no regard for authority or their elders). In a nutshell, Alex's \\"droogs\\" turn against him, he is imprisoned, he is promised to be released if he undergoes Ludovico's Treatment, he is brainwashed against violence, returns to violence, and at the end finally decides to repudiate violence of his own accord (if the version you're reading contains the twenty-first chapter, that is).<br /><br />The book focuses mainly on a loss of morals, facilitated by the State, but carried out on an everyday basis by the people, or, more specifically, by the youth. Burgess satirizes such things as police brutality by portraying the State's hiring of gang members to positions in the police department, subtly comparing the police of future generations to be no better than the criminals. Burgess also satirizes the future status of religion by presenting Alex's point of view on the bible (when reading about the crucifixion, he imagines himself nailing Jesus onto the cross), which represents the idea that religion will become increasingly irrelevant as a direct result of degeneration among the youth. Other themes in the novel include: good and evil, the transition from adolescence to adulthood, government meddling, corrupt political practices, and free will.<br /><br />Overall, the book excellently demonstrates Burgess's intellectual grasp on society and also his commanding use of language. It's worth the read.tes Burgess's intellectual grasp on society and also his commanding use of language. It's worth the read.	2007-06-18
US	10181599	R5V5IOYBXNMD2	0141182601	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Fascinating and provocative	This is a fascinating and provocative novel that questions what it means to be good.  Is a law abiding person still good if they have no free-will; if their mind has been altered so that they are incapable of violence?<br /><br />The novel is written from the perspective of 15 year old Alex, a charming sociopath who enjoys `ultra violence'.  Alex writes in a street slang of Burgess' own devising called Nadsat (although it is derived largely from Russian). This may be off-putting to some readers initially, but after a few pages you start to get the hang of it, and before long, you start to like it. (I am resisting the temptation to write my review using Nadsat).<br /><br />When the novel was first published in the US in the 1960's, the 21st chapter was not included.  Burgess felt the final chapter was important but he needed money and agreed to have the novel published without it.  The final chapter changes the tone of the novel.  I have to say that I agree with the original American publishers.  I found the final chapter a little too optimistic.<br /><br />Burgess wanted to present a world where there was hope that even criminal sociopaths can choose to be good without the state forcing goodness on them.  I on the other hand, prefer the nastier (and I think) more realistic ending that the original US version gave us.<br /><br />Burgess felt that the real evil in A Clockwork Orange lay with the state (don't get me wrong, I'm not in favor of radical behavioral controls like the ones administered to Alex) and as a result, he seems to excuse Alex's violent behavior as if it were only a `phase' he might outgrow.<br /><br />Because Alex is charming and because much of the violence is described in a strangely unfamiliar slang, the reader may be desensitized to it and may even sympathize with Alex (something I think Burgess wanted).  In reality, Alex is a self absorbed sociopath who rapes little girls and beats little old ladies to death.  Even after his reconditioning, he still wants to be violent (he just can't) and he shows absolutely no remorse for any of the crimes he has committed. Alex may or may not be able to change his behavior and 'choose good' but it's difficult for me to imagine that he is capable of feeling compassion or empathy, let alone find love.<br /><br />I prefer the sarcastic and cynical ending to Chapter 20.  While Burgess may have intended the 21st chapter to give us hope, I actually think this chapter is the scariest part of the novel.  The only thing more frightening to me than Alex roaming the streets with violence on his mind - is picturing him as a father.<br /><br />That would be a real horror show.<br /><br />Regardless of which ending you prefer, there is no doubt that this is a fascinating novel, well worth reading.

Unlike most dystopian novels, which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" focuses on the nature of the individual in the future. Our protagonist is Alex, only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal, roving the streets with his band of friends, taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him. The boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless. In fact, the more helpless the victim, it seems, the more pleasure the boys take in the act. The most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes. They aren't doing any of this out of malice toward their targets; in fact, it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim. They are creating mayhem just because it's fun for them.<br /><br />Everything changes, however, when one particular break-in goes horribly awry and Alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder. There, though he manages to create an illusion of good behavior, we see that the experience has no real impression on his sense of morality. Then, after two years, he is chosen for a new, experimental rehabilitation program, designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in, or even contemplate, any acts of violence. As we see, however, this \\"treatment\\" also leaves him without any choice in the matter of being good or not. He HAS to be good because he is programmed to be. This, of course, raises the question central to the book: Does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you have no freedom of choice?<br /><br />The book can be a little difficult to get in to at first, predominantly because of Burgess's unique style. The story is narrated by Alex and thus, is written in the complex slang language, invented by Burgess for this book, that the youth of this society engage in. For example, a sentence taken from the opening chapter: \\"He looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that\\" (pg. 5). There is no glossary, but if you stick with it, you will start to develop a feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters. However, if you find yourself having difficulty, a nice, comprehensive lexicon can be found on Wikipedia if you search for \\"English to Nadsat\\" (due to review guidelines I am not allowed to include a direct link). Unfortunately, it is alphabetized by the English equivalents, not by the slang terms, so looking up a word can be a little difficult.<br /><br />One final note of interest: The original British publication of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" had 21 chapters, as does the current American edition. However, when the book was first published in the United States, the last chapter was dropped. As Burgess explains in his introduction to the restored version, publishers considered this 21st chapter a sellout. Whether it is or isn't is up to you to decide, but I can tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book. Without the final part of the story in place, the book offers a bleak message, implying that human nature cannot really change. On the other hand, reading the book with the final chapter in place gives us a little more hope. Beyond that, Burgess tells us in his introduction, interpretation is up to you.when he viddied the four of us like that\\" (pg. 5).

Burgess has achieved that remarkable feat in this book.  The genius of it is in the use of the first person and in the use of slang to give voice to Alex.  The slang also serves to make the violence almost comical as instead of kicking someone in the mouth, Alex describes giving a tolchok into the rot and knocking out a few zoobies.  So even though the book is full of violence and rape, the language removes us from it in such a way that the book feels less violent than it is.  Although this may seem like it would make the book hard to read, it all makes sense when read in context.<br /><br />The story itself is a fairly simple and fast read.  If you have seen the movie then (other than the last chapter) you know what happens in the book.  Alex and his friends commit violent crimes, Alex gets arrested, he gets cured of his violence and then gets cured of the cure.  The movie follows the book almost exactly.  The key difference is that the original American edition left out the last chapter (the American publisher thought it was a sellout as Burgess explains in the introduction) and Kubrick followed the American edition of the book.  Is the last chapter a sellout?  Does it cheapen the book?  I think it changes the story to some extent.  Burgess suggested that it changed the book from a fantasy into a novel.  I think this overstates it but if you have read the American edition without the last chapter then you need to read it again with the last chapter.<br /><br />The book is a classic and should be required reading.  Although adult in concept and story line, anyone old enough to read the daily paper is old enough to read this book.  Beneath all the violence in the book, Burgess is trying to make a point about free will and what it means to be human but he doesn't overstate it.  The story and the language carry the reader and the message is just there to do with as you please.  As Burgess says in the introduction, \\"Eat this sweetish segment or spit it out.

US	43180298	R5LTLABTFRK4O	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Both a compelling story that explores human nature and a thought-provoking social satire	A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess takes place in a dark depiction of the near-future in which both the government and society are corrupt and the streets are rampant with criminals and thugs. This is the world that Alex, the narrator, lives in, and he spends his nights stealing, beating, and raping until he is finally caught by the police. He is then chosen to undergo a new type of treatment that can reform him by making him physically adverse to violence. This leads to drastic consequences that raise important questions about human nature and freewill. <br /> <br />Alex is the perfect anti-hero for this satire, since he is immoral and cruel enough for us to hate him as a human being, while still being complex and intriguing enough for us to love him as a literary character. His seemingly contradicting traits make him even more interesting and original, since his love of \\"ultra-violence\\" is contrasted with a love of classical music, usually considered the music of the refined and sophisticated. But for people who don't like reading books with too many incomprehensible vocab words, you should be warned that in nearly every sentence of A Clockwork Orange, Alex uses nadsat talk (teen slang invented by Burgess). The first few chapters will probably be difficult to read, as there's no glossary and each nadsat word must be deciphered in context. However, once you get a feel for it, which may happen much quicker than you think, Alex's unique voice and vocabulary makes the book even more memorable and his character more real. <br /> <br />I highly recommend A Clockwork Orange as both a compelling story that explores human nature and a thought-provoking social satire. If you've already seen Stanley Kubrick's movie adaptation, this is still worth reading for the additional insight into Alex's subconscious and for the reinstated final chapter that could alter your perception of Alex and maybe the story as a whole.	2007-02-26

When I first purchased the novel it was simply because I wanted some shock-therapy so-to-speak.  I wanted to read something daring and edgy and a novel tagged with the `ultra-violence' moniker must be both.  Well it is both daring and edgy, to the extreme even, but as most every reviewer has stated, this book is so much more than just a mishmash of violence.  Inside this novel beats the heart of modern society and it asks questions we all do well to ponder.<br /><br />Anthony Burgess paints a haunting picture of a world torn about by violence.  Alex (Your humble narrator) is a fifteen year old punk, a bossy irresponsible rebel of the extreme kind.  He rules the streets with his droogs (fellow gang members), pillaging as it were.  The first few chapters give the reader a glimpse not only into these teens' actions but also their attitude towards them.  They have absolutely no sense of justice or consequence, and in a way they have no idea they're doing anything wrong.  The novel takes a turn when Alex pushes too many buttons and his friends turn on him, selling him out to the cops and he ends up a prisoner of the State.<br /><br />It's here that the novel becomes that `classic' or `masterpiece' everyone keeps talking about.  Once Alex is imprisoned he goes through many changes, but it's the cause of those changes that makes all the difference.  Forced to become a walking robot, stripped of his free will and programmed to be the perfect citizen, Alex becomes a model example of everything that is wrong with society.<br /><br />Anthony Burgess's fantastic vision asks so many questions and the reader can't help but try to answer them.  How should we feel about Alex?  Did he get what he deserved?  Did he get away with too much?  Was his rehabilitation extreme or justified?  The reader is forced to hate, even loathe this boy one minute, but only the heartless wouldn't feel pain for him towards the end.<br /><br />`A Clockwork Orange' changed the way I look at literature for it provides a balanced look at life and the decisions we make.  It makes a statement more so then just tells a story.  It exposes human emotions and inner workings, the darkest parts inside of us that we keep hidden from us all.  Upon finishing this novel I was forced to ask myself, \\"aren't we all the same?\\" and it's a question I feel this novel addresses well.  Everyone is appalled at the life Alex is living and the horrendous acts he commits, but isn't his punishment, his `treatment' as it were, just as masochistic?for him towards the end.   <br /> <br />`A Clockwork Orange' changed the way I look at literature for it provides a balanced look at life and the decisions we make.

Yes, this book is violent and gory but oddly enough that's only one of many distinguishing characteristics.<br /><br />The story itself weaves around page after page of strange and often catchy made up slang with a character that all at once can be hated and pitied. The smattering of scintillating imaginary slang that dance around the story doesn't take away from the often ironic and thought provoking plot. I hadn't really expected this book to make me sit back and think about morality in such a way. What IS good? And for that matter what is evil? Does a lack of evil (by force) automatically constitute good? You'll see the question by all sides and I must say the last chapter that was not published in the original American printings I think adds that final layer to the story it needed. Without it I think I would have been left feeling antsy about the entire book. In any event I do suggest this book even to those who normally shy away from 'ultraviolence.'	2006-12-11

The authorities have given up the night to the youth gangs that then menace citizens in both the street and in their houses.  What is scariest of these thoughts is that the perpetrators of this violence are kids under the age of eighteen.  Our protagonist, Alex, is fifteen and his droogs (friends) are not much older.  They rob, rape, drink, take drugs. <br /> <br />Once you get past the language (try not to spend too much time looking at the glossary), there is a powerful message about good and evil. Alex is arrested for murder and then commits a second in prison.  A new treatment based on drugs and aversion therapy has been developed to control the 'bad' impulses, and Alex is chosen as the first prisoner to be treated. As is to be expected, the treatment does more than just stop Alex from being 'bad' it takes away his ability to protect himself (in more ways than one). <br /> <br />This is the full version of the book.  The original american version was missing Part 3 Chapter 7.  For anyone who has read the pre-1986 version or seen the Kubrick-McDowell movie, the missing chapter will come as a revelation.

In addition to such writers as George Orwell and Aldous Huxley, British authors seem to be the masters of creating fiction which predicts the worst possible societal, political, and cultural decay, based on contemporary observations of the latest trends in these three factors. In Clockwork Orange, Mr. Burgess portrays what was for him, a near-future Britain, in which economic failure, inept and corrupt government, and social malaise result in a society overwhelmed by crime. The main perpetrators are vast numbers of street-gangs roaming the cities, savagely assaulting, robbing, murdering, raping, and vandalizing...for fun. The gangs are largely composed of teenagers, who aside from their random violence, are also obsessed with drug-abuse and pop-culture, a pop-culture with its own trendy slang-language (based on Russian in this case). This scenario, exists now, in certain neighborhoods of specific cities! The vision did come true! <br />The main character and narrator, is Alex, an average street-thug, who describes graphically the psychopathic crimes commited by his gang. Despite his vile behavior, one can't help but find a certain charisma in Alex. His one positive attribute seems to be his love of classical music, Beethoven specifically.  <br />Alex eventually finds himself in prison, and volunteers for an experimental \\"treatment\\" in exchange for early release. This turns out to be a form of operant-conditioning, which programs him to be violently ill whenever he feels compelled to violence. The government endorses this new method, so as to make space for \\"political prisoners\\", by releasing \\"treated\\" street criminals. The result: Alex is released into a crime-ridden society, completely unable to defend himself! This becomes the major philosophical point of the story. The most disturbing fact is that some bureaucrats really do believe such concepts are an acceptable means of \\"establishing control\\".  <br />Get the unabridged version of this book WITH ALL 21 CHAPTERS. Some time ago, the American version was very foolishly published with only 20 chapters!

Cobble and dirty the streets.  Roughen the clientele, and ascribe raucous thuggery.  Such is the ambience of A Clockwork Orange.  Exit into the crisp night air with caution; this is not a place for the faint of heart. This is the rough and desolate world of post-modern existentialism.   <br /> <br />His name is Alex, and he leads a gang of thugs.  Dressed in the height of fashion, their minds are filled with drugged drink, solipsism, and \\"ultra-violence\\".  Sometimes they are the Nighthawks; sometimes they are those they prey upon them.  They are, at minimum, a terror that menaces this hollow society.   <br /> <br />Anthony Burgess brings together the graphic violence of Quentin Tarantino, the inky ambience of Joseph Conrad, and (bear with me here), the understated and even farcical humor of Damon Runyon.  Unlike Tarantino, however, Burgess has thinly veiled the disturbingly violent escapades of Alex and his cohorts under a narrative written in a fictional slang.  The slang itself is part of what creates an otherworldly ambience, seasons the text with whimsical humor, and brings the reader into an unsettling relationship with the graphic imposition of suffering which Alex and his gang have embraced as their daily bread-and-butter: <br /> <br />~~So that was old Dim's cue and he went grinning and going er er and a a a for this veck's dithering rot, crack crack, first left fistie then right, so that our dear old droog the red - red vino on tap and the same in all places, like it's put out by the same big firm - started to pour and spot the nice clean carpet and the bits of his book that I was still ripping away at, razrez razrez.~~ <br /> <br />\\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\" is a question which, by my count, appears three times in the text.  The question implies that Alex is indeed capable of choice, of becoming more than a victim himself of a habitual cycle of violence.  Once at the beginning of the book, once in prison, and once at the end of the book among a new troop of gang member, the question surfaces, as if inviting Alex to value something more than the temporal.  It is not until the element of choice is taken from Alex that he begins to change, at first assuming a passing interest in God while in prison, and then after being subjected to a government-imposed scheme to rid prisoners of violence through chemically- and visually-induced brainwashing. <br /> <br />Although I struggle with valuing any book so intently focused on violence, I find A Clockwork Orange a quirky piece of brilliance.  The humor is subtle but well-placed in revealing Alex's adolescent qualities.  Once incarcerated, he wisecracks about being \\"dressed in the height of prison fashion\\" and extols the value of reading the Bible, but mainly the part where the Jews beat each other up, drink plenty of wine, and sleep with each other's wives . . .   <br /> <br />Yet despite his penchant for violence, it is hard to not humanize Alex.  His smirking, if not comedic outlook on life is somewhat contagious, and he is not immune to the full range of human emotion.  Once faced with the prospect of a government reform program which would eliminate his power of choice forever, he seems to encounter real fear, a nascent conceptualization of sin, and the prospect, according to the prison chaplain of being \\"beyond the reach of the power of prayer\\".  Having come through the program and endured various measures of victimization and reform afterwards, however, he still carries a comforting resemblance to his original, whimsical self.  Recovering in a hospital, he asks about his condition in his typical, humorous fashion, \\"But has anyone been doing anything with my gulliver?  What I mean is, have they been playing around with inside like my brain?\\"   <br /> <br />It is unlikely that many readers would naturally identify with Alex.  But this is perhaps part of Burgess' brilliance.  Despite Alex's immersionin the dregs of life (drugs, crime, violence, gangs, etc.), we begin to value his humanity as manifested in the freedom to make moral choices.  Once stripped of this, we begin to see Alex as stripped of an inalienable right, as stripped of his own humanity.  Perhaps then, the enduring value of A Clockwork Orange is its affirmation of moral choice as an inextricable component of humanity in us all.  To be deprived of choice is to be deprived of being human, even if we remain physically alive.	2006-09-24

In any case, they weren't impossible to decipher on my own. The character of Alex was also fascinating because I never found myself disliking him for his inhumane actions better yet nursing a hatred towards him. A Clockwork Orange flowed wonderfully and I had a hard time putting it down. Reflecting back on it, the reader may find that it is indeed, a rather amusing book. I've always admired writers who can make the reader connect with their characters and Burgess is no exception. <br /> <br />Cons: The last, original 21st chapter. I'm a bit of a cynic so the negative, evil-will-always-prevail complex is rather appealing and more realistic than the we-will-all-eventually-settle-down complex, oddly enough. I finished the 20th chapter with a satisfied smirk whereas I finished the 21st chapter with furrowed eyebrows and a dissapointed sigh. I felt that Alex's struggle throughout one half of the story was for nothing, and his character itself faded away as the pangs of responsiblity corrupted his rebellious mind.	2006-09-23

He explains that this book is not what he considers his best work.  He also tells the reader that this is the first complete version of the book in the US.  The first release or the \\"Kubrick release\\" left out the last chapter.  Burgess tells us that he believes this to be a mistake.  He was correct when he says that this is not his best work.  It isn't his best work.  It is a great concept and he has a way with words but it's much too \\"mathmatical\\" and less creative.  I had trouble creating my inner animation.  Which many would not agree with that assessment considering his creation of a slang, which was to highlight youths ongoing penchant to create an esoteric lingo to distiguish themselves from authority.  Now, Burgess was incorrect in saying that his original version is the best.  The Kubrick version of 20 chapters is the better book.  That last chapter is not exactly fitting and doesn't satisfy the theme as Burgess imagined it would.  It's tired just like Alex.  His use of \\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\", leaves me grey.  I can't make up my mind on whether it's quite intelligent or pretentious or contrived or all of the above.  It is not the prophetic masterpiece many believe it to be.  Violence has always been a constant in human society.  Prophetic would be speaking of peace.  It's a good concept, too technical outside of the slang, and can be difficult to read.	2006-08-04

I was surprised then to find that the story didn't really evoke any feeling from me. <br />What kept me hooked was the way that Burgess has written A Clockwork Orange,  The clever way that the title is woven into the story and the way in which Alex speaks and narrates the story.  Alex has his way of speaking and as I read the first chapter I tried to decode what he was saying which I found hard and stressful.  I then read the first chapter again but this time I just accepted the strange words (slovo, ptitsa, bezoomny, litso etc) and the reading of the book became easier and the meaning of these words became very clear and no longer a problem.  I think these words help the reader relate to Alex but also, especially at the beginning, alienate the reader from him as well. <br />This is a really good book and I'm glad that I didn't give up on it.	2006-07-19

When Burgess wrote his book, the violent, God forsaken world he wrote about was in the near future (I'm guessing around 1995, since Alex and his droogs at one point go joyriding in a \\"Durango 95\\").  Burgess was apparently a rather keen sociological observer, and most readers will conclude that there was a lot of accurate prediction in what he wrote. <br /> <br />The book is narrated by Alex, an oddly lovable amoral teenage thug.  Alex uses \\"nadsat,\\" a slang derived mostly from Slavic languages, and this language makes Alex's world more real for the reader.  This language is mostly comprehensible from context, and there are several glossaries on the internet.  His language has great comic effect throughout the book, as when Alex reads some propaganda in a government newspaper: <br /> <br />\\"This gazetta I had seemed to be like a Government gazetta, for the only news that was on the front page was about the need for every veck to make sure he put the Government back in again on the next General Election, which seemed to be about two or three weeks off.  There were very boastful slovos about what the Government had done, brothers, in the last year or so, what with increased exports and a real horrorshow foreign policy, and all that cal.\\"  <br /> <br />Or when he describes a bit of refuse on the floor of a milk bar: <br /> <br />\\"I had my glazzies like fixed on a malenky bit of silver paper from a cancer packet that was on the floor, the sweeping-up of this mesto not being all that horrorshow, brothers.\\" <br /> <br />Much of the humor in the book comes from the contrast between the horrible things that Alex does and his unshakable self-esteem.  It never occurs to Alex that the reader's sympathies might not be completely with him as he rapes and murders and plots and schemes.  And Alex is so buoyant and resourceful that it's hard not to root for him. <br /> <br />But Burgess didn't write this booksimply to draw attention to an alarming increase in juvenile delinquency.  The central struggle in the book is between the little man and the soul-stealing bureaucracy.  In one soliloquy, Alex tells us \\"They of the government and the judges and the schools cannot allow the bad because they cannot allow the self.  And is not our modern history, my brothers, the story of brave malenky selves fighting these big machines?  I am serious with you, brothers, over this.  But what I do I do because I like to.\\"  The government tries to make Alex good but of course it can't: Alex has to choose to be good, or not. <br /> <br />The 1987 Norton edition restores a final chapter that had been deleted from the original American edition of the novel, and it is here that the reader sees why all men are equal, in God's eyes: everyone has a potential as well as a past, and no man can say what another man will become. <br />	2006-06-11

They speak about the skill in depicting the main character's alienation, and the dreary world of an imagined future technical dystopia.<br /><br />They speak about a vision Burgess presents, and the fact that in spite of the language containing many at first non- understandable slang terms, that the work is nonetheless really understandable.<br /><br />I didn't like the book.

It is a story of an ultra-violent gang who roam around doing whatever they please.  The structure of the novel has multiple parallels within the text.  These parallels can be hard to find, but add to the overall effectiveness of the work.  This novel can be seen as a difficult read due to the unique diction that the author chooses.  However, this obstacle is easy to overcome after the first few chapters. <br /> Throughout the novel, the author replaces everyday words with unique slang.  The author chose to create this unique language to accentuate the qualities of the characters in the ultra-violent gang.  For example, the author wrote \\"There it was again, all the old ultra-violence and vecks with their gullivers smashed and torn krovvy-dripping ptitsas creeching for mercy\\"(118).  This unique language becomes easy to understand within the context.  The diction that Anthony Burgess chose is the most creative aspect of the novel. <br /> The novel is split into three parts, each containing seven chapters.  During the first part, the ultra-violent gang roams around doing as they please.  They beat innocent people and break into homes.  \\"What is it? Who are you? How dare you enter my house without permission\\"(21).  This part of the novel sets the scene and creates the opening drama.  During the second part, the government tries to control this violence using bizarre techniques.  \\"After every meal... we shall be giving you a shot in the arm.  That should help\\"(98).  This treatment brainwashes the main character, Alex, which takes away the pleasures in life that he enjoyed.  The third part of the novel returns Alex to his old self.  He is once again able to enjoy his old passions.   <br /> A Clockwork Orange is an enjoyable read.  The diction that the author chooses is unique in style.  The author achieves his overall goal in this well planned novel.   He creates many parallels andkeeps the reader on their feet.  The novel has an overall theme of free will.  Anthony Burgess captures this theme by testing the will of the main character, Alex.  He is conformed by the State, but eventually returns to his normal self.  \\"It was like as though to get better I had had to get worse\\"(174).  The novel is exciting and convincing.  It is well organized and a great read. <br />        The complexities in A Clockwork Orange entice the reader to think outside the box.  The unique diction that Burgess uses keeps the reader on their feet.  Overall, A Clockwork Orange is a one-of-a-kind fictional novel that should not be left on the bookshelf to collect dust.	2006-03-31
US	14748292	R3QASYNKYZD0A0	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	1	2	N	N	I cannot recommend it highly enough!	Throughout much of my pre-teen years I had heard much about this story through people who hated Kubrick's film version, naturally this peaked my interest and I really wanted to see it.  This would not happen for a number of years though, as I wanted to respect those I lived with.  So I went out and got my hands on the book by Anthony Burgess, and read it cover to cover in one sitting.  This novella is a highly intelligent, complex and energized futuristic adventure about a brutal fifteen year old boy, Alex, who whirls through the night with his three teenage \\"droogies\\" performing \\"a bit of the old ultraviolence\\" on all the helpless \\"weepy young devotchkas\\".  The language shared by these anti-heroes, called \\"nadsat\\" a mix of British and Russian slang, is ingenious and perfectly illustrates  these hoodlums social pathology. <br /> <br />Alex and his droogs have the time of their lives destroying other people.  Each night they begin their reign of terror in the same way, they assemble at the Korova Milkbar for \\"milk with knives in it\\", which is milk laced with \\"drencrom\\" or \\"synthemesc\\" which would \\"sharpen you up and get you ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence.\\"  Upon \\"sharpening their knives\\" they proceed through the streets of a post-apocolyptic & fascist London, where they knife the innocent and rape and carve through the beautiful - howling for joy all the while.  A third of the way through the book, our hero, Alex, is apprehended by the \\"milicents\\" after being betrayed by his droogs and is sentenced to fourteen years in jail.  Here Alex is placed in a state-run program designed to rehabilitate violent criminals through an inhuman conditioning technique.  Transforming Alex into a model citizen, we see how Alex was conditioned to respond to violence, sex and even his favorite music - Beethoven with a violent and surging sickness.  Though Alex is now incapable of violent acts, and so is forced to remain helpless as one by one, his victims perform savage revengeupon Alex's person.  We now see Alex as the victim, crouching over in sickness from the violent thoughts flooding his mind, but incapable of acting upon them.  Upon receiving negative press due to inhuman treatment our protagonist is subjected to, the State turns Alex back into his happy brutal self, freeing him to \\"carve through the litso of the whole creeching world with his cut-throat britva.\\"  This book is a social and moral commentary on society and the nature of good and evil, and the choices between them.   <br /> <br />The one downside to this edition, is the inclusion of the twenty-first chapter.  This chapter should in no way be seen as a part of this story, it is more like a mini sequel, and it does no justice to the story and its subtext.  This chapter was not in the original first edition, and only appeared after the film version, and in a way, it was included solely for the purpose of cushioning the devastating effects that this film apparently had on many viewers.  I feel that this last-minute inclusion of this chapter was a sort of disowning act for Burgess, who never liked his own story, and felt it needed this sort of an ending to redeem the whole thing - which goes against everything he claimed the book represented.  Read it if you like happy endings, but ignore it at all costs if you intend to preserve this book's integrity.  Just my opinion.	2006-03-22

Imagine a new solution for gang violence, where young hoodlums are \\"treated\\" in such a way that they are physically incapable of violence, for even a mere evil thought triggers pain and nausea.  With this new Ludovico's Technique, the streets will be safe again and the overcrowded prisons will be cleared.  Is this a panacea to street crime, or a coy government plot to impose its will on its people?    Anthony Burgess's \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is a compelling novel whose central conflict is between the human choice of doing good or evil and a mechanical imposition of doing good.  The novel begins in a dystopic world where young thugs rule the streets at night - thieving, raping, and mugging at will.  Although this may been a frightening idea for readers back in 1963, this sounds strikingly familiar for any major city today.  The proliferation of gang violence, insipid pop music, prostitots, and addiction to TV are mere facts of life today, so it may lose some of its edge for the modern reader.     However, Ludovico's Technique deserves a much closer examination.  It is this technique that forces Alex to be good, for any evil thought within him will trigger extreme nausea.  Although this renders Alex impotent and harmless, there is a much darker side to this, for it has robbed him of his free will.  Although he chooses evil, there is at least hope for him to reform, until he is programmed, like a robot, to do only good.  Indeed, this experiment has literally put the \\"Thought Police\\" inside Alex's mind, for at the first inkling of evil his body turns on him, overcoming him with pain and nausea.  Although the State claims to be doing this for the common good, this could obviously be used for more sinister purposes in an attempt to \\"condition\\" all citizens and punish them for subversive thoughts against the State. Although this never happens in the novel, the chilling possibilities remain.     Although this is a compelling novel, it is also quite gimmicky.  This book makesextensive use of an invented teenage slang - \\"nadsat.\\"  This no doubt is confusing at first, but it enriches the novel overall.  If this is too much, make use of the \\"nadsat\\" glossary.  This novel also inspired a campy 1972 British film.    Overall, this is a superb novel and presents a compelling moral question on free will.  Although the repressive government is a mere peripheral subject, its frightening possibilities of using Ludovico's Technique for mind control make this a thought-provoking, dystopic novel.	2006-02-23

And I can agree with everyone that the first pages were kind of a struggle, as the language is primarly taken from the Russian language and some altered english slang, and i think one or two german words. <br /> <br />But as i continued to read i got the hang of it. And upon finishing it, i felt that without a doubt it was better than the movie. As I find with all books that were made into movies. But the movie still is a classic in itself, and is one of my favourate films. <br /> <br />What I would primarly like to talk about here is the Nadsat language. I read the book more than 3 times over and realy, almost memorised the entire thing. I even went as far as buying the book in german and reading it. As I have been learning german. But about the language. <br /> <br />I recently had a forigen exchange student come to my school from Russia. I immedietly was interested in him, as i myself am going to be an exchange student to germany next year. After i became friends with him, i showed him A Clockwork Orange, and really he thought it was kind of silly, because the russian used in it, is inaccurate as far as to what it would really say. I shall give some examples: <br /> <br />Korova in russian means Cow <br />Viddy in russian means to like watch a movie or something to that extent, it doesn't precisly mean to 'see' or look, how it is sometimes used in the book. <br />Ptitsa in russian means bird.. so starry ptitsa, would mean old bird, which is accurate as old women are sometimes refered to as 'old birds' <br />Devotchka is the russian word for a woman, and depending on the way it is spelled and pronounced, it can mean young girl, or woman i believe. <br />Sharries in russian means testicles. and often people say that 'Kiss my sharries' means 'kiss my ass' <br />Spatchka in russian means hybernation, and is usually only refered to animals like bears that hybernate in the winter. In the book it refers to simply sleeping. <br /> <br />and there are more but those are some of the main ones that stick out in my mind. <br /> <br />Overall i think this book is among the greatest novels ever written. And will remain a classic.	2006-02-18

Written in the 1960s and using a variety of Russian and British street slang to come up with its own bombastic and puss-spewing lexicography, the prose and plot-line create a tremendous feel of the emotional distance located in the criminal mind. In addition, the outcome leaves the reader with huge quandaries and questions about the nature of human rehabilitation, forgiveness, and re-construction. In today's society with our sights set on bio-tech enhanced visual, mental, and health transformations, what will politicians, scientists, and the common public decide to do with tomorrow's criminal sub-sector? With gangs, the availability of guns, and the emotional detachment from ones fellow human beings all increasing, what ramifications, punishments, and treatments will occur in future years? This book explores this and many other heartfelt societal issues from a more simpler, technologically blase, and reclusive society. Fascinating rhythmic read from Mr. Burgess.	2006-02-15

Or in other words, since 'nadsat' means 'teen', it would mean, 'teen' talk, the way the teenagers, in the supposed future, talk. And it's not anything normal, I can tell you now. To help you out a little, when the time comes if you ever read it, I will give you the definitions of some words the characters often use in A Clockwork Orange, so you won't become utterly confused. <br />Many, many other reviewers have already stated the plot and other main parts of the book, so I see no purpose or no vindication or no positive results in doing so; it would only be redundant and a big, fat waste of my time, and your time. So let's just stick to the language of a Clockwork Orange.

The main character, Alex, and his \\"droogs,\\" or friends, go out at night committing crimes.  Alex, who is fifteen, knows what he is doing and seems to be enjoying all the wrong doings he does.  Most of these acts include violence and rape.  Finally after beating and raping a woman police finally arrests Alex.  He is given a fourteen year sentence but after killing a cellmate Alex is chosen to be the first candidate for a new test called Ludovico's Technique.  This process basically makes Alex not want to commit violent acts.  In two years Alex cleans up his act and is released from prison.  Now although Alex is technically free person he is unable to do what he wants and basically doesn't have the power to make decisions anymore.  Alex then encounters the husband of a victim he had raped and beaten.  When this man learns it was Alex who did it to his wife he makes a plan to force Alex to suicide.  But will Alex give in? <br /> <br />       One of the most interesting and unique things that Anthony Burgess does in A Clockwork Orange is that he creates a whole slang vocabulary.  At first it can be frustrating on trying to figure out what some of these slang terms mean but after a while you are able to pick up on what these words mean.  A Clockwork Orange is often disturbing and really violent.  Those aspects of the novel made it hard for me to put down because it made it so interesting to read.  The thing that I disliked about this novel was that some parts were hard to read.  This caused me to go back and reread the same parts a couple times.  This mainly occurred in the beginning of the novel though. <br />	2006-01-31

Alex takes the fall for his droogs and receives a 15-year prison sentence. However, Alex's doctors have been working on a case study, \\"Ludovico's Technique.\\" They offer Alex the opportunity to participate in this experiment as an alternative to prison.  <br /> <br />Alex does what any 15 year old would do and takes what seems the less painful choice. Ludovico's Technique is an experiment designed to condition its subject to lose their evil tendencies and become the \\"perfect Christian.\\" This technique comes right out of Psychology 101. Dr. John B. Watson first conducted the experiment with a rat and a child in the \\"Little Albert\\" case study.  <br /> <br />Although Burgess creates a new world, he leaves our imaginations to fill in our own world. \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" will have the reader questioning the dangers of conformity, the roles of society and their own existence. \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" should be read with an open mind. It took me two weeks to get past the first chapter, but once I did, I never wanted to put it down.	2006-01-29

A Clockwork Orange is the story of a fictitious (but not all around improbable) society in which the protagonist, Alex, is a young heathen and criminal. He enjoys wretched activities such as vandalizing, stealing, and raping.  <br />   Life begins to turn sour for him when the police finally catch him. He is taken to a prison, and chosen to be an experimental guinea pig in a new brainwashing or \\"curing\\" process. Upon finally being considered \\"cured\\" some questions of the ethics of the process arise. Caught in the middle of a heated controversy, Alex, now the victim instead of the benefactor of this society, is left to fend for himself and try to live with his will virtually sucked out of his being. This is where the term \\"a clockwork orange\\" becomes relevant to his life. <br />    Overall, the theme the author conveys in this book is rather thought provoking, which I found to be the most enjoyable part of the book. I finished the relatively short novel feeling eager to ruminate on this question of morality. Is it right to making a being safer to society at the expense of his soul? It is a puzzling and unanswerable question that the author well represented in this novel of potential quandary.	2006-01-24

It may sound sick and weird, but I enjoy reading books with plenty of action and some violence. But for the first time, the violence in the book actually prevented me from enjoying this book as much as I thought that I would. <br /> The book is separated into three parts. The first part immediately opens up with the narration of the main character, Alex. Alex is 15 years old and is apparently the \\"leader\\" of a gang that consists of his friends. I couldn't really figure out why Alex was the leader because each one of his friends appeared capable of being able to bring harm upon a person as much as the other. I suppose he stood out mainly because his attitude was cooler, calm, and collected than the others when he made small talk with his soon-to-be-victims. The description of how Alex and his friends commit the crimes that they do and who they do it to is the main focus in the first part, which after a few chapters, can become quite repetitive, but doesn't lose it's shock factor.  <br /> The second and third parts of the book are probably what give the book it's strength because even though they contain as much violence as the first part, they're more \\"random\\" and different as oppose to the usual find an innocent person, beat or rape them, and rob them for all they're worth. Readers also witness Alex's road to recovery from being a sick menace who lives to cause to pain to someone who gets terribly sick at the smallest thought of violence.  <br /> The book has its strong points and weak points. Since there are more weak than strong, I'll start with the weak points. For a book that was said as really easy to get into, I found it terriblydifficult to read past the first ten pages. I feel that it was because of the weird Russian slang that was constantly used. Sometimes I could read through it because I had a basic idea of what Alex was describing, but then no more than seven words later, an even more foreign word would cross my path and I'd have to stop reading, flip to the back of the book to the dictionary section, look up the word, then flip back to where I was, and then try to get back into the plot. I feel that many readers will find this incredibly frustrating at first, until they eventually get a feel for the book and won't have to look in the back as much as they used to. I also mentioned that the amount of violence in the book kept me from fully enjoying the innovative plot. There's just too much of it! It kind of takes away from the book because either it's too much for the squeamish readers or too unnecessary or repetitive for the hardcore ones. It's a good thing that Mr. Burgess didn't rely on the violence alone for the entire plot of the book, although it is one of the main factors. <br /> This brings me to discuss one of the best parts about the book, which is the plot. As an avid reader, the plot of a book can either make it or break it for me. Never before in my entire life have I ever read a plot so vivid and detailed and I suppose, eccentric is the word for it.  This book left me thinking, \\"What the Hell just happened here?\\" after every chapter. I also enjoyed how the book was separated into three parts, which is another way of separating the three main personalities and stages of Alex and his life. Another idea that I enjoyed about the book was how Alex associated classical music with violence. Classical music is often perceived as being a way for those of high society to relax and find peace. But Alex on the other hand, finds it as sort of a spark to violence and doesn't see how one can exist without the other.  <br /> All in all, I recommend this book for anyone who feels thatreading is boring and a waste of time. This plot will open up the minds of those with the emptiest imagination and show them a world of darkness and in a sense, confusion. One should read this when they have plenty of free time and won't be distracted easily, that way they won't be confused as much about what is happening and won't be easily aggravated by the common use of all the Russian slang words.    <br />	2006-01-09

This part was extremely disturbing, as they involved terrible acts of violence, such as the beating of an old man, the robbery and beating and raping of a couple (the husband was writing a book called \\"A Clockwork Orange), and the drugging and violent raping of two ten-year-old girls. Finally, after beating an old woman to death while robbing her house, Alex is caught by the police and sent to jail, charged with mainly murder.  <br /> <br />Here the book takes a very personal turn, and really shows you how Alex feels, and exposes the real person inside him, not just a ruthless, violent child out to terrorize the world. In jail you get connected to him as he gets disconnected from the world.  <br /> <br />In two years time it seems like Alex has really cleaned up his act, and is released to a group of doctors who will test a new technique where they are able to program the violence out of Alex. They succeed in doing so, but now Alex is not a real person, for he cannot chooses how he wants to live. He is now a free man who can walk the streets alone, but now that he's been reformed into an ordinary citizen, nobody wants him and he has many encounters with previous victims, including F. Alexander, the author of A Clockwork Orange, who Alex beat up and raped his wife (along with three other guys). It's revealed that after being beaten up so badly and raped so fiercely, the wife died.  <br /> <br />This was probably the strangest part of the book and one that really crawled under my skin.  <br /> <br />Alex is now repeatedly betrayed by people and finally, in an attempt to end it all, jumps out a window. <br /> <br />But Alex does not die. He wakes up in the hospital weeks later and finds out he's back to normal.  <br /> <br />The book ends where it begins, for the most part, but, although it sounds awful, this book was really well written.  <br /> <br />It is very sad, tragic, and true, but also makes you think about certain things that you usually do not. It's hard to explain, but, read the book. It will do you good.	2006-01-09

Anthony Burgess, the author of A Clockwork Orange, would seem like the first person to ask such a question. \\"`The attempt to impose upon man, a creature of growth and capable of sweetness, to ooze  juicily at the last round the bearded lips of God, to attempt to impose, I say, laws and conditions appropriate to a mechanical creation, against this I raise my sword pen-'\\" (22). Alex, and his three pals, Dim, Georgie, and Pete, are normal teenagers living in a futuristic world that is somewhat of a nightmare. These boys' rape women, steal, kill, and savagely beat other citizens living in this time; as a solution the government \\"rewires\\" Alex to feel sick when the want to do any of these things occurs. He becomes \\"a clockwork orange\\" in the sense that he doesn't have the ability to decide what is good, or evil, and whether to participate in \\"evil\\" acts. Had the book only consisted of my brief outline above, it wouldn't be the well known and thoroughly enjoyed classic that it is today. Along with an eyebrow raising plot, the style, questioning of morality, and unique outlook on the future, makes A Clockwork Orange, not only an important book, but an entertaining one. I truly enjoyed reading, and re-reading this book. I assume that throughout my progression into adulthood, I will find it entertaining for different reasons than I do now, and I hope to re-read it again, and again. A book that can change, as a person changes, is something to cherish to enjoy. I believe that most people will find entertainment, if not shock value, to this controversial text. I definitely consider it to be one of my favorites, and a must read to all participants of an educated society.	2006-01-08

Anthony Burgess paints a picture of life, of the way life is at any given moment and then strings you along this journey, expossing the atrositys of culture and the repricutions of our actions.  Alex, Your Humble Narator (YHN) is a droog (a gang member sort-of-speak) who fancies raping women and beating others near death.  He's the youngest member of his group yet is the bossy ringleader.  After having a fall out with his friends they decide to sell him out and he becomes a prisoner of the State.  While in prison he undergoes treatment to cure his violent urges and make him a safe human, stripped of free will and a complete robot for the sole purpose to make him safe for the comunity.  This novel makes you ask yourself so many questions.  Is it fair what they've done to Alex?  Did Alex suffer enough?  When you see is parents reaction to their sons return home you'll wonder if they're being fair, or if they are being unreasonable.  Don't let the language stop you from reading this powerful novel.  I almost stopped before the first chapter was threw and that would have been a shame.  The slang used in the novel actaully help you to see the attitude of YHN and how he is truly a distressed youth.  You can see how for the majority of the novel he is self pitying, feeling that he is a victim of those around him when in actuallity you can see he is a victim of his our selfish decisions.  Read and analyze and realize that this is a one-of-a-kind novel with guts that you don't see very often.  Great novel and an instant classic.  I understand all the praise.	2005-12-29

The style of narration told through the eyes of the main character--an invented slang derived as a mix of english and slavic language--keeps the reader's attention on the events of the story.  It creates a reaction time effect, wherein the reader will pause for a moment before the shocking reality of the story unfolding finally takes hold.  And their is plenty of shock: Burgess spares no detail while dictating the horrible reality of urban violence.   <br /> <br />Burgess suggests that some are inherently given to violence and innocent in their desire for it.  He ponders the subject of choice: is it better to choose evil than be forced into good?--does a man cease to be a man when that choice is taken from him? <br /> <br />Overall these questions are compelling and the frankness of the storyline gives the message a powerful effect.  But the reader gets the sense that some aspects of violence and adolescence are left wanting something more.  Burgess suggests that the innocent inclination to violence fades with age, but why is this characteristic limited to adolescence?  Why in adolescence to begin with? <br /> <br />\\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is compelling, but much of the plot is left underdeveloped.  Interesting and hard to put down, but it's effect, like the violence of adolescence...fades with time.  <br />	2005-12-26

I really liked the beginning and the unique twists including in the novel.

In this book A Clockwork Orange, the character Alex displays the personality of an adolesent who longs for the attention of his peers. He seems to have a sense of violence instilled within his inner self and cannot seem to get rid of this feeling that he feels. Alex surrounds himself with sex, violence, and hatred which shows what he is really feeling on the inside. Alex started of the book with him and his \\"gang\\" wrecking havoc on the community by stealing a car and then preceeding to Mr. Alexander's house and raping his wife. While raping his wife Alex sings the song \\" Sing'n, in the rain\\". This seems like something someone who is trying to put on a show and act like their cool in front of their friends. The only time Alex was ever a descent person in this book, was when he was spending the first two years of his stay. After he began to feel comfortable with his surroundings the bad Alex seemed to suddenly reappear from the dark side to take over the place of the \\"rehabillitated\\" Alex. I think that the time he was good shows that he can be good when put under pressure by peers. Also when he is in a situation in which his surroundings are unfamilliar and unwilling to cater to every single of his needs. If Alex had never gained that much attention from his familly and \\"gang\\" i dont believe that Alex was really bad to be bad; but he was just bad to gain the respect and attention from his gang and familly.	2005-12-24

A CLOCKWORK ORANGE  <br /> In Anthony Burgess's, A Clockwork Orange,  his depiction of the future teenage culture is a disturbing one. It is a compelling story about the importance of free thinking. The main character, Alex a fifteen year old boy leads a group of three other \\"droogs,\\" Pete, Georgie, and poor old Dim. The four boys antagonize citizens for amusement, roaming the streets, engaging in gang violence, robbery, beating up men, and raping women. Justice seemed like a thing of the past until one night it caught up with Alex when he and his droogs stole a car and cruised the streets looking for trouble wherever they could find it.  The others, were inspired to turn their backs to their leader. The next time they go out, they break into an old woman's house, and she calls the police as the boys are trying to flee the scene Dim hits Alex in the face was deserted and left for the police. The police then inform Alex that the women he beat and raped in an earlier robbery has passed. Alex is sentenced to fourteen years in prison for her death. After fighting with and killing his cellmate he is chosen for an experimental treatment called Ludovico's Technique. The doctors inject him with a drug that makes him experience nausea and headaches, while making him watch violent movies and listen to classical music. After two weeks of this brainwashing torment the mere thought of violence is enough to make Alex ill and is released from prison. A twisted hand of fate leads him to a cottage for help, and he recognizes the man whose wife he had raped. After talking with Alex he begins to recognize the slang nadsat, that the teenagers who broke into his house and raped his wife used, which arouses his suspicion. He changes, his mind and locks Alex in an apartment and blare classical music, hoping to drive him to his suicide. He throws himself out the window, but only to wake up at a hospital, shortly after the old violent Alex is restored. The only thing that defines individuality is our differences, whether they be good or bad ones, it's wrong to try to correct people's faults. Humans are far from perfect, and brainwashing them to fit the mold, stripping them of their individuality is sinful.  The book is narrated in teen slang called nadsat, which incorporates elements of  Cockney English and Russian. I would suggest that you search for a glossary online in order to develop a better understand of the text. I would highly recommend reading this book, because it offers insight into the mind of a violent thinker.	2005-12-24

The book is full of action; something is always going on whether it is a rape, a beating, or even burning down some ones home. Its so action packed that it's really hard to put this novel down. The four main characters in the novel are Alex, Pete, Georgie, and Dim. Alex is what I like to call the leader of this violent gang like group of boys. These four go around committing violent acts and think it is completely alright. They figured since they never got caught they could keep beating people up. Alex was in for a rude awakening in the middle of the novel when he was captured by the authorities and all of his friends ran off. One of the many unique twists this novel had was when Alex was essential brainwashed and forced to watch these violent acts and then released into the general public. Every time a violent act was committed he became very ill. I really enjoyed the unique twists the author deployed to really make the reader think and in some ways created this sense of disbelief. The writing style was quite different in the beginning, I liked how it made you really pay attention to your reading and actually even made you go back to try to figure out what was just said. The novel was a fairly easy read once you got past the first 30 pages or so. At the same time I also disliked the writing style because of the extreme amount of time that was spent trying to decipher the text in the beginning. I also disliked the fact that they didn't have a glossary at the end to help with the deciphering of some of the words throughout the novel.  I would recommend this novel to anyone who is looking for something that is full of jam packed action and is ready for the many twists that are thrown out at you by the author. Its one both teens and adults can enjoy. <br />	2005-12-23

So many passionate and intelligent reviewers have talked about this book, mostly discussing the conflicts of good vs. evil and man vs. the state. But no-one has discussed the unending source of Alex's fascinating personality. Is this modern icon of cool a demon or a damsel in distress? <br /> <br />On the surface, Alex seems to be a very macho personality -- a stereotypical teenage hoodlum slashing away with his razor, fighting like a demon with fisties and boots, a cross between the volatile Riff in WEST SIDE STORY and the rebellious James Dean in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.  <br /> <br />Yet what makes Alex stand out from the pack is the languid, almost feminine personality he exhibits whenever not actually fighting in the street. Aside from his delight in violence, all his personality traits are \\"feminine.\\" He's dainty and fastidious in his dress, obsessed with cleanliness and neatness, sensitive to pleasant smells and extremely disdainful of sloppy people and dirty surroundings. Moreover, his Nadsat language contains a surprising amount of baby talk, the kind girls use. And he insists on describing himself as \\"luscious,\\" inviting us to imagine a fair damsel and not a foul brute.   <br /> <br />All this is very important in explaining why the reader cares so deeply about Alex, in spite of all the hateful and ugly crimes that lead to the \\"treatment\\" in prison and the ordeals that follow after. Really we are reading about a damsel in distress -- and we sympathize completely because the person being injected with drugs, tied in a chair, and so forth, responds in a way that's more endearingly pliant, submissive and helpless with each passing page.  <br /> <br />By the time Alex is relased from prison, our sympathies are entirely with the dazed and helpless damsel, who obviously needs rescuing. And the irony, of course, is that the ruggedly handsome writer who takes Alex in after his beating by police is the same man Alex injured earlier in the novel. Note that in the Kubrick movie version, writer F. Alexander is a cripple and a gibbering buffoon. But in the book, F. Alexander is strong, ruggedly handsome -- and a lot more masculine than Alex. It's very easy to visualize Alex as a forlorn damsel, a beauty in distress whose suffering awakens the protective side of this rugged knight's chivalrous nature. The reader is put off balance, drawn even more deeply into sympathy for Alex, who by now is gentle and meek and sweetly submissive, wearing the rugged writer's pajamas and all but eating out of his hand. <br /> <br />If Alex were a true damsel in distress, this would be the beginning of a love story, not a journey into further terror.  <br />(See the superb historical romance SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME by Lisa Kleypas.) But in this case the reader does not know what to expect, and these oddly tender images and emotions help to explain A CLOCKWORK ORANGE'S haunting and disturbing appeal.    <br /> <br />	2005-12-20

Breathtakingly beautiful, to those of us who are slightly twisted and love a little madness.  The language, although sometimes confusing, is truly beautiful, if you just take the time to read it.<br /><br />I'll admit, I read this originally for a lit class and I hated it.  I didn't get it at all.  Looking back, I think I hated the class, not the book.  And the professor, but we won't get into that.  I appreciated it, as a classic novel, but I didn't enjoy it at all.  However, because I am hardcore, I reread it about a year later on my own time and I absolutely loved it.  I think it was just a matter of slowing down and reading it for myself rather than for some class.<br /><br />So, kids, let this be a lesson to you.  Just because you hate it in high school or college ... does NOT mean it's bad ... it just means you need to reread it.  Dammit.	2005-10-03

The issue of free will has been a intriguing issue since Christianity--Jesus wants to have you love him out of choice and the ability to choose makes one human.  So, Burgess presents this question in a colorful futuristic scenario.  Although this is a confrontational topic, Burgess does an excellent job of presenting this issue, developing both sides of the argument without bias. <br />Break-down: <br />\\"The pro-free will argument\\": <br />The ability to make decisions and feel emotions and development of abstract thoughts is what defines the human race from our sans-opposable thumb cousins...you guessed it, the monkey and ape classification.  Once you remove these characteristics from our catalog, we fail to be humans.  Burgess presents this side of the dispute by showing the vulnerability of Alex while under the institutionalized processing.  Furthermore, he goes back to his family, only to be turned away.  It is nearly impossible to sympathize with this still impressionable teenager. <br /> <br />\\"The pro-processing argument\\": <br />Burgess does not directly show the implications of this argument, but he tactfully subconsciously places vivid memories to exaggerate the violence induced chaos of Alex and his gang.  We would not have such specific and painful accounts of the attacks of Alex and his gang if Burgess were trying to weigh the issue.  We get every gory detail of rapes and fights; we also experience their lack of remorse and moral vacancy.   <br /> <br />Finally, <br />Because Burgess puts Alex back in his original state avoids the stereotypical \\"clean ending\\".	2005-09-24

However, most people, even if they are intelligent, aren't able to read it. The story is about a man who gets arrested for murdering someone. He is in a gang and has raped, and beat people all the time. This time he murdered a woman. He goes to prison, and gets taken out early to get experimented on. This treatment makes it physically painful for him to commit violent acts. He is then let out into the world. Life is different for Alex (main character). His parents think he is still bad, so they kick him out of the house. Alex goes through many troubles and lives life the way other people used to when Alex beat them. In the story language is harsh. The author decided it would be easier to just make up words then use horrible English words like: rape, kill, murder... etc. The author uses great diction. I have never seen any other writing like this. To understand the book a lot better, watch the movie. The movie follows the context of the book very well. Overall A Clockwork Orange was a very interesting, and great story!	2005-09-02

A strength of this book is the suspense that the author describes. He builds situations up very good. He got me interested in it. A weakness is the diction that Alex and his friends use. The diction is very hard to understand, especially if you don't know Russian, but most of it you can understand by reading what is around the words. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysterious books and suspenseful books. A person who likes to hear about violence would like this book.	2005-09-02

Yes, there's a statement here about free will and the price society must pay for its preservation, but I believe the funny parts were not meant to escape as many readers as they do. There were times when I was reading this story of a violent teenager (much younger than he was in the film version) where I laughed till my sides ached. I know devotees will see that as sacrilege, but it's also just plain true and if you miss the laughs in here, you're missing the best part.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange is about Alex DeLarge, his teenaged gang of \\"droogs\\" and their sordid misadventures in England a generation or two hence. Alex and his cohorts dress like characters straight out of a comic book, talk to one another in Slavic-flavored \\"nadsat speak\\" an invented, brutal dialect, and imbibe psychotropic-laced milk before proceeding on nightly raids into their dilapidated city. In among the descriptions of turf wars, assaults, robberies, vandalism, rape, and eventually cold-blooded murder, Alex tells us of his keen love of classical music, which he appreciates to...er, \\"auto-erotic\\" heights. Alex is intelligent, driven, shows strong leadership skills, and one gets the sense that in another age or slightly different background he might have made something of promising young Tory spouting \\"Britannia Forever!\\" while wrapping himself in the Union Jack. But not in his rusting era of post-Imperial decomposition.<br /><br />Eventually Alex's crime spree goes too far and he is sent to prison for slaying a woman in her home. In the overcrowded prison, Alex survives and in a manner even thrives, and in the course of serving his time, he is befriended by an earnestly good man, the hard-drinking, true believing chaplain, whom Alex uses to his advantage. It is during this period that Alex learns of a psychological treatment being proposed as a means of solving Britain's horrific crime problems. It involves a sort of brainwashing whereby the recipient can no longer of his own free will choose to undertake an act of violence upon any other living creature. Alex volunteers to be the first to undergo this course of experimentation, and is rendered harmless but somewhat pathetically neutered in his capacity or act on his own volition. It is the consequences of this treatment and the effects it has on Alex's life that provides the final portion of this brilliantly inventive piece of fiction.<br /><br />This is a novel divided into three sections of seven chapters each, highlighting author Burgess' fondness for numerology. Until recently, most readers in the United States read a version that conformed more to the legendary Stanley Kubrick film that ended with Alex \\"cured\\" and once more set free on society. The novel as originally written and now restored goes one step further and projects several years into Alex's future, wherein he outgrows violence and consciously elects to become a law-abiding citizen, an exercise in free will accomplishing what the harsh chemical treatments during his incarceration could not.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange is a worthy book that rewards with humor and thoughtful prose.er of his own free will choose to undertake an act of violence upon any other living creature.

The whole idea behind the story was very appealing to me. The thought of how at night the world we know can be taken over by criminals, got my interest, since I have not read a story like this before. I also liked how this really made you look at how important free will actually is, in our society. In this book, one gets the idea of how a criminal looks at the world, and how over time people do grow up and change. This book is full of detail and surprise. Anthony Burgess I think really did an amazing job with capturing the mind of a criminal teen. It intrigues me the way Anthony Burgess was able to put humor into this story of good and evil. An example of this would be when the character, Alex is breaking into this old woman's house, and it is full of cats everywhere, and how his main problem with this robbery, is because of all these cats. It really adds to this story to have humor involved. I really liked how the main character `Alex' had a language of his own, which made this witty story even more interesting. The book just throws in a bunch of surprises one would not expect. The only real weakness this story has, is that it was in such complex text, it may be difficult for many to understand. I know for me, I had some troubled at the start of this book because of the language `Alex' created. Over time however, I seemed to adapt to this language, and actually understand it just fine. I recommend this book to those who are capable of reading something in complex text, and would be interested in the frightening ways of how evil sometimes prevails over good.	2005-09-02

All the violence, fun, and rape keeps me pumped up and full of life.  But then again, it makes me think about philosophy and good and evil, human nature and all that razdraz, at the same time.   <br /> <br />It's not like all those other books that portray all the stark realities of our fallen world, that makes u go all boo hoo hoo.  The strong bad in here is counteracted by the main Character's, Alex's, charm, wit, and his love of classical music.  This book makes u happy and think about free will and God and good and evil at the same time.  Whats interesting is that this book doesn't give an opinion, like all those other philosophical novels, instead, it asks all these questions and has no answers, but instead of leaving you confused, it makes you not care and instead, crave Alex's idea of fun. <br /> <br />when first reading, ull be confused because of the thick slang, but u understand it all in a little while if ur not dim witted. <br /> <br />And another thing: this book is for the mature minded who have self control.  I hate it when yooung people read things (those who normally dont read), just cuz it has all this \\"cool\\" violence in it and such, but then again, im like that myself a bit and so is everyone else.  Even if you arent' much of a book worm, read it, itll dispel your stupidity, and possibly make u wiser.   <br /> <br />To me, the theme of the story is this: if u are meek, unselfish, humble, and dying, u are great not in the world but in God's eyes, if you believe in a God in the first place.	2005-08-27

I've never seen the movie, although I've heard it's rather ultraviolent, which seems to be appropriate.  The thing that both attracted me and made me shy away from the novel though was the prose itself . . . for those who aren't already aware, Burgess sprinkles the novel liberally with a made-up slang that the main character uses.  I had seen a few pages at my local library and thought, \\"Crap, this isn't going to make any sense to me at all\\".  But it does, somehow.  There might actually be some editions floating out there with a glossary of sorts, giving you a clue as to what the more obscure slang terms might mean but you don't really need it.  Reading the novel, it's very easy to figure out what's going on and the text isn't impenetrable at all.  Most of the slang you can figure out via context and for the linguistically agile among you, I believe most of it is derived from Russian, mixed with some Britishisms and other stuff that I'm not smart enough to figure out.  The end result of this is that it gives the book a weird sort of driving rhythm, half the words seem made up but it flows anyway and I never had any trouble figuring out what was going on at any given point (not that you don't have to read carefully, but it's not Finnegans Wake or anything).  So that's that.  But what is it about?  The story is narrated by Alex, a teenager who inhabits a future Britain that has fallen into dingy decay, gangs walk the streets at night committing all sorts of violent acts, there hardly seems to be any hope and the government has become rather oppressive.  But Alex doesn't care because he's quite enjoying himself.  The book is a lot funnier than you might think and the violence (it's ample but not graphic) is almost slapstick.  Alex and his pals spend the first third of the book (it details a typical night) basically walking around and beating up everyone they see, the narration makes it clear that Alex is intelligent enough to know what he's doing but he likes it and would like to keep doing it.  One incident lands him in prison and while there and serving a long sentence, he's given a chance to get out early.  All he has to do is submit to a new procedure that will make him nonviolent and he can go back into society.  That procedure and its consequences drive the rest of the book, showing how things can seem to get better while actually getting worse.  It's a testament to Burgess' skill that he manages to make Alex a nearly sympathetic character, to the point where I started to feel bad for him, especially in the scenes where he's denied the joy of his beloved classical music.  The moral dilemma he poses is an interesting one, questioning whether society really becomes better if you take away free will.  The edition I have (and most recent editions, I'm sure) restores the previously \\"lost\\" final chapter . . . it was cut from the American edition for various reasons and it and the actual final chapter end the story on two utterly different notes.  I prefer the real final chapter, I think it closes the book on a reflective note, rather than the implied middle finger of the prior chapter, and I think it's more faithful to Burgess' intent.  But your milage may vary and if you really disagree just stop before you get to the end.  I don't know if it's the best Burgess book but it's certainly the most famous and quite the reading experience for those who prefer more experimental prose styles.  It was published forty years ago but still feels contemporary and it certainly worth reading even today, in a future that Burgress might not have imagined but may be closer to his than we suspect.lapstick.

I greatly encourage the reading of A Clockwork Orange; its use of language alone is reason enough. The incorporation of nadsat words emphasizes the separation of the teen culture from society in the novels setting. The difficulty I faced while beginning the novel surprisingly dissipated after the first few paragraphs. One quickly becomes use to the new language and Burgess writing. At first appearing as gibberish, after deconstructing the roots of the nadsat words, I understood the profoundness in the authors choice of words. For example, the name Alex, which is Russian in origin (as is nadsat), literally means outside of the law. As well as Burgess use of nadsat, he also incorporates repetition in Alexs narration, Then he flick-flickflicked with his bolshy (Burgess, p. 93). This style of writing really aided me in visualizing the events, despite the narrators lack of description of setting. The reader is forced to experience the books events from Alexs point of view, and I found that at times I felt I was in Alexs place. Additionally, in Alexs narration, he would describe the most prominent features of places and people, paralleling the way we remember things in real life. A Clockwork Orange, to me, was like a memorythings that were considered small were omitted or forgotten, but the story was told and the details considered significant were emphasized and described. In addition to A Clockwork Oranges achievements in language, its arguments of morality are insightful. The most fascinating point Burgess makes is about the need for free will, even if that results in one doing bad things.  In the novel, the government tries to end crime by removing freewill; however, this is no solution. Since in order to be good, one must choose to be good. The act is not what makes something immoral; it is the intent. In conclusion, A Clockwork Orange was unlike anything I have ever read, and because of its creative use of language, insightful messages and interesting plot, I highly recommend that it is read.	2005-08-21

What is less identifiable through the movie is that these young men speak using a lot of Russian words, intermingled in the English ones, and written using an unorthodox spelling that, however, allows the English-speaking reader to read them correctly without knowing their real pronunciation. This technique creates a strange form of slang that was the subject of articles, books and also a dictionary. It envisions an (impossible) context in which a hooligan can be well educated. I think that this is the feature that mostly distinguishes this very interesting novel. Not all the readers can, however, understands all the ins and outs of it.	2005-08-14
US	28191497	RSAQK8EEMKC3T	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Blind Spot?	I first became familiar with A Clockwork Orange in 1972 as a 20 year old in Northern California going to the movies with my sisters and friends to see what it was all about.  I was first struck by the brilliance of the soundtract but immediately next by the comedic violence that quickly lost its humor.  I found the film a witty satire, but I missed the meaning of the Mechanical Orange for a long time.  I thought of it as reflecting the circular journey of Alex and all the uselessness of the system and all its bizarre, hypocrites along the way, ending up where he began.  Perhaps there was some logic in that view?   <br /> <br />Most of all, I loved the music.  I recall feeling highly critical of people who condemned the film because of the violence in it.  The violence wasn't the point but an illustration I thought.  I still ocassionally listen to the soundtract, it is as brilliant as ever, but I rarely view the movie.  Once you understand the point, this is not a film for entertainment, but for re-exploration of the themes.  I was disturbed to hear that copycat gangs had sprung up and were going around actually hurting people.  Anyone who argues that movies and video games do not produce copycat behavior in some people should be reminded of this.   <br /> <br />I still think the movie (and book) has value.  But it may be very different now.  In a time when our society has gangs everywhere and even the MS13 running around seemingly at will, the idea that at a point young men (mostly) grow out of it may be our only hope. But how DO we deal with it?  The film (and book)has an important message couched in the question; \\"What makes a person truly good? However, it does seem that only people concerned with higher values care.  Current gangs are not concerned with intellectualizing their lives at all.   <br /> <br />I always thought that the film made the point that even religion was manipulative in this sense.  In the film when the reverend claims \\"The boy has no choice.He is forced to be good by mechanical programing rather than a conscious moral choice.\\"  (This is a paraphrase, not a real quote).  But what struck me in the film is that the reverend was earlier threatening Alex and all the other prisoners during a preaching sermon with horrible torture in Hell.  Myself, I see no difference in Behavior Modification methods as the \\"Ludovico Technique\\" represented or the religious brand of what turns out to be the same proposition.  Perhaps a political compromise where a prayer could be said during the subjects treatmemnt would have made the reverend and the Church happy because the Church was being involved in a State mandated intrusion into questions of moral conduct via the consciousness of an individual?  \\"As the PM said, who cares about the details, the fact is that it works!\\"  We would try whatever we thought would suceed in ending the cycle of youth gang violence if we had the chance, I'm guessing. <br /> <br />I have read many reviews of the book and the movie and no one I have read has mentioned this problem.  I read that A. Burgess himself a religious man was attempting to convey that moral choice is important.  But how does anyone reconcile this when entire cultures all over the world seem to depend on some form of moral programing from birth?  Is anyone really free to choose?  I am reminded of the exploration of inherent good and evil in books like \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" and \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" <br /> <br />Perhaps the true message of a book and film like this could be that we need to explore the question of thought freedom.  Free thought and action as opposed to programed thought and action like the \\"chicken and the egg\\" may in the end be locked in an odd circulum of contradictions - A Clockwork Orange?	2005-08-07

Of course the story is casually violent, while the bizarre invented slang spoken by the goofy classical music-loving and philosophical young hoodlum gives the reading of the book a vaguely surreal and sarcastic quality. That's all fairly well known, so it helps to consider the themes on violence and state control that Anthony Burgess explores here. Alex the nogoodnick is weaned off of his personal violence when the authorities force him to watch state-sponsored violence, so how is the state less morally corrupt than the individual? The idea that violence can supposedly stop violence is probably the most brutally ironic theme considered here. Meanwhile, an average schmuck is used by competing political factions for their own small gains, and in the process nearly loses his humanity - while the state gets more and more control thanks to timid citizens who are willing to give up liberty for security. Sound familiar? Some parts of this classic novel are a bit worn out and are not aging too well, but you have to admit that it really makes you think. If you can viddy it. [~doomsdayer520~]	2005-08-04
US	33106583	R2K4NCY5USA299	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Burgess' "nasty little shocker"	To the reader who declared, \\"The theme I'm told is, 'is it better to choose evil than to be forced to do good,'\\" I have to point out that this is a misreading of Burgess' intent. The problem, or question, posed by this \\"nasty little shocker,\\" (as the book was called by Burgess himself, if I'm not mistaken), comes down to \\"what does it mean to be human, to be a moral creature?\\" In other words, why did God create humankind with free will? Why would He allow His creatures to commit evil? Wouldn't He have preferred His creatures to act peacefully and benevolently, such that he would have made them incapable of choosing malevolence and violence?    The title itself, \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" refers, according to Burgess, to something which has the appearance of life, but which is mechanistic, its actions predetermined. An orange is an organic object, which grows naturally, while a \\"clockwork orange\\" merely apes the appearance of an organic, growing object: it is a construct, a machine which cannot change and which cannot act other than how it has been designed to act.    As a catholic, Burgess wanted to demonstrate that God gave his creatures free will--choice--in order that they come to moral behavior out of their own reasoning and spiritual/moral maturation. In other words, had God's creatures lacked the capacity to behave brutally and with evil intent, they could never become moral creatures, as they would only have been machines, capable only of acting as they had been designed. Such creatures are not alive in a spiritual sense, but are windup toys which simulate the activity of life but which are dead. Machines have no morality, and neither do creatures who cannot choose their actions. Each major section of the novel begins with the question, \\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\" A machine cannot ask or answer that question, but can only hum along performing its limited, thoughtless reflex actions. Animals, similarly, despite being organic creatures, behave largely mechanistically, in that they do not have a morality, but behave according only to instinct and inborn impulses which allow them to survive in an unforgiving but morally blank environment.     It is our capacity for free choice, even when we choose to behave evilly, which allows us to develop a morality, and this distinguishes us from animals and machines, and it is what makes us God's creatures. That Alex appreciates music and adores Beethoven indicates he has an aesthetic, a capacity to enjoy that which is not merely related to the brutal imperatives of survival, and it is this which signifies his potential for deeper human growth.    (I must point out I am an atheist, but I am speaking via the terms of Burgess' own thinking.)    The final chapter of the book, which was truncated from the original American edition of the book, and likewise from Kubrick's film, illustrates Burgess' point: in it, Alex has grown a bit older, he's perhaps in his early 20s. He's married, has children, and looks back on his career of teen hooliganism with a nostalgic enjoyment, but he's also grown out of it, and he realizes that one cannot always live such a life. He has grown in years, in experience, and he has developed a morality. Had he not been \\"cured\\" of the government's behavior modification treatment, he might never again have behaved violently, but it would not be because he had grown out of it, had CHOSEN to leave it behind. It would have been only because he could NOT have acted in any other way. He might have always harbored violent desires, or he might have had NO desires, but he would not have been a creature of God, a moral creature, because the chance to grow into that state would have been denied him. He would have been a \\"clockwork orange,\\" and not a human being.	2005-07-19

US	35539800	R2V9OR1YCKGE2G	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Very close to a masterpiece	Burgess' 'A Clockwork Orange' - thanks, for the most part, to Stanley Kubrick's screen adaptation - has become one of those classics that simply must be read at some point. Up there with '1984', 'The Catcher in the Rye' and 'Catch 22', its not-so-subtle jabs at authority seem to propell in into the arena of timeless college favourites. And this is not undeserved. Burgess has come up with an undeniably entertaining book that I would encourage all to read at some point, sooner rather than later. But, unfortunately, much of the criticism that has accompanied this book throughout its lifetime has been disproportionately positive. <br /> <br />That's not to say that there aren't many positives to praise. The story is told by our \\"humble narrator\\" Alex. The 15-17 year old speaks in an initially confusing mix of English/Slavic slang (or so I'm led to believe). While the common use of words like \\"viddy\\" (to see), \\"gulliver\\" (head) or \\"cancer\\" (cigarette) may seem challenging for the first few chapters, the style will grow on you quickly, and its quirky intelligence becomes a joy to read, somehow creating a refreshingly surreal atmosphere throughout the book. And the book does boast a decent plot, veiling (albeit lightly) an important philosophy: it is better to choose evil than to be forced to do good. Individual freedoms, and \\"all that cal\\". <br /> <br />But here is where the problem begins. The books major strengths combine, in a strange way, to leave some weaknesses. Burgess' informal and downright weird writing style do not make for the most convincing character development or philosophical power. I felt that the plot of the book would have been better served with a novel 2 or 3 times its length, in the style of a Dostoevsky or a Steinbeck. But, then again, that would mean losing its unique charm. The problem is that (and I will do my best to avoid any spoilers here, but be warned in any case) the major character development in the last chapter seems a bit hollow without any powerful/emotional scenes before it. There just doesn't seem to be a believable reason for what happens. And it's not as though there were no opportunities throughout the text to provide the basis for this revelation. The attempted suicide scene, the police beating - they were crying out for more serious undertones. Similarly, Burgess (as his American publishers did in the earlier days) could have left out the last chapter, leaving the novel relatively consistent. But that would have left its philosophy largely unproven. <br /> <br />All this leaves a slight aftertaste of an opportunity lost for an author who never seemed to reach his prime, and it is a shame. Burgess could have written 2 separate books, each of a different style instead of trying to amalgamate them into this effort, or he could have worked a little more on consitency. In any case, I feel something lacking in here. But, despite its flaws, 'A Clockwork Orange' is an immensely enjoyable - sometimes thrilling - read which holds, without question, a rare charm and intelligence. It should be read, if nothing else, for its ideas and its originality. Above all, it should be read - but don't get caught up in the hype. <br /> <br />Finally, for anyone it concerns, any scenes of violence or sex are a lot milder than I was expecting - so there's no real need to worry about that.	2005-06-09
US	24957467	R2OXKFH1EMD9K1	0786246448	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A Must-Have Book!,	Anthony Burgess' novel A Clockwork Orange has become a sort of underground classic. It is read and loved by young men all over the world.  The novel is written in a language all its own; a hybrid of English and Russian slang. Burgess called this language Nadsat. It can be, at first, difficult. However, once the reader acclimates themself to the rythyms of the words Nadsat comes alive. The language of this novel is electric. Burgess was very interested in music, and was a composer. In this novel he uses words as Mozart would have used musical notes.  A Clockwork Orange is the story of Alex, a young criminal. He and his \\"droogs\\" (friends) roam the streets robbing, beating, and raping the people they encounter. Alex is quite satisfied with his life, he has everything he needs.  Things begin to turn bad for Alex after a midnight raid on a house in the country. He is captured by the police and his friends turn on him. Soon Alex finds himself in prison, where he is offered the \\"Ludovico treatment\\". This treatment will garuntee that he never breaks another law.   Alex agrees to the treatment in exchange for release from prison. This is the point in the story where Burgess' talent really begins to show. It is at this point that the reader fully realizes that Burgess is not simply telling a story; he is showing us a metaphor for the world we inhabit.  The Ludovico treatment turns Alex into a clockwork orange: he appears to be a living creature, but is merely a machine. Alex, stripped of free will is unable to defend himself. And, because he cannot choose evil, any good he may do is meaningless.  In this book Burgess first creates a loathsome character. Then draws us into his world, making us care a bit about what happens to him. He then tears down that characters world, to show how easily our world can be torn down.  This is a startling, and brilliant book. It is not for the squeamish, nor the easily offended.  By the way, if you purchase this book be sure to look for the European edition which is one chapter longer than the American version.   ----------------	2005-06-06

The characters were a bit shallow, but I contribute this to Alex's narration--because he describes the events through his perspective, he, naturally, does not see the other character's depth/thoughts, etc. His own character began as a simple character as well, but he grew (subtle actions and words hinted at a depth). Anyways, the book is a violent one, not as terribly graphic or explicit as some have said, but nevertheless, violent. Not for the kids (the immature ones, at least). I have not seen the movie myself, but from what I have heard and read (I own a version of the novel that has an introduction by Blake Morrison which speaks of the movie), the movie is a great deal more violent and explicit (so much so othat Burgess himself found it gratuitous). So. Onto my review which will discuss the book's various themes and such.  <br /> <br />Anthony Burgess tries to convey several themes, particularly the maturation of youth, the importance of freewill, and the relationship of high art with refinement. Alex's character in the beginning of the novel was a petulant and selfish adolescent whose fun included rape and drugs. The government and society tried severely to discipline and control the wild youth. All of their attempts, including incarceration and post-corrective advisers, were in vain and Alex returned to his old ways. Despite Alex's troublemaking, he established early in the novel his desire to learn from his elders, \\"to slooshy what some of these starry decreps had to say about life and the world\\" (Lee, p.12). This shows that rebellious teen actually hears the preaching and \\"nagging\\" that is told to him by adults, and that there is hope that may reform.  <br /> <br />At the end of A Clockwork Orange (after the Ludovico technique and its failure), subtle changes had emerged in his character-he felt bored and hopeless and didn't participate as much in committing the actual violence. After some other changes, it is revealed that Alex keeps a photograph of a baby with him, now clearly showing his transformation. Then his meeting with Pete and Georgina show Alex that it was time to mature and leave his youth. **Nadsat (the slang terms he uses), I have found are used to represent the \\"wildness of youth\\". Note that Dim, who despite growing up (physically) continues to partake in violence as a police officer, and still uses nadsat. Vis-a-vis, Pete no longer does, and has in fact settled down and has become a father.** Alex had grown up, and in the process, fully left his violent ways. Youth is meant to be wild, admitting that Alex's youth is an exaggeration, and the only cure is age. In the words of Blake Morrison, \\"Youth...must have its fling, however wild.\\" <br /> <br />The second theme within A Clockwork Orange is the importance of freewill. The government and society attempted to solve the growing problem of teenager related crimes by suppressing their freewill (Ludovico's technique). This however, as shown in the book, was no solution. Alex (the technique's first subject) still had violent thoughts and wanted to do bad things, he just couldn't physically act out. So then, was he a good person? No. The actual act is not what makes something immoral, it is the intent (as with a young child who unknowingly injures someone). <br />Finally, often those who enjoy classical music, are affluent or are intellectual are thought to be better. There is a general notion that high art civilizes. However the men that ran Auschwitz read Shakespeare and appreciated Beethoven and Bach (A Clockwork Orange, introduction by Blake Morrison, xiii). There is a stereotype that enjoying the arts makes one better morally and socially, and as displayed in A Clockwork Orange, this is not true. <br />	2005-05-29
US	16468831	R3RQNLISBAHPW	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	2	27	39	N	N	A very flawed bit of ultra violence	Why?  That was the main question I seemed to be asking myself while reading Burgess' A Clockwork Orange.  I had the same problem watching Kubrick's movie version made back in 1971.  Why does young Alex act the way he does?  He has normal and loving parents; he is a mere 15 years of age.  His background just does not seem to mesh very well with how he is presented: a brutal, savage rapist and even killer.      The story opens relentlessly with Alex and his hoodlum friends kicking the snot out of an innocent civilian.  Next, they go to an innocent woman's house, rape and beat her to death.  (Also bloodying up her husband).  Finally, they break into another innocent woman's house, where everything goes wrong.  Alex cracks her over the head a bit too hard and ends up killing her.  He is immediately sent to prison.  The police don't treat him too kindly, but who would?    Alex, after spending a year in prison, gets sent (or rather volunteers) to be part of a new \\"experiment\\" in which violent criminals are cured of their inclination towards evil.  They are forced, against their will, to watch violent and unspeakable films.  Repeated viewings of these films lead the victim to a feeling of nausea and sickness.  Soon, they have no desire to commit violence.  I guess you can call it stripping away at human freedom and brainwashing.    After Alex gets let out of this institution, he attempts to go back home.  His parents reject him.  Distraught, he wanders to a place where a bunch of old people are gathered together.  Ironically, one of them is the same man Alex so ruthlessly beat up in the first part of the novel. He is recognized, and \\"attack of the senior citizens!\\"  They all attempt to beat him up and scream for his blood.  Give me a break.  Next, he discovers one of his childhood hoodlum friends is now a cop along with his former enemy.  They beat the tar out of him, of course, because nothing good can happen to Alex at this point.    Next, he wanders to the same exact house in which he brutally raped and killed a woman earlier in the book.  The man who answers the door does not recognize him though.  He helps him clean his wounds, feeds him, and is compassionate towards him.  He soon recognizes Alex, however, because of the unique slang language he used.  He ties that language to the same villain who attacked him years earlier.      After being shut up in a room, Alex can't take it anymore, and jumps out of an open window.  He doesn't die, however.  Soon after he is taken to a hospital where the doctors \\"correct\\" him and he becomes the same violent freak we have all learned to love from the beginning of the novel.  He is cured.  Hurray!! Society is outraged at how \\"unjustly\\" poor Alex was treated. Another bit of irony for you, the man of the wife Alex raped and killed gets sent away to an institution so he won't be anymore trouble to Alex.  Oh the corrupt government gets its just punishment gets its due for doing what they did to poor old, violent, raping, murdering, old lovable Alex.    Ugh.  Where do I start?  The most glaring thing that upset me about A Clockwork Orange is that because of the way it is written, we are supposed to sympathize with Alex.  How can you?  I also don't understand the question the novel asks us in an offhand matter, \\"Is it right to \\"reform\\" people by taking away their freedom to choose?\\"  No, not for normal people it's not.  Alex could have been sent to the electric chair for the things he did, in my opinion, so who really cares if they took away his freedom?  I think he was better off as a mindless twit than a sadistic rapist.  Did the people he raped and killed have a freedom of choice?    IF Burgess would have explained a bit more the society in which Alex lived, maybe my questions would have been more properly answered.  He does nothing to explain this ultra-violent society.  I can't even picture this \\"nightmarish future\\" because Burgess does nothing to describe it.  He also gives us no insight to why Alex acts the way he does.  I couldn't get that out of my mind.  I like the British ending a tiny bit better because it gives Alex a bit more human elements, opening the door for a possible future change.  Maybe he is somewhat human after all, maybe all that violence did cause some regret.  By this point, however, it is too late to really care.    The only thing I really liked about this novel was Burgess' creative use of slang and jargon.  He invents Alex's language.  I like the creativity involved in that process, but unfortunately it can't save this mess.  Too bad it couldn't have been used on a greater novel.    I know this book is herald and praised all over the world, but even Burgess himself can not figure out why, (he says this in his introduction).  Can I pity or sympathize with a character I know nothing about?   Alex is as cardboard as characters get, aside from the creative, confusing language he uses.  I know he likes Beethoven.  What else? Hmmmmm.    Also, can I picture a futuristic world that is not described?  I learn nothing of this \\"ultra violent society, aside from the random acts of violence Alex and his friends commit.  How can this be a fable of good and evil, when no good is shown?  Listen to the sequence of events in this novel, a beating-a rape-a murder-another prison beating--violent films--abandonment-another beating-a fantasized rape-a bit of redemption.     A Clockwork Orange is real hoax of a novel, it entices us to believe it is a thundering statement against forced mind control and restraints on human choice and freedom, but all it really does is rejoice in the viciousness of its \\"hero\\", Alex.

At first I found it very difficult to read through the first few pages, but, well- I can't read slang or pronounce Russian.  I managed pushing myself to read harder and capture every piece of information presented through the novel.  I can't really tell you to much because that will ruin the story but, their is a good and a bad for everything and A Clock work Orange though difficult to comprehend and understand is a brilliant read for everybody.  The main character in this novel is Alex who is a young trouble making delinquent who like to commit crimes and breaks rules well because his gang doesn't have any.  His gang friends are also known as droogs.  He really enjoys his life, which is: raping woman, robbing innocent victims, and brutally assaulting an individual.  This is normal gang behavior.  But one day every thing had gone wrong and caved in on him.  While robbing an old lady Alex had murdered her, his friend's fled the seen leaving Alex to take all of the blame. At the age of sixteen Alex is sent to prison and he stayed there for many years to come until he gets a second chance, an opportunity to do right.  The government is giving him the opportunity to involve himself in a program-one in which he can only do well because the thought of doing evil will make him suicidal.  Anthony Burgess has written a classic novel of good and evil in the prologue an authors not one might say.  Burgess gives the reader input on his book and how he feels about it and his additional ending which was removed from the American version- Chapter 21.  He also mentions something about 21 being the age it takes one to mature and the number of words he chose to end the book with.  Supposedly this is not Anthony Burgess's best novel and it was written in a much earlier time in his life when he hadn't quite matured but it is without a doubt the one book that everybody will remember because of its originality and unique concept.  There is also because they based a movie on this book-Cheater.	2005-04-14

It seemed like every other sentence contained a word that I didn't for the life of me know, so I would be flipping back and forth between the book and the glossary of Nadsat words that a friend was kind enough to send me, making an attempt to figure out the translations.<br /><br />Once I got past that, though, reading A Clockwork Orange was a piece of cake.  Written by novelist Anthony Burgess, A clockwork Orange tells the story of Alex deLarge, a young delinquent who, in the company of his three friends, gets his kicks by assaulting, robbing, and raping anyone that crosses his path, and who enjoys getting wasted at the Korova Milk Bar, an establishment in the boys' neighborhood.<br /><br />Things go wrong, however, when one of their victims is killed in the course of an assault.  Panicking, Alex's \\"droogs\\" flee the scene, leaving Alex to face the music all by himself.  Convicted of the charges against him, Alex faces a rather lengthy prison sentence until he is offered the chance to participate in an experimental aversion therapy program which strips him of any ability to enjoy the things he did before.<br /><br />Thrown out by his mum and dad, being chased by hordes of his  victims, and very nearly beaten to a pulp by two of his former droogs, Alex seeks shelter at a house that belongs to one of his victims, but the old man doesn't recognize who Alex is until Alex starts humming an old refrain from his delinquent days while talking a bath.  When the old man finally catches on, he begins to harass Alex with a piece of music that was once a favorite, but that Alex can't listen to anymore without getting sick.  Tormented by the old man, Alex jumps out the window of the guest bedroom in a vain effort to end it all.<br /><br />When he recovers consciousness, Alex finds himself in a hospital bed, with his parents looking worriedly at him. After a tearful reunion with them, Alex is next visited by a doctor who advises Alex that the aversion program has been shut down, and that he can bring Alex back to something approximating his \\"old self\\".  It is an offer which Alex happily accepts.<br /><br />One of the things I liked about this book is the fact that this particular release was published with the 21st chapter which, for reasons unknown, was previously left out of the original US release and was never portrayed in the movie.  This chapter chronicles a visit between Alex and one of his droogs, and it provides a rather nice ending to the story because Alex suddenly realizes he's no longer the delinquent he used to be, thanks to his own conscious decision to abandon his former life.  I don't have a clue why the original US edition was missing this final chapter, but it does wrap up the story very well.<br /><br />All in all, A Clockwork Orange is a very good book, once you get past the polyglot mixture of Nadsat Russian and various made-up words that are a staple of Alex and his droogs.

It's so farfetched that you can't help but being enthrolled with it. <br />   In the end, the book is serene, and you realize that he's come to a point of being an adult. In a way it's heartbreaking to realize that he's become one of the ones around him. THe one's he used to pick on and beat near to death. But it's all a circle, one that Alex may or may not realize.	2005-03-30
US	50545242	R35IOWTT2C3PUE	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Disturbing and brilliant novella	'A Clockwork Orange' deserves its place right up there at the top of dystopian fiction, a superb and thought-provoking piece that is amply cynical about government, media, the police and the prison service while remaining pleasingly sceptical of the alternatives (the damning indictment of the opposition towards the end), but without getting overly preachy, usually operating by suggestion rather than overt political statement. More broadly it sets up the philosophical dilemma over free will and its moral ramifications, coming down on the side of liberty but thoughtfully maintaining that no solution is perfect. For me the ending (not in the original) is a tad odd and seems to be an attempt at justifying Alex's choices, rather unsuccessfully. The book is more nihilistic where no solution works - Alex returning to his original state is endlessly depressing, for instance, however much we may have opposed the state's action against him.  <br /> <br />The really brilliant thing about Clockwork Orange, however, is the language use. Not only is the language of nadsat an inventive device which is deployed brilliantly, but the whole style of prose is searing, incredibly original and frequently humorous. The book has the capability to be vivid, shocking and simultaneously worryingly amusing in its attitude. Overall, combined with the power of its nihilistic force, it makes a huge impression on the reader.	2005-03-27

As you hopefully can tell, Alex isn't your typical teenager, and this is not your typical novel.  Instead it is a quirky and offbeat story that highlights the conflict between individuality and conformity. It also dips into the realm of totalitarian governments, propaganda, brainwashing and pretty much everything else that has to do with THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLING YOU.  Alex lives in a desolate near-future world were his friends are not his friends, his enemies are not his enemies, and nothing is truly what it seems.  From page one it is evident that Alex is already a sub-human whose only emotions are rage, jealousy, greed, lust, and hatred.  He has no aspirations, no goals, and no motives of any kind. The reader follows him through the night and bears witness to his senseless and repeated acts of violence and destruction.  Although he believes he is the master of his own domain, it is made evident throughout the story that he is nothing more than a mere pawn. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book because it made me think about how the world may someday be.  In many respects it reminded me of George Orville's 1984, in that it creates a world where human rights are frequently violated so that the government can control the entire population.  I will admit that the unique language in which Alex speaks is obnoxious until you eventually decipher the meaning of his words.  On the whole though, A Clockwork Orange is a quick read that you will not be able to put down, and it will keep you thinking long after you finish it. <br />	2005-03-23

With tools like character, theme and language, Burgess succeeded in creating a not-so-distant future with a language solely reserved for teenagers and a government struggling for control of its people. <br />   The main character of the novel is a teenager named Alex, who is the leader of a gang of his droogies. Each night they prey on the people on the streets committing acts of violence which bring them joy. As Alex sees the blood running from his latest victim he is filled with ecstasy and this passion only serves to drive the violence onward, \\"it was real satisfaction to me to waltz... and carve left cheeky and right cheeky, so that like two curtains of blood seemed to pour out at the same time,\\" (17). This violent nature is only amplified by the fact that Alex is a boy who appreciates fine music from the composers like Ludwig Van Beethoven and many others, however the music only serves to inspire more violence, \\"for now it was lovely music that came to my aid...and I could just slooshy a bar or so of Ludwig van...and I whished out my cut-throat britva,\\" (53). The fact that Alex is young with a violent intelligence creates a world controlled by him exclusively; there is no room for another competitor, not even the government. <br />   Through Alex, Burgess also introduces the themes of free will and also the question of when a boy becomes a man. Alex chooses to be bad, it is what he knows and that is what he will do. He will commit acts of violence until he is stopped. When he is arrested however, the government offers Alex a chance to get out of prison if he volunteers to be part of an experiment in which he watches films. Early into this experiment Alex realizes that these films are violent in the most gruesome ways, films of concentration camps, rape, and murder. These were things that used to thrill Alex, but now they begin to make him sick, \\"I had like pains all over and felt I could sick up and at the same time not sick up...I was heaving away but could not sick, viddying first a britva cut out an eye...while red krovvy shot on to the camera lens,\\" (104). That was the experiment, to rid Alex of any pretense of violence, \\"he will be your true Christian...ready to turn the other cheek,\\" (129), and to fill him with only the drive for peaceable actions inside society.  <br />   The theme of growing up comes in the final chapter of the novel, the chapter that was not included in Kubrick's film. Alex has been out of prison and finds himself not wanting to perform the old violence in the streets anymore, instead he wants to make a family and grow old with children of his own, \\"like a picture of me sitting before a bolshy fire in an armchair...I seemed to have turned into a very starry chelloveck, about seventy years old,\\" (186). By having a main character like Alex, Burgess was allowed to show through the world of Alex, the themes of free will and mental growth. <br />   I agree with Burgess and his views of society. The only person who should have the power to change one's mind is the sole owner of that individual mind. When the state tried to take Alex's mind away from him people began to take advantage of his inability to defend himself. Through this failure in reprogramming I believe that Burgess demonstrated the dark side of government and how far they are willing to go to preserve order. Also the use of an entirely new language which was created by Burgess brought the reader into the world of Alex, and made them a part of his gang, seeing what transpired through the eyes and mouth of Alex. <br />   Anthony Burgess wrote a fantastic novel featuring a character named Alex, who armed with a razor and a language all his own brought violence to the streets and also spoke toward the dangers of government control. After his release from the prison Alex becomes a man no longer interested in the violence of his childhood, now he is interested in starting a family and having a son that would grow up and resemble his father. This fact made the novel complete in my eyes, bringing Alex from violent teenager to passive adult made the novel a complete masterpiece. Burgess created a novel told by a teenager, a novel that was to read by a teenager. \\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\" (192). <br />	2005-03-18
US	50376745	R2084YVQVXJAUW	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Horrorshow!	It may well be true that Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' is one of the rare few occasions of a film being more - or at the very least as powerful and effective as the novel on which it was based (the only other such case I can think of being 'The Shining', also by Mr. Kubrick). That film is, without a doubt, one of the great masterpieces in cinema history and is mandatory viewing. That doesn't mean Burgess's novel is not praiseworthy. In fact, it's a fantastic piece of literature that, though it was overshadowed by its fantastic cinematic adaptation, is comparable to Orwell's 1984 in quality as well as in themes and ideas, and if you liked the film then the novel is well worth your time as well. <br /> <br />The comparison to 1984 comes quite naturally because they both run along the same veins of futuristic thinking, and both deal with similar subjects of free will, individual freedom, violence and alienation in a technologically advanced society - though from entirely different points of view. Burgess chose - as you well know if you've seen the film - the point of view of Alex, a teenage delinquent and a violent criminal, in a futuristic New York where teenage gangs rule the night and have their own way with innocent, law-abiding citizens. We see this world through Alex's eyes, and so receive a very disturbing view of this reality; Alex sees the violence and death in a humorous, indifferent way, and so the novel is often hilarious and constantly shocking. A reviewer noted that nowadays, the idea of a fifteen year old committing murder may not be as shocking and unthinkable as it was forty years ago, and that may be true; but the elegant and lightly style in which the gruesome murders and rapes are described by Alex makes the novel shocking and compelling still, and the moral and philosophical questions it raises about free will - essentially, is good truly good only when it's chosen? - or, is good behavior that isn't chosen by one's own free will better than bad behavior that is? - still fascinate. Burgess suggests no easy answers - but he raises some damn interesting questions, that may become more and more relevant. <br /> <br />The linguistic aspect of the book is also a fascinating one. Burgess came up with a complete and structured slang to be used by the teenagers of his hypothetic future, composed mainly of words derived from Russian. Since the Humble Narrator himself speaks in that hybrid language even as he directs his words at the readers, it makes for both a challenging and a fascinating read. <br /> <br />The 21st and last chapter of A Clockwork Orange is an anomaly that almost every reviewer here referred to, and so shall I. The chapter was omitted from Kubrick's otherwise very faithful adaptation, as it was from the original American publication of the novel (the version which I first read). Quite frankly, I can see perfectly well why Burgess and Kubrick chose to drop it, because it's mostly anti-climatic and does not fit in well with the book's ideas, though it fits in very well with the structure of the novel and answers some questions left by the original twenty chapters (most of all, whatever happened to old Pete?). It's interesting enough to read though - even though I still consider it an afterthought and a separate section from the actual novel - it sheds a very different light in regard to Burgess's views on the matters discussed in the novel, and raises some very different questions than the original ending. Do try to find the version that includes this chapter, but read the first twenty chapters first and this one separately, and decide for yourself.	2005-03-10
US	50230169	R1UFVN3FKAYTEG	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Simply Horrorshow	Great books seldom make for great films, but when they do, it's usually the movie people remember better. Films reach more people, requiring less investment of their time. Plus, when they are made as well and as excitingly as was Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of this Anthony Burgess novel, it's hard not to think of the movie first.<br /><br />Both feature a young man named Alex who, in what was a vaguely futuristic society for the time, rides around with his friends committing various felonies. Alex lords it over his friends as well, a bit too much. Then he finds himself with one victim too many, and in the hands of the police. His only chance for freedom: Submit to a controversial mind-altering technique that will make him incapable of violence.<br /><br />There are two reasons the book remains vital above the movie. The first, more surface reason, has to do with Nadsat, the unique argot Burgess developed for the youthful protagonist, Alex, and his friends. For example, while contemplating robbing helpless victims, Alex narrates thusly: \\"Our pockets were full of deng, so there was no need...of crasting any more pretty polly to tolchock some old veck in an alley and viddy him swim in his own blood...\\"<br /><br />You can find a Nadsat glossary online if your edition doesn't have one, but the remarkable thing is how well you pick up on the words' meaning after a few pages without looking up definitions. The movie keeps some of the Nadsat but it doesn't have the same place it has in the book, which is too bad since the language makes a point about the corruption of the culture Alex inhabits.<br /><br />The second thing about the book that places it over the movie is explaining what the title is all about. The phrase \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" recurs through the novel, while never appearing in the movie. \\"A fair gloopy title,\\" Alex calls it, when he first spies it on a manuscript of an author he is in the process of terrorizing.<br /><br />As Alex goes on to read, the author describes \\"a clockwork orange\\" as the artificial imposition on man of \\"laws and conditions appropriate to a mechanical creation.\\" This has a ring of irony when Alex himself submits to the technique. It's not that the movie doesn't carry the concept of the clockwork orange, just that it doesn't connect the dots or make the point as effectively.<br /><br />A third reason to choose the book over the movie is the missing 21st chapter, which is found in later editions of the book but not all, and did not appear in the movie. It's kind of a mixed blessing, since the missing chapter wouldn't have gone so well in the movie (hard to imagine the wonderfully malevolent Malcolm McDowell suddenly having a sensitive moment) but does give the reader something positive to take away from an what otherwise might feel depressing upon reflection, the idea that man has two choices, to be controlled artificially or left to their evil desires.<br /><br />But \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is not depressing to read through. It's actually thrilling, mind-warping, and more than a bit funny. You will find yourself liking Alex despite yourself, and adapting to his worldview with surprising ease. That's because Burgess does such a good job of representing the devil inside all of us, why we listen to it, and even, most daringly, why it's better to have one than not.ificial imposition on man of \\"laws and conditions appropriate to a mechanical creation.\\" This has a ring of irony when Alex himself submits to the technique.

I originally started the book last year, but with my busy schedule, I didn't have time to finish it.  This year was a different story, I could not put the book down.  Burgess' use of the NADSAT language filled with the vile images leaves you with a life long memory of it all.  I don't have one problem with this book, I can't say that about many things.  I have reread it now a couple of times and is falling apart with all the notes I have taken in it.  It has such a deep meaning that can be topped by very few books.

If you're tired of reading the same ol' stories with a goody two-shoes protagonist, who has some sort of dilemma then through a miraculous epiphany he finds his way and everyone holds hands and sings kumbaya, then this is the book for you! (Whatever you do, do not read the last chapter!!!!)    This is a very dark and satirical novel with a very fresh dialogue. Burgess uses a language called Nadsat to alienate the main character and his \\"droogies\\" from the rest of the world. If you have the capacity to read at a slightly higher level (like Shakespeare or Dante), or are enamored by the challenge, then this story will have you quoting it months after you're finished with it. And if you're IQ is above average you might even recognize the author's sporadic humor and sarcasm.    Alex suffers from some kind of psychopathic disorder, and the society he lives in has incubated all the malice that lives within him. He is very clever, brave, witty, articulate, and not exactly what you would call a delicate flower.     After the government experiments with a highly effective and novel rehabilitation method, Alex becomes an ideal citizen, but he suffers every day and wants to kill himself. His life becomes \\"Clockwork\\" and loses its purpose (I don't know where the orange part comes from).    As you read it you will be confused as to how you are cheering on this menace, which kills, robs, and does other horrific activities. However, this is where Burgess' genius becomes apparent and makes the book a classic. You the reader experience what Alex experiences when he goes through the rehabilitation process, he starts feeling and doing things that are contradictory to his natural state of being, and hence becomes mere \\"clockwork.\\" Even though he is a malevolent character you yourself are in oppression of something greater and can't help liking him and hoping for his reincarnation so to speak.    All of the characters are interesting and the encounters with one another are real. The onlyfolly of the book is its 21st chapter. I don't know hat happened here but the book is pure magic until its last chapter, where it abandons its key premise and succumbs to social pressures and suddenly becomes politically correct. Nonetheless, the book is profound intelectual bliss-you can end with the 20th chapter and it makes complete sense.    I recommend this book to anyone who is not superficial and is looking for a thoughtful experience. Please do not judge this book by its movie! This clich was probably coined specifically for this book. The movie has a completely different ambiance and misses the artistic brilliance of the author. The book is probably 5 times more interesting, more entertaining, and much better.    It's a great read, and will have you scratching your head by the end of the book, not because it's confusing, but because you can't put it down and thus have no time to shower.

The book is based in a british slang called nadast.  Don't be discouraged by this style of writing and decide not to read this book.  I know when i first picked up this book and i had read the first page i thought to myself, \\"man, this is one hard book to follow.\\"  At that point i had almost put the book down and planned on not reading it.  But, people telling me how good this book was kept me reading the book.  After a few pages into the book taking it slowly i started to make sense of this confusing text and now i'm use to it, and it's a wonderful book.  SO FROM ME TO YOU, IF U PLAN ON READING THIS BOOK DON'T PUT IT DOWN THE TEXT WILL MAKE SENSE THE FARTHER YOU GET INTO IT.  Hey, Maybe you'll even start talking like them, this being a very horrorshow (good) book. <br /> <br />As for the actual review of the story, i will start with the beginning but i dont plan on giving it all away (you can read someone elses if you want to spoil it for you.) Also im not good at reviews or writing in genral. <br /> <br />First off, the book starts with a young 15 year old boy named Alex, who is sort of a juvenile delinquent.  His average days consist of Hanging out with His Droogs(friends,also gang members) sitting at a milk bar (drugged up milk is drank here) and doing several delinquent acts such as rape,thievery and maybe even MURDER!  The first main thing to happen in this book is they take a little trip to a authors hows to have a little fun.  Alex using his charm to make the kind young lady open the door enough for them to run in and attack and rape his wife and him.  Later they return to the milk bar and a young lady starts to sing a little opera, when Dim (the dumbest and biggest of them)makes a very ignorant gesture/noise towards this women. Which results in a nice kiss to the face from the leader Alex.  This makes his droogs to conimplate betrayal and hatred towards there leader.  Then the droogs go off to another house to go for more vicous acts.  Alex leads in and is confronted by a older woman who puts up a terrible fight.  As Alex leaves the house he is confronted by his droogs to see that they have come to betray him.  They knock him to the ground which results in him getting caught by the cops. <br /> <br />Alex is then charged with murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison.  2 years in prison leads to a scientific discovery made by government officials to \\"brainwash criminals to be good\\" and Alex is \\"forced\\" into the program.  They give Alex a drug that inflicts pain on him which then they keep his eyes open as he watches disturbing videos; so as the drug co-insides with criminal acts triggering when he does wrong.   <br /> <br />There is more to this book but like i said early i am not about to give the book away thats pretty much to much info right there.  If you want to know what happens next then look at someone elses to find it, like i said im not giving it away.  Also Yes! there is a movie on it but i reccomend you should read the book instead or at least read it before it is certainly much better and more enjoyable then the movie. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-11

This book was one of those books that I would pick up apposed to doing my calc. I enjoyed this book very much, It tickled my mind more than whatever I wasnt reading in school would have, I guarentee it. This book brought to the light issues of free will, governemnt, humanity, and morals, or lack there-of. Kindof funny isnt it. Morals. I read this around election time and morals seem to be the hot topic, especially with the right wingers. People seem to think government can improve peoples morals, what a load. Lets take a look at alex's world. His government is the epitomy of controlling ones feeling and morals, but lo and behold is Alex a nice person? What about his droogies? NO. Even with alex's transformation at the end he is miles from what we would call acceptable today. Let us not forget that the goal of being \\"moral\\" is to provide an enviornment where an alex must change, not to change an alex. I think we are forgetting that, and this book is a good reminder.

The narrator and main character, Alex, leads his droogs (friends) to vandalism and anarchical acts.  Burgess uses a slang language derivative of Russian that creates a strange futuristic tone.  At first, the language made it hard to understand and read, but as one begins to indulge themselves in the story, the language is nearly non-existent.  Burgess puts this group of kids against all the best wishes of society and they survive society's grasp.  Burgess also uses parallelism of his future with our reality to show what might happen.  Strangely enough, and quite ironic, Alex, the leader of a vicious group of street hooligans, finds favoritism in classical music such as Beethoven, Handel, and Bach.  This contrast was obviously intentional to show the influence of the past in the near future.  It is a great story that I quickly started reading and enjoyed every slash of Alex's britva and every beating of innocent bystanders.  To enhance every brutal scene, Burgess uses a mix of dialog and narration.  Burgess' use of strong language, a pioneer of his time, helps create an atmosphere of anarchical lunacy.  I would highly recommend this book to anybody that can take a good old graphic novel filled with suspense and fun.	2004-12-13

He is offered early release if he goes through a \\"deconditioning\\" program.  The program will deter him from crime.  It works but it has unexpected side effects.  His whole thought process at this point is disturbing since he still wants to rape and beat, but then he is also revolted by violence.  He wants the deconditioning undone. <br /> <br />This book is more of a pleasant curiosity than a must read.  The movie kind of played up the deconditioning and simplified or focused things depending on how you look at it.  The book has more issues, including a peaceful disturbing ending in which Alex lumps his violent tendencies with childhood.  The book is also good conversations material.	2004-11-12

It is an amazing story of a young boy, Alex, and his daily life as a child delinquent.  The moral of the story, to me at least, is that one must choose to be good; it cannot be forced upon them.  I recommend this book to anyone who can read it and get the gist of it.  It is filled with it's own made-up language, so that is a bit hard to get used to at first.  Read it!	2004-10-04

Far from it. There are really only about a dozen invented words, which are supposed to be the teen-speak of the time; and you don't even have to memorize them because their meaning is always clear from the context.     So is the book better than the movie? Well, they're very different underneath, even though their plots are superficially identical, and they're both brilliant in their own ways. Kubrick's movie is typically obscure and mysterious, and he leaves you to draw your own conclusions about its point. Burgess' book, on the other hand, is much clearer about its political stance. One good thing about the book is that its characters are in their early-to-mid teens, as opposed to the movie, where everyone looks around thirty, O my brothers.    The book is absolutely compelling. The violence is brutal, but not all that disturbing, because the novel takes place in a \\"dystopian future.\\" In actual fact, it's no more dystopian than the industrialized societies of today, or of the '60s or '70s; the book is an allegory of 20th century society. The novel is actually pretty short; it's a quick and easy, fast-paced read.    You're probably familiar with the plot; vicious little Alex, he of the ultra-violence and the in-out, in-out and the Ludwig van, gathers his droogs every night, and together they terrorize the decent folk after drinking their narcotic-laced milk. Eventually Alex is captured, and what little free will he has is removed through some kind of controversial aversion therapy. It's a relatively short but very strong story.    My only problem with A Clockwork Orange (the book) is that Burgess oversimplifies the causes of social problems. Burgess strongly implies at various points in the book that \\"free will\\" is an illusion; that little Alex, Your Humble Narrator, is nothing more thanthe product of society. His randomly violent behavior is not his \\"free choice;\\" he behaves this way because his peers do, and because it's the only logical way that society gives him to act. Again, I don't necessarily agree with this, but this is what Burgess implies throughout the book. In case you had any doubts, he makes it clear near the end, when the kind old guy who takes him in (the same one little Alex terrorized before his \\"rehabilitation\\") is also named Alexander. Burgess is saying that little Alex and nice old Alexander are the same type of person inside, just brought up in different situations. And at the end, Burgess throws in a chapter which Kubrick left out, which has little Alex realize that he's too old for the \\"ultra-violence\\" and the old \\"in-out, in-out\\" and decides it's time to become a respectable adult. Again, Alex does this not because he's \\"changed\\" or become \\"better,\\" but because it's what all his friends have done at that age, and what society expects. But this isn't really a flaw in the book; Burgess set out to make a societal statement and he makes it.     Burgess is a born writer; the dialogue and plot are far ahead of their time. The book was written in the '60s and feels not the slightest bit dated today. I may not entirely agree with its politics, but A Clockwork Orange may be the most vibrant and memorable book I've ever read.	2004-10-04

I repeat: IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!!!  If you are offended by violence and other \\"adult situations\\" then you will not like this book.  It is also an intensely difficult read for the first chapter or so.  This is due to the fact that Anthony Burgess invnented his own kind of slang, through which the story is narrated by the central character, Alex.  There is no glossary so re reading is a necessity if you're going to enjoy this book, simply to figure out what the language means.  For a book written almost 50 years ago, it is quite a ways ahead of its time.  The way all of the characters can be loathed and loved at the same time is just mind boggling.  Even Alex can be felt sorry for after he is subjected to the government's rehabilitation program.  To sum it up, amazing, but not for the faint of heart.	2004-09-26

Glad I had.  The opening line of the book instantly caught me, and did not let go till the last hair raising sentence. <br /> <br />Before going off on the story, I want to comment on Burgess' intense writing style, which has reshaped my own view of what writing should be.  In addition to the Slang used by Alex (Nasdat) There is a wonderful natural fluidity to his language that grips the reader instantly. <br /> <br />The plot, it seems, is intertwined so that reader must identify with any one particular person at a time, but this changes rapidly.  At one point you find yourself loving the character Alex, then the next moment you realize he's a total jerk!  The police are appreciated till their evil is revealed.  The old man F. Alexander seems to be compassionate till you realize he plans to kill Alex.  You want to smack Alex's parents for not having raised their kid right, yet you pity them for fearing their own sons evil tendancies.  It's bothersome because you don't have any character that you can latch onto. <br /> <br />Alex is evil.  Let there be not mistake.  The state is evil.  The kind old man is evil, driven so because of Alex.  By the end the evil has not left.  It just simply went through a cycle.  In short, this book scared the crap out of me, Bog blast it!	2004-09-19

There is no box for Anthony Burgess. <br /> <br />Burgess has taken the English language and made it his own. In difference from other authors, Burgess has used English as a basis, rather than a guideline, to create a new art. Using his own words and style, he has become something special that is deserving of praise. <br /> <br />The Novel Itself. All in all, A Clockwork Orange is an amazing work. The story of a troubled nadsat (teenager) who is caught in the act and sentenced to punishment. Yet, Alex (the main character) gets more than he ever bargained for. He is subjected to a new form of correction used by the government only to be released to a changed world that rejects him real skorry (quickly). Alex soon finds himself back he began (in a sense, that is), only to be enlightened by part of his beginning. The story proves to be very circular, yet un-repetitive in a very masterful way. <br /> <br />Philosophy. Burgess quietly challenges the world within his story. Is it fair to force someone to do the right thing, rather than to let them choose? Which is better: a world of forced good or a world of independence? You'll see both the author, protagonist, and main other characters challenge these questions. <br /> <br />The Human Brain AND A Clockwork Orange. Due to Burgess wonderfully unique style of writing, this novel allows the reader to tap into him- or herself. As Burgess uses many of his new, invented words (such as: veck, droog, itty, viddy, etc.) we can see ourselves becoming accustomed to them and understanding what they mean. It excites the brain on the thought that we are learning a new language, and thus brings back childhood illusions. Burgess knows precisely how to use his new words and when an explanation is needed. Remarkable. <br /> <br />A Clockwork Orange should be read by all intellectuals at one point or another. It does not take long, but we mustread it with an open mind realizing that we will have to do some thinking ourselves, as well as some accepting. Make sure (if you're planning on reading A Clockwork Orange) that you have the original British version that includes a Seventh Chapter in the last section of the book. Originally, when this book was brought to America, the last chapter was omitted (also was it omitted in the film adaptation of the book). The Norton Paperback Edition includes this last chapter.	2004-07-26

As with most famous novels, there is the danger of disappointment because they are so hyped up. This was the case with me, until I was about halfway through. Then, because it was sufficiently different from the movie, I realised that it was good beyond the hype. And overall, it is the fact that Burgess has condensed quite a lot of ideas onto about 150 easy pages that makes this book a great read. If it was much longer (like so many other thematic books of novels-of-ideas) it would lose its tolchok...<br />Speaking of tolchoks, this would be the most challenging part of the novel - nadsat. The narrator is Alex, a juvenile delinquent living in a somewhat not-too-distant-and-certainly-dystopian future, where Britain is quite close to being a police state and where crime is such that the &quot;delinquencies&quot; of little Alex involve rape, murder and other examples of ultra-violence. Furthermore, the teens in this future speak nadsat, a slang peppered with Russian expressions. The first page should be quite a shock to those who don't know Russian (and if like me you do know it, there's the feature of figuring out what Russian word the Anglicised string of letters is meant to symbolise). Anyhow, you can think of it as a cloze passage and in a few pages, you should be fluent. If not, there are excellent resources on the internet, such as Wikipedia's nadsat entry. As for the purpose of this deliberate difficulty, it's actually worthwhile in highlighting the superficial and brutal subculture Alex lives in.<br />The novel is divided into three parts. Part 1 is Alex and his friends running amok and basically doing what they like. Part 2 is Alex in prison, and the famous Ludovico's &quot;rehabilitation&quot; technique. Part 3 is Alex back in the world, with a difference.<br />The book is seen to explore free-will and the choice to do good and evil. As such, we climb into the head ofsomeone who would most likely be described as a sociopath in conventional terms. He commits acts of violence simply because this is what he genuinely enjoys. And to go against the stereotype of the low-IQ bum, Alex is considerably intelligent and has a true passion for classical music. This sets up the background of a world-gone-mad. Then, Alex is treated with a technique that physically conditions him to be unable to do harm to anyone. Of course, the prison chaplain is against this but according to the Minister of the Interior, at least it will help in the seemingly-hopeless fight against violence.<br />Alex immediately becomes front-page material and a political pawn from all sides of the spectrum. Burgess examines the nature of our society, where politics and public perception are at the heart of every issue, and where both sides can become involved in dirty and partisan tactics. Also, the inconsistencies of the way society brings people up, incarcerates, punishes and attempts to rehabilitate criminals is a major idea.<br />The good thing is that it is unclear to me what moral lesson Burgess was actually attempting to espouse. He really lets the reader draw their own conclusions, more so than most writers. Finally, some of the early editions cut the last chapter, making the novel more edgy and dark (this is the case in the film). The last chapter (part 3, chapter 7) is an actual resolution. People have argued whether it makes the novel better or not. I think it does make it better because it casts irony on the tortuous attempts to rehabilitate Alex. But try to get an edition with the last chapter so you can see what Burgess intended originally.<br />Because it seems that somehow, violence is still with us *just a bit*, and the Clockwork opens up the recesses of evil and not-so-evil and its such a concise read makes it a great novel of the 20th century, and more original than many other dystopias.	2004-07-07

The main character, is a 15 year old lad named Alex whose life consists of crime, cruelty, and recklessness. After being betrayed by an accomplice, he is sentenced to prison where he volunteers for a program that corrects the seemingly uncorrectable. Only then does he being to suffer the consequences of his crash and burn lifestyle. <br />A Clockwork Orange is what I believe to be a fabulous novel. It may confuse a reader at the start because of the language, but its not that hard to understand the slang dialect if you have a firm grasp on English and are a few pages into the book. Also, one must be patient when reading it because the main ideas aren't revealed until later in the novel. There is a lot of building up the characters before hand, which is valuable information but may bore those who are already have a distaste for the book's violent nature. I also highly recommend that you read the British version because the last or 21st chapter is quite important.  <br />Anyways, the book is more oriented those who can see past the gore and sex and can grasp the main ideas the author is trying to convey through a clockwork orange.	2004-05-28

Therefore it was immediately apparent to me though I liked the mixing of the two languages it reminded me of how I talk at home using both languages interchangeably.

I picked it randomly from a list of books to do a project on, and was warned after about its intense violence, and difficult language. After reading it, though, I would rate it was one of the most worthwhile books I've read in my high school career.  I found Burgess's invented slang intriguing (although difficult to comprehend at first) and I felt that it added to Alex's character.  Burgess did an excellent job of developing each of the characters, and even though he was a cruel delinquent I often found myself feeling badly for Alex.  The last chapeter was the one that enjoyed the most (apparently it wasn't included in the original American versions) because it displayed so much hope for this troubled young man.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone, but would strongly warn the reader about its violence.  The book should not be read by those with a weak stomach!	2004-05-17

The main character, Alex, is a naive and immature boy who experiences harsh consequences to his actions, but they are well deserved.  Even though his crimes were out of fun, not meaning to kill anyone, they did, and he showed no sign of remorse.  He doesn't learn from his mistakes and his true feelings are masked by his inability to perform violent acts.<br />The language used in the book is difficult at first to understand, but with repitition, I got used to it and could understand the plot.  I like the fact that the language is unique, but I don't think the book has any other great values.  There is no significant difference between Alex at the beginning of the book and at the end.  Like all his actions, he has no real reason to start a family.  He acts on sporadic instincts and doesn't think about the things that he does.  Weeks of physical torture could not keep him from his violent thoughts, and the idea of growing up most likely won't either.<br />I found this book tiring because it was so wordy and I found no real attachment to any of the characters because the only ones described in depth were cold and violent.	2004-05-03

He creates an atmosphere, an entire surreal environment that I both knew could not exist but wondered if it might be possible.  <BR>Each of the three sections of the book open with this ambiguous line, &quot;What's it going to be then, eh?&quot;, and with each usage I came up with a new interpretation.  Example A: the first portion of the book is spent watching 15-year-old Alex and his gaggle of friends take out their aggression on nearly everyone they meet.  A man walking down the street is beat so badly he bleeds and can't get up off the street, simply for being a &quot;teacher-type&quot; and carrying an armload of books.  Burgess uses this repetitive opening line as bait...I had to keep reading just to find out what shape it might take on the next time around.<BR>One of the most amazing aspects of this book was the language.  Burgess creates his own vocabulary, replacing random English words with his own concoctions.  Alex didn't have friends, he had &quot;droogs;&quot; they didn't drink a little at the bar, they drank a &quot;milenky&quot; bit.  Sure, it takes a while to figure out just what in the heck Alex is doing or saying, but it's well worth it.<BR>So, to make this short and sweet, read the book, be stumped by the vocab, try to not be too appauled by the violence, and decide for yourself what that opening line means.	2004-05-03

If anything, it adds to the gang like feel Burgess sought to convey. To tell the truth, I found myself using Burgess' made up words by the end of the book. The scary reality of this futuristic story makes the language even more powerful. <br />The two contrasting ideas of the novel are so well presented that I found myself unable to actually decide which side to agree with. Is it better to choose whether or not to be evil or just to be good? Is free will really what makes us human? What was also a bit disturbing was the fact that I felt sympathy for someone as devilish as Alex. Burgess' incredible storytelling can be thanked for that. From the middle to the end I sympathized then empathized with the little droog. <br />I recommend the novel, especially now in light of recent developments in the world, however I do not recommend the movie. Seeing the movie is not enough, for it does not do the novel justice in the slightest. I do not understand why it received as much acclaim as it had. I find it ironic that the one book Burgess really didn't like, turned out to be his most famous. It was good, not spectacular, but definitely a must read for anyone who likes stories along the lines of Brave New World (I did enjoy Aldous Huxley's masterpiece far more than I enjoyed A Clockwork Orange, though they both have certain un-ignorable similarities). I picked up this novel without having any idea what it was truly about. I did read summaries and things of that nature, but those can only tell you so much. It is the sort of literary work that one needs to read oneself in order to get the full effect.	2004-05-03

It was a little awkward that I found myself really enjoying this book.  The content is very disturbing, but the way Burgess writes, makes it absolutely fascinating.  Burgess uses a type of Russified slang that takes a little bit of reading to get used to, but don't let that stop you.  Some of the books have dictionaries of the slang words, but I'd recommend not using it.  One of the best parts of this book is that you find yourself able to understand what he is saying even though you don't quite understand the language.  It is also interesting how the sections of the book mirror each other.  There are a lot of recurring events that happen over the course of the book to look for, while reading it.  And if you have read the earlier American version of the book, that only has 20 chapters, be sure to pick up the newer version with the complete 21 chapters.  That goes for the movie as well, it was made based on the 20 chapter version of the book, so it's a good idea to read the book with all 21 chapters, if you have already scene the movie.  That last chapter adds a whole new spin on the book.<br />Burgess also explores some very deep political themes.  The idea of Ludovico's technique, which is mentioned in the book, shows Burgess's views on Skinner's behaviorist theory, which can also be applied to Communism.  This book is very thought provoking and brings up a lot of controversial issues that can be great class discussion topics.	2004-05-03

Its paradoxical name refers to its political overtones.  A story about an English boy overcome with hedonistic and violent tendencies.  He is treated by the system and trained to become sick when his evil tendencies arrive.  Like many writers of his time, Burgess metaphorically communicates a portrail of our own society.  The Clockwork is a hint towards the mechanical workings of our socitety; with its regular schooling, social groupings, criminal control and government.  The Orange hints towards the rather live working members inside this mechanical evironment; being the people.  The book give question to our larger purpose and mening, testing the bowndries of right and wrong, and moral norms.  A clockwork Orange remains a classic in our generation and will remain for generations to come.	2004-05-03

I've heard from many people that after the first chapter or so of &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; they gave up because of the NADSAT.  Nadsat is a slang invented by Burgess, that is a mixture of Russian and, well, nonsense.  There are resources available to define these nadsat words, but in most cases it is not even necessary.  Many of the words, in context, are self-explanatory, and those which are not can often be passed by without tainting the reader's experience.<br />If you can get past the brilliant but difficult slang, this book is definitely a good read.  Burgess also wrote symphonies, and this is apparent in his works.  This book is no exception.  The book serves almost as a mirror:  the first section is a slow build, the second section is the middle ground--and also where much of the action takes place, and the third section is a slow decline to the end:  much like a reversal of the first section.  <br />&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is incredibly thought-provoking--it really makes you look to yourself, check your own values and beliefs.  What is right?  Is free will more important than a safe society?  This book is great, and I would recommend it for both classroom reading as well as reading for pleasure.	2004-04-30

Their leader, Alex, is our narrator, as he lets us join in on the gang's adventures, which mostly center around &quot;ultraviolence&quot; such as rape, beatings, very sick jokes where someone ends up severly damaged, etc.  On one of these outings they make their way into a middle-aged woman's house and Alex ends up killing her and is caught by police.  If I say anymore I will give away the book, so I will stop now.<br />This is definitly my favorite book ever.  I read it for the first time while at Camden Military Academy.  It was the original American edition, plain orange cover, no special design, only 20 chapters (the American publisher didn't seem to really like it, telling Burgess he should be lucky to have even 20).  It was a torn, forgotten book lying beneath one of the shelves at the school's library.  Burgess, as usual, plays around with language in this book, creating the &quot;Nadsat&quot; language, a combination of German and something else, which is the slang language of teens and the lower class in the times of the future in England.<br />This book also, I think, satires government control, because they &quot;reform&quot; Alex in some sick way, but if I explain it I will give it away...<br />I truly reccommend this book to anyone that likes to think, and isn't offended by horrible violence taking place while someone sings &quot;Singin' in the Rain.&quot;<br />This was a hard review to write... you just have to read the book to get it.	2004-04-24

I was a little weary about reading it because I had seen the movie first, but I'm glad that i read it. Stanley Kubrick did a very good job on the movie, but i would have to say that i enjoyed the book more.<br />The book goes into more detail on Alex's life and the crimes. I thing it was amazing how Anthony BUrgess set the book in 3 main parts. The first part is being set in his hometown with the victims of his crimes, the second part is in a new setting with completely different characters, and the third part is back at his hometown with all of the same charactesr as the first part but they switch roles in the victimizing.<br />There are only a few things that i made me less into the story. The fact that Alex is only 15 years old in the book is hard to comprehend especially with some of the things he does. Another thing that is wierd about the book is the language. Alot of the words are english slang terms for that time such as &quot;slooshied&quot; and &quot;viddied&quot;, but you get used to it.<br />Even if you have no desire to read this book because you saw the movie, at least read it for the original ending (which the movie does not include)<br />this book is well deserving of 5 stars, and it is one of the best books i have ever read.	2004-04-22

It is a great, fast paced story of the future that also has a strong moral message. Burgess opens it by introducing us to Alex. A teenager bent on destruction and violence. He's not the only one though, nearly every teenager is like him. At one point though he gets caught in one of his acts of violence and he has to go to prison. He then gets a miracle cure that makes him absolutely sick of even the thought of harming anyone and is thrown out into the world leaving him open to the revenge of all the people he harmed before.<br />This book alone would be a good story. Burgess doesn't just tell a good story though. Every action has a meaning and a purpose in the book it is not just 'filler paper'.A good show of how teenagers have an affinity towards violence. But Burgess doesn't stop there. Burgess writes on how people can change. He brings up the problem of choice. Is the man who is forced to good more moral than the man who chooses to do bad? Moral choice is what seperates man from beast isn't it? It is very thought provoking and I am very happy that I stumbled upon this book.	2004-04-05

The story is will developed, and it is written in a creative way.  Anthony Burgess uses many words pulled from other languages to replace ordinary everyday English words.  For example he uses the word \\"krovvy\\" to replace the word blood.  There is a Glossary of Nadsat Language in the back of the book.  At first the words make it difficult to comprehend what is happening.    The first couple of chapters I had to keep flipping back to the Glossary.  Then I got the hang of the words.  Not only do the different words make it an interesting read, but he also has a creative style of writing. <BR> The story is the first person view of a young boy named Alex.  It is about how he and his friends, droogies, like to walk the streets and beat people up.  Unfortunately for Alex all the trouble comes back on him.  Anthony Burgess uses Alex's story to get across many points depending upon how much one wants to reads into the story.  Burgess refers to the change in times and how the police abuse their powers by cracking down too hard.  The story is violent, but does not go into details too much to gross someone out.  I am not one who likes to read a lot, but I certainly liked this book.  I would recommend this book more to males even if they do not like to read.	2004-03-31

The movie only shows the first twenty chapters.  While the movie is well done, it does not tell the whole story.  In most copies of the book, all twenty-one chapters are present.  Both the movie and the book are a very insightful and alaramingly realistic satire of modern day adolescents.  What Anthony Burgess wrote in 1962 seems very realistic today.<br />While the coded language or slang used by Burgess is often hard to decode, it gets easier as you read further into the book.  Alex is a rebellous and often violent teenager.  With his gang of thugs, he rules the night with violence and theft.  The crime spree continues until Alex is arrested and convicted of murder.  At this point, we see a megalomanical government attempt to intervene by committing what we might now call a human rights violation.  Through a series of dramatic episodes, classic conditioning cures Alex of his violent tendencies.  Alex is then released into a world he is forced to rediscovered.  Many of the things he once found pleasurable are now painful.  These events nearly cause Alex's demise.  It is only through his near death that the conditioning is reversed and his mind is liberated.  With a free mind, Alex is left with the prospect of finally having to act as an adult and take on adult responsibilities.<br />The controlling government is eerily reminiscent of books such as &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;.  If you enjoyed these books or books similar to these, I suspect you would enjoy reading &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.  Even if you personally find the book unreadable, you will at least learn what a &quot;clockwork orange&quot;, the name means.	2004-02-24

The story is written in first-person and follows the adventures of a teenager named Alex.  Alex and his gang of 'droogs' are one of the many gangs that take over London after the sun has gone down, doing whatever they feel like whether that is beating, robbing, violating, or occasionally killing.  Eventually, Alex is betrayed when some of his 'droogs' feel he is too harsh of a leader.  In prison, he voulenteers to be the test subject for a new treatment that would make him incapable of evil by turning him into a clockwork orange. (A person trained so that they can do only good or evil; they lose the ability to choose) He voulenters, saying he wants to do good, but really only wanting to reduce his sentence.  When he is realeased he discovers that he is powerless to stop his former victims from harming him!  The unique language invented by Burgess in the book is facinatating and really adds to the enjoyment.  But, perhapes the most amazing thing that Anthony Burgess did in the book was make Alex a likeable character, you can't help but pity him but you realize that you really shouldn't.  At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the last chapter is what pulls the book together.  I first read a version with twenty chapters and then read the twenty-first; the book is great even with the absence of the final chapter, but that is what really makes it work.  Possibly my favorite book ever, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is hard to put down.	2004-02-17

The story basically tells of Alex, the main young thuggish proantaganist and the many crimes, violent acts, rapes and murders these malchicks particiapate in. The book really begins to take off and capture the reader after alex's droogs slam him over the head with a glass bottle, knocking him out during one of there many rape attempts and frameing him for murder. He is taken to jail by the millicents (police), he serves time and then is realeased for a scientific experiment. During the experiment Alex is forced to watch many short film clips in which people are being killed, and raped and such. As the clips flash on the screen he is administered a medicine in which the sight of violence and rape makes him sick, weak and powerless. Therefore enlisting that violence and rape are wrong, after awhile of this Alex is then released into civilization again and is considered \\"cured\\". In the original story, A clockwork orange ('resucked') the story continues revealing the future of our little teen thug. He grows up gets married and grows bored of those acts of rape and violence that once caught his attention so very much. As Anthony Burgess has said in the introduction of A Clockwork Orange Resucked, \\"Senseless violence is a prerogative of youth, which has much energy but little talent for the constructive.\\" It is in which the 21st chapter that this happens. 21 symbolizes maturity, where a child is no longer an adult and is therefore capable of making there own descions. The 21st chapter also shows moral growth, room for growth into good making little Alex no longer a clock work orange. A clockwork orange is a old british saying (He was as queer as a clockwork orange.) This is NOT meant to be demeaning towards homosexuals. This is just the way people spoke way back when.) To bea clockwork orange is to \\"have the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only be a clockwork toy wound up by god or the devil..or the almighty state.\\" On the subject of the movie, Stanley Kurbrick does no such justice to this phenomenal book. He has based his movie on the american novel only featuring the 20 chapters. The only thing i had a little trouble with was the break down of the futurized teenage slang 'Nadasat' which is russianified english. It is meant to be like this for a reason, as Burgess explains in the introduction, to make it sound as though muffled. Do NOT let the language scare you away from reading such an extraordinary story as this, it may seem hard in the beginning but you get used to it in time which is the same as with everything you do. If you do however begin to get discouraged the following site's glossary is made to help you out: [...]   <BR>I have given this story 5 stars because I believe it is an exceptionally genuis piece of literature novella.	2004-01-15

The only little throw back in the whole novel was the language. Sometimes it was hard to try and understand what Alex was trying to say with all that &quot;future slang&quot; but even that was so great about the book. A Clockwork Orange is such an original classic nobody to this day has written such a great book. I read the entire book in less than 24 hours. And after I read it I must have watched the movie at least 20 in one week. At the end of the book I acutally was &quot;Cured&quot; as Alex puts it I relized that making choices is such a great thing.

The first part introduces us to the teenager named Alex who is the narrator of the book.  He is the leader of a small gang in futuristic England until he gets caught for doing the ultimate crime.  The second part has Alex or rather prisoner 6655321 in jail.  In prison, he undergoes an experimental procedure that cures him of his violence.  Part three details what happens to the cured Alex after he gets out of prison.<br /><br />A streak of grotesque surrealism runs through this book especially in part one.  For example, as the gang of hoodlums drive to their \\"surprise visit,\\" they run over a big, snarling toothy thing that screams and squelches, and as they drive back they run over \\"odd squealing things\\" all the way.<br /><br />The most fascinating aspect of this book is the invented vocabulary or futuristic, teenage slang -- it has the effect of putting you in another world.  Alex thinks and talks in this slang.  A doctor in this book explains it: \\"Odd bits of old rhyming slang.  A bit of gypsy talk, too.  But most of the roots are Slav [or Russian] propaganda.\\"<br /><br />Alex as he narrates translates some of this slang.  I found that it is best to compile a running glossary so as to make later reading easier.<br /><br />At first the vocabulary seems incomprehensible: \\"you could peet it with vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom or one or two other veshches.\\"  Then, the reader discovers that some of the meaning is clear from context: \\"to tolchock some old veck in an alley and viddy him swim in his own blood\\" or \\"I kicked the chelloveck in the yarbles and he began to platch.\\"  The meaning of other words become known after a second context.  For example, when Alex kicks someone in the \\"gulliver\\" it might be any part of the body, but when a glass of beer is served with a gulliver, we then can deduce this word's meaning.  The meaning of other words becomes obvious as the reader progresses through the book.<br /><br />Another fascinating thing about this book is its contrasts.  For example, violence is connected with symphonic music especially the music of \\"Ludwig van.\\"<br /><br />This book is packed with various themes.  The prison charlie or chaplain exposes the central theme of the book in a series of questions to prestoopnick or prisoner 6655321: \\"What does God want?  Does God want goodness or choice of goodness?  Is the man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than the man who has the good imposed on him?\\"<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick's movie of the same name catches the book's essence.  However, the movie does not entirely get across the futuristic, nadsat or teenage slang so evident in the book.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a new kind of book.  I can't say I've read another like it.  But I can say that this book contains *** a zammechat razkazz that works for me!!

The teenage Alex and his band of \\"droogs\\" or friends roam around a futuristic, dystopian city, beating and robbing people with no remorse. When Alex is imprisoned he is chosen for an experimental procedure that will \\"cure\\" him of his violence, but also of his passion and creativity. <br />I like this book because no one is spared--both authoritarianism and anarchy are skewered. Burgess clearly believes it is a \\"sin\\" to force man to be good, but he does not think man is incapable of being redeemed. In an odd way, this book turns out to show a rather old-fashioned morality.<br />The book is 21 chapters long, but the original American edition left off the last chapter. This edition adds the final chapter, which changes the meaning and lessons of the book RADICALLY. If you have only seen the movie, which is adapted from the original American edition, you have not learned Alex's whole story! I am not sure if I prefer the book with the added chapter or without; you can decide for yourself which is more realistic.<br />Although much of Alex's speech is invented slang, adapted from Russian, we learn the meaning of the words quickly. However, despite the excitement and relative brevity of the book I had to take several breaks in reading, simply because pausing to decipher all the slang words gave me a headache. So don't expect to finish the book all in one sitting even if you are really enraptured by it. Definitely read it, though.	2003-11-13

At first I thought the book was just all fun and games but after Alex got sent jail I started noticing deep insite. The book is talking about choice, and how if you cannot choose what you want, then you are nothing.

He said the movie and book were both unbelievable, so i decided to give it a try.  I loved the book.  It is one of the few books that i love, and not one of the many that I like.  It is unique in its style, and content.  I loved the use of language by Anthony Burgess; it made me think about each event even more.  The story line was great, and i felt it had a positive message, even after all the violence that was incorporated into the book.  It tells of growing up and how being your own person is important.  I would recommend this book to anybody, preferably over the age of 14 because of the violence and use of language.  But i feel the message portrayed is important for people of all ages, and especially teenagers.  i rate it a five.	2003-10-24

That book is the worst anti-socialism propaganda ever written. It was as anti-capitalist as it was anti-communist and it appeared to make a point.<br />Burgess tells a tale that is anti-facism, anti-capitalism, andti-communism... anti-ism!! One of the more amazing novels written in the twentieth century, the fact that it is short and still brutally effective is its most amazing attribute. What Burgess has done with this novel is actually change the idea of what literature can be. He dances on the edge of de-construction without crossing over the line.<br />The language is incredibly anguishing to read, but at the end of the first few chapters, you realize that the effect of this &quot;translating&quot; that you have to do, you begin to think exactly like Alex. You feel complete empathy with his feelings. Its actually rather chilling when you think about it.<br />Anyone who enjoyed the way in which this novel was written should pick up &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; by William S. Burroughs.	2003-09-14

Burgess makes the typical black and white judgements more difficult for us.<br />But Clockwork Orange's genius is more than this. Burgess injects Russian words into his gang of toughs creating a lower class dialect . Knowing Russian makes the book much easier to read yet defeats the authors purpose- he wants the reader to determine the word meanings by context.<br />Clockwork Orange is a darkly comic work that stands as one of the best books of the twentieth century.	2003-07-19

Some of the language is hard to understand because the characters use slang from England in the 60's. Alex, the main character who narrates the book, is very interesting. He is the leader of a gang of his friends called the Droogs. Alex and the Droogs go on their missions nightly to drink milk laced with drugs, beat people up, steal from people and rape women. Parts of the book are somewhat disturbing, especially when he beats up an old man, but it keeps the reader riveted to the book. Once some one starts the book and figures out all the crimes Alex has committed you almost have to keep reading to see what he does next. This book has a lot of twists and turns and is very unpredictable. Clockwork Orange is a book that is great if you aren't scared to read it.	2003-07-11

This malchick here's got a couple of bolshie slovos to shazat to you all.  One of the many books in my biblio is A Clockwork Orange written by that Anthony Burgess veck.  It's the story of Little Alex and his droogs who go about shopcrasting, tolchocking other gang members with britvas and nozhes, as well as going on the surprise visit and having a bit of the old in-out, in-out with some hapless devotchka or what not.  His tyrannical ways becomes his undoing and his droogs turn on him.  He is sent to the Staja (state jail) on a murder charge, but that sentenced is commuted in exchange for taking part in \\"this new treatment that gets you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure that you never get back in again.\\"  But is that better than the traditional eye for an eye, as the prison Governor says?<br />The debate between good and evil is the bolshy theme here as explained in this passage comparing goodness and badness as different shops:  \\"If lewdies are good that's because they like it, and I wouldn't interfere with their pleasures, and so on to the other shop.  And I was patronizing the other shop.  More, badness is of the self, the one, the you or me on our oddy knockies, and that other self is made by old Bog or God and is his great pride and radosty.  But the not-self cannot have the bad, meaning they of the government and the judges and the schools cannot allow the bad because they cannot allow the self.  And is not our modern history, my brothers, the story of brave malenky selves fighting these big machines?\\"  The self against the machines.  Yes, we saw in the 1960's, my brothers.  But the quote also explains that we are all so full of what Christians call original sin, we want to go into that shop of badness, we enjoy seeing scenes of ultraviolence, people being tolchocked.  After all, it's easier to destroy rather than create, so it's no surprise despite having a decent pee and em raising him up, that our humble narrator dishes and gets dished the tortures of the damned.<br />Another bolshy theme pops up when the prison charles has a govoreet with Alex, who has just gotten the opportunity to undergo this Ludovico vesch that turns a malchick like himself good.  The charles says, \\"What does God want?  Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness?  Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?\\" Or still, \\"in a sense, in choosing to be deprived of the ability to make an ethical choice, [is to have] in a sense really chosen the good?\\"<br />The number of chapters also plays a significant role, like it did in Dante's Divine Comedy.  This book is divided into three sections, each of 7 chapters each.  Seven times three is twenty-one, which is the age at which someone reaches adulthood, and that last chapter was originally taken out of the American release of this book.  That's how the film directed by that Stanley Kubrick chelloveck ended.<br />And that's where I too end, oh my brothers, for a bit of spatchka.  I finish with a tall glass of the old warm moloko, \\"before getting my passport stamped...at sleep's frontier.\\", to spat perchance to sneety, but that's another work altogetherdecent pee and em raising him up, that our humble narrator dishes and gets dished the tortures of the damned.<br />Another bolshy theme pops up when the prison charles has a govoreet with Alex, who has just gotten the opportunity to undergo this Ludovico vesch that turns a malchick like himself good.

Anthony Burgess' predictions of the future (written in 1962) have not come far from the truth. This novel is a disturbing reflection on the basic structure of our society, on our government and on what it means to be good and evil. In a world where science has the power to turn flawed human beings into perfect machines, one must wonder whether it is moral to turn  sadistic individuals into a good doing robots for the sake of preventing crime.   <BR>Those of you who have seen Kubrick's film, read the novel just for the sake of finding out what the title means!<BR>If you do chose to read this book, make sure to read the European version, which contains the 21st chapter. Personally, I found the chapter to be unnecessary and unfitting to the dark tone of the novel. It seemed like a forced happy ending to a very dark story. It almost contradicts all the statements Burgess makes about the human race throughout the book. Nevertheless, I recommend that you read it anyway so you could make up you own mind.	2003-06-19

The message of independence, choice, and maturity hit hard and make the book one of the best. Shocking at times, for some it may be a little hard to take, but give it a try.

Burgess imagined some really smart steps with which Alex tried this. On the other hand the book made me think about \\"friends\\". How many \\"friends\\" in this world are there like Alex's? Or the other way around: what did Alex do that his friends thought they were right to do such things? I mean they betrayed him as they broke into the house of the old lady with the cats. Of course Alex wasn't exactly right playing the leader of the gang without knowing that his friends don't absolutely agree with him. But is this really enough to betray him in such a way? Or is it just the character of his friends to act this way? Still, it made me also think about the way they wanted to cure the criminals. Is this really a reasonable way?	2003-06-02

This book is where it all began, and it's just as poignant now as it was when it was first published.<br />When addressing the problems of crime, evil and violence, most people (conservatives and liberals alike), would prefer the \\"pop-the-pill\\" remedy of making people conform to the standards of \\"good\\".  Unfortunately, it's not that easy, and this book proves that.  Alex, the murderous droog, is put through a program that will remove the \\"evil\\" from him.  But as we eventually see, he's worse off without the ability to choose good.  Without his free will, he has become \\"a clockwork orange\\", because he does good not because he wants to, but because he has to.  Simply brilliant!<br />One problem is the \\"Nadsat\\" dialect it's written in.  Sure, it's ingenious use of language, but it gets old fast.  It does not detract from the book, however!  But the best thing in here is the fact that Alex, who commits rape, murder, assault, and theft, is a huge fan of classical music, especially Beethoven.  That oughta show \\"in-your-face\\" to those bozos who think rock and metal cause violence.<br />Read this book: prepare to be shocked.  And enlightened!	2003-06-01

I was looking for another book entirely; however the title caught my attention, I read the back, and forgot about the other book.<br />A Clockwork Orange is an amazingly well written book. Burgess' Alex narrarates the entire story using his made-up Nadsat (teenage) language. On reading the first sentence, I was like, &quot;What the heck is this?&quot; It left me completely confused, yet I promise you, that by (at most) the 5th page, you will understand entirely what is meant by viddy (see), metso (place), litso (face), nogas (feet), horrorshow (fantastic), so on, so on.<BR> Anthony Burgess takes you into the mind of a teenage boy and asks you whether or not a person who does only good because they have no other choice is better of than a person who chooses to do bad. It is amazing and leaves you thinking and laughing all at once. YES, you heard me, LAUGHING!

Reading this book, one cannot but be totally embedded in the sadistic mind of Alex, a trouble teen who'd like nothing more than to kick you in the teeth for doing absolutely nothing, like minding your own business on a street corner.  But this is anything but a mindless read. On the contrary. After being arrested, Alex is embarked on a Reclamation Program where the Government attempts to brainwash criminials by conditioning them to do good. The story veers into a serious exploration of the morality of free will: is it better to be evil and free; or good and without choice?<br />For the first part of the book though, expect very brutal and gruesome scenes of the crimes committed by Alex's gang (what he terms droogs).  These scenes would be very grim to read, if not for the inventiveness of the author who cleverly pens in a self-invented slang known as nadsat.  Queer words like viddy (see), slooshy (hear), horrorshow (good, fantastic), metso (place) and veshch (stuff) abound, so much so that the scenes become somewhat alien and bearable.  I suppose, nadsat is a really a double-edged sword.  Readers may be put off instantly after reading the first 2 pages. I guarantee you that most would come out scratching their heads, comprehending 20% at most. Take heart, push on - you won't regret it. A glossary would come in handy for sure, but that would rob the fun of deciphering the pecularities of the lingo. By the third chapter, the prose becomes much more fluid as readers grow accustomed to Alex's street talk. In fact, nadsat is so fundamental to the book - that's where we find Alex's voice and establish a connection to his character.<br />I would like to say that the book is funny (because it FELT funny) if not for the gravity of the crimes committed and the degree of suffering decked out by our hero's careless actions.  In Alex's voice, the wanton acts of violence seem \\"muted\\" - and thus, charming. One is not confrontedwith the carnage of the his brand of violence because everything is seen from his eyes and in time, you'll empathize with his pitiable state. It is little wonder that 'A Clockwork Orange' remains shrouded in controversy.  Nonetheless, this is a superb read, by any standard - short and sweet, morally substantial and totally out of this world. Go and buy this book!	2003-05-11

I have never seen the movie but had heard many awful things about it.  I was expecting a book without a purpose (as many described the movie to me) that graphically described countless horrific crimes and then ended.  I knew it couldn't be as bad as people described and still be so popular so I decided I would read it for myself.  I am happy to report that this book is nothing like what I expected.  <br />     The slang language used by the main characters of this novel serves two purposes to me.  First, it transports the reader directly to Burgess' futuristic world that quickly becomes frighteningly real while at the same time provides a sort of buffer that allows the reader, for some unknown reason, to still like Alex despite his tendencies toward terrible, violent crimes.  It is for this same unknown reason that I found myself appalled at the \\"cure\\" Alex was given in order to be released from prison.<br />     This novel poses several very intriguing questions.  I found the prison chaplain's view especially interesting.  \\"It may be horrible to be good.\\"  Is it better to choose to be bad or to be forced to be good?  Being good, or in this case, not doing bad things, doesn't make a person good when their inner thoughts are still bad.  The closest Alex gets to being good is not when he is physically kept from committing violent crimes but when he realizes, through his own reasoning, that there is more to life than violence and crime.<br />     There is much more to this book than graphic violence and crime, or even what I have briefly mentioned here.  The language of this book makes it one of a kind and the thought provoking questions it raises make it definitely worth reading.	2003-04-05

The story is about this boy that is growing up in England, living with his parents by day and trying to rule the streets by night.  The main character is named Alex and at night he rules the streets with his gang(droogs) causing chaos.  He loves to get his hand on money or pretty poly as he refers to it.  They have there own slang terms like rook which is hand and he uses the term, \\"O Brothers,\\" numerous times.  At night he would go around robbing people and taking part in violent acts.  Alex's dad suspected something when Alex brought home a lot of cash but, never accused Alex of anything.  One night while the droogs were taking part in these violent acts, the cops finally caught up with them.  Alex went to jail for the crimes that he had committed and was locked up at the age of fifteen.  Jail didn't do him any good.  There he even tried to fool the system by getting out early, but he wasn't ready to face the consequences of his actions.  There he under went a detox experiment, only they weren't taking the alcohol out of him but, the violent side of him and trying to make him more humain in society.  They finally release him back into society but he had nowhere to go and his family didn't really want him.  There he went back onto the streets of England.<BR>          I recommend this book because it settles all the hype that you hear about it but, I thought it would have been better than people said it was.  I've heard people say that this book was too gross for them to read and it gives them goose bumps but, it's all hype.  This book isn't as bad, if not less intense, as any movie out today.  I don't think this book should have even been band in the sixties because it not really that vulger.  This book was ok to read yet, it had its slower parts.  I think the best thing about this book was that you kind of had to decode some of the phrases that Alexwas trying to say.  This book reminds me of a Shakespeare play, in that the langue is hard to understand.  Unlike Shakespeare, you don't have to decode every line word for word, for the book to make sense. After a while you get a feeling for the langue that Alex's uses.  This is what I like about the novel, trying to figure out what the character was trying to say.  This made the novel better than it might have been.  If they had this choice of books in high school, I would have rather read a book of this nature,to prepare me for novels like Mac Beth.  If you think that you are going to read a novel filled with acts that are unheard, then maybe you should read another book.  There is only one major shocker when he breaks into this ladies home after playing a nasty trick on her.  This is a type of book that you should read through a second time to get the whole story, and to understand it completely.  My thoughts were that this book was going to be a type of story that was taboo but, it was about as bad as brutal as someone getting mug, which happens everyday.  Over all I would have to rate this book a five because I feel it didn't live up to the magnification	2003-04-04

I'm sure many people who own this book decided to buy it because of it's 'classic' status.  Those people are missing out on one of the best books I've read.  <br />What you'll find in this classic is a story about the youth of the future, teenagers intent on causing violence and chaos.  Full of characters who live to cause pain and death you can't help but feel a connection to these boys.  Even with their despicable traits they seem to be extreme manifestations of your impulses as a little child, the impulses that made you kick over the sandcastle your brother built, or mess up the hair on your sisters dolls.<br />That is part of the beauty of Mr. Burgess' writing.  If you met Alex and his gang in real life you wouldn't want to be around them, but in the context of the book they are just friends doing what boys do.  Instead of just giving gory details of their actions Mr. Burgess gives us more of a look into the personality of Alex, he gives us more than a violent youth, he gives us a person.  He gives us examples of the slang used by Alex and his buddies, a slang called Nadsat.  It all comes together to create an atmotsphere that really draws you into the book.<br />The book has a good pace, although there are some slow spots at the beginning and middle.  It really deserves 4.5 stars, but Amazon doesn't have fractions...<br />Anybody who enjoys a good book should really pick up this horrorshow (nadsat for great) read.	2003-03-27

The story shows a grim and dark \\"future\\", where free will is not something that is commonly seen as it is today. Alex, the main character in the story, is not the usual \\"hero\\". He is a cruel and evil man who rapes and kills people, which makes him seem more like a villain. But things happen which cause Alex to change. By the end he seems to have become his complete opposite. He no longer wants to kill, but to start over and even start a family.<br />The NADSAT is a very interesting tool that was used in the creation of this book. It is the futuristic form of slang that is used throughout the book. Like so many people say, it is difficult at first, but it does get much simpler as you progress through the book. The NADSAT adds a lot of flavor and makes things seem more \\"realistic\\". For those who just can't seem to understand the NADSAT there are glossaries in some of the books, and glossaries can also be found online. All you have to do is search using a search engine such as Yahoo or Google.<br />I recommend this to every reader whether young or old. It will work your mind in many ways and make you think of things that you never thought of before.	2003-03-17

Their world is one focused on ultra-violence; outrageously low performances of betrayal, as well as brutally untainted sadism. If one were to look deeper into this novel, beyond the despicable acts of violence, you would find that Burgess has posed several questions worth considering. Some of these points are especially disturbing. Alex, being the criminal he is, was brainwashed. He was supposed to be morphed into a person that would chose to behave morally in his society. This made me question whether or not a man who was restricted from his own free will could be considered moral and ethical, or if it has just made him a brainless sack of idiot. If one is rendered incapable of evil, would that make him better than a man who is evil because he chooses to be? Even more unsettling is to question if it is moral, in a sense of punishment, to confine a human being's free will to the point where he is a zombie? Furthermore, after this point of zombie-like moral restraint, are the remains a man, or something less than that? Burgess will have the reader fantastically engaged in all of the problems that lead one to contemplate these disturbing questions. Although this book is a complete horror show, all these issues are entirely worth considering. I liked it very much.	2003-03-17

The complex Russian slang (Nasdat) that was used in the book was very annoying at some parts but was also a very interesting technique used by the author to keep you very interested and locked in to what you are reading. Alex, the main character, and his droog friends were wreaking havoc during the night, also drinking milk that was spiked with hallucinogenic drugs. Eventually the cops caught up with the boy and he was the focus in an experimental punishment used by the government. He was sat down and forced to watch many horrible things in history. The hope was that after seeing all this horror, Alex would be so incredibly sickened that his crime days would be put to an end and he would be a much better citizen. Burgess really keeps you interested through out the entire book with some very clever language.<BR> There is an extremely high level of violence used through out the book. In my mind the violence is used for an extremely important reason. The way Burgess pounds the violence in to you, describing every detail, you begin to get a great idea of what this book exactly means. All of his ideas and points in the story are bashed into you when you hear about these nasty minor things that many other authors would leave out. The more you read, the more intrigued you are to find out why these boys could do such sick and disgusting things and just what punishment will be laid on them if any punishment will. All in all I was extremely pleased with what I got out of A Clockwork Orange. I would highly recommend the book to anyone with an interest in sci-fi.	2003-03-17

It took some time to adjust to the garbled Russian-English slang called Nadsat, and seeing as the paperback that I purchased didn't have a glossary of the lingo in the back, I spent less time following the story and more time making an effort to translate. After you figure it out, you'll definitely appreciate some of the dialogue.<br />The book follows a young no-good-nik, Alex, and his cohorts. The book begins with Alex and his `droogs' at a bar, where liquor isn't served, but milk, because the milk is laced with a plentiful variety of opiates and hallucinogens. Alex spends every night having fun, which, for him, means raping wives in front of their husbands, beating the daylights out of old vagabonds on the street, killing random people, and theft. He is morally a disgrace, but I really liked how honest he was as he narrated the story. When he is thrown in the slammer for two years, he learns about an experimental Government program for turning homicidal delinquents, like himself, into reformed, productive members of society. He tries it, since it'll get him out of jail in a fortnight, but he didn't know it involved a forced, VERY long viewing of different films of rape and violence, while being injected with nausea and pain-inducing drugs. The Government, arrogant in it's certainty of success of the experiment, thinks this will change his patterns of thought and that Alex will associate rape and murder with pain and vomiting, rather than thrill and ecstasy. Nonetheless, it seemed to cure him, and he was sent back out into the world, which more or less turned on him, driving Alex to attempted suicide.<br />A Clockwork Orange isn't a light read. The book provokes questions of whether or not a person should go through such a horrificprocess to become an upstanding citizen, or if he should be able to choose his path in life, being a lowlife or a decent person. Anthony Burgess writes with fantastic intensity, and the reader won't want to put the book down. The language in the book is imaginative and colorful, but I won't spoil it in the review.  This is definitely one of the century's great novels, and whether you like it or not, it'll at least give you something to think about for a while.	2003-03-17

There is a lot of crime in this futuristic world and not very much law...<BR> You may find that while you are reading this book there is a lot of vocabulary you've never seen or heard of before.  If you try to look these words up you will never find them in a dictionary.  This is because Burgess made up most of the language in this novel.  Some books are equipped with a handy glossary in the back.  Mine did not have one.  It is hard to understand at first but after a while you get used to it.  The new vocabulary is based on the Russian language.  It really offers a feeling of being in the future and knowing what it feels like to be there since it seems that you are reading the lingo of the future.  You should try not to use the glossary because it fun to figure it out on your own.	2003-03-17

I have read this book twice and I still haven't picked up all the details that its pages hold.  The gruesom and horrific acts within its covers make the mind run and hide from the idea of its possible truth.  Alex, the protagonist and his droogs commit rape, theft, assult, and even murder for the pure pleasure in it.  Most of this is covered up using a type of slang known as Nadsat.  Although the slang is sometimes hard to understand, it can be picked up quickly.  After being caught and forced to reform to society's standards of living(\\"Ludivico's Technique\\"), he tells the readers at the end his dreams to start a family as a younger man.  <BR>    Like in Orwell's 1984, this book brings up the question, \\"Do we want a society where the price of prosperity is the loss of our cherished rights; freedom of speach, press, religion, and even thought?\\"  Read \\"The Clockwork Orange\\" and feel the terror, the mind provoking feeling of a world that could be.	2003-03-01

It is reminiscent of Russian, with gutteral undertones and an English spin, and it is perfect for the characters in the book. While the violence in this novel is profoundly disturbing (made even more so by the words used to describe it), it is disturbing with a purpose. Without making the crimes of Alex (the main character, a violent 15-year-old) horrendous, the novel wouldn't pose such profound moral questions. While the reader is driven to hate Alex by the crimes he commits (which include ...torturing as a way of regular entertainment), the horrible treatment he is given by the government (which causes him to go into horrible spasms and fits of nausea at even the slightest thought of violence ...) inspires some sympathy for him, even if its only on the level of his being a 'victim of the state'. The question arises, should Alex be forced to endure this treatment as a way of 'purifying him', or should he be allowed to choose whether to be a psychopath or a good member of society?<br />Another theme arising in this novel is of the nature of human change and of violence being an activity primarily of youth. Unfortunately, you will not get any hint of this unless you read the book with the 21st chapter added on. Originally, the book was published in the US with this chapter hacked off (it is not featured in Kubrick's movie), but thankfully in subsequent additions it has been added and it really changes the meaning of the book.<br />So if you have a penchant for language and can handle 'a bit of the old ultraviolence', I would strongly recommend this book.	2003-02-27

During a botched burglary, Alex accidentaly kills an old woman and is sent to prison to serve a 14-year sentence. A couple of years into said sentence, his jailers offer him a proposition - sign up for this experimental treatment which only lasts for a few weeks, and you're a free man. Alex, of course, does just this, much to his later chagrin - it turns out that this treatment takes the notion of \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" to undreamt-of extremes.<br />The first thing that clues you into the fact that A Clockwork Orange is not your run-of-the-mill popular fiction novel is the Nadsat. It may seem intimidating at first (I know it was intimidating to me, to the extent that I waited several months after I purchased the novel to actually start reading it),  but it actually only takes a chapter or two until you get the hang of it. If you have trouble with it, simply do a search on Google on \\"Nadsat\\" - you'll find at least half a dozen links to Nadsat-to-English glossaries. <br />The other thing that stands out (once you dig in a little bit) is the book's thematic complexity. A Clockwork Orange asks many difficult questions, none of which have easy answers: To what extent are we willing to punish criminals? Why have we always felt the need to dehumanize them? And finally this: if a man no longer has free will, is he truly a man?<br />One to put on the \\"challenging reading\\" shelf, and highly recommended (by me, anyway).	2003-02-26

Burgess is a genius and this book is definetly on my list of everything I must read twenty times before I die.

The government, which has gone to the ultimate extreme to stop crime, is so real, I could picture the Minister and the Doctors myself. <BR>The transformation, which even I must admit, gets a little difficult to believe, is the perfect ending, which the Introduction explains so well, I can't even do justice to it or the book.

Regardless, I kept reading and in a few chapters I had picked up most of the vocabularly.

They steal, they rape, and they beat people.  All is well for Alex until he gets caught by the police.  He then undergoes experimental treatment at a correction facility.  This treatment was suppose to make it so he could no longer do harm; however, it doesn't all go exactly as planned.<br />This is a dark novel based a bit into the future where the night is run by villans such as Alex and his gang.

Or in plain English shoplifting, fighting, and sex. Burgess uses a truly unique language throughout the book. He literally made up an entire language of made up slang words. Although it was quite confusing at first, I found that by the end of the book not only did I understand the words but I was actually using them in everyday conversations. Burgess also brings up deep social questions. He made me question some modern day practices of punishment. I have learned more from this book than any other I have read before.

In a nighmarish future society every bit as scary as 1984 (and far more plausible, it now seems), Burgess thrusts us into the world of Alex and his three \\"droogs\\": a world of ultra-violence, shockingly base treachery, and pure sadism. However, as anyone who cares to dig deeper knows, what appears to be a mere feathers-ruffling shocker  poses forcefully insightful philosophical questions. The notion of crime and punishment - as well as more practical side issues such as prison overcrowding - has been perenially debated, but what about some of some of Burgess's more troubling points: if we can somehow condition criminals to refrain from violent acts by quite literally depriving them of free will, are we in the right? Do we now have a harmless, perfectly good citizen or a mindless stooge who cannot even defend himself? If we take away a persons's choice, even the choice to do evil, are we left with something less than human? And, even more thought-provoking, is a person who does not do evil only because of being physically unable any better than a person who does do it freely? Burgess tackles these and other issues with sheer abandon, brilliant writing, and truly original vernacular. As ground-breaking as the movie was and is, the book is even better. A must-read.	2003-01-07

Should prisons be used to punish, or to reform?  If they are used to punish then does the prisoner become a victim?  What about the victims?  Should they be allowed to have their revenge?  Also, what can be done about overcrowding?<br />The book was also full of lots of irony.  In having the main character facing many of his old victims in the later chapters, I thought it seemed very much like a Frank Capra type of movie.  However, instead of seeing how much worse life would have been like for all his friends and family if he had not been born, (like it was in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"), you get to see how badly the main character had affected all of his victims by coming into their lives.<br />This particular novel contains a controversial last chapter which differs from the version which Stanley Kubrick used to base his movie upon.  It seems that the last chapter was originally cut out of the United States version of the novel, and only the British novels had the last one.  Now it has been added back in.  I can't picture the movie having been any better by having added this extra chapter back into it, but it was good to read the novel the way the author had intended, and it works well in the book form.<br />After seeing the movie I was surprised to see how short the novel was (less than two hundred pages), but it was packed with excitement.  One of the best books I ever read.	2002-12-30

Having read some of Burgess other novels, I can only fathom what sort of talent he must have had to completely step outside his own norm in order to adopt a completely unorthodox presentation; focusing strongly on language, humanism, and plot.  His other works, Such As \\"The Doctor Is Sick\\" showcase his style of using alternate spelling of words to make them sound phoenetically like a certain dialect, where he even \\"spelled\\" out lisps in characters who spoke with them, almost as otomotopeia. In \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" this device is altered and taken to an extreme; here the words are all new, all unique derivatives of Russian and English syllables combined to form an intuitive language that the reader comes to understand while moving through the novella.<br />Burgess rationalizes the slang in his introduction of this book, stating that it was meant to make the almost overly-shocking or pornographic nature of it's content seem more acceptable, if that were possible. The slang is very hard to explain and very abstract at first, but once you settle in and get used to Alex's use of it, his words become second nature.  That if nothing else is true testament to Burgess' skill in crafting this \\"nasty little shocker.\\"<br />To summarize the plot in a few sentences, The story focuses on Alex, a teenager who lives in the near future where the streets are ravaged at night by violence and deviant teenagers.  Alex, the main character of the book, is such a teenager, and routinely commits acts of \\"ultraviolence,\\" including beatings, rapings, burglary, you get the picture.  He finally pushes his luck too far and commits an act, and then is incarcerated.<br />This is just the beginning few events in the novella, and I don't want to ruin the experience should you decide to read it.<br />This book brings several issues to the reader's attention in terms of how we percieve our own inalienable rights as humans.

They seem to put it in the same category as 1984 and brave new world and books like that. Fro me this book was closer to The catcher in the ryre or lor dof the flies than it was to those books. I actually dont see this as a political novel at all so much as a novel about youth and growing older and how adults will want to change you when your a teenager. Thats what it was about to me. Aside from that, this book has alot of symbolism i think the entire novel could also be seen as a metaphor for how christian missionaries used to convert indians to christianity and then send them back to theyre country,changed forever.

Set in a futuristic world where \\"malchicks\\" spend their nights prowling for unsuspecting victims to mutilate and/or torture, the story revolves around a young man named Alex and his \\"droogs\\". The gang of teenagers begins the evening with a milk-plus at the Korova milkbar, followed by a thirst for violence which is satisfied by breaking into houses and beating the inhabitants to near-death while destroying everything tangible, or \\"tolchocking\\" a starry (old) veck (man) or two that they may come across on the dark city streets. But, as is suspected, all is not well in Alex's world. The self-proclaimed leader of his gang, whose faith in him is failing, eventually causes a revolt of sorts. Alex is left, at the scene of one of their crimes, to be caught by the police.<br /> Alex is locked up after being given the usual brutality, and soon is carrying a long sentence with him. After some trouble in the cell which he shares with five other men, Alex is yet again fed to the wolves, so to speak, when he is blamed for the death of an inmate. At this point he is brought forth as a candidate for the experimental \\"Ludovico's Technique,\\" and it is at this point that the motive of the story surfaces. In the battle between good and evil, to what extent should the willingness to do good be imposed upon the members of society? At what cost should the government interfere with it's citizens' urges and desires? In the end, it all comes down to a moral standpoint, and the question of whether a man without free will is really a man at all.	2002-10-06

Alex est arrêté et incarcéré relativement aux crimes qu'il a commis.  En prison, on lui propose une cure, la méthode Ludovico, qui, en quelques semaines, fera du monstre qu'était Alex, un humain fondamentalement bon.

I read this book in high school on the suggestion of a friend. I have grown up a little since then and I have read a lot of great books since but through them all Clockwork Orange still would have to be my favorite. It is violent, yes, which is probably why I liked it so much in high school, but it has a sense of humor also. Probably the first dark comedy I've read.  <br />To tell the truth I had to read the first couple of pages over after figuring out the clever russian/cockney slang Burgess uses. I had never read a book before where the author trusts the reader enough to make up his own language, which what makes this book stand out in my mind. I have not come across another book since that lulls me into the story like Clockwork Orange has.<br />I don't want to get into a movie review but I feel both the movie and book are great which doesn't happen very often. If you like a happier ending with a brighter outlook you have the book and if want a darker ending you have the movie.<br />Through all the books I've read throughout the years this one is my favorite.	2002-08-30
US	51320210	R2IBQK3XZLRU8K	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Literary classic	This is a simply superb American novel, as disturbing as it is riveting.  <br />The novel follows Alex and his troupe of marauding friends as they happily go about murdering, stealing and terrorizing in their superviolent world of the not-too-distant future.  Burgess tells the story from Alex's point of view, giving the reader tremendous insight into the sadistic and troubling inner-workings of the \\"protagonist's\\" mind.  This choice of narrative point of view has an interesting effect: while the reader can't help but be disturbed by the senseless violence perpetrated by Alex and his posse, readers will find themselves actually caring for and understanding Alex (most of us have at least a little bit of Alex in us).  <br />When Alex is finally arrested for his horrible crimes, the government seeks to inflict its own version of violence upon him, trying to reprogram his perversely violent mind into the mind of a peaceful, law-abiding citizen.  The moral implications are obvious and troubling: can society violate someone's free will to make them peaceful and good?  <br />The novel is perhaps most famous for the futuristic slang language (\\"Nadsat\\") that Burgess interweaves throughout the dialogue.  The use of this language may be a bit confusing at the very beginning of the novel, but Burgess eases the reader into it, making it easy to understand quite quickly.  Some readers may need to read sections a few times initially to get comfortable with the vocabulary. Despite this smattering of peculiar words, the book reads surprisingly fast.<br />Many people are more familiar with Stanley Kubrick's famous on-screen adaptation of this novel but it is important to note that this edition of the book contains Burgess' original 21st chapter which was omitted from the first US editions and from Kubrick's movie version. <br />All in all, this is a fantastic novel that will present readers with multitude of emotions.  At times the book can be horrifying, at other times, heart wrenching, and at other times, downright funny.  The novel's plot is certainly strong enough to stand on its own, but what makes the book a classic is its thought-provoking attempt to examine the role of free will and the role of society in promoting good, regardless of the costs.	2002-08-20

I first came across this book in a box filled with musty old books like it, and as soon as i opened it's pages, i could not put it down. I have since read it approximatley 20 times. This is my favorite book of all time! Burgess takes you on the horrorshow journey of Alex and his four droogs (friends) and all thier violence, rape, and total sadisim. When double crossed, Alex (who is 15 in the book, 12 in the movie, if i'm not mistaken) is eventually is used as the first test subject in an experimental reform process, in which he cannot even think about violent acts without getting terribly ill. He is then thrown out into the real world where he must face all of his victims, who still haven't forgotten, or forgiven, who he was. Burgesses' story of inborn goodness vs forced goodness in one's own personality is a tale you soon won't forget. While some people found it tiresome, if you love a challenge, this book is filled with new foreign words, and do not be surprised if you must read lines over and over again to get their full comprehension.

This is mainly because I consider A Clockwork Orange to be one of the most painful, brilliant, and disturbing stories ever to be put down on paper. The invented slang used by Alex and his \\"droogs\\" is one of the best parts of the book. You'd think that the slang would make it confusing to read, but it doesn't! In fact, it's strangely catchy. They call it \\"nadsat\\" and it's a kind of Russified English. And I don't even speak Russian. (Burgess later invented \\"caveman speak\\" in Quest For Fire.) <br />The basic plot follows Alex and his gang of sadistic young punks as they run amok, beating, raping, and murdering with gleeful abandon in the London of the near-future. They then retire to a bar to drink drug-enhanced milk and plot their next crime. Eventually, Alex gets caught and is subjected to the will of the State. He's forcibly deprogrammed with the \\"Ludovico Technique\\" in which he's strapped to a chair, his eyelids held open by metal clamps, and forced to watch a long movie of non-stop murder, rape, torture, and other horrible violence until he gets physically ill at the mere thought of such acts. Then he is thrown back on the streets, a declawed kitten at the mercy of his former victims. The American re-edition is published with the controversial twenty-first chapter not included in Kubrick's film, plus an introduction by the author called \\"A Clockwork Orange Resucked.\\"<br />Unfortunately, it's a sad reflection on society in that Alex was shunned because of his violence, and when caught, had violence inflicted on him in order to make him stop. This extremely graphic novel received mixed reactions, either hailed as genius or dismissed as violent pornography. I would recommend the movie as well; it's visually inventive and a must-see from one of the world's greatest directors.	2002-07-25

Does society have the right to overpower evil for the sake of good by taking away one's right to choose? The book explores the difficulties of reconciling the conflict between individual freedom and social order.<br />Alex, the story's protagonist is a child of the corrupt totalitarian society. He acts out the evil crimes against society without thought of retribution. Are there limits to which society should go in maintaining law and order? Should society do the wrong thing for the right reason, even though it frequently does the right thing for the wrong reason? The state's attempt to eliminate evil is an assault of the self because goodness is no virtue if it has not been chosen.<br />The fundamental reasoning of the book is that free will defines humanity and represents the curtailment of choices as intrinsically wrong. A Clockwork Orange reprehends behaviorist conditioning for its infringement of free will. The story is a very thought provoking read. It not only addresses issues of good and evil but what is good without evil. One needs to look beyond the sex and violence to grasp the intense meaning of the story.	2002-07-24

This edition of 'A Clockwork Orange' begins with a scathing criticism of the publisher by Burgess that I applaude. In the Author's note, Burgess describes how the original Novella as published in the UK consisted of 21 chapters. When Burgess attempted to publish the book in the US, the publisher felt it was within his providence to omit the 21st chapter, calling it a \\"sell-out\\". He continues to explain that not only did the 21st chapter provide a certain degree of numerical resonance, but that the concluding chapter contained his vision of the book's ultimate lesson. A lesson of change that is completely rendered impotent by the 20th chapter if left alone. Clearly riding on the book's success (and of course the Kubrick film that truly popularized his work - and was based only on the American '20-chapter' version), Anthony Burgess finally laughs loudest at the end of this disagreement. His attack on the publisher (who clearly still has rights to the book and is compelled by money to continue to market it) is so harsh that the publisher feels compelled to place a tiny little \\"Publisher's Note\\" after the \\"Author's Note\\" that basically says \\"I'm sorry\\" in a watered down and spineless way. It's easily the best introduction to a book I have ever experienced. <BR>   <BR>The story's heart is dark and disturbing. Centered around a troubled 15 year old named Alex who narrates the book from the first person, is an account of violence and pleasure. 'A Clockwork Orange' raises serious questions about the anatomy of evil in an extreme depiction of the 'Nature versus Nurture'argument. By default, Burgess compells the reader to question what is the anatomy of good as well - a phrase that doesn't roll off the tounge as easily because it is never used. <br />But the real genius of this novella is the imaginary cockney dialect that Burgess creates to convey his message. It took me three chapters of slow, difficult reading. But by the fourth, I had adapted to the new vocabulary, understood the new language, and could read as smoothly as if I was reading my own words. A subtle and powerful lesson that makes Burgess' point about nurture all that more profound. <br />The violence is what keeps you reading when the language is difficult, the going is slow, and the images are at times nauseating. Why?	2002-07-15

Instead I found it to be quite predictable and ordinary.  The protagonist, Alex, is nothing more than a posing hooligan trying to fit in with his \\"crowd.\\"  His brand of violence is not really shocking in this, the 21st century.  He is merely a victim of peer pressure.  The only thing that sets him apart and adds a slight air of menace is that he embraces a lot of different types of violence - from rape to beatings to petty theft.  He is not a true believer of his own world, though, with his reluctance to pull off true crimes in the form of burglary and out-and-out murder. And his supposed shocking \\"rehabilitation\\" is simply aversion therapy.  The last \\"lost\\" chapter is neither a shocker nor a surprise and I really don't see any significance in it at all other than the numeric importance to the author.  Sort of a cop out - time heals all wounds... and psychopaths.  I will grant that the slang language invented by Burgess is a very good tool for transporting the reader into the \\"droog\\" world.  Otherwise, I don't see the fuss over this predictable novella.	2002-07-07

The author created a slang language in it that was a mix of cockney and russian slang.  The outcome is a funny yet disturbing piece of prose that at times reads like poetry.  It is vicious with a point.  The author is fighting a conflict between being evil or being good because you have no choice.  It reminded me of the Catholic religion and Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil.  Are you being good because you are afraid of the consiquences of being bad or are you being good because it feels like it is the rite thing for you to do.  Living life as you see it should be lived.  You don't kill or rape because a Religious law tells you it is sin; instead you don't do these things because you know that they are wrong.  This is what Nietzsche called living beyond good and evil.  And it has neve being better protrayed than in this book.  A clock work orange.	2002-07-03

By writing A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess created one of the most disturbing novels that I have ever read.  It begins with our most humble narrator, Alex, living his teenage years as a drug-addicted bugular and rapist.  Alex and his friends commit crimes for fun and see nothing wrong with their incredibly violent ways.  When eventually Alex is caught by the police and put in the State Jail, he is entered into a program that will supposedly 'cure' him of his violent actions and allow him to go free.  The question is, though, does someone actually become 'good' when their free will to make that choice is taken away?  Which is worse: choosing to do wrong or being forced to choose good?  Burgess really makes you think about that idea as Alex's life progresses after he goes through the cruel procedure to 'reform' him.  I would definitely recommend reading this book to anyone, as long as they are prepared for a lot of violence and gore (as well as Burgess' invented slang that Alex and his friends use - it takes a little while to get used to).  What's it going to be then, eh?  Go read A Clockwork Orange and get ready to think about a lot of stuff you never have before.	2002-05-30

The first thing you'll notice about this story is that it is written in a imaginary slang. This slang is called \\"nadsat\\" or teenage talk. The story is divided into three parts. In the first part, it outlines how Alex goes around and terroizes the town until he is caught. The second part tells about his life in prision and the new experimental technique he agrees to take place in. The third section is about how the procedure changes Alex's life and how he responds to this. This is a very good story about good and bad and how far the government may go one day to correct the evil ways of people. I gave this story four stars only because it took about half the book to understand the complex slang. But in terms of plot, development, and language, this story is tops	2002-05-23

Alex goes around raping, stealing, and even murdering in this novel based in the future. He is later caught and taken to jail for the murder of a old woman.

The experiment is supposed to make the criminal forget all their criminal tendencies and turn them into a peaceful citizen. Alex thinks this will be his way to escape from prison but in the end it turns Alex's world into an even bigger nightmare.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an easy read, a book that will keep your attention, and keep you turning pages.

Burgess thrilled me with his potrayal of the young, thuggish protagonist Alex in the 1960s in England.  Alex is a teen who gets his kicks out of extreme violence and destruction. Living his life with blood and women, his many murders eventually catch up with him.  After Alex is abandoned by his friends and put in jail, he asks to be the first to try the new experiment.  This new experiment Burgess has created is horrifying and at some points unreal.  It is a great book for those interested in human pyschology and the struggle between good and evil.	2002-05-13

Not only was the main character/narrator's, Alex, lifestyle portrayed specifically throughout the novel, it was greatly astounding to be noticed as a life worth meaning and acknowledgement.  Alex's life was one of violence, a typical hooligan's life who grows up with gangs and other such bad influences.  There is a dramatic change in the course of the novel from it's beginning which keeps the excitement up, because I have to admit, the beginning is redundant with the amount of violence displayed.  The twist in the plot is ironic and surprising.  There is meaning behind all the slang Borgess speaks with through Alex.  If you are a person who is able to find meaning if small areas of life and depict reality from the real world, I suggest this book.  It gives one a purpose, a meaning to look for between the lines of this book.  It keeps one entertained by creating a desire to know what happens to Alex.  The end gives one a sweet sense of satisfation although the ending is nothing you could ever imagine.  Enjoy.	2002-05-06

After a string of crimes, Alex is betrayed by his companions and winds up sentenced to over a decade in prison. After two years behind bars, he is given the opportunity to be the subject of a new experimental theraphy, \\"Ludovico's treatment\\", which would have him cured and a free man in a mere two weeks. Alex loses his criminal tendencies, but Burgess asks, \\"At what cost\\"? After this setup, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE goes on to examine what stripping a person of his free will would mean for him and society.<br />A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is also the reaction of a Briton against communist governments, this book was obviously written in the early 1960's. The administration which seeks to tame Alex seems benevolent, but there are signs of growing despotism. In foreboding one passage, a prison official expresses his hope that Alex will leave the prison, as the space will soon be needed for political prisoners. The dialect that Alex's generation speaks, Nadsat, is a mixture of Russian and English words, and shows a Soviet influence on this future England. This makes the book feel somewhat dated, my reason for giving it four stars.<br />A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is written in Alex's dialect, and nearly every sentence has Russian words written as they sound to English ears. However, this is rarely a problem, as Burgess gives sufficient context to quickly understand such common words as \\"glazzies,\\" \\"pletchoes\\", \\"tolchock\\", and \\"devotchka\\". The Russian words are nearly all extremely common anotomical terms, so for those who want to be certain about every word of Nadsat, any small Russian dictionary will do.<br />Stanley Kubrick's 1972 film of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE went on to become popular, buut be aware that the book is a very different story. Kubrick based his film off the original American edition of the book, which lacks the crucial final chapter in which Burgess reveals a suprising plot turn, which reverses much of what came before. Thus, the book and the movie have totally opposite messages. The book is also more graphic than the movie. While the movie has Alex in a tryst with two teenage girls, the original scene from the book has him molest two ten-year olds after shooting heroin. Thus, for those sensitive to explicit content, the book may be more objectionable than the movie, although the book's thick dialect and sparse detail does not have the force of actually seeing such things in a movie.<br />A CLOCKWORK ORANGE may appeal to those intrigued by the moral dilemma it presents. It is also suprisingly entertaining for new students of Russian, as this reviewer found. If you enjoy A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, I'd recommend going on to Burgess' work 1985, in which he examines George Orwell's work 1984 from a viewpoint closer to that year, this book is somewhat of a continuation of several themes of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE went on to become popular, buut be aware that the book is a very different story.

In what should have been a sickening foray into the dark underbelly of the surreal crime world, Burgess leads his readers to find the essentiality of choice and the importance of living life for the good and bad.  Although many graphic images can have a stomach-turning effect on the reader, the overall motive of the book remains intact through the clever use of language and subtle humor.  What is unique to this book is the way in which the reader may choose how he would like it to end by simply ignoring the addendum of the last chapter or reading on.  Depending on this choice, the book can mean very different things, and that is a feature not found in many other works.  There are books that are worth reading for their social commentary, others for their wit, and still others for their surrealism; A Clockwork Orange is truly all of these and more.  It is a must-read for anyone who loves true literature.	2002-04-29

One of those rare occasions is Anthony Burgress 1962 transgressive classic, A Clockwork Orange. At first, the tale of Alex, a malicious, young degenerate of the future, seems like a warped, little shocker, full of madcap language, malevolent intentions and stomach-turning violence. As the novel progresses, though, it is soon evident that Mr. Burgess is carefully surveying an important subject matter: juvenile delinquency. Through portrayals of Alexs parents, he comments on Dr. Spock-style principles. Through portrayals of the government and prison system, he comments on what type of society produces these baby-faced killers (One as amoral and creative as the delinquents themselves). And through the main characters vivid naration he explores the surprisingly human thoughts and motives behind this appalling behavior. Most often when one walks into a theater, turns on the TV or opens a novel and squeems, the said medias creators are attempting to vend cheap thrills. But not always. Mr. Burgess brilliant and alarming book and the stunning Stanley Kubrick film based upon it are instances when true artists looked the seedier side of human nature in the face and produced poignant works of art from their observations.	2002-04-23

The novel, A Clockwork Orange, firmly states \\"No!\\"  <br />Although the main character, Alex, is ultraviolent in manner and his horrorshow activites make readers cringe, it is his choice to behave in this nature, no matter how shocking it may be.  Once he becomes programed to behave according to the laws and moral restrants, then he becomes a tool and is manipulated to the point that he is less of a human being.<br />I'm not going to go into any more specifics of the novel because they have already been firmly stated by previous reviewers.  However, I will say that I have not seen the movie version of the novel and frankly do not see how it could acturately portray the author's true intentions without the twenty-first chapter.  The final chapter makes the novel, in some sense, an allegory of youth and shows that people are not clockwork--they are not machines that solely follow the forces of good or evil.  Instead, people are living beings who do not necessarily follow a set path in life.  <br />A great book.  I only wish that I hadn't burned through the whole 192 pages in two days.	2002-04-01

Burgess's novel beats the movie 100 x's more (and Kubrick's film happens to be my #1 favorite movie as well so that means I really love this book). The book is alot more sickening and explicit than the film , you really get a feeling of nausea while reading it...and that hasn't happened with any other book i've read. While the film loaded it with artsy filmaking and a bizzare musical score. The book is an energetic bleak look into sadism and ultraviolence. Droogs who violently rape and pillage their community without sympathy and care..just for the sick pleasure of it speak in nadstat style of slang that is very difficult to understand while reading , but it contains a handy glossary. Alex leads this group as the humble narrarator is sent to be reformed by the government in which he can no longer choose violence , but his victims can. Burgess ask \\"what cost?\\" and \\"whats the price we pay for conformity\\". However unlike the movie , the film's final and until the reissue was ommitted ending features Alex looking back on his life and wanting a family of his own. Through all his tolchoking and nastyness he is human afterall which was the message all along. Alex was human and if he stayed \\"reformed\\" he would have been nothing more than \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" ripe and healthy on the outside , mechanical and programmed on in the inside..leaving him freedomless and without choice..which the government has no right to do.

The narrative flow and the story itself are confoundedly magnificent. Yes, I too love A Clockwork Orange.<br />Here is a story of free will versus society; a devastating critique onindividual human nature and an even harsher attack on the ultimately Fascist attitude of any organized system of justice.<br />In a mildly Science-Fiction-style plot we go forward to the parallel near future where politics have taken over ever aspect of human life. Even thoughts can be controlled and the punishment shall always fit the crime. We, the reader, are forced to choose sides between a violent, anarchist, sociopthic rapist-murder, and the oppressive State Government that will force the mind to suppress thoughts, to suppress all human desire in an effort to make certain that everyone will be safe in their homes, out-of-sight--<br />The arguments are beautifully placed and here, ten years after I've read it, the passion and power of the debate still lingers, fresh. (On a brief side-note in relation to Kubrick's wonderful film adaptation: I love Stanley Kubrick and A Clockwork Orange is, depending on my mood at the time, perhaps my favorite of his flicks; but the book diverges into even more decadent and intense realms, and forces one to actually experience the events in your mind, not transposed on a visual plate, and you experience the horror even more viscerally than the romanticized extravagence of the film)	2002-03-03

I have never seen the film, but from what I had heard about it I was a bit apprehensive about picking this piece of literature up.  But for whatever reason, I did, and I am sure glad of it.<BR>     This is the bleakly futuristic tale of Alex, a young droog who loves doing the ultraviolent,  razdrazzing others, peeting milk-plus in seedy mestos and slooshying Beethoven.  He and his three other droogies wander the streets when the sun goes down, looking for a chance for some twenty-to-one, and rarely are they without a decent find.  One fateful noche, however, he is taken by the millicents to the staja where he gets by on his oddy knocky day in and day out.<BR>     <BR>     What?!<BR>     <BR>     Written in a beautifully brutal dialect (something of a combination of slang english and russian), Burgess leaves the reader to figure out that Alex, a young hoodlum, loves to rape, kill, drink halucinogen-laced milk, and listen to classical music.  However, when he is caught one night, he is taken to prison where he dwells for 2 years.  However, he learns of a new treatment that will get him out of jail in a fortnight.  This treatment is the creation a connection in his brain between sickness and violence by making him watch violent films (i.e. holocaust documentaries, interestingly enough) after given a shot that makes him yearn to vomit.  The state, in all of its arrogance, releases young Alex into a world where his actions come back to haunt him.<BR>     Thus, the book asks:  is it better to be bad on your own free will, or to be good without free will (a clockwork orange)?<BR>     Perhaps one of the most redeeming characteristics of this novel is the likeability of \\"your humble narrator.\\"  Remarkably, Alex is quite a sympathetic character, if you can put aside all of the atrocities he commits nightly.  You wholeheartedly root for him until the end, although you are not sure why.  I am:  it's the magic of Burgess' writing.  <BR>If you can stomach a little literary violence and a great philophical quandary, packed in with a message of maturity and hope, this book is for you.

Obsessed with violence and not caring what happened to other people, so involved in himself/themselvs he didn't even care he was hurting the people who cared for him like his parents and even his \\"droogs\\".  I think the message in this book is that no matter what happens that people will always eventually grow up and that even people who might seem happy still have dreams that could make them really happy and not just seem happy on the outside.

Quite simply put, it is a not too distant future of ours. As technology breeds increased comfort and increased isolationism, it also breeds racism, hatred and desensitization. This near 40 year old book really captures this feeling, daring to the reader to attempt to define 'free will' in a world in which all images and content are provided for you and have a singular semiotic meaning. In light of our all too common subway shootouts, our random executions and a penal system spiraling out of control (all things happening relatively recently), it is amazing that Burgess could so accurately cast a world of rave clubs, X, random abuse and Ikea furniture.<BR> <BR>     This version has the 'controversial' 21st chapter, and let me say the controversy really lies on the choice of the idiot editor who removed it in the first place.

Yet there is not just the forewarnings of doom seen in the writings of other dark future writers, but also a slightly hidden but wonderful sense of wit and humor.<br />In the American re-edition called the intro &quot;A Clockwork Orange Resucked&quot; and complained bitterly about what Kubrick did with the movie.  More likely than not he was proud but just angry with Kubrick's leaving out the final chapter of the book, as he mentions.<br />Burgess looks at the darkest impulses of humanity, and the out of control attempts that society goes to in order to rectify and &quot;cure&quot; the social deviants.  This is not just a dark future, but also a warning to us about the course that our reform programs seem to be heading towards.<br />Gritty, dark, somber and somehow always cleaver, this mini novel is a must read for everyone.  Burgess flourishes with his mastery of how language works and employs his gifts as a linguist to bring out a colorful sub-culture lingo that has evolved (within the context of the book) from the reasonable and normal perversions of every day speech to the language.<br />Burgess said that there were other books that he would rather have been remembered for.  &quot;A CLockwork Orange&quot; brings modern readers to the late Burgess' prose and leaves us interested to go on and see some of the wealth that inhabits the rest of his writing.	2001-12-18

It is the story of Alex, a member of a gang in a future Britain.  Alex goes around amassing destruction, robbery, rape, and murder to his criminal record before being betrayed and sent to jail, where he undergoes a controversial treatment.<br />This treatment is a basic exercise of Pavlov's conditioning in which Alex is taught to hate everything he loves, so that he could leave the institute within two weeks of arriving there.  Unfortunately, nothing turns out the way Alex wanted.<br />A Clockwork Orange is a very good book on realizing why we are the way we are.  Because of Alex's loss of choice, we learn through Burgess a great deal about how being able to do bad things is so important.<br />The only deterrent to reading this book is the amount of violence, drug-taking, rape, and other things that might be found on a FOX tv show, which were banned worldwide at the time it was published, in the 1950's.  If you thought Catcher in the Rye was a immoral book, I wouldn't recommend this, but for those who can stomach the violence to realize the point are well worthy of reading this book.<br />This version of A Clockwork Orange is almost the same as the American version, except that it has a foreword written by Burgess himself, as well as the last chapter which was not published in America.  This book is a very good read, and a great addition to the avid reader's library.<br />Two thumbs up!	2001-12-16

The author jumps right into the story and gets his readers hooked. The strongest aspect of this book is the appeal of the story line. The other elements that contribute to the books sucess are foreshadowing, different dialects and the strong characters.

Also the well developed characters add a new dimension to the book.<BR> This book intrests, appalls, and stuns all at once. The actions of the narrator and his frinds are often so extremely violent it's sickening. The concept that is the hardest to swallow is how the characters of the book could act so horribly. The book takes a deeper look at what youth is coming to. All the extreme actions that are taken all to entertain this young man through out the book takes a good hard look at the narrators psyche.

However, I might be able to express the importance of this book, and perhaps you'll even want to read it when you've finished my review.<br />I may have started out reading A Clockwork Orange because my friend told me how good it was. And then I continued to read it because it was engaging, disturbing, and thought provoking. Even though the book was written over 30 years ago, I believe it is still as powerful today as it was back then; perhaps even more so. Alex, the protagonist, is almost innocently committing violent crimes with his friends; for he isn't -trying- to be bad, he just is. He likes violence, and that's the way he is.<br />When Alex's friends gang up on him and leave him to be arrested by the police, Alex is sentenced to 14 years in prison. But then the opportunity to change presents itself to Alex, and he can't help but take the offer. Without ruining the story as so many previous reviewers have already done, I can say that when everything is said and done, important questions arise: is being good truly good if it is not by choice? Is it good to be bad, if that is what one chooses?<br />The book first came out in the 60s, and the American version lacked the last and 21st chapter from the original story. When it was republished, the book had the 21st chapter. Depending on which copy you read, with the last chapter or without it, the book will have an entirely different feel to it. The old copy represents the horrible realization that bad minds are always bad; the newer version leaves the reader with hope. Hope for Alex, and hope for oneself. Change is possible, the book says, no matter what sort of person you are.<br />A Clockwork Orange is truly a great work, one that will appeal to people for different reasons; and affect them in completely different ways. But it will affect them.	2001-11-28

One version, the one originally created by Burgess, has changed many lives for the better and fulfilled many people's views of society and culture.  The other version, the one published in America, is an incomplete and bastardized version of Burgess's original.  The ending is changed 100% because the American publishers left the last chapter out of the book.  <br />Burgess wrote the book in a format of 3 parts with 7 chapters apiece to add up to 21 chapters.  The story is about a boy named Alex who grows up defying society and its laws.  Without the final chapter of the book the true ending, and the true future of Alex's fate, is not revealed.  Many people who have read this version are left feeling ill and doubtful about the direction of youth.  <br />Burgess also created his own language (Nadsat) in the writing of this book.  It is slang that the characters use (many of the words are based from Russian) and is easilly tripped over in the beginning.  It took me two hours to read the first twelve pages of the book (using the glossary in the back), but after that I could read it easily.  <br />I hope this review helps you in making your selection.  Good luck, and happy reading.	2001-11-22

This is a book about a boy named Alex whose interests are rape, ultra-violence, and classical music. He and his droogs are in a gang that goes around and indulges in these things. They enjoy drinking milk laced with drugs to sharpen them up for a bit of ultra-violence. This novel is very brutal but the nadsat seems to be a buffer for the brutality. After Alex breaks into a house and beats and old woman his gang members abandon him and leave him beaten, with a chain, for the millicents (police). He is entered into a criminal rehabilitation program. Now when he thinks of the things he used to love he gets sick. This book is one of the greatest pieces of English liturature ever and was even made into a film by Stanley Kubrick. If you want to know what happens to Alex, read the book. This edition includes the 21st chapter which was originally excluded in the original American release. A highly recommended novella.<br />P.S. The nadsat is really cool. After picking up the book with my rookers and viddying it with my very own glazzies I was impressed with Burgess' masterful use of nadsat. EXCELLENT!	2001-11-13

It deals with a teenage boy named Alex who lives in England. And when night comes, he and his teenage &quot;droogs&quot; or friends (in Russian) go out and wreak havoc on the city. During one of the groups ultra-violent encounters, Alex accidently kills an old woman. To add up on to the incredibly frustrating situation for Alex, his friends betray him and leave him to be for the police. Stuck in prison, Alex wants to get out as quickly as possible. He starts to suck up to the warden by reading the bible and trying to be &quot;friendly&quot; to be let out earlier than the original sentence of 14 years. Since Alex is 15 at the time of his sentence. To go through his entire sentence, he would be 29 at the age of his release. Alex finds out about a certain technique that is used on prison inmates to make sure that they get out of prison and never return. Almost drooling, Alex finds himself very interested in getting out of prison. He volunteers to have himself as a test subject for the technique. The basic procedure of the technique is to give the patient a certain drug that makes that patient extremely sick. The doctors and scientists then strap down the patient in front of a screen and hold back his eyelids by tape so that he would be brainwashed in a way. Watching the most violent and gruesome of films, Alex is slowly brainwashed to a state where anything that has to do with violence in Alex's mind would automatically engage a very nauseating and stressing feeling makeing Alex extremely sick. After two weeks of the procedures, Alex is let out of the hospital where he was being &quot;treated&quot; and &quot;cleansed.&quot; Alex is then rejected by his parents, by his friends, and by his earlier enemies. Being beaten by those who he hurt before prison, and being extremely exauhsted, Alex comes into the possesion of certain rebels of the government. The rebels want to use Alex to overthrow thegovernment which seems to be so cruel and bad. To do this, they want to have Alex commit suicide to show that the treatments that the governemtn applied to prisons is bad and that it leads patients to commit suicide. Jumping out of a window out of extreme frustration, Alex survives and is sent to a hospital to be treated. The government takes control of Alex again and turns him back to his original violent self. Alex enjoying the fact that he can control his emotions and violent feelings once more believe that he is fully cured. Back on the streets of England now at the age of 18, Alex starts to move away from the violent feelings in his life. Wanting more out of life, Alex begins a new era of his life. Escaping out of the animal called youth. This story explains, in great words, the idea that everything changes no matter what. We don't need machines, or governements to make everything &quot;okay.&quot; All that we need is to live our lives and let the universe unfold as it should.	2001-11-09

When this experiment was through, they send Alex into the world.  How will the young man last in a harsh world when he can't fight back?

In this futuristic tale, the main conflict is between good and evil and the freedom of choice.  Alex must choose to continue his life of evil or to switch to the side of good.  Saw the movie?

Burgess said that this was one of his least favorite novels but when it comes to books that delve into the basic primal instincts of man, this one tops the lists.

I loved the way that a book like A Clockwork Orange, by Anthony Burgess, can make the reader feel bad for the villain. It is the story of a fifteen-year-old boy named Alex, who maims, rapes and robs people for recreation. He doesn't really think much of it, just as we don't think much of killing a fly. Well one night, he and his droogs (gang friends) go to a house to rob it, and Alex ends up killing the lady and then is betrayed by his droogs and brought in by the police. He then goes under a new scientific procedure that will make him good again... One of my favorite quotes from the book pretty much sums it up: \\"Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?\\" (p. 95). <br />I thought this book was eye opening. It really debates whether it is better to choose, for better or worse, or to let people tell you what to do. It also shows how desensitized people get after being exposed to so much violence. At first it is hard to understand, with all of Alex's slang (hands are \\"rookers,\\" guys are \\"malchiks,\\" and the aforementioned droogs). But as one gets more into the book, one picks up on the slang, and it is a great language that Burgess writes in.	2001-10-24

This book, though looked at by some as impossible to read and looked at by others as glorifying violence, really does have a point:  a person can change.  While the movie and the original American version of the book don't have this redeeming quality, this new version does, mostly because of the inclusion of a new chapter that should have been included in the movie and original American version of the book.  Those who say that this book isn't thought-provoking don't know what they're talking about.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has the patience to work through the very difficult dialogue.  Even after having read greats like Shakespeare and Dostoevsky, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is even harder to read, but like the works of the great authors I mentioned above, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; has a greater point than it seems on the surface.

After reading the first few pages of Clockwork Orange, I thought it would be too painful to continue, but the word substitutions gradually became clear, and the story evolved into a powerful and-surprisingly-humorous narrative. Gang leader Alex rebels against society in every way, rejecting decency, work, and even language. His mischief eventually leads him to prison at age 15, and mishaps there result in his being selected for criminal rehab by association. The rest is what turns the novel into a classic--the criminal becomes victim, grows more charming in the process, and learns how to grow up.	2001-10-04

Through the narration of Alex, a young miscreant, we see his transformation from free-roaming criminal to a thing, the botched result of a government experiment. The book is really good in the philosophical arguments it brings up: Can people be changed from bad to good without choice? What will society sacrifice to feel safe? Is humanity in the choice to be right? It is one of the most provocative novels I have ever read.<br />And that's just half of it. Burgess writes with an original prose that is used by Alex and his criminal buddies. This helps immensely to portray the graphic implications of their activities without actually being graphic. Even though we see the bad things he does, we still feel a connection with him and share in his pain in his treatment. Maybe it is his childlike glee or the fact that the people that are supposed to protect the public are far more insidious. A brilliant book, read it even if you've seen the film, because this book has another chapter which changes the end of the story and gives it a more hopeful tone.	2001-10-01

It's trash, she said. I thought it was a good commentary on what's wrong and what's right with the world. I read the book in school, because I _wanted_ my teachers to see I was reading it, because I wanted to wear my mind on my sleeve to some extent, by showing them a book that meant something to me.<br />Much to my surprise and chagrin, they did not respond as my mother did. In fact, they would ask me why I found it engaging (and believe me, I did), and they would talk to me about the characters and the story. It was a book that made me re-evaluate a lot of things in my world, and to a large degree, it helped me (indirectly) gain some valuable insight into myself and the people around me.<br />To say this book didn't change my life would be a lie. In fact, I'm sure this book changed in one way or another the life of everyone who's read it. Lately, in America especially, people will hide behind the veil of decency and what's right and good to repress and take away freedom. ACWO indeed gives a deep insight into this sort of action, and the deadly and terrible consequences it may have.<br />It dares to ask the question of if good is good because of intentions or because of instinct. In a more direct way of saying it, it says &quot;does society act civil because it wants to or because it is somehow forced to by an influence other than its own&quot;.<br />Like &quot;Mother Night&quot; by Vonnegut, this book points out that the individual, no matter how much you might not like them, or how much you might not believe who they really are, is defined by their actions and their words, and that the world around them forces who they appear to be onto them, or forces its views of who they are onto them.	2001-09-26

I was hesitent in tackling 'A Clockwork Orange' because I knew it contained many invented expressions by the author and, I feared, it would make for difficult reading.  Thankfully my fears were unjustified.<br />Firstly, as most everyone knows 'A Clockwork Orange' is a futuristic story about a sadistic teenager causing havoc with his equally disturbing mates.  His behaviour is vile, with this futuristic society being portrayed as an ultra-violent hell.  Fortunately he is caught, imprisoned, then undergoes 'treatment' to cure him of his violent obsessions.  The story flows well, with both the characterizations and the description of this future world being very believable.<br />However it is Burgess's creative use of inventive gang-land slang which makes this book most memorable.  Of course initially it is all rather confusing, but after a bit it is rather easy to follow.  One is simply left over-awed at the author's ability to get away with such creativity - I imagine his publishers (back in the early 1960s) were rather disturbed at Burgess's creation.<br />Bottom line: violent, shocking and unforgettable.  While not for the squeamish, most everyone will be impressed with 'A Clockwork Orange' - regardless if they've seen the film.	2001-08-07

This book was touted as in the same vein as that book.  It's not.  The book makes some observations about free will, and the nature of good and evil, but I don't find them to be very profound.  Also, in this book the protagonist uses slang that the author has created. This adds little to the story, and wears thin upon the reader after many pages.  In conclusion, this book probably just couldn't live up to the hype.  The reviews on this book make it out to be more than what it is.	2001-07-23

After the first several pages laden with unintelligible, invented slang, the novel contains enough English to be understandable, but the writing style remains unengaging and flecked with that neologic nonsense. The English language can be precise and beautiful, as proven by authors ranging from Edgar Allan Poe to William F. Buckley Jr; however, Anthony Burgess chooses to masscre it. Alright, I'm a purist, but, diction aside, the story still does nothing to engross the reader--at least not the reader pythia. Not wanting to reveal too much to those who do want to read this (fine, try it, but don't expect the thought-provoking masterpiece this novel is often reckoned!), I will simply say that the narrator/protagonist is a kid with a penchant for gang violence and classical music. Tasteless. Oh, in case you're wondering, no, I am not the type of person who prefers warm, fuzzy, feel-good novels. Currently, my two favorite novels are Orwell's 1984 and Levin's This Perfect Day--would you believe that this drossy Clockwork Orange is sometimes catagorized with these? It doesn't belong there. It just doesn't belong. <br />Now that I'm done, I'll admit that I only read about a third of this novel and merely skimmed the remainder, so invalidate my review if that pleases you. Clockwork Orange simply was not worth reading!<br />pythia	2001-07-18

Four months later, I had my bar mitzvah, and being a man I saw this movie.  I could go on for hours about the movie, but I'll post a review of that later. Many months afterword, I reread the book, but took care not to read the last chapter.<br />What I wish to do on this review column, is gather some oppinions of the 21st chapter (just please don't give anything away).  After my first reading, I really liked the 21st chapter, and thought it added a nice optimistic twist to the story.  I had known the movie did not feature the events of the last chapter, and was eager to see how that would work.  I later learned that, although the movie was shot in Britain, Kubrick had read the American release and had not known about the last chapter, and upon reading it, said he was not too fond of it.  Kubrick, of course, was a pessimist.  But after reading the book a second time, I really understood his statement.  Although interesting, the last chapter really interupts the feel of the book, and leaves you with a feeling much different than that of the 20th chapter, that of which I prefer.<br />I would like to appoligize for the terrible writing of this review, but would appreciate anyones oppinions on the 21st chapter.	2001-07-17

I always have been fascinated with books that are written in a way that many people wouldn't understand.  This particular book is written in a rather strange language, specifically the way Alex and his droogs talk, is quite interesting and surprisingly clever to me.  Occasionally I'll find myself telling my mom that the mac and cheese is &quot;real horrorshow&quot; or asking my friends if they want a cup of &quot;chai&quot;.  <br />&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; raises an important question that is more valid now, perhaps, than it has ever been before.  Is a man who chooses to do bad things any worse than a man who hasn't the ability to do nasty things.  In a time when technology is altering lives, and medications can be taken to change your feelings and perceptions of reality, maybe we aren't that far from real &quot;Clockwork Oranges&quot;.  In the story, Alex is only a teenager, but he commits horrific acts of violence that are still shocking, even in our day and age.  Alex is then arrested, and goes through treatment to make sure that he never commits an act of violence again.  After Alex finds that he's not able to function properly in society, something has to be done.<br />This is an amazing book, and a must read for anyone and everyone.  The added last chapter in this book makes it much, much better and completes the story the way it should've been in the first edition.  A book to read for the real and dedicated readers out there.	2001-07-10

It will NOT be the last.  It's been quite a while since I've been so enthusiastic about a book!<br />Burgess creates a tale about twisted teenagers, who's life is dedicated to violence.  In their eyes, the more people hurt, the better.  When the police capture Alex (leader of the gang), instead of sending him off to jail, they use him as an experiment.  He is given to the government as a lab rat for a new &quot;treatment&quot; that boasts criminals can finally re-enter society, and instead of being a danger, will be a constructive and completely &quot;corrected&quot; citizen. However, the method has it's down sides, and leaves Alex completely defenseless.  He is quickly and easily driven insane by a group manipulating him in a scheme to prove the government wrong.  I won't give any details, and I'm not going to give away the ending, but even if you knew the whole story from start to finish, every twist and turn, A Clockwork Orange would stilll be this good.  <br />What makes this book so fantastic is Burgess's ability to tear you apart.  Throughout the book, Alex narrates as if you were his friend.  You go through everything with him, and then you begin to feel sorry for him!  All the while, I couldn't help but think, &quot;I SHOULDN'T feel sorry for Alex!&quot;.  I was completely split.  It really breaks down traditional good and evil.  When I began reading, I thought, Alex and his &quot;droogs&quot; are the evil, the government is good..typical theme... As I read furthur, however, I began to question which was good and which was truly evil.  Then you see that not everything breaks down into black and white.  A Clockwork Orange is certainly no ordinary tale.  It questions all kinds of things that most authors never really take the time to question.  Questions that don't really have definitive answers.. that will keep you thinking longg after you're done the book.  <br />The language that Burgess created for the book sets the mood and puts you in the story once you get the hang of it.  I had anticipated it being much harder, and printed out a long &quot;Nadsat Glossary&quot;, which was completely unnecessary.  There aren't any words that you won't be able to figure out from the context.  <br />I also thought that I should address the fact that the original version of the book has 21 chapters in it, and the movie cuts out the last chapter.  I've never seen the movie, but without the last chapter the book would be quite different, without as much meaning.  So even if you've watched the movie, you should read the book.  <br />I can't think of the last time I read a book that made me smile, laugh, and gasp in horror and discust all within 192 pages. And when it was all over, I came away satisfied, feeling like I'd actully got something out of the novel.  It's really an amazing book.	2001-07-09
US	47492882	R108LWRAVUADD8	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	4	3	4	N	N	a challenging novel	In a time when the literary world is becoming just as lazy as other branches of entertainment (film and music, for example), it's refreshing to be taken aback by a classic that stands convention on its head and disregards the rules of dull, refined storytelling.  This is what I experienced with &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; which is part science-fiction, part comedy, and part social satire, and feels just as current (and relevant) today as it no doubt did during its initial publication (1963).  It's essentially the tale of a young hoodlum named Alex who robs, rapes, and murders without remorse, until imprisonment introduces him to a strange medical technique designed to turn criminals into 'normal' citizens.  The made-up slang writer Anthony Burgess uses here is very challenging (while you read, you pick up on certain words and are left to decipher the meanings) but ultimately may be too much for a casual reader; if you manage to make it past the first twenty pages, though, it's a safe bet you'll be set for the rest of the novel.  Issues of Free Will, social disorder, and childhood merging into adulthood are addressed without Bible-pounding preachiness, topics that can easily be related to our own chaotic modern society.<br />The much-ballyhooed final chapter, in which (SPOILER) Alex discovers that being a droog is a drag and adulthood is the next step in his life, struck me as syrupy--an ending that's been ripped off countless times since in film and books, among other places.  The whole 'recovery' at the end of chapter 6 was far more satisfying, with the threat of the patient out at work in the real world again, raping and robbing as he had before.<br />&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was also the basis for a 1971 film adaptation by Stanley Kubrick, and I must say--in comparison to the book--the language had been softened up to no doubt make it more accessible to the audience.  However, I believe both the novel and the film stand on their own as masterpieces of their respective medium.f their respective medium.	2001-06-26

The government/police dont do much about it, and while Alex roams the streets, just looking for &quot;fun&quot; (yes, apparently it IS fun to bash peoples' heads in) he eventually kills an elderly lady and is arrested.<br />In jail, he puts forth a false attitude that he wants to change, and so he is the first &quot;victim&quot; of a new government program to reverse the mentality of criminals.  For a fortnight he is forced to watch gruesome videos of people being killed, of the German concentration camps, of a world of evil that he once took part of.<br />When he was released, he went back home to find himself replaced by his own parents. He then saught shelter with a man that he once tried to kill, but instead gained respect for him.  When he stayed in his house, the man put forth the attitude that something awful had been done to him, but he was really the man who pushed for it.<br />Eventually, all the effects were reversed, but nonetheless Burgess has created a remarkable novel here.  Throughout the story, Burgess tinges the plot with his own made-up slang such as you would &quot;viddy&quot; a movie or watch a movie. Its quite interesting at times and also through out is the line &quot;So whats it going to be then, eh?&quot; which is quite interesting. Overall, wondeful book and I loved it, had that 1984 feel, but that wasnt nearly as good. The slang can be difficult to get used to, but you do, and want to talk like it afterwards, really gets you in the feel for things.	2001-06-23

People often speak of it and the Kubric film in a way that makes it a blatant disregard for human emotion; a chance to tantalize the senses and fill our minds with senseless violence, rape, and murder.  The antagonists of Mr. Burgess' classic tale fail to discover the meaning of this horrific novel, much the same as those who find the &quot;relations&quot; offending in &quot;Brave New World,&quot; and those who banned &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; for its language.<br />Censors miss true meanings of great literature because they are too busy dabbling over trite matters, while the big picture passes them by.  Fortunately for Alex, in 1986 Anthony Burgess was able to reissue the book with its 21st chapter, left out of the original American version and out of Stanley Kubric's film.  But even without Alex's remorse spelled out for the reader, one who pays attention can see that the novel is based strongly on the forces of good and evil and our glorious ability to choose.  When Alex's free-agency is taken away from him and he is reformed to be a law-abiding man, the novel asks boldly, &quot;Yes, but at what cost?&quot;  The brilliant language (nadsat) used by Alex and his droogies hints at the possibilites of his scenerios materializing in the future; in 30 years or tommorrow or 1,000 years.  Frankly, it doesn't matter.  The novel warns that any time a human's agency is stolen from them, it is the beginning of the downfall of governments, nations, and humanity.  Think &quot;Brave New World&quot; and soma, or the thought police in &quot;1984.&quot;  Had Alex's fate reached the masses, the same rejection of the treatment would have occured, leaving us with thankfulness for the way life is, and warning us about the way life could be.  Burgess captured brilliantly what the charlie tells the prison authorities, &quot;When a man looses his ability to choose, his ceases to be a man.&quot;<br />Very highly recommended...	2001-06-21

What the book reveals about Alex and human nature is startling and must not be taken for a tale of pure madness and ultra-violence. Unfortunately, movie-watchers were only naturally entertained, without understanding the philosophical message behind it. The theme is mixed with Burgess's 'Nadsat language' derived from various languages, mostly Russian. This is the 'lingo' of the gang. One misunderstanding is that the word 'orange' in the title does not mean an orange, it means man derived from Malay. In the preface to this book it becomes all too clear that Burgess is talking about a man who can be wound up like a clock by God or the Devil and has no free will to choose what to be. The priest in the Staja jail also says something like &quot;A man who cannot choose ceases to be a man.&quot; What lies beneath Burgess's tale of rape and ultra-violence and undergoing a dangerous treatment for it is a notion of how human nature is never all good nor all evil and to make a clockwork orange of a person is to dehumanize him.	2001-06-16

I guess the most major is language.  The dialect of the boys, although entertaining, overshadows the story itself to some point, and is little more than a device to smooth over some of the rougher areas of the literature. Despite that, it was a good, even touching story despite the raw violence that seemed to jump off of every page.  Yet despite their raping and beating and killing you manage to feel some compassion for the boys.  I won't give away the ending, but in a mark of true fiction, you find the signs of a character who is dynamic both inside an dout in Alex, the leader of the boys.  I think it is a good book because it takes a satrical look at the side of society that is too often ignored, although perhaps not so much satrical as just a magnified projection.  However, the language (for me) and the violence (for others) prevent me from recommending this book to everyone.	2001-06-05

Very rarely do I enjoy reading the book rather than watching the movie, but with A Clockwork Orange, it was quite the opposite.  Having seen the movie first (and loving it), I knew what to expect from the book, but I had no idea that it would leave me feeling like the movie was not nearly as good as I thought before.  The book is beautifully written, with the young Droogs own language that is confusing at first, but soon becomes easy to follow.  Burgess portrays the world of the young criminal in such a way that rather than being disgusted, I was very interested in continuing with the story.  By the end, I even felt bad for him.  Any book that can make me feel bad for a boy who enjoys rape, murder, and crime in general must be very well written.  What I enjoyed most about the book was the fact that it left so much to the imagination.  While the movie showed scenes and settings such as the woman with the cats' house and her attack, the book merely described them, which allows the reader to come up with his/her own mental picture.  I  found myself picturing things very differently from the movie, which I love.  Overall, this was an excellent book and I am overly impressed by Anthony Burgess's writing.	2001-05-14

This includes the unrivalled originality in Burgess' nadsat language.  The story really captured the often destructive self-absorption and invulnerable feeling of youth -- the ability to act without fearing the consequences, and even when suffering the consequences, caring very little if at all about one's own part.<br />The introduction, in which Burgess harped on about the excluded 21st chapter of the American version prior to 1986 had me curious.  I think that the book without the final chapter, the way it was captured in the movie, is in fact better.  Burgess makes an important point about the final chapter, yet I found it didactic and perhaps with the least flow of any in the rest of the book.<br />Still, this is an excellent book, and well worth a read for anyone.	2001-05-07

While it is true that I and many others have been de-sensitized to violence, the book delves into a different kind of violence.  I guess what scared me after reading A Clockwork Orange was that we do not really know why Alex was &quot;evil&quot;.  Alex would do his thing every night, come home to sleep, then in the morning, gets up and eat breakfast and usually goes to school. What is up with this guy?<br />Usually when you see movies or read books that involve killings and other types of violence, you can always trace the reason to a person or an event that happened previously.  Even in the Columbine shootings and others like it, the kids had reasons and they acted out this anger.<br />But in A Clockwork Orange, Alex chose this evil.  This freaks me out.  It's not I find the other type acceptable, but when shoud people ever have a choice between a good and evil lifestyle?<br />Anyway, the book was good.  It took me like 15 minutes to read the first three pages because of the Nadsat language.  Make a printout of the words and keep it on hand when reading.  The first-person narrative was great and I do think the movie makes the book better because you don't quite get all the emotions of Alex out of the book.  For example, you can hear him laugh and giggle during a rape scene in the movie - something you can never get from a book even if you have a great imagination.  Then reading about his trip to the chair to watch the films - wow - it was described so well - you actually had to feel for the guy.<br />I did get a little turned off by the politics - maybe that is because I always get turned off by politics.

This is the something: Alex, our protagonist, is just that, and any understanding reader knows this but may not know why. How can we know when a novel and a film start and end in the same place? The final chapter fulfills this need for closure, thus transforming Alex into a round character, rather than a flat one, incapable of change. My only critiscism with this novel (including the final chapter) is that, at the end, like at the end of Tim Burton's Beetlejuice, we see conformity, for, in my view, no reason. Not to give it away, I will just discuss the part in question. Before Alex becomes a &quot;Clockwork Orange,&quot; he tells the reader that he loathes what is, in their society, pop music, and prefers &quot;Ludwig Van&quot; (Beethoven). The changes in the last chapter, has him abandon his earlier passion, in place of &quot;tamer&quot; music. This bothers me; perhaps i have misinterpreted this, but to me it makes a comment about civility and music. <br />Anyway, this is one of my favorite novels. It is a brilliant Pavlovian study of psychology (why we do what we do and what can control that) and the philosophy of free will, as well as the conflict between the proponents of free will and law enforcement and psychiatry. You will not read this book without having a lot to think about well after you close the pages of this book.	2001-04-16

I read this book a couple of years ago, and to say that it scared and thrilled me is almost an understatement. Burgess' use of language is fantastic, creating a slang that's as disturbing as it is confusing. The story itself is especially interesting for the times we live in. The only thing I disliked was the added final chapter. It seemed to be tacked on, even though it was originally in the text. That's why this only gets 4 of 5 stars. Aside from that, it's one of my favorite books of all time. ^_^	2001-04-05

If someone bans a book I sometimes have to find out WHY?  In my high school about ten years ago, we were not allowed the choice to choose books such as &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;, or &quot;American Psycho&quot;.  I am 26 now and yes I became too curious and read them all.  Definitely didn't make me a bad person.  Would, (if I had) a 13 year old, allow he/she to read it too?  Of course.  Banning books just makes youth more curious.  Anyway, I liked &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;. It was wild to say the least.  I was instantly attracted to the use of an almost &quot;foreign &quot; sounding language the boys used amongst themselves.  I myself often wake up from dreams and realize that in them I was speaking in an unknown tongue....one my mind had created on its own.  The first few chapters are hard to understand but once you memorize a few words here and there the lingo becomes more clear.  Alex and his friends are delinquents. They drink &quot;milk&quot; which I immediately recognized as their drug of choice.  They beat up old people without reason.  They rape and even kill.  They live vicariously, showing no conscience or remorse.  They almost remind me of &quot;Jack&quot; and his pig-hunting pack from &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;-Just living on pleasure and animal instinct.  I failed to finish reading &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;, not because I didn't find it a modern masterpiece, but because the violence was more hard to stomach than some Stephen King novels.  I finished at the point where Alex was kept in a &quot;hospital&quot; in attempts to reform him. These scenes in the book often brought back memories of Michael Crichton's &quot;the Terminal Man&quot;.  If you read the book I know you understand.  Someday I hope to stomach the book in its whole-even the edition with the exta chapter.  I would give it the five stars I know it deserves, but I gave only three until I finish it someday cover to cover.	2001-04-04
US	52474360	R1CQ581QS4HSWK	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	56	64	N	N	A real tolchock in the yarbles, O my brothers	Fans of Ayn Rand's ATLAS SHRUGGED will no doubt disagree with me here, but _A Clockwork Orange_ may be the most remarkable man-against-the-State story ever published. Anthony Burgess's approach is in one significant sense the opposite of Rand's: where she tried to project a hero (and in my opinion failed; John Galt seems to be little more than a one-dimensional abstraction), Burgess projects a thoroughly depraved teenager and forces us to root for him anyway. It's not every author who can make you watch a bunch of gratuitous sex'n'violence and _then_ conclude that even great moral depravity trumps behavioristic psychology and mechanistic determinism.<br /><br />What \\"protagonist\\" (or Your Humble Narrator, at any rate) Alex does in the first half of the novel will make you ill. But what the State does to him to \\"cure\\" him makes his nadsat gang violence seem almost . . . well, \\"innocent\\" isn't quite the right word, but the fact that I'm even thinking of that word is an indication of Anthony Burgess's power.<br /><br />For Burgess, the important thing is moral choice, and the possibility of choice entails the possibility of evil. Once Alex has been \\"reformed\\" by the very latest techniques of behavioristic science, it's no longer even _possible_ for him to be moral -- and that's somehow more horrible than any of his own horrible acts.<br /><br />But Burgess stops short of making volition an object of idolatry. In the first place, he doesn't make any argument that Alex's actions were somehow \\"good\\" merely because he had _chosen_ them; quite the contrary. In the second place, even though Alex bears the full blame for all his depraved actions, there are hints scattered throughout the book that if he weren't living in a \\"socialist paradise,\\" he just wouldn't have been acting this way in the first place. (For example, both his parents are required by law to work full-time. They also seem curiously unwilling to discipline their son, or even inquire what it is he does when he goes out at night.)<br /><br />I read this book twenty years ago in an edition that had something this one lacked: a glossary. I thought I was going to miss it, but I didn't; Burgess is a fine writer and anticipates his readers' needs very nicely. If the meaning of one of his Russian-import slang terms isn't obvious from context, he works in a definition. (And there are a few glossaries available online anyway.)<br /><br />The earlier edition also lacked something this one has: a twenty-first chapter. I hadn't read this before -- it was left out of the American edition of the book and therefore out of Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation as well -- but to my mind it makes a better ending for the book.<br /><br />Sure, as Burgess himself admits, it's a little crude; we never actually _see_ Alex develop into an adult, we just suddenly learn at the end that he's growing up and becoming ashamed of his past actions. But the novel wouldn't be complete if Burgess hadn't introduced that final bit of irony: after all the State's torturous efforts to \\"reform\\" the poor misguided youth, in the end he just sort of, well, gets over it.<br /><br />Other readers may have different opinions -- and according to Burgess's delightfully snarky introduction of 1986, that's okay with him. And he almost sounds resigned to the fact (for it probably is a fact) that of all his thirty-two novels -- not to mention his nonfiction (including a fine exposition of James Joyce released in the UK as _Here Comes Everybody_ and in the US as _Re Joyce_) and a whole bunch of music -- in the end it's this book for which he will be universally remembered.<br /><br />He may be right that it isn't his best work, and he's undoubtedly right that it's a bit preachy. But it's undoubtedly the book for which I myself will remember him. And I'll make no appy polly loggies for that, O my brothers, for it's a horrorshow book with the impact of an oozy across the glazzies, and no mistake. This malchick and his droogs deserve a place in literary history.	2001-03-30

I have recommended this book to about ten people, every single one of them has bought there own copy of it!I have yet to see the movie for fear it will ruin the feeling the book has left in me, though maney say the book is just as good as the movie is.  Burgess makes a strong commentary on what the human nature to violence is and the human nature to control violence @ all costs, even the free will of a person. This book could make the president hate the government! I hope that every single person in the entire world will read this book, and let it control their thinking the way it did mine.	2001-03-23

The crimes catch up to this villain that we want to hate, but can't. Alex takes the fall for his droogs and receives a 15-year prison sentence.  However, Alex's doctors have been working on a case study, \\"Ludovico's Technique.\\" They offer Alex an alternative of reducing his prison sentence to less than a year by participating in the experiment. Alex does what any 15-year-old would do and takes what seems the less painful choice.   Ludovico's Technique is an experiment designed to condition its subject to lose their evil tendencies and become the \\"perfect Christian.\\" This technique comes right out of Psychology 101. Dr. John B. Watson first conducted the experiment with a rat and a child in the \\"Little Albert\\" case study.  Although Burgess creates a new world, he leaves our imaginations to fill in our own world. \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" will have the reader questioning the dangers of conformity, the roles of society and their own existence. \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" should be read with an open mind. It took me two weeks to get past the first chapter, but once I did, I never wanted to put it down.	2001-03-09

Post-Columbine High School, most people have become numb to violent acts committed by children.   The fact that Alex and his gang's favorite pastimes are spreading terror, theft, and rape, may even seem tame by today's standards.  Yet we should be appalled, none the less.  Not at his age, but with the cavalier attitude towards death and the destruction of the lives of others.<br />It is a well known fact that Burgess was dismayed at the success of A Clockwork Orange.  In the introduction to the 1986 reprint, which included the \\"missing\\" 21st chapter, never published in the United States before (more on that later), Burgess says he would \\"be glad to disown it for various reasons, but that is not permitted.\\"  While ACO survives, other works of his that he values more, \\"bite the dust.\\"  Such is the life of an artist. Our humble narrator is a 15-year old leader of a small gang of droogs.  The four spend their after-school hours wreaking as much havoc as they can muster.  Of course, boys being boys, someone has to lead the pack.<br />As the result of a power struggle within the little group, during a bungled robbery attack, Alex takes one across the glazlids, and is left blinded for the police to pick him up.<br />Though sentenced to spend 15 years in prison, a stroke of luck gives Alex the opportunity to participate in a new experimental aversion treatment for violent criminals.  He emerges from prison a changed, if not particularly new, man.  The violent impulses are still there, but he is overwhelmed by nausea whenever they rear their ugly head.<br />Enter Politics.<br />Now a \\"victim\\" of the state, the opposition political party that is fighting the government's recent crackdown on violent crime seizes upon Alex's plight.  He becomes their poster child for overthrowing the oppressive regime in the next elections.  Tormented by his present condition, Alex attempts suicide by leaping from a window.  His failure only draws attention to the issue (the opposition is delighted) but prods the government into righting its previous &quot;wrong&quot; by changing Alex back to his old self.<br />\\"I was cured all right,\\" the original American version ended.  So now our little droog is back to the way he was; violent, chaotic free will and hormones raging.  Ready to prey on society once again, only now with a good paying government job from his new friends.<br />The new version or, perhaps I should say, the original version (now available in the U.S.) has an entirely different ending.  In the final chapter, our \\"young thuggish protagonist grows up.  He feels bored with violence and recognises that human energy is better expended on creation rather than destruction.\\"   This version, Burgess believes, is a true novel as it is founded on the principle that human beings change.  The old American version was a fable as are all fictional works that fail to show change in human character.<br />The prison chaplain, who befriends Alex, puts it succinctly when he says, \\"When a man ceases to choose, he ceases to be a man... It may be horrible to be good.\\"<br />He warns the pre-treatment Alex, \\"You are passing now to a region where you will be beyond the reach of the power of prayer.  A terrible terrible thing to consider.  And yet, in a sense, in choosing to be deprived of the ability to make an ethical choice, you have in a sense really chosen the good.  So I shall like to think.&quot;<br />Burgess, like his jailhouse preacher, is a strong believer in free will.  They are appalled that government could decide to take away one's ability to make decisions between right and wrong.  If that happens, a person is no longer a person and the fact that they will no longer harm anyone else is secondary to the fact they have been harmed themselves.  Then what is the point of punishing criminal behavior?<br />Which brings us to the final, omitted (dare I say censored?) chapter.  In the original novella, and the revised American version, Burgess' character has a sort of realization that maybe the life of violence he has lead is not the right way.  Maybe he should even get married and have kids - not that he would be able to control them any more than his parents did him, but just maybe...  Is this a true conversion in Alex?  Or is it the idle prattle of a common street thug?  Burgess intends for us to believe that it's the beginnings of a true change.<br />Suppose it is.  That's not a hard thesis to support.  Alex himself recognizes that something is changing.  \\"There is something happening inside me,\\" he says, \\"and I wondered if it was like some disease or if it was what they had done to me...\\"  But Burgess fails to take the cue from his own character.  <br />Perhaps out of resentment for the original omission of his last chapter, Burgess refuses to even recognize that maybe it was the punishment he received that has lead to the new Alex.  Instead, he gives all the credit to Alex's free will.  Perhaps.  After all, as he says, \\"The important thing is moral choice.  Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate.\\"  <br />And so it must.	2001-02-21

Two things about the book may be stumbling-blocks to some readers: its extensive use of invented slang (based mostly on Russian), and the violent content necessary to portray Alex's depravity. The former actually tends to suppress the latter. Philosophically ACO seems to be a parable praising free will, but the book raises more questions than it answers. So do many great books. This edition fortunately includes the controversial last chapter, which I agree with the author is essential to the work. But whether this is really so, along with the social lessons to be gleaned by this effective story, is for the individual reader to decide. After all, as Burgess said, &quot;you are free&quot;.	2001-02-21
US	45165573	R2K57ECWK81AQ9	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Flawed Brilliance	What amazes me most about A Clockwork Orange is not the literary pretensions that Burgess set out with in creating it, but how quickly and easily he draws you into the world he creates.  Two things allow him to do this.<br />The first is the flow of his language, a thing that is doubly amazing when you consider that he had to invent a fairly complex slang vocabulary which can be more than a little off-putting to readers at first.  I say at first because within a few pages I barely noticed that I was reading words like &quot;rooker&quot; and &quot;litso&quot; instead of hand and face.  In fact, the language has a cadence and rhythm all its own once you become used to it that actually guides you through the story.<br />The second reason is Alex, the narrator of the novel.  Alex is a 15-year-old leader of a gang of droogs who has equal love for Beethoven and &quot;the old ultra-violence&quot;.  Something about this character makes him completely appealing, even as his actions make you want to turn away.  Or maybe appealing isn't the best word.  Fascinating, perhaps.  And Burgess doesn't have to do THAT much to make him that way.  Contradictions.  Simply things like contrasting violent tendencies with his effete nature.  Singing showtunes while beating a man to a bloody pulp.  I wish I could explain better, but maybe there isn't more to explain.  For whatever reason, I simply find myself pulled in by Alex and his antics.<br />Speaking of antics, though, I refuse to discuss the specific plot of the book (I think it's rude and a bit juvenile; besides, Amazon has that information already if you want to read it), but I WILL say that Burgess' book deals with many themes.  It is in ways a social critique, a &quot;fable about good and evil&quot; and a philosophical text that questions what &quot;the self&quot; entails and what freedom means.  <br />ACO is alternately bitingly funny and horribly frightening, and Burgess manages to paint a portrait of a dystopic future in whichstreet punks rob, rape and cause general havoc to everyone they can, parents are mostly useless and ignore their children because they cannot deal with the horrors in which they participate, and the government concerns itself only with good public relations rather than the welfare of its people.  Moreover, Burgess manages to do this with seeming ease.  <br />Please do not think that if you have seen the movie you do not need to read this book.  While similar in plot, Burgess intends certain thematic differences than Stanley Kubrick completely dropped the ball on in his movie.  This will become crystal clear if you read this version of the novel, which contains the much debated 21st chapter that was not originally released in the United States.  <br />My personal feeling on this chapter is that Burgess did not understand his own novel enough if this is the way he intended to end it.  I say this because there are certain things that happen in this chapter that I cannot find any evidence for in  the rest of the book.  I feel like Burgess began to write one book and then just decided that he couldn't follow through with it.  For this reason I call ACO flawed brilliance.<br />But don't let the first word draw your attention away from the second.  This book is brilliant, and well worth a read or two.  I am even glad for the inclusion of the last chapter, because it is what Burgess originally intended and opens up interesting lines of discussion.  <br />Others books would be so lucky to have a flaw as wonderful.	2001-02-21

Anthony Burgess<br />La elección del bien y del mal, la capacidad del ser humano de poder elegir entre los dos es lo que lo hace humano. Pero, porque alguna gente elige ser malo o hacer el mal sin motivo aparente, excepto el placer del mal? Este es uno de los temas principales que trata el autor, uno que no  queda resuelto pero que atraviesa el libro de principio al fin. Si no tuviésemos esa  capacidad para elegir, seriamos menos humanos, meras maquinas al servicio de un Dios que no tiene un plan, pero como podemos elegir, podemos rechazar el bien y servir la causa del mal, aunque jamas entenderé como la gente se siente bien o deriva placer de portarse mal. Es una de las cosas que están fuera del alcance de mi tal vez corto e ingenuo entendimiento.<br />La novela es acertada y profética, ya que en estos tiempos esa  clase de violencia la podemos ver todos los días en los noticiarios, niños que matan niños, adultos que matan adultos y niños sin motivo aparente y sin ningún tipo de remordimiento o arrepentimiento.<br />Después de ponimar la situación largamente y goborar conmigo mismo sobre el destino de la crisna humana. Me encuentro en uno de esos callejones existenciales que parecen  no tener respuesta-salida para mis ponimaciones. No tengo respuestas satisfactorias en mi golova para lo que le pasa a la humanidad y creo que lo mejor para mi y para todos es seguir viviendo y tratar dentro de lo posible de elegir el bien por nuestro bien-estar y el de nuestros drugos y familiares.<br />En términos de realización la novela esta muy bien hecha y después de haberla leído cuidadosamente creo que el capitulo 21 ( el final) es muy necesario aunque muchos digan que es una traición  a la novela de ultraviolencia y maldad. Ese capitulo muestra una solución y una salida para Alex, nuestro humilde narrador. El camino hacia la madurez y un cambio en la forma de pensar, ya que se da cuenta de que algún día será un starrio viejo comolos demás y de que tendrá hijos que quizás repetirán su camino aun cuando el no lo desee.<br />La película de este libro es excelente aunque prescinda del ultimo capitulo. Esta en cada lector hacer el juicio final al libro, dejarlo como libro de ultraviolencia o ponerle el fin didáctico que el autor deseaba. De todas formas es un libro excelente.<br />Luis Mendez.	2000-12-26

However, the part of the book that I had the most fun with was the Nadsat. The language, while it seemed very difficult at first (I came very close to throwing away the book after the first page), turned out to be cool once you understood it (i finished the book that same day). After you learn it, the slang makes the book more enjoyable- you feel a bit proud that you can finally understand what they are saying, and the story shines through. Good pacing (except for part 3), great use of narrative and language, and an enjoyable, disturbing read.	2000-12-23

It is truly amazing what he did with language in this book, creating a futuristic teen slang. It is difficult to read at first, but with patience you get used to it. <br />The story does have a high level of brutal violence and criminal acts in it, but when you look beyond all of that, you realize it's quite necessary. It serves to strengthen both the theme and setting, namely, a future society filled with crime. Through the main character, Alex (the &quot;clockwork orange&quot; himself), this novella brilliantly displays the importance of moral choice in the individual.	2000-12-13

This book is not an easy book to read, it's use of a futurist slang and vividly descriptions of violence makes it hard going in places.  <br />Don't be fooled, however, into thinking that this book is violent for shock value only.  Hidden within the richness of the language and violent images there is a deep and hard hitting message in which Burgess tells us that the possession of free will is ultimately more important than what we use it to accomplish.<br />The book is a modern classic and which everyone must read.

Apparently this is a nightly routine in which they bloodily attack any number of random victims, sometimes with no hope for gain at all.  He is eventually caught and brought to prison, where he remains for several years.  The state later decides to reform him using an experimental technique.      Anthony Bugess' A Clockwork Orange challanges our fundamental beliefs regarding good and evil, right and wrong.  This novel asks whether those human beings who are inherently malicious (meaning our protagonist, Alex) can be forcibly molded into upstanding citizens.  The answer is, of couse, no.  The only means of doing this leave the victim bereft of the basic human right choice.  Robbing one of his free will changes him from man to machine.  It is far worse to be a law abiding machine than an evil human, because the evil human still has the option of voluntary reform (as seen in the 21st chapter which is, in my opinion, absolutely necessary).	2000-11-25

In a horrific, futuristic view of the world, Anthony Burgess takes us on a turbulent ride through the mind of a seemingly psychopathic teenager.  But is he really a psychopath?  This is the question that Burgess poses to his readers. Is he so far off from what everyone begins as? Is he just the manifestation of the thoughts which run through all teenagers before they are taken over by the system?  Alex, the main character, goes through a complete metamorphosis from his violent, gang ways to being a &quot;good little boy&quot; after going through prison and experimentation due to his murdering an innocent woman.  Watch what happens when something so full of the juice of life is turned into a machine - when he is turned into a clockwork orange.<br />I recommend this book to anyone willing to read.  But be prepared to think, because that's what this book forces you to do.	2000-11-03

Eventually Alex is captured by the authorities and undergoes Ludovico's Technique, a form of brainwashing that makes him ill when he considers violence.<br />The most original feature of this book is, of course, the language that Burgess created for his characters.  It's sort of a bastardized Slavic slang.  It makes it hard to orient yourself at first, but most of the vocabulary can be gleaned from context.<br />What makes the book great, is it's recognition of the central dilemma of man's existence--&quot;Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness?  Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has good imposed upon him?&quot;  Burgess concludes, as I think one must, that it is better to have the choice of good or evil, than to have a society which controls its citizens so completely that &quot;good behavior&quot; is imposed from without.<br />GRADE: A	2000-10-31

But if you can get past this, then you will see that this is almost a perfect book.  It's central theme, which is that it is better to have the choice to act immorally and to do so than it is to act morally without choice, is weaved masterfully throughout the entire novel.  I also loved the invented &quot;nadsat&quot; slang that is used by Alex and his friends.  I reccomend that you go online and download the nadsat translator or print out the fifteen pages of definitions from your computer-- this helped me immensely.

In example, the tendency of human nature to be violent and unruly until age makes it's effect and gives knowledge and understanding; or an overall mellowing out.

While reading the book you may be disgusted and put the book down but you'll end up picking it up again and questioning yourself how the hell did I put this down? The answer is that this novel is so intriguing and so inventive that if the violence and sex is a bit too much you can forgive it because it is needed and necerssary! The language he has created &quot;nadsat&quot; is a stroke of genius and before long you'll be speaking the lingo in your normal conversation without knowing it.

The movie, which starred Malcolm  McDowell and was directed by the late Stanley Kubrick, has developed a cult  following.  <br />Alex, the protagonist, is the leader of a small gang in his  town.  He lives in a world where the hell-raising kids take over the night,  while the adults are at home glued to their TVs.  He steals, vandalizes,  rapes 10-year-olds, and much more.  He gets caught eventually and is sent  to prison for murder, where he hears about a new rehabilitation program  which he is eager to join.  However, rehab is far from what he expected,  and has some serious side-effects.  <br />Probably the most brilliant thing  about this novel is it's language.  Burgess invented a slang which Alex and  his friends (or &quot;droogs&quot;) use.  It's called Nadsat (which means  &quot;teen&quot;), and is widely based on Russian.  It takes a while to  pick up, but it's not all that difficult (there's an unofficial  Nadsat/English dictionary at clockworkorange.com).<br />The problem is, a lot  of people dismiss both the book and the movie and put them in the  &quot;violent, tasteless, shocking and corrupting&quot; category.  These  people have to see beyond the violence and realize this is clearly a work  of art.  This edition of the book includes the 21st chapter which has a  different (surprising, perhaps) ending (different from the first American  release and the movie).<br />I truly recommend this book to anyone.  It's  better than that Harry Potter junk anyway.	2000-07-28

The main character, Alex, is the leader of a gang of  four teenagers, who run a muck, breaking into people's houses, beating  people up, etc. alex runs into trouble, and is thrown in jail, where the  government gives him horrific punishment.... anyway, enough of the plot.  alex and his &quot;droogs&quot; speak a kind of Russified english, which  they called &quot;Nadsat&quot; (russian for &quot;teen&quot;). The novel  has no glossary, although nadsat is laced thickly throughout the entire  book. this was not a problem for me because i speak russian, but i imagine  that this book would be a very difficult read for someone who does not. but  hey, if you cant, you can download a &quot;nadsat translator&quot;.  overall, a clockwork orange is a visciously bizzarre, violent, hilarious,  intruiging book that asks the reader &quot;is a person who does not have  the option of evil really good?&quot;. a clockwork orange is the best book  ever written because it breaks free of ordinary book structure. the main  character is not very heroic, and is actually very dispicable. the book has  very unexpected twists in it, so reader never knows what to expect. anyway,  read it- it is not something you will soon forget.	2000-07-25

It took me about a month to finish this book, which is longer than i expected. The russian slang is fantastic and adds color to the murky tale of A  Clockwork Orange.  I had to take breaks because reading this was difficult  in more ways than one.  Alex isn't one of those reporters on the tv,  telling us stories about crime and rape and the corrupt government.  He  isn't a journalist writing a 4-paragraphed sumary of a recent crime. He  lives the crime through his own hands, fists, feet, etc. Alex takes you on  the ride that is his life, into the tunnel of his mind and hole of his  heart. His antics and frame of mind are both very intruiging and  disgusting.  I felt somewhat of a softspot for him when his large love for  music was ruined due to his role as a guinea pig after jail.  Imagine  wanting to vomit when witnessing/hearing something you previously  absolutely adored and lived for.  A Clockwork Orange isn't for everyone.   If you are easily offended or closeminded, don't bother because this book  will mess with your head somewhat (at least, it did with me).  Your Humble  Narrator probably wouldn't reccomend it to everyone either.	2000-07-21

Burgess' creative manipulation of language slang and structure is  astoundingly catchy - he delicately entrapps the reader (through the use of  language and 1st person narrative) into the deceptively vicious world of  Alex. He is the &quot;anti-hero&quot; who has been reformed by the state -  using new &quot;scientific methods&quot; - to end his diabolical orgy of  rape, torture and murder. Towards the end of the book, however, you find  yourself despising the government for having used Alex as an organic  guinnea pig, even though &quot;Ludovico's Syndrome&quot; (which involves  making the criminal look at horrific images of extreme sadistic torture  until they become almost &quot;accustomed&quot; to the eventual sickness  they feel) is actually reforming Alex to be a socially acceptable citizen.  Of course, it is evident almost from the start of the book you are in the  hands of a master craftsman of literature - a craftsman who carefully,  almost delicately, constructs an enormously important argument which will  blow you away with it's absolute social relevance and gravity.	2000-06-01

He and his friends go to a milk bar to talk, and have a drink, and discuss what to do with the night.  Such as whether to attack an old man or  rob a store.  And after stealing a car, what should be done with it? Just  average kids doing what kids do.  When Alex is betrayed by his so-called  friends and caught by the police is where the novel becomes truly  frightening.  The deeds Alex committed are nothing compared to what is done  to him in the attempt to cure his wicked mind.  He is left with no defenses  against the world, the image of a perfect citizen without any chance of  surviving the reality he is released into.  After many of the people he has  abused exact their revenge, Alex is returned to his natural, sociopath  self.  This is where the Kubrickian (or American) version ends.  However,  Burgess intended the last chapter to show a mature Alex who finds himself  thinking of family and a new course in life.  This novel is an amazing  glimpse into one human's experience.  Though not the author's favorite, it  is mine.  The statement about society and violence and psychological  treatments is impossible to miss.  This is a classic.

It's an eye opening tale about a boy Alex and his odd path of life. Despite the violence that many people have commented on, I found it necessary to have  inorder to do the story any justice, in regards to what Burgess  has to say  about society.    To help help the story out, Burgess softened the violence  by adding tons of humor to his characters, regarding their actions and even  the hard to follow slang they used. As I read more and more into the book I  began to follow what each of the characters were referring to when they  used their slang, my friends and I even began to use some of the  terminology in our every day conversations.   I also suggest watching the  movie after the book is read. Despite Burgess' dislike to how the movie was  done, I thought it shined a light on the character of Alex and made you  want to see more.    All in all, to anyone who comes upon any negative  comments about the book, disregard them. This is a story that you have to  witness on your own. To some it might have a great impact and to others  they might find it distastful. Personally, I think Burgess was a genius and  wrote a great masterpiece.	2000-05-09

I don't need to harp on the fact that this was Burgess'  least favorite of his works that just happened to become popular,  especially after the release of the movie.  Read it for your own good, and  judge it as you would any work of fiction.<br />Beware the slang and  terminology, which can deter the unsuspecting reader.  A good story  nonetheless, but I can understand why Burgess cared less for it than his  other works.  There are better Burgess works out there.	2000-05-01

First off, Burgess did a brilliant job with creating an invented language of the teens in the future-set society. At first, it is hard to follow and might  be a little frustrating to some, but if you are patient, you will get used  to it and realize how incredible it is. The novel also has a very important  theme to it, which displays the importance of moral choice. The central  character, Alex, is nothing but a clockwork orange (I'll leave it to you to  figure out what that is by the end of the book). There are some that might  argue that the novel is too violent, but the high level of violence is  actually needed to strengthen both the setting (a future society filled  with crime) and the theme. The movie was also good, but I enjoyed the book  more.	2000-04-21

An enduring fable	Anthony Burgess originally wrote this novel when he was told by a doctor that he had a year to live. After this was found to be false he re-edited his manuscript. Perhaps though, the urgency and pace of his writing  reflects his own brushes with mortality. The book is incredibly rich right  from the start. Burgess writes using a patois slang called 'nadsat' which  is the books voice of youth. The first person narrator Alex (Russian for  Outside-the-Law) is an uncontrollable delinquent, but don't write him off  yet as he has a refined taste in classical music, a large vocabulary, an  ironic sense of humour and dollops of charm. When he steps over the line  once too often the state reform him, but in doing so turn him into a  'clockwork orange' a fruit that has lost it's goodness and beauty because  it is simply a mechanical object. The heart of the book is the classic  moral dilemma- is it better for someone to choose to be bad or be forced to  be good. Burgess clearly chooses the former. The end chapter of the book,  which was omitted from Stanley Kubricks masterful film shows Alex reforming  himself, and from this perspective the book can be seen as a rites of  passage, we all learn by our badly intended mistakes after all. The book is  less than 250 pages but contains enough for a book twice that length.  Burgess has created a fascinating dystopia and a warmly moral tale, once  you get used to the graphic descriptions of ultraviolence. Although not on  a par with some of his other work, including the brilliant 'earthly powers'  this is still an essential novel.	2000-04-07

The classic film by Stanley Kubrick keeps the spirit of the novel, but read the novel anyway because  there are certain points not addressed in the film, especially the infamous  omission of Chapter 21 and a long sequence involving the droogs bribing  some old women with drinks. As for the summary (not very descriptive of the  novel or film but I like it), a young man enters a government-sponsored  rehabilitation program in order to curb his violent nature, only to  reemerge in society no different from who he once was.<br />I used to have  nightmares about this type of society. In respect of politics, the novel  has some very key points that the film (or any film) would have difficulty  trying to add in to the story. But it's a great book, with a particularly  odd writing style that uses a language called &quot;Nadsat&quot; (Russian  for &quot;teenager&quot;), a mix of Russian and English. Classic.

Anthony Burgess himself was chagrined that this book became his best known novel, its fame assured by Stanley  Kubrick's film adaptation.  The book has an imaginative first-person  writing style that is replete with a slang built mostly from Russian words.   This edition contains a twenty-first chapter that had  been removed from  the first American edition of the book.  In his introduction, Burgess rails  bitterly against this omission, but I have to say that I agree with the  American editor.  Chapter 21 transforms the book from a disturbing vision  of the future into an overly simplistic allegory on human nature.  Burgess'  message?  That the urge to violence and destruction is natural and  unavoidable among the youth of a decaying society, but they'll grow out of  it and become productive, nurturing adults (I guess Burgess forgot about  such grownups as Hitler and Stalin).  It is an oddly weak note on which to  end one of the most forceful and disturbing novellas of the 20th century.	2000-03-30

While Kubrick does follow the story line until omitting the final chapter, his intent seemed to be focused on the shock value of the  violence and sexuality of the story, not the message. Readers of A  Clockwork Orange will find that Burgess does not put Alex on a pedistal;  rather, he tells a story about a hooligan who at first glance deserves the  treatment he receives. It is up to the reader to determine if such  punishment is an acceptable alternative to current means of criminal  correction. I highly recommend A Clockwork Orange to anyone who has seen  the movie and wants to better understand what Alex was thinking as well as  doing.<br />This book is much more relevant to today's world than 1984, Animal  Farm or Brave New World, as Burgess more accurately predicted what the  world today looks like than Orwell or Haley. Further, Burgess does not  discount the ability for humans to think independently, while Orwell and  Haley simply believed we were all incapable for making good judgements. In  fact, it is this distinction that enables Burgess to be so accurate about  how violent, yet free of dictators, we have become.	2000-03-22

The discriptive language paints a vivid picture of the  violent acts described.  I wish I could have read the book the way the  author had intended it.  He was upseted by the American transformation of  the book.  The last chapter (Chapter 21), was left out and a glossry of the  Nadist language was added.

It's a shame that the original version was missing the final chapter.  For, the final chapter is what holds the meaning for the rest of the book.  A young man falls from grace, pays his  dues, yet it seems that is not enough for some!  Eventually, he is no  better off than before.  In the final chapter, though, he comes to terms,  and realizes what he must do to finally achieve peace of mind.  Burgess'  use of teen slang is hilarious, and yet adds to the character, and the over  all tone.  There is also a message that we should all leave well-enough  alone.  Some things are meant to be the way they are.  Also, the whole  concept that people can and do change with age is evident moreso in the  final chapter, which is another reason why its previous omission was a true  travesty.  This book is a classic.  A sure-fire classic!  I strongly  recommend this for anyone who is a fan of Beat Literature(Kerouac);  especially the work of William S. Burroughs.  The story development is much  the same, although Burgess represents the British counterpart to Burroughs.   But, contrary to Burroughs' Naked Lunch, the main figure of Clockwork  emerges rejuvenated, and free of worry, whereas Burroughs' main figure,  William Lee, is a martyr for his craft. Either way, this is a great read,  and is a good example of both what goes on inside the criminal mind, and  superb revolutionary literature.	2000-03-11

Can a person be forced to be virtuous? Vladimir Solovyev, a great Russian  philosopher of the nineteenth century, wrote that an intent of the law is  not to transform a human being into an angel but to prevent their  transmutation into a devilish beast. The government officials in Anthony  Burgess' distopia conducted a forced metamorphosis of a morally brute  protagonist into some celestial critter incapable of doing any harm. The  result is deplorable: produced Clockwork Orange, whom nobody needs except  some unscrupulous politicians, can not survive in society based on lie and  violence. Forced Good is ephemeral and powerless before Evil.<br />The last  chapter gives a new dimension, new profundity to the story. Good, which was  impossible to inculcate from without, appears uncoerced within the depth of  the soul of adult hero supplanting Evil and Hate. The novel is full of  violence but it gives a hope: the author believes in an ultimate triumph of  Good in human being.<br />The language of the novel is positively unique. For  those who know both English and Russian its reading is a pure pleasure. The  author spells Russian words (sometimes slightly transformed) in English  letters and uses them with Russian meanings but under the rules of English  grammar. The result is stupendous: such exquisite inter-language play of  words, such splendid construction of sentences I've never met. However,  Russian translation of 'A Clockwork Orange' is rather lackadaisical, and  that only confirms novel's inimitable originality.	2000-02-18

On the surface, it is simply the tale  of a &quot;droog,&quot; reformed, then unbrainwashed, and then redeemed.   The Russian slang adds incredible flavor to the story, but also another  layer of difficulty.  And the final chapter...  This is not an easy book to  read, dispite its length.  It is, however, an important book.  A rare  thing- this Western novel of philosophy.  Where does our free-will begin  and end?  If we can be killed for our crimes, why not taught to be good?   What is the place of the individual in society, and when must its freedom  be sacrificed for the &quot;greater good&quot;?  All questions are address  but few are are answered.

It is an intensely moralistic study of society, and its right to judge. The basis for it can perhaps be traced to an incident in Burgess's own life, when his wife faced down an Alex and his  droogs.  In the novella, Alex, the antihero, relates his adolescent  experiences, and the effects he suffers at the hands of a civilized  society. Some have accused the novel of being pornographic, violent, and  downright distasteful. First, the sexual content is minimal, secondly we  live in a violent society, and one person's concept of taste is inherently  personal. Whether art affects society or vice versa is a rich topic of  debate for middle class dinner parties, not book reviews.  Central to this  plot is the concept of sin and redemption. Even the societies who  manipualte Alex to their own ends are symbolic, eg the Pelagians.   Ultimately one could simplify it to the question of personal choice: to  choose to be 'bad' or to be forced to be 'good'. I don't belive the book to  be immoral. Undoubtedly there is an argument for Alex being amoral, after  all, he is only obeying his own philosophy. (Alex, is, literally, without  law.) We are forced to draw our own conclusions about the ethics we adopt.  I think some of the other reviews are tainted by the fact that for a long  time, A Clockwork Orange, in its proper format wasn't available in the  States. The 21st chapter was removed without Burgess's permission. This  spoilt the moral questions and also ruined the numerical unity of the book.  The 21st chapter crucially deals with Alex rejecting his violent lifestyle.  To fully understand how Burgess suffered at the hands of the ill informed,  especially after the Kubrick fiasco, one should read the Enderby novel, A  Clockwork Testament. The only thing to add is a warning: Nadsat is a  difficult idiom to grasp, but the wordplay is a glorious exercise in the  richness of language in all its forms. This is a rare book, one that  challenges the reader and makes her/him think.	2000-02-02

The biggest problem that I felt it had was that if the same  content would have been written by another author, it would have been  called pornogrophy but because it was by Burgess it is called classic  literature.  Beating helpless people, raping women, and drinking some kind  of spiked milk should not be something that is glamorized, but it should be  something hidden with the rest of the works such as this trash.  If a woman  is raped and purposefully hurt now in a work of literature, it is seen as  some kind of foul scene, but here, because the youths in the book seem to  have no sense of right and wrong it is seen as alright.

But it isn't - the violence isn't at all explicit and  anyway the effect is dulled by the use of the slang. Clockwork Orange is a  deep exploration of good and evil, with the conclusion that it is better to  choose to be bad than to be forced to be good. In other words, man's free  will must be protected at all costs, and we mustn't curb our nature so that  we become little more than a machine - we mustn't become like &quot;a  clockwork orange&quot;. This is a dystopian nightmare that can easily be  ranked alongside &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;.	2000-01-06

All kids, and especially the children of today, are faced with choices about sex, drugs and violence.  Burgess shows  both the danger of the presence of these choices as well as the danger of  their absence, all in the same novel.  Like Golding, Burgess is intelligent  enough to know that by making children the protagonists of his work, he  forces the reader to consider man's underlying nature.  If all you have to  say about this book is, IT WAS VIOLENT, or, I GAVE UP AFTER A FEW CHAPTERS,  then do everyone else a favor and spare us your review.	1999-12-03

Burgess' text will grasp you from the very beginning, from when Alex starts his mystery tour to when he drops you off at the end.<br />You feel attached to the text instantly as Alex and his gang start  on their evenings work. Great start to the book, which you can, and will,  read over and over again.<br />The slight drop in standard for me was during  the third section. Although it is almost compulsory to be there, it seems  to drag out slightly. It is nauseous - yet interesting - to know that he  gets treated in a rough way, as he may have treated somebody else.  <br />Towards the end, somehow the disgust I feel for Alex during the opening  chapters, turns to pity through sorrow.<br />A Clockwork Orange has the best  ending I have read, to top off the finest book I have ever read.<br />A  stunning and original use of languages and an enthralling structure, which  describes and educates an extremely a morbid subject.	1999-11-22

There's all this violence, and everyone wants to do anything to stop it.   This book really explores that.  What would we be willing to do?

In addition to being an utterly captivating literary performance  from beginning to end, this book examines the problem of violence in  society in ways no writer has done before or since. Regrettably, I think,  most readers miss Burgess' point. A Clockwork Orange is not so much about  the evils of totalitarianism and the importance of free will as it is about  the clash of the &quot;evil&quot; state vs. the evil individual. In the  end, total government with all its prisons and behavior-modifying  technologies is no match for man's potential for total depravity. So who's  to blame for violence in society and what's the cure? Burgess offers plenty  of clues, and the possibilities for discussion are endless.	1999-09-10

How can I explain that it is possible for me to empathize with a rapist, a murderer, a child molester, a parent hater?  And yet, to me, that is  Burgess' genius in this book.  When I was requested to follow along with  &quot;Our Faithful Narrator,&quot; I eagerly submitted with anticipation,  to learn where the future would take him.  And possibly us. <br />Burgess asks  in this novel a question of some simplicity: what is the human species?   But his answers are unlike anything I've seen, with apologies to Orwell and  Huxley.  He first guides us into the mind of an individual criminal. And  then he indicts society at large with the criminal manner in which he is  handled.  Unfortunately for us, true examples of similar means of  &quot;bettering&quot; our society are too plentiful to mention (like  castration of rapists) and too scary to dwell upon.<br />And then there is the  language.  It made me chuckle, it made me want more; I wish this book were  a 1000 pages longer.  One criticism I often have is that novelists poorly  finish otherwise good books.  This is NOT true of &quot;A Clockwork  Orange;&quot; it ends fittingly and true.	1999-07-20

I just felt all the violence helped establish character (The best character establishment I'VE ever seen!). This book also had the best plot I've ever seen. There  are only three cases where the movies are better than the book and that's  &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot; (which  doesn't really count because the only correct things are the characters and  setting) and this. This is the only movie that still brings tears to my  eyes (on the part where Frank gets his revenge), gives me goosebumps  (almost the whole movie) and makes Beethoven's ninth symphony my favorite  musical peice ever.

Throw out the reviews, good or bad, especially when they mention the graphic ultra-violence and sex which is very comman  throughout.  Instead, sit back, relax, grab a cup of joe, and enjoy a  funny, sarcastic, and exciting book from Anthony Burgess. <br />The story is  about a young man named Alex.  He is the leader of a group of droogs, or a  gang of friends as it seems, who spend they're nights getting stoned on  milk laced with drugs, beating up defensless people, and raping women.   Perhaps none of this seems very funny, especially in this day and age when  violent crimes are becomming more common, but the language and humor that  Burgess puts in the mind of his humble narrator, Alex, makes it nerely  impossible to resist.  Even during Alex's darkest days the book's humor is  kept in tact by the charisma, charm, and almost poetic languge used by our  Humble narrator.  and P.S., make sure you pick up the newest copy when  buying in the states...and older version won't have the final 21st  chapter...	1999-06-01

I had heard about it so I decided to read it, and I'm  glad I did.  Fourtunately for me, It included a glossary, but did not  include the finall chapter.  I read the book, and couldn't put it down.   When I finished it, Iread it again.  Now, I personally didn't like the last  chapter, when I found it online.  I had already read the book once, seen  the movie, and was halfway through it again.  The last chapter looses the  flow of the violence.  I liked being able to imagin what Alex was thinking  when he was cured.      The book expresses a hatred of violence on the part  of the author, yet he writes from a violent youth's point of view.  One  thing that I found frightening, was that I could see myself as Alex, and  feeling rigjht at home withh the idea. I highly recommend this book	1999-04-08

The movie was much like the novel, filled with violence, rape, and more violence.  As a matter of fact, the only main difference between the novel  and the movie is the last chapter.        As a once troubled youth turned  good myself, I identify with the eighteen year old Alex of chapter 21 and I  truly feel that the last chapter is essential to the book.  People really  do just suddenly grow up as Alex does.  Thus chapter 21 of the novel is  what makes the book worthy of being dubbed as iconclastic.      I give A  Clockwork Orange my highest reviews and hope that anyone who loves great  literature will read what I consider is one of the greatest novels of the  twentieth century	1998-11-10

There is something about the Dark Side that attracts and tempts us with promises of escape (real or imaginary) from the boredom in everyday life.  Burgess, in his introduction to ACO, attributes this attraction to \\"Original Sin\\" and says he enjoyed ripping and raping by proxy through his protagonist, Alex.  But there was a moral point: \\"If one can only perform good or only perform evil, then he is a clockwork orange - meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil or (since this is increasingly replacing both) the Almighty State.\\" He continues: \\"It is as inhuman to be totally good as it is to be totally evil.  The important thing is moral choice.  Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate.\\"<br /><br />From the 1st to the 20th chapter, one is (although vaguely) under the assumption that Alex is free to choose good or evil but gets more pleasure out of evil.  Alex says he does evil because he likes it just as some people do good because they like it. Alex assumes his own freedom and uses it (and Burgess through him) to mock those who think that evil is not freely chosen but the result of a bad environment, a bad government, or the devil.  Then one comes to the 21st chapter. Here, quite abruptly, is an older Alex who associates his youth with a wind-up toy (the opposite of moral freedom)!  One is also left wondering if Burgess actually believed at the time he wrote this novel that one INEVITABLY grows out of evil through some maturation process. If he did, then this contradicts the moral idea he presents in his introduction that one is free to choose evil and, I might add, stay evil.<br /><br />Apart from what I perceive to be a contradictory 21st chapter, the book is excellent for its creative language and emotional presentation on the moral issue of whether conditioning, not just incarceration, can remove moral freedom.  Put yourself in the victim's shoes.  Would you want Alex to lose his moral freedom to torture, rape or even murder if it meant a safer society, a safer YOU?  If you answer \\"yes,\\" then you are in effect saying that you want your own moral freedom to choose evil removed.  This raises the question of why evil (or our moral perception of evil) exists in the first place. A lot to think about here., not just incarceration, can remove moral freedom.  Put yourself in the victim's shoes.  Would you want Alex to lose his moral freedom to torture, rape or even murder if it meant a safer society, a safer YOU?

Burgess, like Joyce before him, creates his own language for his tale of these futuristic thugs in a socially apocalyptic England.  It is a book that sucks you into its world so well for the very reason that you must learn its language.  And Burgess, despite his often shocking vulgarities and violence, is writing what is essentially the central parable of the modern age.   It tries to answer the question that lies at the heart of modern society: how do you find your essential humanity in a society that has come to regard the soul as a mixture of brain chemicals?  Burgess is relentless in his desire to find something beautiful and enduring about the human struggle in the dense web of human technology, and little could be more appropriate when facing the absurdities of the modern age.  This is a difficult, disturbing tale but one that belongs among the greats of all Western literature.	1997-12-09

Burgess himself has criticized and attacked this novel which he published in 1968, but which has come to be regarded alongside such dystopian classics as _Brave New World_ and,  perhaps more appropriately, Yevgeny Zamyatin's _We_. An  unsparing story of a sociopathic hoodlum, Alex, _A Clockwork  Orange_ is shocking and often a difficult read despite the  bizarre and sometimes surreal street language employed by  its narrator, a dialect of some archaic words, a few   neologisms, and a great deal of Anglicized Russian. The   film by Stanley Kubrick is equally disturbing, but, as   Burgess himself notes in the introduction to this edition,  leaves off the crucial twenty-first chapter, a chapter that  is vital to the book both for its numerical significance  (twenty-one being considered the age of maturity), and its  philosophical poignance.	1996-08-09

I seldomly read fiction, however, this and some others that I'll eventually review were on a list of 100 essential books for men.  I don't know if this is really &#34;essential,&#34; but it is thought provoking particularly toward the end.  Be prepared ahead of time because this book has its own language.  When I first began reading it I was sitting at my desk at work thinking &#34;what have I gotten myself into?&#34; Yes, I actually started this book at work, haha.  My take away point, which was entirely philosophical, was &#34;are bad people supposed to be bad and is it 'bad' to change a bad person to good?&#34;  I have my own thoughts about this.  Hint:  I'm a Christian Conservative.  However, you should develop your own.  I've never seen the movie and really didn't even know of its existence.

I've recently started reading 'the classics' for which I've only ever seen the movie and this one my brothers, is amazing.<br />The Kubrik movie holds fairly true to the book, except for the ending, which I won't spoil it for anybody who hasn't read it yet. I am left scratching my head, as to why Kubrik left out the final chapter - he had to have had access to the UK version of the book. While the movie has always been a favorite of mine, I feel the addition of the final chapter would have made it even better. It adds a whole new twist to the story and a depth to the Alex character that almost makes him human.<br /><br />One word of warning though ... the book is heavy with rhyming slang, and some unusual words and phrases lifted from the Russian language:  gavoreeting == talking, which is pretty close to the actual Russian word for speak  (I never thought my High School Russian classes would come in helpful).<br /><br />If you have any ability for language it shouldn't take more than the 1st couple of chapters to start understanding the nadsat slang Alex and his droogs use.	2015-08-15

Thanks to this book I am sure that the Nasdat slang will be forever embedded in my vocabulary. After being such a fan of the Kubrick movie and Malcolm McDowell's portrayal of Alex, I decided to read the original work and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Violent in one area, hilarious in another, and disturbing throughout, I blazed through it easily and would highly recommend it. The writing is real Horror Show and paints scenes that may leave scars on your Gulliver, but I got through it surprisingly—Nasdat and all—and in the end wished the movie had stayed a bit closer to the source material.<br /><br />The book comes with an introduction from Anthony Burgess which served as a bit of a buzz kill since he admits to disliking the story, and goes on to complain about the American version of his book omitting the last chapter to keep things negative. After finishing the book there was a counter point added from the publisher saying that there may have been a misunderstanding (very odd of them to add that)when the final chapter was originally omitted. Still the last chapter will surprise those of you that have only seen the movie. Many hate the last chapter but I enjoyed it.	2014-11-17

One of my Top 3 book EVER !  Also, Stanley Kubrick's movie version was excellent!  It was one of my favorite Top 3 movies EVER !  The young Malcolm McDowell was the perfect choice for &#34;Little Alex&#34;; as were the supporting actors.  Although Anthony Burgess was  not pleased that both the American versions of both book and movie ended at Chapter 24, and didn't include Chapter 25; I;ve read both and the final chapter seems like a silly afterthought to justify the horrific nature of the rest of the book.  There was a lot of controversy about the book and the movie served to bring it more to the mainstream, promoting even more controversy.  People with &#34;delicate sensibilities&#34; either could not, or would not watch it; or read it. Although quite graphic, the sex and violence portrayed were not simply gratuitous; but were integral parts of the book. Somewhat like &#34;1984&#34;, and &#34;Brave new world&#34;, the almost unbelievable, yet frighteningly believable and realistic outlooks at a future, not that far off, that truly drove home the points were very well thought out.  As we have seen, Orwell's &#34;1984&#34; prophecies of &#34;Big Brother&#34; were relatively tame when looking back at them in today's world.  I truly loved the book and, as with reality, simply not watching or reading about horrific things doesn't make them any less real.  After all these years, I still believe it is a &#34;must read&#34;.  Thank You, Jamie Jenks	2014-07-26

The authors heavy use of  a street slang he appears to have invented may turn off some readers but becomes manageable after a couple of chapters.

I am always amused by how many people sympathize with and indeed &#34;root&#34; for the main character/narrator in this novel.  I wonder if, perhaps, there is another dimension to this book that is overlooked in high school and college discussions of the implications of government programmed behavior.  I wonder if this book is not a study in how we the readers can be manipulated into turning a blind eye to horrendous behavior.  After all, the protagonist here is a street thug who rapes, beats, and murders with impunity and even admits that he enjoys it.

Review: The depth of this work is not fully realized in a passing read. Indeed, the author himself dismisses it as much to pedantic too be artistic. Yet, the work does seem to have layers with which the reader can be drawn into thoughtfulness. It is a violent work, born in part, from a violent act. Burgess's wife suffered an attack not unlike one of the horrendous acts which the main character perpetrates. This fact alone make the work mind-boggling and curious. Why would the author write a work like this, told from the perspective of the actual criminal mind?<br /><br />And yet, he distances himself from all the violence. Blurring the heinous crimes with a hypnotic made-up language that populates the book. Burgess admitted this. The language of this book, perhaps a bit difficult to get through at first, becomes more and more familiar as we are sucked along in little Alex's head and all his misadventures. It covers over the violence and keeps the reader from being completely turned away. Perhaps we even feel a strange sympathy for the main character when he is being used by the political forces in this world? As we might be sucked in by any charismatic criminal.<br /><br />Moral choice? In the book, the main character is evil, but the government attempts to make him good by physically disabling him from doing bad. The religious figure, a prison Chaplin, decries this saying that without freewill a person ceases to be a person. By contrast a prison warden scorns that the government's action is missing the point - for where is redemption without punishment \\"an eye for an eye\\" and all that. The government officials in the conservative party say that the only point of all this is to lower the crime rate (and in so doing to get reelected). The scientists who invent the special technique which transforms the main character don't even want to get into ethics at all. But what about Alex's parents and former social worker? They all sort of seem perplexed by him or maybe indifferent. And the main character himself is unconcerned with all this - he just wants to get back to his old ways as quick as he can.<br /><br />If you read the 21st chapter (the one originally cut out in the American version) you end on a different note. The character grows up. Seemingly all on his own. His change appears to come from within. Yet, I feel it is not completely from within - for at the end - he has a job doing something he likes (which is not destructive), and he is now earning money NOT stealing it. Back in his crime-filled sprees it was easy come - easy go. Yet little Alex, now big Alex is not so quick to part with his cash when he's been meant to become a part of society and earn his keep. So, when Alex gets set up doing something he likes (associated with his love of music) his destructive ways are diverted.<br /><br />But compare this with Alex's companions: George, the droog who had a notion to take over leadership - falls victim to his own criminal ambitions. Dim, a lack-witted brute, throws in with Alex's enemy- perpetrating his old violent tricks now as a corrupt (or sadistic) police officer. Then there is Pete who was the least violent in the group, who renounces his old ways and finds a girl--moves on--matures--grows up. We are led to believe that Alex might follow in Pete's footsteps. Did he come to this conclusion on his own? Did the government help him to it by providing him a way of making a living with something positive he is interested in? Or did it just become tired of being a criminal (or more mature). After all, the last chapter is the \\"21st\\" chapter and made to be symbolic with the coming of age at 21 years.<br /><br />In Alex's world, everyone connected with the criminal way seems to be using everyone else. Alex and his droogs use people by preying on them. Then Alex is preyed upon by the government for political reasons and exploit. Despite Alex's unforgivable lifestyle, we are still left feeling unsatisfied with the government'ssolution. Somehow we can't quite swallow turning someone into an automaton. Burgess makes sure of this by making the governments technique have the side effect of  causing him pain and awful discomfort whenever he hears music (his one arguably redeemable quality). And this side effect is then exploited to cause Alex to try to \\"snuff it\\" (end his own life). This would be unacceptable, for if the government had wanted that, then they simply could have administered capital punishment in the first place.<br /><br />This book is very successful in sucking you in to a sort of comfortable and hypnotic read of things that would otherwise jolt you off the page, and then after you've gone too far into the character's head it's too late to turn back. You are caught in the bright and harsh lights on the big moral issues at stake surrounding crime, morality, maturity and freedom of choice.<br /><br />Podcast: If you enjoy my review (or this topic) this book and the movie based on it were further discussed/debated in a lively discussion on my podcast: \\"No Deodorant In Outer Space\\".

Honestly, I think that is exactly what he was going for.<br /><br />&#34;I do not know of any other writer who has done as much with language as Mr. Burgess has done here — the fact that this is also a very funny book may pass unnoticed.&#34; - William S.

Is it easy to read? No, but the story of Alex is as captivating as the world that Anthony Burgess brings us into.

Somehow, a few months ago, I started thinking about this book and realized I'd never read it, and was probably in a very small minority.  I ordered it and could not put it down.  Is it violent?  Yes, of course.  Did it sicken me?  No.  It was pure physical violence to start with, so no creepy sick stuff that is far more likely to play on my mind.  The brainwashing to eliminate the violent tendencies was interesting and thought provoking.  So much has been written about this book that I probably can't add much.  The only thing I will say is that the last chapter, which apparently was eliminated from many editions, is completely ridiculous.  I don't want to spoil it, so won't say more, but it was a facile ending that diminished the book as a whole.  This final chapter is why I gave the book four stars instead of five.	2014-01-22

I must tell you I have indulged in this book perhaps more than any of you, unless you're Russian also. My native language intertwined with this astounding work of brilliant horror, coloring it rich and scary and crazy at the same time, with me imagining it as it was spoken, properly. Brrrrr. I feel like there is the voice of Anthony Burgess in my head, reciting as Alex. I must tell you one more thing, before I go on. I have read the version with the 21st chapter, the very end that's been cut off in the original American publication, but was kept in the British, hence the review might differ from the version that didn't have it. You see, Alex changed, as impossible as it might have seem, he did change in that last 21st chapter, and indeed it changed the story itself. There is hope, after all, for the Alexes of the world. Makes you wonder, doesn't, what kind of decision made it cut from the American version in the first place. But I'm getting carried away into mundane. Now, I must say, this will be the book to re-read and to re-read and to re-read, among such works of genius as Lolita, War and Peace, and the like. I've never read Burgess before, and I plan on indulging more and more in his work in coming years, because, oh well, because the explosion of the beautiful and the appalling, the sophisticated and the primitive strikes such a fine balance, that you feel it, you smell it, you taste it, you hear it, you see it like it's unfolding around you, and you unfold around it, and inside it, and all is in and out and together, and you raise your head from the book to answer that call and you no longer know who you are or why or where. Last time a new writer had such an impact on me it was Haruki Murakami with 1Q84. I can't say wow, because it sounds boring. Let me try. It will deposit fireworks in your brain. It will skin you and pin you with sharp words all real proper. It will put you in a mind of one you don't want to be yet feel for by the end of the book, unsure how it happened. Namely, little Alex.<br /><br />Little Alex. Little Alex has a proper mum and pop, lives in a proper flat, in a proper block, all good. But it's not enough for little Alex. Little Alex likes to perform a bit of ultra-violence every night with his droogs, but it's just simple bloodletting, oh no. It's more sophisticated than that. Alex has wit, Alex is fond of classical music, Alex adds the disturbing twist to his crimes, and that, only at 15. He does everything there is to try, the beating, the cutting, the raping, the stealing, until one day he stumbles on killing, and that's a slippery slope that leads him to an institution where some very interesting new curing methods are tried on him, and lo and behold, I can't tell you no more as otherwise I will spoil it for you, in case you happened to have been untouched by this story, wether in book or film shape. Anyway. It all turns around, of course, as things do in life. Those who do crimes, pay for their crimes, but who is to judge what is fair? How much do you pay, and when can we stop the punishment? I know there have been horsed of scholars who said smart things about this book and about life and people at large and how it relates, but on my level I can tell you that the coin has always two sides, and we may forever wonder if what the author was trying to say, but I have a feeling that is wasn't simple glorifying of sex and violence, as it might seem. Oh no. It's about &#34;Why?&#34;, and about &#34;Why not?&#34; Why do we have violence and those who enjoy it? Because those who do it can tell you, why not? When we're blind as to why we shouldn't, we do it just because we can, don't we? We do until we get caught. That's how we learn. Some earlier, some later. Alex does learn, eventually, but at a cost. Okay, I need to shut up now otherwise this will turn into an essay. Go read it. It will, literally, blow your mind.n't want to be yet feel for by the end of the book, unsure how it happened.

The '60s and the '70s were irresolute and anxious, essentially puerile and unformed. Kubrick's choice to omit the last chapter was not only good movie making, but a conceptual necessity: the story doesn't support the didacticism with which Burgess wants to imbue it-- except when he doesn't, complaining of its immaturity and ham-handedness. The early '70s in the States were a resonating chamber for the primacy of violence and moral ambiguity, and into this Burgess's ending would have thudded dully and uninterestingly.<br /><br />Enjoy the brilliance of the language and forgive the obviousness of the story. You'd have to read Nabokov to find its like in craftsmanship.	2013-12-10

By this I mean is it better to be bad, but like it, or to be forced to be good. This argument is a popular choice in many books nowadays. It is included in the \\"Matched\\" trilogy, \\"Anthem\\", and the \\"Divergent\\" Trilogy. However, unlike these books, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" gives this argument that involves frequent uses of what the main character, Alex, states as \\"ultra-violence\\". Alex is a fifteen-year old delinquent that travels a long way morally by the end of the book. Anthony also comments on the adolescent population using frequent demonstrations. By using \\"nadsat\\", Anthony Burgess's Russian-influenced version of English, he comments on the teenage slang frequent in his time period (and currently still going on now). He also comments on the fact that violence is childish due to the fact that once Alex grows up, he decides to settle down. Throughout the book there are vivid descriptions of assault and rape, given and received, by Alex. For the first half of the novel Alex is the one dishing it out but after the Ludovico treatment, is received by Alex. Due to this imagery I would have to give it a rating of \\"R\\" mainly because of the violent content. But when looking back, I did enjoy the novel, and feel it is a great book of literary merit, which is why I give it a five-out-of-five rating. And I wouldn't change a thing in Burgess's novel.	2013-09-29

The main character, Alex, is so un likable, I really didn't care what happened to him.  I didn't want to know anything about him, how his actions propelled him into the situation, or if he would come out a better person.  I had no desire to know anything about such an awful person.  The entire book painted the world such a hopeless place.  I don't know about Europe, but I still hold out that America is not this bad, despite the picture that the current media paints.

When a boy is growing into his teens he finds that he now has a lot of &#34;demons&#34; that hound him day and night. While most are good at suppressing these &#34;demons&#34; Alex does the opposite, he embraces them.<br />I prefer this book much more than that of the movie. The main reason is because of the final chapter. This really should have been included in the movie, it adds so much to the character of Alex.	2013-03-02

I had heard of this movie from a friend many years ago. From what I'd heard of it, it was a graphic story laden with violence. I also learned that it was based on a book. Years later, still have never seeing it, I saw that my local library at the time carried the movie. So I checked it out and prepared myself for a controversial film. (I was in the midst of watching a lot of other classics at that time that I had never seen: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Pscyho, Gone with the Wind, etc.) This was around 2009 or 2010.<br /><br />What really ended up surprising me was that I really liked the idea behind the movie. I didn't care for the violence or any of that, obviously, but the central idea behind it all really won me over and really stuck with me well after I had turned it off and moved on. And what was this idea? It was the classic issue of morality. Free will. Good and bad. Moral choice.<br /><br />The gist of the story is, if a society had the ability to \\"rehabilitate\\" sadistic and violent individuals, at what cost would that be justified? Because, ultimately, after Alex receives his treatment, he may no longer have been able to inflict harm on others, but he was also rendered incapable of choice. In addition, he was incapable defending himself against the evils of the world, since he was conditioned to be intolerant of any kind of violence.<br /><br />So this leads one to wonder, if this type of treatment existed, would it be a fair course of action? Might some justify it as payback for truly sadistic persons who have inflicted so much harm upon others? If given the choice of this \\"treatment\\" versus a life incarcerated, or even the death penalty, what would someone in Alex's shoes choose if they were truly informed of the implications of such conditioning? We certainly become aware that Alex comes to regret his choice and loathes the \\"rehabilitation\\" he recieved, but he was never truly informed of the specifics of his treatment. Ultimately, he finds his quality of life so intolerable after the treatment that he sees the only possible way to resolve his situation is to off himself.<br /><br />In 2011 I got my hands on a used copy of this book. Ever since viewing the movie, which, as I mentioned earlier, stuck with me, I was eager to read the literary work that was responsible for inspiring the film. The edition I picked up was the one most recently published in the US, the one that included the original 21st chapter that was published in Britain but excluded from previous copies here in the states. Therefor, Kubrick's film, though filmed in England, sticks to the American version - the version that ended with the 20th chapter - instead of the 21st. (More on the 21st chapter later.)<br /><br />The first thing that caught me off guard when I first began reading the book, that I had no knowledge or expectation of, was the language. The language! Surely I've read books with some unusual use of language, old english, slang, etc., but the language in this book was a different breed altogether. The language Alex speaks in, while essentially English, is so obscure and filled with such odd words that it hardly resembles English at times. It's called Nadsat, and it is the teen slang of the future. This in itself was intimidating. Just a few pages into the book, I was quite nervous about what I'd gotten myself into.<br /><br />Sure enough, I got the hang of it eventually. A lot of it can be figured out in context. A few chapters into the book I ended up looking for a glossary type resource online, and found one. This helped a lot with determining the meaning of some of the tougher words. The truth is, though, if you go into the book and treat it like submersion in to a foreign language, you'll understand enough, do just fine, and ultimately figure it out. Of course, if you want to pause and look up every word, too, this will eventually work out fine as well, since by the time you're half way through the book you have an excellent grip on Nadsat. (P.S. Any one want to govoreet in Nadsat with me? I'm real horrorshow at it now.)<br /><br />It's been a few years now since I've seen the movie. From what I can remember, the movie seems to be quite true to the book. Though I am curious, had Kubrick incorporated the 21st chapter into his film, how that would have been done. I would love to see yet another director take on this work of fiction and put it on the big screen yet again in a fresh new interpretation.<br /><br />So, that 21st chapter. I said I'd get back to it, didn't I? Well, though I appreciate that Alex eventually comes around and wants to change (a nice fairytale ending), I have a few problems with it. The thing is this: yes, kids can be irresponsible, reckless, explosive, impulsive, and violent. But I don't believe that all kids are this way, and the ones that are all exhibit these traits to varying degrees, and most not to the extent that Alex was. The level of violence exhibited by Alex was in no way a mandatory or common component of youth. Alex was above and beyond the troubled teenager. And, in my opinion, Alex demonstrated psychopathic characteristics. (I'm no phsycologist - this is all just my opinion.) He got his kicks from other people's suffering and demonstrated little to no remorse for his actions. In addition, he was incredibly egocentric and narcissistic. So, for Burgess to suddenly have Alex overcome this youthful lust for destruction, and crave the more productive route of creation, seems a little too \\"out of the blue,\\" if you know what I mean. Especiallly given his propensity towards violence throughout the entire book. It bothers my that Burgess implies that youth=an inclination towards detruction, and maturity=an inclination towards creation. It just doesn't work that way, to me. Maybe in this strange, distopian, nadsat-speaking world Burgess fashioned, but not in this world. In spite of my criticism, I realize why Burgess wrote the 21st chapter this way, as he said himself, \\"the twenty-first chapter gives the novel the quality of genuine fiction, an art founded on the principle that human beings change.\\" The problem is, I would have liked the change to have been more authentic and convincing.<br /><br />Regardless of the 21st chapter, this is a fascinating story of a thuggish protagonist with some serious issues, and the curious path he follows which brings into question the matter of moral choice, free will, and a human's inclination towards good and evil. A classic tale, for certain, with some crazy language mixed in. Now I have to go find the movie again and see what I think of it now.rip on Nadsat. (P.S. Any one want to govoreet in Nadsat with me?

The first three chapters were hard due to the new language the author uses. (recommendation: get the dictionary from the web and print it so you can look up the new words). After a while you can read with no trouble. At the beginning I was astound by the violence and couldn't understand how this book got good reviews. But as I got to the middle part it changed pace and the depth a in which the author goes to show us how society deals with violence or differences was mind blowing. I just hope my daughter can understand what was able to appreciate at her age. It is written well. The violent parts are really strong you feel like you are there. The other sections really make you think about life, society, laws and our behavior. I really recommend the book	2012-10-08

This book was the first book I ever read with the \\"Anti-Hero\\" in the main role.  I think any book that throws up such an unlikeable character as Alexander LaStrange and still manages to capture its readers is a classic.  Obviously, most people will compare this book to the ever popular Stanley Kubrick movie of the same name.  Whereas, I enjoyed the movie (its acutally one I own) I felt that the book drove the main points a little deeper than the movie did.  Whether you think prisons are to lax or too strict, you will probably find something in this book to agree with.  I don't think Anthony Burgess' point was to make you feel any specific way about criminals or prisons, but just to experience them from all sides and perhaps make you realize that, as with most things in life, there are layers upon layers of factors that complicate any issue.  Nothing in life is straightforward as most people would have us believe.	2012-05-23

Chances are that you have already seen the Stanly Kubrik adaptation of this novel and are looking for the full experience that inspired the (half-hazardly done) film.<br /><br />Anthony Burgess takes a unique look into the world of the dark and depraved aspect of humanity, from the point of view of an exceptionally dark and depraved individual.<br /><br />This version of the novel is as it was written originally, including a final chapter that was not included in the American prints, nor touched upon in the film.<br /><br />As for my 2 stars: the language in this novel is extremely hard to keep up with in this novel due to the excessive use of Cockney slang and odd usage of other words and phrases (even foreign and entirely fictional ones), most of which gives no hint whatsoever to their meaning or definition.<br /><br />I do not mean that you have to be able to read Chaucer or Dante Alghieri to follow this, but you will probably need a pad and paper for notes unless there is a \\"Clockwork Orange Word Key\\" on some website. If there is a more \\"Americanized\\" version in PRINT, I would suggest that first, since there isn't one for Kindle.<br /><br />Read a sample and you will see what I mean.	2012-05-21
