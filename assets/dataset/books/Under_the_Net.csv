This debut novel by Murdoch from the 1950s was on some list I saw of the best novels of the 20th century.  I guess that shows how bad the novels from that time period were.  This is a novel about nothing, and I didn’t like the characters, either.  What is the deal with this book?  I do think the portraits of people that Murdoch has her principal character, Jake Donaghue, draw are poetic and interesting.  Otherwise, this book is a big fat goose egg.  The closest comparison I can make is to Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis – another book that has proponents, but which I hate.  Quotes (all from the first couple of chapters, when I still found this a bit interesting):<br /><br /> “Subtle people, like myself, can see too much ever to give a straight answer.”<br /><br /> Jake hears a random person shout this at a (tight-lipped) peripheral character:  “You are pathologically discreet!”<br /><br /> A character once said to Jake “that to find a person inexhaustible is simply the definition of love.”<br /><br /> I thought Anna was going to be a principal character, but no, she wasn’t.  I liked Jake’s description of her, though, including that “her private life must be an almost full-time activity.  This has the sad result too that her existence is one long act of disloyalty; and when I knew her she was constantly involved in secrecy and lying in order to conceal from each of her friends the fact that she was so closely bound to all the others.”  Jake also says that Anna’s “emotional promiscuity” never turned him against her.	2015-01-18

The writing is a little stilted and I have yet to find any of the humor others mentioned. I read a lot of English suspense writers, like P.D.James, Elizabeth George, etc. Murdoch just doesn't measure up. The story and the characters seem remote and shallow, so it's hard to immerse yourself in the book. I may not finish it, since I seem to avoid sitting down to continue reading. Being an avid reader or many genres--especially mysteries and other types of English novels (Kate Morrison; Kate Adkins)--this is unusual for me. Sadly, I purchased 3 Murdoch books, which now will probably be give-aways.	2014-11-05

Iris Murdoch took a leaf out of Beckett's early 1st novel,Murphy,in having a peripatetic narrator,who moves around London,in a series of picaresque adventures of a ne'er-do-well kind,the tone bohemian/offbeat,and both narrators have jobs at some stage in hospitals.Her very 1st published book,Sartre:Romantic Rationalist,had given her ideas of existentialism and contingency, Jake  `goes with the flow',but all reality is not constant or unchanging,as Jake searches for the truth,stability,love,the uncontingent. Both Beckett,who moved to France, stopped writing in English,wrote then in French,to strip away the phenomenal traps of language;and Murdoch,through Hugo,the philosopher/film-maker,moves away from theory and generality,in the move towards truth and the particularity of the individual situation itself,for Jake to escape the net of language,to crawl under the net,to live with it and to see behind it. Hugo's ideal is silence.<br /><br />Jake is tossed out of Madge's flat at the beginning and has to look up old flames and acquaintances with his sidekick,Finn.He finds Anna Quentin,who puts him on to her sister Sadie.Jake,being a writer-hack,translating the works of a French writer.He also through his friend Hugo Belfounder,explores truth through forms of dialogue with each other,how language(through his book The Silencer) traps us in its conceptual nets.Murdoch shows how through the  miraculous vitality of life-a series of hapless adventures or episodes in which the hero is constantly side -tracked and hilariously thwarted from pursuing his ends,followed by periods of reflection on those actions and drinking-we drive onwards.The relationship between appearance and reality,the search for truth and the desire to know if one can ever truly know another person,is a central theme.Jake Donague's aim is to become a writer,who will write this book.<br /><br />Through a process of his relations with other characters we come to know Jake.His interpretations of events and the people around him is always wrong,but they are presented to us as if they are right.Murdoch depicts the vulnerabilities of  the human being,who is not immune to the contingencies of the world.We move throughindividual desires,intentions and minds.A woman Jake is in love with says:\\"Only very simple things can be said without falsehood,and the simple things are the quotidian.\\" Jake's frantic odyssey catapults him all over London and back to Paris,before restoring him at the end of the book to the bosom of Mrs Tinckham,much the wiser for his adventures,ready to pen this novel we've been reading.We've travelled through an erotic comedy of errors,swims in the midinight Thames,broken into flats,survived revolts in film studios,escaped from hospitals,kidnapped a dog in a cage.Murdoch's genius is to present the solution to these existentialist dilemmas on the surface of the book through the hilarious forms of ludic absurdity.How fiction is a a reflection of reality,by removing veils of illusion,the artist searches for truth throughthe medium of language,Jake can grow into someone who can produce real art,have real relationships,be moral with words.	2014-06-14

I don’t mind reading about a lazy bum who will never live up to his potential, but the humor was at like a 5, and it needed to be a 10… on my arbitrary scale of funniness. I was flat out bored for stretches of time. Murdoch seemed to be stalling the plot until the last 20 pages when the banal “twist” comes out. I didn’t miss the philosophical points about the difference between how people seem and how they actually are, thinking of someone as an idea rather than a person, yadda yadda yadda, but the intelligence of this was mixed up with a bunch of shenanigans. The bar crawl and night swim in the Thames, and actually that scene when he’s eavesdropping out on a fire escape and the neighbors across the way start harassing him, thinking he broke out of an insane asylum, those were entertaining little episodes. Everything else has kind of blurred together into mushy nothingness.	2014-05-19

It is a comic novel in the sense that a series of misunderstandings can launch a fruitless quest with many misadventures and odd characters along the way. I found the characters vivid and the situations in which they found themselves ironic and often ridiculous. This was Iris Murdoch’s first novel, published in 1954, but the situations and relationships will be all too familiar to the readers. There are scenes of such humor that I can imagine how they would play out in a comedic film. In this review I would first focus on character development, then the unfolding plot, then the layers of meaning that this master writer weaves into this great first novel.<br /><br />Jake Donaghue is the primary character. He sponges off others, works only enough to cover his expenses  of which his bar tab is his greatest expense, and yet is bright and witty. Even though he is bright, Murdoch puts him through more outrageous encounters that you can count. Despite his intelligence, he often makes bad mistakes and choices, and the reader gets to follow these wild adventures at a hectic, never sit still pace. Murdoch was a professor of philosophy and wrote books on philosophy as well as her novels. Yet this novel is full of action, from start to finish, even if some of the action seems totally fruitless.<br />The storyline or plot would be hard to describe since about fifteen characters are introduced who all interact in a social network of greed and misunderstanding and non-reciprocated romantic attractions.<br /><br />There are bound to be multiple interpretations of this rich multi-layered novel. For me the novel was about the vast and almost impossible task of understanding other people, their words, their actions, their intentions. How easy it is to be launched onto a tangent just because of a misunderstanding or misinterpretation. So what do we do about this situation? Murdoch would indicate that vast misunderstandings and misinterpretations are a factor of human life and the only answer is to keep running, keep experiencing, keep living, and allow the large pieces of the puzzle to come together gradually so that hopefully you can benefit just a tiny bit in the small insights we are afforded in life. The insufficiency of language to convey truth and meaning is certainly part of this theme. Yet Murdoch keeps it light and witty, never burdening the reader with didactic heaviness.<br /><br />This is one of the few books I would read again, this time with a red pencil to identify all the wise and witty commentary that fills this funny novel.	2013-11-17

The difference is that this hero, Jake Donahue, is actually a decent human being, albeit somewhat misguided. The novels could be considered similar, also, in that they are all comic (or aim to be) and feature fantastic escapades. The difference is that this novel is actually funny. Very funny, in fact.<br /><br />Jake claims to be a writer, but he actually spends all his writing time translating French novels into English. Ousted from his free lodgings by a lady friend, he goes in search of new digs, and returns to a former love, discovering that maybe he still loves her. But it seems that she has become involved with another old friend of his, Hugh, with whom he had once had grand discussions about philosophy. Jake becomes obsessive about finding Hugh again. The plot from here is complicated, but logical, and comes to a very satisfactory conclusion. It includes laugh-out-loud accounts of the kidnapping of a movie star who happens to be a dog and a fist-fight in a film-set of ancient Rome. All this mayhem seems logical and inevitable, surprisingly.<br /><br />Jake's fault, which he finally realizes, is of \\"having conceived things as I pleased and not as they were.\\"<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. It was great fun.	2013-02-07

The book came out in 1954, and is set in London and Paris,  It does not seem dated, which is rather odd, given how difficult life was in Britain in that period.  It is narrated by Jake Donaghue, an impecunious translator of French novels into English, and follows his wanderings through London (and eventually to Paris) in search of various people he knows.  There are long philosophical discussions, few of which lead anywhere in particuar: perhaps this is post-was existentialism in action.<br /><br />As to the story, there are very funny bits, and terrific set pieces, but I kept wishing that Jake would settle down and follow one goal (or person), rather than constantly shifting targets.  Also, at the end of the novel all the relationships that Jake thinks he understands turn out to be something else all together.  That changeability makes several of the characters difficult to care about very much.<br />I did end up being rather fond of Jake, but the dog is still the most sympathetic character in the novel.<br /><br />One's response to this book, I imagine, is very much a matter of taste.  There is no question that it is beautifully written, and that it is at times very funny.  But it is also degage, and on some level -- for me at least -- inconsequential.  All very clever, like beautifully decorated desserts, but not necessarily satisfying.	2012-12-02

Let me intercede here that this novel contains a lot of philosophy, which will leave some readers snowed and disappointed.  What I think this book is \\"about\\" is Christian faith.  The plot is basically tragicomic, with positive, negative, and neutral events as in real life.  But there are certain scenes that are definitely Christian allegories.  For example, after Jake, Finn, and Dave go bar hopping, someone has the idea to take a skinny dip in the Thames.  The one person who refuses is Dave, the Jewish philosophy professor.  Obviously this is a baptism scene... but notice the nuance of antisemitism in the case of Dave.  And prior to the dip, in a bar, someone says that the one thing that'll never perish is the Jews.  That makes me uncomfortable.  What is Murdoch saying?  Straying from the present novel, if we look at the devil figure in _A Fairly Honourable Defeat_, Julius that is, he's a survivor of a Jewish concentration camp.  [[ASIN:0141186178 A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)]].  Murdoch took some heat for that and was put on the defensive...<br /><br />Anyway, the tragicomic plot plus the Christian allegories create a sense of ordinary reality going on while sublimely there is, behind it all, a Christian order.<br /><br />If you just want a good laugh, then skip to the dognapping episode.  It had me in stitches.  But I take her antisemitism very seriously.  The most important thing I learned in college was the Holocaust [[ASIN:0061320684 The Cunning of History]].  The humor may seem innocent, but please be aware of certain racist attitudes in this novel.	2010-11-29

He never thinks an action through to the consequence, he treats his friendships lightly - taking them for granted or doing stupid, silly things to sabotage them.<br /><br />This book isn't about action and adventure.  It's a slow, quietly witty journey through a period in Jake's life.  It explores friendships, loves, jobs and heartbreaks.  It has quiet humor - in fact, in a way this book reminds me of the few Nick Hornby books I've read (minus the language).<br /><br />Despite being written in the 50's, UNDER THE NET is not dated and it's very easy to relate the story to modern day times.  It's a short novel - so if you are worried that a meandering journey might be something that would bore you don't worry... it'll hold your interest and give you a good dose of philosophy to boot.	2010-08-08

He furthermore concluded that anyone who finally comprehended the meaning behind the language of \\"Tractatus\\" would realize that its arguments were senseless; to quote the Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, the reader can \\"throw away the ladder after climbing up on it\\" and experience the world directly through contemplation rather than through philosophical discussion. \\"Under the net\\" of language, then, lie the truths of the world.<br /><br />Yet it's not essential to have an understanding of Wittgenstein to enjoy the zany farce of Murdoch's novel, whose characters are hunters of truth in its pure manifestations (love and freedom), as well as its illusory aspects (money and success). The chief seeker is Jake Donaghue, short of cash and without much prospect for any meaningful source of income. Jake has been freeloading in a friend's apartment; when she becomes engaged to be married, he's homeless as well as poor. Along with his sidekick, Finn (who serves as a less dependable Jeeves to Jake's ungentlemanly Wooster), he sets out in search of a new home and instead embarks on a series of adventures: a peek at a bizarre theatrical performance by mimes, a night of pub-crawling, a day at the races, a dog-napping, and a visit to a film studio whose riotous outcome prefigures, as much as anything, the finale of \\"Blazing Saddles.\\"<br /><br />During his journey, Jake runs across three old acquaintances: a former girlfriend; her sister, a famous actress; and most important, Hugo Belfounder, who had been a fellow patient at a clinic testing inevitably unsuccessful cures for the common cold. During alternating bouts of deliberately induced illness, the pair held philosophical conversations, to which Hugo contributed nearly all of the original thoughts. Jake in turn converted these pronouncements into a book, \\"The Silencer,\\" published without telling his new friend. Only after he'd finished the book, however, did Jake realize that the profundity of Hugo's opinions had been frustrated by his own attempt to render them into words. Jake's embarrassment over both his deceit and his failure had caused him to break ties unceremoniously with Hugo, who has since become a filmmaker. (Although this suggestion of truths masked by language is one of the more overt allusions to \\"Tractatus,\\" biographer Peter Conradi points out that the character of Hugo is based not on Wittgenstein but on a Cambridge friend of Murdoch's who was the philosopher's star pupil.)<br /><br />There are a number of wildly unpredictable and often absurd subplots involving the four old friends, all based on the miscommunication that results because each of them is in love with another, but none of them is in love with each other. It's a circle of love right out of an Elizabethan drama.<br /><br />In spite of its philosophical borrowings, Murdoch's first novel is her most fast-paced--and it's certainly her wackiest. At times, it's even downright silly, and looking for meaning in the fun is like tracking down the literary references in a Buster Keaton film (they exist--but does it really matter?).

Ejected from his latest rent-free living arrangement by a woman friend who finds a \\"real\\" boyfriend and wants her flat to herself again, Jake and his dreamy sidekick, Finn, run off to their buddy Dave's house to try to find another (free) flatmate or two.        The journey is hilarious and pitiful at the same time. Jake truly lives for the moment. Just as the reader adjusts to Jake's newest situation, he jettisons himself into a new place, new relationships, new goals, even a new pet dog which he steals for his own leverage purposes, then becomes too attached to give the pooch back. He revisits a long-ago incident of dishonesty with a former friend, chases the elusive shadow of an old girlfriend, and finally comes face to face with the man he cheated long ago. All along one gets the uncomfortable, prickly feeling that Jake is running, running, hiding from the truth: the truth about the book he wrote that stole another's words and insights; the truth about who he could have been if he hadn't been so shiftless. The title of the book, in my humble opinion, is a metaphor of how truth catches us, in contrast to the popular notion of seeking after truth. Murdoch presents truth as a hunter and humanity as the prey. We make our wild attempts to fool Truth, as Jake does all through this delightful and powerful novel, but in the end, Truth triumphs and we are caught \\"under the net\\" like an insect caught for a collection under glass.

Eventually, the scenes tie together -- the later scenes make the prior scenes  become more appropriate.  Within a matter of days, the humor of this book has Jake  kidnap a movie star dog, experience the falling of Rome (on a movie set at least), visit a mime theater, engage with a bookie in fixed races, engage in a drunken leftist movement, and sleep in a bearskin suit when evicted from his home.<br /><br />The madcap adventure of a little more than a week encapsulates much.  The humor, a bit stale after five decades and a country apart, still resonates in today's world and would make a wonderfully sarcastic film.<br /><br />The writing, which is like her peers and some of the great British writers who preceded her, is more descript and more detailed than modern-American prose, and exemplifies the writer and her achievement.	2006-12-04

In fact, after the first 70 pages or so in which I was unsure about the direction I was being taken, I found that I was laughing aloud for much of the book (rare in my case), which is not something I had expected. The set pieces of the book are conceived with great originality & a deeply quirky, Irish type of humour. The characters themselves remain - intentionally - rather hard to fathom for most of the book, adding to a mildly dark sense of mystery which leads us (and them) on from one episode to the next. This also adds to our questioning about what direction the author is trying to take us. Inevitably, the answer is largely subjective - but what added to my appreciation of the novel after I finished reading was that rather than attempting to draw a broad prescriptive lesson about life, it is rather a celebration of the individual and offers humour and a kind of resolution - or at least positive progress - even in the midst of the most confused and unheroic of lives. This is a picaresque novel peopled principally by (lovable) roguish empiricists - not one for those craving a strong plot. I loved it. And I have an implicit confidence that this is an author of such skill & originality that I shall enjoy any of her remaining 25 novels (this being her first). Even when I have hugely enjoyed reading a book, I have rarely, if ever, looked forward to reading other novels by the same author with such confidence and relish.	2006-02-17

Jake is a 30-ish writer in London whose specialty is translating French novels to English to earn money, which he hasn't much of, and he hasn't written anything original for sometime.  Despite being semi-dependent on friends for survival (and a strong aversion for actual work), he seems very likeable, generous, loyal, and would not compromise his ideals for easy money.  He is living everyone's romantic version of poverty, where everything works out and he's never actually desperate, in fact it's a bit too fantastic how he gets out of trouble sometimes, chasing one urgency (a long lost love or friendship he has to repair) after the next. But it's a feel good book because of that, and maybe in post-World War II London all this was not impossible.  In the end, this very impressionable and impetuous character is more wise, has writing and employment plans, and is just as poor.<br />Jake's fascinating friends also add entertainment - the social climbing Madge and her friendly/devious fiancé Sammie the bookie, Jake's strangely loyal &quot;assistant&quot; Finn, his socialist filmmaker friend Hugo, and the attractive Quentin sisters who are two corners of a sad, 4-way unrequited love structure.  Something exciting or dangerous is always happening.  <br />The novel is also filled with nuggets of wisdom from Murdoch, that you can't help but feel she's pondered a lot on love, the intellectual life (vs. accomplishing work on a daily basis), and many other things.  She describes swimming and judo with such zeal you feel it is something she has done, rather than just having researched on it.  Perhaps it should not have been told in the first person because at times it does not sound like the thoughts of an immature male writer who is still finding himself, but someone wiser.  It takes thirty pages (out of 286) to get going and I'm not sure everyone will relate to Jake's character, but it's certainly a worthwhile read.	2003-03-08

Well, the fact is strange, not the novel. I read Murdoch's Unicorn and shrugged my shoulders. Read Black Prince and had a feeling that I had wasted my time. But Under the Net! - mmmm... A perfect book for young existentialist beer-lovers, who love dusty bookshops, who keep late hours and hate regular jobs. And, please, don't blaspheme this book by analysing it too much (like some sophisticated reviewers here tend to do). Enjoy the ride and have some beers with good friends instead. If you like deconstructing things to symbolic bits and pieces, read Camus instead.	2002-08-04

I had read Murdoch's The Sea, the Sea years ago (well, I finished it Dec 4, 1983, if you really want to know that) and had been underimpressed by it. I should have read the reviews on Under the Net on this site before I read it.  That would have given me some clue to what I was supposed to expect and derive from the book.  I am no student of Ludwig Wittgenstein, but if I had known that Hugo was supposed to be based on him, it might have made me more alert to what he did,e.g.  But I read the book as I do any other, and I found it very unimpressive--and I know that is my fault, I suppose.  So I guess what I am saying is that if existentialism, Wittgenstein, Sarte, Bellow, etc., don't get you very interested  you might not enjoy this book.  I found I was glad when I was nearing the end--tho I admit that  the last ten pages I rather enjoyed!	2001-11-11

In this uncomfortable blend of existentialism and the picaresque novel, James &quot;Jake&quot; Donaghue is an  aspiring, though incorrigibly lazy, writer.  He makes a living, barely, by translating French works into  English and he stays in the flats of friends.  As the novel opens Jake is informed that he, and his man  Friday, Peter &quot;Finn&quot; O'Finney, must move out of their current address, because Madge, who has been  letting them stay there, has found herself a fianc&eacute;.  Over the course of the rest of the book, the  flat-broke Jake desperately seeks for ways to avoid having to do any work and for places to stay  courtesy of his friends.  Much of the story is taken up with his broken friendship with Hugo  Belfounder, a philosopher turned moviemaker (apparently based on Ludwig Wittgenstein), whose  theories Jake presented in somewhat bastardized form in one of the few books he actually wrote  himself.  Another subplot involves a dognapping of an animal which is an unlikely film-star.  The book  ends, as it began, with Jake broke, not writing, and looking for a place to stay.<br />I suppose some of the scenarios in the book are amusing if you are British and are immersed in the  works of philosophers like Wittgenstein.  For the rest of us, it's all rather tedious.  A picaresque where  neither the central character nor any of the people he comes in contact with show any signs of personal  growth and development seems an exercise in futility.  Personally, I agree with the friend of Jake's who  suggests :<br />  Society should take you by the neck and shake you and make you do a sensible job.  Then in your  evenings you would have the possibility to write a great book.<br />To the extent that Jake in this sense embodies all of England between the Wars and the rise of Margaret  Thatcher, I suppose you could interpret the book as depicting the adverse effects of the dole mentality  on British culture.<br />But Iris Murdoch apparently intends the book to convey a somewhat more existentialist message.  As  she says :<br />  All work and all love, the search for wealth and fame, the search for truth, like itself, are made up  of moments which pass and become nothing.  Yet through this shaft of nothings we drive onward  with that miraculous vitality that creates our precarious habitations in the past and future.  So we  live; a spirit that broods and hovers over the continual death of time, the lost meaning, the  unrecaptured moment, the unremembered face, until the final chop that ends all our moments and  plunges that spirit back into the void from which it came.<br />Here I come back to my eternal quarrel with existentialism : if it's all pointless anyway, then why in the  name of God do you spend your time writing about it, and for what earthly reason should I waste my  time reading what you write ?<br />I must admit myself to be at a complete loss to explain the presence of this novel on the Modern  Library Top 100 list.

It is a great thing to make someone laugh out loud while reading and this book did it continually. Whether it be the point where Jake Donaghue sits outside Sadie's flat listening to the \\"plot\\" against him with the neighbours poking him to see what he'll do or the superhero stunts of Jake and Hugo at the Roman set saving Lefty. I couldn't stop myself from laughing at the clever wit of the situation. But, what is amazing is that behind all of this there are deep philosophical thoughts at work, but the spaciousness of these thoughts never intrude upon the enjoyability of the story. It is similar in that way to Bellow's Henderson the Rain King, but the comedy in this is up a few notches more. The story is deeply routed in London (with a side-trip to Paris) and this location no doubt gives all the more joy to readers familiar to the area with its deep descriptions of particular sections and jabs at the reputations of others. Yet, this too did not detract from the book's enjoyability because of the eloquence of her descriptions. \\"When caught unawares,\\" Jake reflects, \\"I usually tell the truth, and what's duller that that.\\" The book is one long reflection and so, according to this line, we are thenceforth suspicious of all we are told. Many points of his memory are probably deeply exaggerated and this would explain some of the all too convenient coincidences. But, who cares? It's a good, entertaining story. Ultimately, Murdoch is presenting a rather ideal view of the independent will of the free spirit. Jake's hope is neatly set forth at the end. But the ideals of living in regards to work and love, wealth and fame seem to be given a manageable frame in which to work in. What Murdoch seems to be saying is that we must be swept along by the course of our own story and not be caught \\"under the net.\\" The old argument which Bellow echoes also of Being and Becoming. Living, not without reflection, but containing the dialogue between oneself and existence within because once it is set out on paper it becomes a story, not life. \\"The substance of my life is a private conversation with myself which to turn into a dialogue would be equivalent to self destruction.\\" Jake is learning to live more fully by instinct and self-forgetfulness.

The story of the would-be writer Jake D. who struggles to find a proper  literary philosophy to ignite his career, nicely reflects Murdoch's own  intellectual struggles in writing &quot;Under the Net&quot;.  Although this  might sound rather high-blown and tedious, it is not, for by mixing the  philosophical musings with the picaresque form, Murdoch ensures that the  story is highly dynamic and entertaining. We follow Jake through a series  of bizarrely comic and breathtaking incidents, and observe how he develops  his initial egoistical Sartrean world-view to a truer and more profound  understanding of his fellow-beings. It is fascinating to watch how this  development unveils Jake's pretentiousness and shapes him into a mature  artist.  In sum, this novel simply has and is everything, drama, farce,  mask, satire etc. and Murdoch has mixed these elements with such dexterity  that one can doubt whether she ever wrote a better book. In saying so it  must also be emphasised that &quot;Under the Net&quot; foreshadows much of  Murdoch's later work.	2000-09-20

A recurring theme in the novel is the idea of reflection, in both  senses of the word: Jake is continually thinking about ideas, and he is  also forever trying to see himself as he really is. Many of the instances  of reflection in the novel occur near rivers or are connected in some way  to currents.      Under the Net examines the nature of reality through the  many reflections in the novel. Iris Murdoch uses these reflections to  mirror the true relationships between contingency and non-contingency,  between appearance and reality: <br />Events stream past us like these crowds  and the face of each is seen only for a moment. What is urgent is not  urgent for ever but only ephemerally. All work and all love, the search for  wealth and fame, the search for truth, like itself, are made up of moments  which pass and become nothing. Yet through this shaft of nothings we drive  onward with that miraculous vitality that creates our precarious  habitations in the past and the future. So we live; a spirit broods and  hovers over the continual death of time, the lost meaning, the unrecaptured  moment, the unremembered face, until the final chop that ends all our  moments and plunges that spirit back into the void from which it came.  (p244) <br />Contingency and non-contingency, like reality and appearance, are  mirror images of each other that are interconnected; one cannot exist  without the other. Despite the contingency and uncertainty surrounding our  everyday reality, we press on as part of the dialogue of life, and Under  the Net stands as a fascinating exploration of this uniting of concepts.	2000-05-06

He goes from determined pursuit to avoidance in the blink of an eye. Whenever he gets what he has  indicated that he wants, he spurns it.  He is maddeningly arbitrary, but  also fascinating because the author deftly expresses the flux of thought  and impulse that motivate human action (and inaction). The other characters  serve primarily as foils for his shifting attitudes.  Only by conspicuous  exertion is Jake able to even conceive of Hugo, his hulking sometime  companion, becoming a watchmaker or of Finn, his longtime  &quot;shadow&quot;, returning to Ireland. They exist only as they play a  role in Jake's life.  The most significant development, in a story where  things largely end up where they started, is Finn's replacement by a dog  (not necessarily a flattering commentary on Finn). <br />The one non-ancillary  character is &quot;Mrs. Tinck&quot;, the news store proprietor, who,  benevolent soul that she is, comes across as an interesting person in her  own right.  The book effectively begins and ends in her shop.  She is also  the one who, gently, helps Jake to take himself less seriously. She  accomplished this, in a scene at the end of the story, in a fashion that  left me smiling as I closed the book.<br />While some of the plotting seems  unnecessarily complicated, some of the dialogue far too (intentionally?)  stilted, and there are too many coincidences, the overall effect of this  book is dazzling.  The best scenes: Jake and Finn stealing Mars; Jake  following Anna into the Tuileries Gardens; and all the scenes with Mrs.  Tinck more than offset the comparative clunkers with Lefty Todd and Hugo.   The author's expatiation on the tension between silence and expression  (truth and falsehood) came across as heavy-handed spoof, especially with  the passage from &quot;The Silencer&quot; and the mime theater interlude.   <br />All in all,however, in its sly and subversive way, this book is  &quot;one of the wonders of the world.&quot;	2000-01-03

Murdoch also reveals her story slowly, layer by layer, turning  what we believe will be little more than mild humor into a mystery of  character assassination.<br />And it reads very much like a mystery, the kind  that you just don't find anymore. But here it is not a dead body that is  the victim, but rather a living, breathing one. But is he as much a victim  as he likes to think he is?

The other two are Lord of the Flies by William Golding and Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis. All three books were included on the Modern Library's list of the 100 Best English Language Novels of the 20th Century. So quite a year for British letters.<br /><br />Under the Net tells the story of of Jake Donaghue, an early 30-ish would-be author struggling with writer's block, indolence and an astonishing lack of impulse control who at the beginning of the book is evicted from his living quarters. His somewhat picaresque adventures following that misfortune form the bulk of the book and give a wonderful portrait of Britain almost a decade after the end of the Second World War.<br /><br />Murdoch was in her mid-30s when she published Under the Net. It shows. There is a maturity in the narrative, comic though it is. Her characters balance caricature and nuance to become delightful, her descriptions are keenly observed (her narration of Donaghue's travels around London are as intricately precise in their topographic detail as James Joyce's of Dublin in Ulysses) and her situations are both entertaining and realistic. The highlight for me: the Rube Goldberg dognapping of a movie star pooch from an apartment—while it's still in its cage!<br /><br />I was also very impressed by the fact that this debut novel by a female writer would pull off a first person narration by a male protagonist so seamlessly. Very hard to do well, especially in your first go-around.<br /><br />Is Under the Net one of the 100 best English language novels of the 20th century?

US	35549652	R3NRXDHWLX3XCT	B004DI7HYM	445043218	Under the Net	Digital_Ebook_Purchase	4	3	4	N	Y	Under the Net,	written by Iris Murdoch, is a philosophical journey between London and Paris, their main inhabitants are Jake Donaghue, Dave Gellman and Magdalene Casement (Madge).<br /><br />The themes touched, described in a picaresque way are `Existentialism' v `Metaphysics'<br /><br />The purpose of this novel is to show the life of a penniless writer named Jake Donaghue his close friend Finn and Dave Gellman a professional philosopher fan of Wittgenstein, sparing of words and thoughtful the antithesis of Hugo a supporter of a brief and intense felicity.<br /><br />This novel is written in first person this imply that the reader will be immediately a part of his/her favorite character.<br /><br />The plot engaging your senses will be captured by the strength and weakness of Jake an  immature and lazy boy, his job is translating  novels from French into English.<br /><br />Under the net is also a prison where we are  trapped, being unable to convoy our sentiments through our words.<br /><br />Under the net is also a retrospective and intimate journey, using the \\"philosophical's silence\\" against a chaotic London i.e. our souls, we will rediscover the true meaning of friendship and an uninterested love.<br /><br />\\"There are some parts of London which are necessary and others which are contingent. Everywhere west of Earls Court is contingent, except for a few places along the river. I hate contingency. I want everything in my life to have a sufficient reason. Dave lived west of Earls Court, and this was another thing I had against him\\"<br /><br />I love this phrase it implies that we can resolve our problems through the dialogue;  are we able to do that?<br /><br />\\"I hate solitude, but I am afraid of intimacy. The substance of my life is aprivate conversation with myself which to turn into a dialogue would be equivalent to self-destruction\\"<br /><br />This is the best example of our contraddiction between an intimate reasoning against the use of our words for resolving a problem.<br /><br />\\"But love is concerned with possession,' I said. `If you knew anything about unsatisfied love, you'd know this.' `No,' said Anna strangely. `Unsatisfied love is concerned with understanding. Only if it is all, all understanding, can it remain love while being unsatisfied\\"<br /><br />What is love? or better what is the differences between love and infatuation? if love means possession I prefer an unsatisfied love because I will research continuously the meaning of love.<br /><br />\\"There's something fishy about describing people's feelings,' said Hugo. `All these descriptions are so dramatic.' `What's wrong with that?' I said. `Only,'said Hugo, `that it means that things are falsified from the start. If I say afterwards that I felt such and such, say that I felt \\"apprehensive\\" -- well,this just isn't true.' `What do you mean?' I asked. `I didn't feel this,' saidHugo. `I didn't feel anything of that kind at the time at all. This is justsomething I say afterwards.\\"<br /><br />This is  our inability to describing a feeling (which is extremely personal) through our own words.<br /><br />\\"What would happen if one were to speak the truth?' I asked. `Would it be possible?' `I know myself,' said Hugo, `that when I really speak the truth the words fall from my mouth absolutely dead, and I see complete blankness in theface of the other person.' `So we never really communicate?' `Well,' he said,`I suppose actions don't lie.\\"<br /><br />This is a philosophical puzzle what is it the truth? is it established a priory? or is it strictly relative to our personal interpretation? if so it will be fair or unfair?<br /><br />\\"What is urgent is not urgent for ever but only ephemerally. All work and all love, the search for wealth and fame, the search for truth, like itself, are made up of moments which pass and become nothing. Yet through this shaft of nothings we drive onward with that miraculous vitality that creates our precarious habitations in the past and the future. Sowe live; a spirit that broods and hovers over the continual death of time, the lost meaning, the unrecaptured moment, the unremembered face, until the final chop that ends allour moments and plunges that spirit back into the void from which it came. So I reflected; and was reluctant to get off the bus\\"<br /><br />In my opinion this is the most vivid definition of philosophy for instance our  infinite research of truth and love.we live; a spirit that broods and hovers over the continual death of time, the lost meaning, the unrecaptured moment, the unremembered face, until the final chop that ends allour moments and plunges that spirit back into the void from which it came.
