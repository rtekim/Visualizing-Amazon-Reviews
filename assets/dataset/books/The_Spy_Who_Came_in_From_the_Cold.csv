But there was a shift in the Zeitgeist underway, and the cultural percolations and pyroclastic flows broke out in a number of different manifestations. The Spy Who Came in From the Cold was one such articulation of the sea change at hand. It is a novel about which the phrase \\"mind blowing\\" may have been coined. Maybe you never had the experience of suddenly realizing that everything you know is wrong, if so, then read this story and savor the flavor--of nothingness, of Cat's Cradles and searchlights casting for faults in the clouds of Delusion. What Le Carre achieves with this novel is nothing short of a devilishly clever magic trick by a gifted conjuror. Both the structural and the expressive pattern of the story elements combine to support one another with an intricate, and elegant harmony. The art of the layered construction, on every level, is spectacularly beautiful. And the story resonates as clearly today as it did 50 years ago. And illuminates the moral equivalency on both sides of the conflict. \\"These people terrify me\\", George Smiley says, \\"and I'm afraid I am one of them.\\"<br /><br />The tale's denouement, evoking both the sense of futility and inevitability; the mechanisms that had been constructed and set in motion would necessarily unfold along an unavoidable trajectory, to a certain only possible conclusion. The die had been cast the minute that Leamas accepted the assignment. His cluelessness was foundational, the fulcrum of the whole lever of the operation. Nobody had ever told a story of espionage quite like this before. There were no precursors; there was nothing to compare it to. Our spies have to be greater confidence artists than their spies, and that's the fitness test for the modern reality. The most powerful weapon is the manipulation of your adversary's psychology. Shape their conclusions, their fears, their greed, their vanity. Make them think what you want, and do what you want. Oh, and always recognize THEIR lies, first before they uncover yours. Admit nothing, deny everything, make counter accusations. It's an abstract, cold, and ruthless game. But somebody's got to do it. Somebody ALWAYS has to do it. I'm grateful it isn't me.	2014-05-12

Now that I have... well, I still consider it to be the consummate spy novel.  What I was surprised to note about The Spy Who Came In From the Cold was the relative lack of action compared to many of the modern attempts in this genre.  This is a story of words: of conversations... of the cause and effect relationships wrought by both what is and what is not said.  It's a really interesting read.<br /><br />Alec Leamas is a British intelligence operator who runs operations in West Berlin. Unfortunately, he's lost every valuable agent he had to a ruthlessly clever East German operative named Mundt. At the outset, Leamas is recalled to London where he is offered a new assignment: to kill Mundt. When he accepts, British Intelligence demotes Leamas. He pretends to become a disgruntled drunk who eventually loses his job, gets gypped out of his full pension on a technicality, and ultimately gets sent to prison for assaulting a grocer who won't extend him credit. This is all a ploy is to make Mundt and the communist side believe that Leamas may ripe to defect and provide them with valuable inside intelligence on British operations.<br /><br />They, of course, take the bait... and so begins the game of verbal cat and mouse.  Much of the narrative is consumed by interviews and conversations held between Leamas and his inquisitors.  Every word, every move, every subtlety of conversation both verbal and nonverbal must be carefully crafted (by both sides!).  Everything Leamas says and does must \\"sell\\" the right story.  The information he gives must be just enough to let them jump to their own conclusions based on their own fears and prejudices.  It's an incredibly complex story.<br /><br />I don't do spoilers here, of course, so suffice it to say that Leamas himself eventually finds that his assignment isn't quite what he thought... that he too is a pawn in a game far more complex than he ever realized.  Reading this book is like peeling back layers of an onion... there is more and more continually coming to light.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:  An interesting and intelligent spy story... full of twists and unexpected complexity.<br /><br />This review originally appeared on my blog.

US	25080785	RTITEMGGBRAPL	0802714544	682630645	The Spy Who Came in From the Cold	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Stiff Upper Lip	The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is the first Le Carré novel I've read - coincidentally, just as another adaptation of his Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy hits the theaters.  Like some other reviewers here, I must say that for a book touted as \\"one of the greatest\\" etc., I found the The Spy Who Came in from the Cold to be no clean kill. It has a lot of problems at the basic prose level, and although it was Le Carré's third novel, it reads less like the work of a polished fiction writer than of a government agent who had a fair grasp of narrative. It reminded me strongly of Peter Wright's (non-fictional) Spycatcher, which of course covered the same 1950s-60s Cold War timeframe.  I assume an editor spent quite some time manipulating The Spy Who... into publishable shape. There is little action, of course - the plot is largely spun out in clandestine meetings, tribunals, interrogations, and of course flashbacks - which is not strictly a problem, except that Le Carré's dialogue, on which all this plot depends, is rather clumsy. Characters simply announce how they feel in bold, primary-color emotions. Someone suddenly figures something out, and then it's explained to us in breathless monologues which read like field reports, not human speech.  The love interest, Liz, is a pathetically simple character, moreso (if this is the comparison we are damned to return to) than any Bond girl. The grand English xenophobia is also on display, less overwhelmingly so than in Spycatcher, but still palpable: men with secrets fearful of those they perceive to have filthier secrets - queers, Jews, Arabs. Even though this novel is almost half a century old, its contention is that there is no moral high ground in espionage, so why revel in small-minded prejudice?  The legacy of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold must surely originate from its final pages. The writing here is still workmanlike and yet at its conclusion I felt Le Carré had more to say, in a finer way, than perhaps he was capable of at the time. It's the novel's only emotional note, and well-struck. You'll continue thinking about this book afterwards because of the conclusion (which is just about the best praise I can give, I think) and yet the strength of that conclusion also makes the 250 pages preceding it, their dry exposition and underdeveloped characters, that much feebler.	2012-01-16

It is certainly the book which brought John le Carre to the fore.    Before I continue, I'd like to give you a warning. Please skip the Introduction by William Blake, as it will completely wreck the pleasure that you should get from the story as it reveals all, including the ending. You can go back to read the Introduction.    I well remember the first time that I read this book. I was about fifteen and I was an officer cadet at a Naval school where we could assemble in the mess hall every Saturday evening to watch a big screen feature film. I saw The Spy who came in from the Cold with Richard Burton was on the \\"Coming Soon\\" list. I borrowed the book from the school library and read it before I watched the film. I enjoyed both immensely, despite the relatively small differences in the story lines.    Revisiting the book a few decades on has been equally enjoyable experience. As you would expect, my life since those days has given me a different viewpoint, particularly as I served on the IGB (Inner German Border) during my Army days, and spent a lot of time with members of families who had spent years of forced separation from their close relatives. It was so sad.    This book is about the duplicitous games that spies play and how these affect the lives of others. There are lots of descriptions of the plot amongst the hundreds of online reviews, so I am not going to repeat that for you. What I would like to say is that this is a fast-paced story of Cold War espionage which draws you in. Every word and action of every character has to be carefully considered by that person, as any slip could place them in serious danger. That makes the story exciting.    This is one of those books which you simply must place on your have-to-read-before-I-die bookshelf.	2011-11-16
US	51879616	R28THEVFBJIC9J	0802714544	682630645	The Spy Who Came in From the Cold	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Still a hot read after the Cold War	There was a time when we spied on the Soviets, they spied on us and the writers who wrote spy fiction liked it that way.  In the height of the Cold War, the Berlin Wall stood as more the a physical barrier.  It split a city and two contrasting life styles, each living in well reasoned fear that the opposition was trying to wipe it off the face of the earth.  These were simpler times, an easy to be a spy novelist like John le Carre, a master of writing about the craft of spying.  Gist for the mill jumped off headlines in major metropolitan dailies and out of Joseph McCarthy inebriated mind.    In the hands of a good story teller, a master spy could reasonably navigate his way through Moscow without drawing more attention than a single match stick in a generic and unmarked book.  But, these days, trying to have an American go incognito in Damascus would be like try to slip vodka into James Bonds's martini.  You are just going to set off some alarm bells.  From the spy novel perspective, the new world order doesn't lend itself to the kind of deception we appreciate.  la Carre, like many of the old masters, has struggled in this new world.  In his newer work, he makes good movie but lame novels.    But, it's still a good time to read his early stuff, when spies were spies and the Soviets weren't trying to be like us.  His leading man are lumpy and flawed, never to be played by Sean Connery or Clive Owen. Instead, think of Ricky Gervais, if he took a serious turn, or Phillip Seymour Hoffman, though like a good spy he can do anything so it's not really fair to cite him, but you get the picture.  In the Spy Who Came in from the Cold, la Carre's breakout novel, the leading figure is old, fatigued and miserable.  Alec Leamas spent a life lying to his closest associates, mistrusting the motives of others and wearing a secret face, leaving him alone and in cold comfort as his usefulness as an agent comes to an end.  Packed with this emotional wreckage, Leamas accepts one moreassignment before he can come in from the cold to finish a career that has ended sourly.    It's impossible to do the plot justice without spoiling the novel's conclusion, but there is a reason Time Magazine rated it one of the top novels of all time and Publisher's Weekly called it the greatest spy novel ever.  As with many great novels, sometimes a great plot and strong story telling can obscure a deeper message.  So it is with The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.  la Carre has a lot say about the morality of spying, why we do it, who it benefits and who it hurts. His characters, presented as archetypes, are fully fleshed with quirks and humanity. There are no cardboard cutouts here.  No short cuts in character development.  Yet, in each character we see more than a person, we see a class of people, or should see it anyway and the whole package paints an ugly picture.  The Cold War is gone.  We won that one without firing a shot, through as a result we have the greatest and most expensive military in the world.  The military, like la Carre's early spy novels, may be bit dated, built for a world left behind and unmissed, but that does not mean that we can't admire the majesty and the power.	2011-10-11

Leamas is in charge of a West Berlin spy division but all of his agents are being killed by East Germans under the direction of Mundt.  He returns to England where a plot is hatched to make it appear as if he is disgraced so that he can seem to defect and implicate Mundt as a British agent.  A complication arises when he becomes involved with Liz Gold, a British Communist Party member, but the plot seems to be working.<br /><br />I was so caught up in this story!  I kept trying to figure out what would happen next and what the ultimate outcome would be (I was not even close) as the layers of intrigue and betrayal unraveled.  The ending was completely unexpected to me and while not what I wanted, entirely fitting with the story.  I'm used to the more glamorous pictures of spying such as in James Bond but this is altogether different.  It's dirty, often crude, and certainly unglamorous.  As presented, there are no clear-cut \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" guys in the Cold War battle as both the British and the East Germans use the same methods and motivations without the guidance of morals.<br /><br />Leamas is painted as largely fed up with the spy game as bloody and cruel; he claims no specific ideology, whether to Communism or capitalism or something else.  It's just what he has to do and what has to be done.  Liz is a sweet girl, loyal to Leamas, but baffled by spying and the dark side that the public doesn't usually hear about.  Mundt is a great villain; he became a Communist because they were the ones in power but as a former Nazi, his main belief seems to be antisemitism.  He is cold and ruthless.<br /><br />Overall: An intriguing look at Cold War tensions and spying.semitism.  He is cold and ruthless.

John le Carr&eacute;'s early fiction takes me back to the days when there were clearer distinctions between the good guys and the bad guys. Yet much of the tension of this, his most famous novel published in 1963 before I was born, questions those very distinctions with a tale of a man cruelly used in the service of a fiendishly clever plan.<br /><br />Alex Leamas is a British secret service operative who has just lost his last man behind the Berlin Wall, the Soviet-imposed breeze-block-and-barbed-wire barrier between East and West Berlin. Now he wants revenge against Mundt, the East German counterintelligence chief responsible for their deaths. Which is just what his bosses offer him, under the cover of putting Leamas out in the cold himself and into the hands of the East Germans, where Leamas can then go to work on undoing Mundt.<br /><br />\\"You can't be less ruthless than the opposition simply because your government's policy is benevolent, can you now?\\" the shadowy figure called Control tells Leamas. Leamas senses something off in this, but goes along just because it's rather personal between him and Mundt.<br /><br />Le Carr&eacute; crafts a tightly wound, ever-constricting narrative framework that communicates within it a larger message, that maybe counter the views of both East and West the rights of the individual do sometimes matter more than the perceived safety of the masses. It's a rare book where the author's philosophy actually thickens the plot considerably, as we are made to care about Leamas the pawn more than almost anyone else in the story, including Leamas himself.<br /><br />Bleak but never dull, \\"Spy Who Came In From The Cold\\" is a quick read. Regular le Carr&eacute; readers more familar with his later novels will be surprised by his lack of narrative digression, though many of his later calling cards, such as May-December romances and the sense of rot within Western power structures, are here in full display. Critics sometimes have at le Carr&eacute;'s habit of setting long sequences that consist of people talking to each other in place of action, and that happens here, too, but when le Carr&eacute; is on like he is here, those chat-fests have a way of feeling more deadly than gun battles do in other thrillers.<br /><br />The best involve Leamas and an East German spy named Fiedler. Fiedler is a true believer in the Soviet system and thus sees nothing wrong in killing individuals in service of the State. Does that make him wrong? Leamas believes in nothing, it seems. Does that make him better, or worse? Conversation between them is biting, funny, and ultimately more than a bit heartbreaking.<br /><br />Do I think this is the quintessential spy novel? Well, overall I probably enjoy reading Fleming or Forsyth more than le Carr&eacute;, but when he's this good, there's no one to touch him. It's a novel that makes points that stick with you, while at the same time delivering suspense and excitement in sometimes overpowering doses.

The drama of the Cold War provided the greatest backdrop for the spy novel in history, as the Super Powers and their allies deployed spooks to tip the balance of power, however slightly.<br /><br />The mechanics of spying during the period have the feel of verisimilitude, no doubt due to the author's first hand experience in the trade.  The most obvious contrast are the adventures of James Bond in the same period, outrageous by comparison.  The atmosphere of existential doom lends the book a special third dimension, which really gives it legs.  I was surprised by the ending, and didn't expect the spy to 'come in from the cold' in quite the way he did.  Also, nice touches of 'life' obviously felt by the author:  \\"He was the typical petit-bourgeois, cautious, complacent, mean.\\"<br /><br />Modern feminists should have a problem with the portrayal of the chief femal protagonist, Liz Gold, as a kind of tremulous foil, not unlike Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa in Casablanca.  However, such criticism would be somewhat anachronistic, like saying there is too much smoking.  At least books like this get those relations 'right' for the time, and aren't as histrionic in trying to 'recreate' them as in, say, Madmen.  A more serious criticism is that the story is occasionally marred by pedantic moralizing, as in the penultimate chapter, with the 'debate' between Leamas and Liz, for example.  That could have been understated a bit more, like their love affair, which never rises to breathless passionate pronouncements.<br /><br />A book like this may be the closest an Englishman may come to Existentialism, and remains a bracing tonic to the pieties of the day.  In the genre of Cold War spy novels, this book will always be a classic.	2011-03-18

Then I saw that the master storyteller Graham Greene had blurbed it as \\"the best spy story I have ever read\\" so then I knew I had to read it. And it really is excellent. Just don't expect it to be any sort of James Bond thriller; this is the polar opposite.    Alec Leamas is a life-long secret agent for England working in West Berlin against the Soviets (mostly in East Berlin). He's quite experienced though not very brilliant, seen a lot of agents on both sides rise and fall with rather bad luck for his men recently, and then is called to London for a little chat with his superior about his future. That's not much of an intro, but I won't spoil the story by revealing further any of the subsequent plot (and plot twists). Beginning and ending with the Berlin Wall, the book transcends the spy novel genre and the Cold War setting to become an exploration of the power and futility of individuals within and against ideologies and organizations (as contradictory as that sounds). Sure, it's cynical and gray and depressing, but that doesn't mean you won't be glad you read it.    I'm headed to the library to get the movie version now...	2011-02-24

Fortunately, I found The Spy Who Came In From the Cold at a yard sale and decided to try again.    This is Le Carre before he decided he was a Great Writer and just wanted to tell a story about what spying was really like; the numbing, insidious corruption that seeps into the souls of men who are professional liars, who must live lies every second of their lives, who dare not trust either their superiors or their subordinates.  Alec Leamas may be the most unpleasant, misanthropic protagonist in fiction, and yet Le Carre manages to make us sympathize with him anyway, because his misanthropy is so thoroughly justified by the life he has led.  That he is still capable of any love at all after what he has gone through, even the limited love he shows in the book, appears as a triumph of the human spirit.    The plot is intricate, unpredictable, and yet believable.  One point, though, remains unresolved at the end.  The true explanation for Mundt's actions at the beginning must lie elsewhere from what he have been led to believe.  Those who have read Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (or who, like me, saw the BBC version) may have a good lead to the truth.    There is an unfortunate point; Le Carre hints here at the irrational anti-Americanism he has since more fully expressed in print, a sentiment disguised as a critique (sometimes warranted) of American policy, but which clearly has far deeper roots in offended British nationalism.  Happily, there is much more to Le Carre than this; sadly, there may not be much more to the critical reputation he enjoys.	2010-08-21

No matter how many times I see or hear or read it, the ideological conflict as presented in the form of a dour-faced, steroid-pumping, muscle-bound Russki versus a hard-scrabble, street-smart, freedom-loving American is enough to bring back memories of bomb drills at school, a vision of Reagan declaring the Great Satan, and those epic Celtics/Lakers battles that defined a decade. All of us here at The Literate Man freely admit that we still pause in our channel surfing to watch long scenes (which we all know by heart) of Rocky IV, Red October, and Red Dawn, among others. Ah ... those were the days when gas was cheap and you knew who your enemies were or, more importantly, where your enemies were. It seems so long ago now.    What was I talking about again? Oh right, the novel. Sorry about that, I got lost in Cold War reverie.    So, I picked up my first le Carré novel, Absolute Friends, in the Frankfurt Airport on return from a visit to the former East Germany and the Czech Republic in, oh say, 2004. The novel chronicles the Cold War relationship of Mundy and Sasha, who work together to help MI6 bring down East Germany and eventually find themselves betrayed by the forces of globalization, which (as products of the Cold War, like me) they never fully understand. It was a very enjoyable book, and I made a mental note to pick up more le Carré as I was able. I saw the film adaptation of The Constant Gardner and I read Mission Song, both of which I enjoyed, though neither as much as Absolute Friends. And so, when my mother sent along a copy of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (thanks, Mom!), I thought it would be an enjoyable read and a trip down memory lane along the lines of what occurs when I watch any of the aforementioned Cold War movies.    I. WAS. BLOWN. AWAY. It was like I was that high-tech PPSI punch-measuring machine at the end of the Ivan Drago training montage in RockyIV. This is--bar none--the best Cold War spy story we have ever heard, seen, or read. And I now understand why it was named one of Time Magazine's All-Time 100 Novels. Ok, so about the story. It's dark ... and I mean depths-of-the-human-soul dark, German winter solstice dark, Vito Corleone's office dark, well ... you get the idea. Alec Leamas heads up the West Berlin office of the British Secret Service (known as the Circus), until his best double agent is killed, his leadership comes under severe scrutiny, and he is recalled to London. Then, in the Cold War espionage equivalent of a last-second, Hail Mary pass into the end zone, Leamas is fired, sent to jail, and hung out for defection like a slab of beef set dangling from the roof of a den of wolves (sound familiar, The Departed?). Anyway, the bait is taken, the trap sprung, and Leamas goes over the wall to East Germany, leaving the lovely (love interest) Liz behind with instructions not to try to follow him. His mission? To frame his counterpart, the East German Muntz, as a double-agent for the British.     I'd give you the rest of the story, but then there'd be no point in you reading it. And you need to read it. The plot is exquisitely crafted, with twists and turns aplenty, but it is the psychological realism in the context of counter-espionage that sets the book apart from anything I have ever read on the subject. Le Carré does an excellent job of describing the amorality practiced on both sides of the Berlin Wall (and the English Channel) in the name of idealism. My advice? Turn off that rerun of The Hunt for Red October (as good as it is--I love Sean Connery as a Russki, I don't care what his accent is) and get your hands on a copy of this book. Do it now, comrade.	2010-07-15

There are no card games or cocktail parties, and no novel weapons and fancy gadgets. Instead, there are intelligent people playing mind games with each other, each only knowing a part of the whole story.<br /><br />The common theme throughout this book is that in the world of espionage, the ends justify the means. That ideals are an unnecessary burden that must be discarded in order to succeed. This message has just as much relevance today as it did when it was written; it's an interesting exercise to imagine this taking place with modern day terrorists rather than East Germans.<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for pulse-pounding action, look elsewhere.

For whatever reason, though, the 60's spy scene fascinates me and I really enjoyed reading this book as my first foray into the period and genre. Le Carre seemed to reach right into my mind and create an atmosphere, and on more than one occassion his outline of a setting allowed me to imagine a vivid and detailed scene. While I wish I had started the series at the chronological beginning, each of the characters were quickly brought to life and became distinct players in the story. I found myself confused once or twice as the story meandered through the twists and turns of a spy ring, but I know that's exactly what Le Carre wrote for. Excellent book, and one that can be read in a single sitting.	2010-07-08

I read Secret Pilgrim a few years ago, and after spending most of my afghan deployment reading Clancy, I decided to shelve him for a bit and return to Le Carre. When I received it in the mail, I was surprised how short it was (the edition I read was only 112 pages), and yet The Spy Who Came In From The Cold hooked me from the very beginning and didn't let go until the very end. The characters are real and believable - ironically I felt the most empathy for Liz Gold and Fiedler...the two main communists. The supposed \\"good guys\\" are son of a bitch bastards (Leamus, Mundt), who I found myself rooting AGAINST until the very end. Even then, they aren't good people. Nature of the game, I guess...     Set in Berlin in the early 1960s when the Wall was first constructed, LeCarre paints a beautiful portrait of the turmultous city at the height of the Cold War. The suspense didn't cease from the opening word to the final one. The ending was an ending, not a drawn out epilogue of events. Short, and to the point.    In summary: Read this book. You won't be disappointed.	2010-06-12

Clearly the critical reviews of The Spy... are in the minority on this website and in the literary world altogether, but I have to say that this one didn't completely do it for me. The Spy... is lauded as the definitive spy novel and one that set the standard for the genre, so going into it I had extremely high expectations and could not wait to tear into it. However, after finishing it I have to say that it was not at all what I expected and for that, I'm a little disappointed.    Now, I know that one reason this novel is supposed to be so great is that it portrayed the world of espionage in \\"real terms\\" as opposed to the \\"martini, girls, and fast cars\\" lifestyle of James Bond. Given that, I wasn't expecting wild car chases and a protagonist with a seemingly unlimited capacity gun magazine; however, I was expecting some sort of action... anything. This entire novel is people talking, save for the first and the last chapters (known as \\"The Wall chapters\\"). Besides those two chapters, the novel is a lot of talk about past occurrences, so much so that you start hoping something will happen in the now.    I'm not saying this is a terrible book by any stretch, as it has clearly withstood the test of time. However, I will say that I respectfully disagree with those willing to give The Spy... the title of best-in-genre. I'd--without hesitation--reserve that distinction for The Day of the Jackal by Forsyth.	2009-05-14

It's a very good novel, with a refreshing economy to it.  At just over 200 pages it tells the story of a British spy who agrees to one final mission behind the Iron Curtain before he retires and `comes in from the cold'.  As one might expect of the genre, not everything is as it seems.  This is not a novel filled with explosions, high speed chases and witty exchanges.  This is espionage of the cerebral variety, where all the players are making moves and anticipating counter-moves at every turn. The spy game is completely convincing and the characters are fully realized, flawed human beings.  Le Carre gives us a hero who is pragmatic, tired, and bitter.  A far cry from the superficial slickness of James Bond and Hollywood blockbusters.<br /><br />The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is a smart novel with an uncompromisingly brutal ending that will resonate with the reader.  This is undeniably a benchmark in the spy fiction genre.  Highly recommended.	2009-01-14

The writer held me on the edge of my seat right to his thrilling finish, after which the characters and intrigues continued to linger in my mind.<br /><br />Through the eyes of Le Carre, a genuine spook, I became struck by the high drama of the Cold War period, including the stakes, the rivalries, and most interesting of all, the ambiguities. I say that despite remembering the late Cold War era because the author portrays the battle of the Soviet Bloc versus the West with a vividness and sensitivity one could never glean from TV broadcasts, newspapers and magazines. Le Carre's a brutal and fearless artist; weaned on a diet of Hollywood cliches where \\"the German\\" is usually cast as stupid, I was refreshed--even shocked--to visit a world where Mundt could be the smartest man in the room and where America's arch enemy just might win.<br /><br />Fantastic read.

There is no need for me to give you a rundown of the storyline; many have done that before me.

It was just okay at best - very rambling and with no real focus, it seemed.  What was I missing?  So I read \\"Single and Single\\" because I bought it at a church book sale.  It was really bad.  This just seemed like drivel from an author that had no idea where the story was going.  But I knew that Le Carre was the primo spy writer, but nothing I was reading was showing me any of it.  So I didn't panic, but instead read all of the reviews on Le Carre's other books.  Then I started at the beginning of his success with \\"The Spy Who...\\"  Wow!!

US	13629829	RPUMAHM0XX4ZX	0802714544	682630645	The Spy Who Came in From the Cold	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Cold Reality	The Spy Who Came in From the Cold has been heralded as one of the greatest spy novels ever.  John LeCarre, a British Intelligence agent who served during the Cold War until his identity was given to the Russians by double agent Kim Philby, wrote this timeless classic in 1963.  It covers the story of Alec Leamas, as an agent, friend, spy, lover, and killer.  Leamas takes on a mission to defeat his nemesis Mundt in East Germany, knowing full well it may be his last.  Le Carre wrote his novel as a conduit from which he could communicate his viewpoints on matters dealing with morals, politics, ideology, and world affairs.  Le Carre was able to do this without all the blood and gadgets so commonly found in your typical spy novel, and in the process, convey much deeper principles.     The novel was a quick and intense read; one that packed quite a punch.  The intensity comes not from the blazing guns of a secret agent, but the dialogue, treachery, deception, mind games, and aggression expressed by the many rounded and dynamic characters.  Those looking for a bloodbath or risqué spy novel will not find it here.  LeCarre tells his story with limited exposure to violence and sex, which made the story more raw and realistic.  The true catch of the story is the game of cat and mouse; the never-ending cycle of espionage that winds up enveloping the lives of both participants and innocents.  The life and nature of spy work is portrayed quite convincingly and one has to wonder how much of it came from LeCarre's own wartime experiences.  My father served in the intelligence community, and it's my knowledge of his experiences there that made me impressed with the way LeCarre's novel exposed the moral dilemmas and paradoxes associated with the perilous work of espionage.  As a political science major, I found the book was a metaphor for many schools of thought dealing with world politics and human nature.     Some would complain that LeCarre's novel is all about people's feelings, is too cold, or does not have enough action packed fight scenes.  They are exactly right, and those who say it takes away from the novel are missing the point.  This book was written to show the world that spy work is unglamorous, unrewarding, uncertain, immoral, and cold.  It serves as a reality check to those who are fascinated by spy work because they see movies like James Bond.  It exposes the real world, where there is no definitive good and bad.  It makes us question our own actions.  Luckily for us, not all literature or film is created for pure entertainment value.  Sometimes there is a brain behind the final product.   The Spy Who Came In From the Cold conveys the tragedies of war, along with the intensity of forbidden love, revenge, and betrayal.  Once you pick up LeCarre's novel you will not be able to put it down.  Finally doing so leaves you begging for more.	2008-10-23

He lets us into his characters' thoughts without giving anything away and they are not cartoonish. Although it is complelling, it becomes more of a puzzle and a history lesson about the cold war in the 60s than a genuine work of lasting literary value.  Le Carre can write an amazing sentence now and then, but a story so locked into the circumstances of the day it was written in creaks with a bit of rust after 44 years.  There are certain scenes and certain turns of phrase that put me off just a dash with their aged presentation, but I am old enough to remember the Berlin Wall and the machinations of both sides of the conflict, and it is a bit nostalgic to remember what things were like in the spy game before computers, satellites and cell phones.  Le Carre doesn't put his heroes through the ringer the way his contemporary Alistair MacLean did, but he can write suspensefully, and ultimately this novel satisfies the need for a good yarn, as well as challenging the reader to figure out what's going on before the book's hero does. The anticommunist preachiness that creeps in is also a bit much in light of the time that has passed and what has happened in the meantime, but that goes by fairly quickly.  It borders on melodrama without taking that final leap, but some of the dialog suffers all the same. It's a great taste of a bygone era of history, and of writing, and should be read as that.  If you're looking for the cutting edge of spy fiction, this book lies at the other end of the scale.  Anyone who writes a spy story owes Le Carre a debt for being one of the progenitors, but he didn't quite cross into literature territory the way Maughm did with the   Ashendon stories.	2008-06-17

At the hight of the Cold War, Alec Leamas is a British agent on a seemingly uncontrolled downwards spiral.

He resorts to drinking, and depressive thoughts, and revisiting the mistakes of his life. But of course the Game is played constantly and one should not trust anyone. Ever. In a world where double-crossings are common and triple-crossings not uncommon, can anyone trust long enough to find love?<br /><br />This book conveyed such an original atmosphere that many suspected JOHN LeCARRE being a former MI6 insider.

A surprisingly short novel, \\"Spy\\" packs in more high-quality twists and turns than most books twice its length.    Alec Leamus, Le Carre's protagonist, is a bitter British agent stationed in Cold War Berlin.  The Wall has gone up, which both divides the city and makes it a perfect hot-bed for agents of the communist and capitalist powers.  At the outset, the communists have the upper hand - they have killed all of Leamus's agents.  Leamus returns to England in disgrace and, worse, useless.    Or so one would think.  But Control, Leamus's boss, sends Leamus back out for one last mission - to bring down Mundt, the communist agent who destroyed Leamus's network.      What makes Le Carre's novels so special is how they unfold gradually.  This is not James Bond, where M conveniently briefs Bond at the beginning and clearly sets forth who the villain is and what his ambitions are.  Much of the action that occurs in \\"Spy\\" occurs for reasons that are only explained later.  As a result, Le Carre compels the reader to dig deeper into book, searching for clues and hints, only to have Le Carre reveal purposes and motives at the perfectly appropriate time.    Be warned - \\"Spy\\" is a bitter, cynical book.  Leamus has been around the block more than a few times, and he knows he is expendable. But even he is shocked and unnerved at the espionage game's ability to chew up and spit out individuals in pursuit of its own ends.  Readers seeking happy endings and tidy resolutions will be disappointed, but readers seeking a brilliant, unsettling, shocking spy tale will be thrilled.	2007-11-09

The suspense was there, the 'never-certain-what's-what' quality was there,  the serpentine plot, etc.  But for me perhaps most impressive was the overall atmosphere that permeated the story.  I would say a 'dreary realism' -- but in a good sense!  The reader is authentically submerged into the gray, secret world of espionage.  Nothing glamorized or oversimplified.  If anything, it is a tad too morally ambiguous to my mind.  Others would disagree.  The title of the book fits the contents to perfection.    The story builds effectively, and its climax-conclusion comes off as fitting.  I enjoyed it, and found it seamlessly written, reflecting considerable knowledge on the part of the author of the shadowy existence about which he writes.    For me (I'm a hard grader) it didn't rise quite high enough to attain a 5-star rating, but it's a near-miss.  \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is a slick and skillful novel that readers who like this sort of thing are apt to enjoy very much.	2007-09-23

The characters were either too cynical or had motivations I was unable to sympathize with, like the girl, who was a member of the communist party but in truth just wanted to get a husband. The book was very clear on that, she was as ordinary as it gets. Communists just recited typical communist propaganda, with a touch of nazism once in a while, and were hardly fascinating as the opponents. The ending was unsurprising, because it was obvious that one of two alternatives was true, and it wasn't even possible to admire the cold cleverness of the story. I don't know how it would puzzle anyone, even though the reviews say otherwise. If it had been a true story, at least I would know how espionage was really like. As a work of fiction I couldn't find anything in it to love, the characters or the plot.	2007-08-14

Alec Leamas and the agent, Karl, have already had a row over a woman.  The white searchlight goes on as Karl is crossing on his bike.  Leamas wants operational assignments.  He knows now he has been written off.  Leamas's counterpart is Mundt.  Leamas has been losing agents, Control reminds him.  Under him there has been a heavy rate of expenditure, a lot of dead agents.  Control believes the Circus should try to get rid of Mundt.  Leamas is to ferret out George Smiley.  He knows the case well.  Within a few months Leamas becomes a resentful drunken wreck.  Killing Mundt is to be Leamas's last act; afterwards he can come in from the cold.      In terms of quality this is not ordinary popular fiction, this is extraordinary.  The author writes in a subdued and steely fashion, powerfully. Subsequently Leamas becomes a defector.  Peters is to question him at a location in Holland.  Leamas learns he is wanted in London for an offense under the Official Secrets Act.  Liz Gold is a friend of Alec.  She is visited by Special Branch.  There is a connection between Alec Leamas and George Smiley, a card.  Peters, a Russian, delivers Leamas to East Germany.      Layers of deception, not surprisingly, constitute the story.  Journalists and lawyers are inquisitive.  Questions become ends in themselves.  Leamas is asked about his philosophy.  Having completed his first stage as a defector he is to be put on ice.   Much of the appeal of mystery stories is psychological description.  LeCarre, former member of the secret service and son of a confidence man, is in a premier position to create a full range of psychological types and permutations generated by acts.	2007-06-29

I won't gush about the things I liked, but here are two things I didn't like: the narrative perspecitive and the unconvincing ending.  As for the perspective, I wish the story had been told entirely from the perspecive of one character, like in his later books (such as Absolute Friends).  Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is also very very good (as long as you don't mind dealing with a really complex plot).  If you want a more modern espionage/mystery novel, try The Prisoner of Guantanamo by Fesperman, which has the same high quality and realism as le Carre's books. Barry Eisler is good if you are looking for an author who leans slightly more towards action and thrills, but not so much that it is unbelievable. (although they may be slightly less probable, Eisler's books are still quite plausible).     Also, I wish that Le Carre would not try to be so damned clever with his endings. It is a trap that many otherwise good writers fall into: they try to give the ending such a big twist that it stretches the limits of what one is willing to believe. The worst offense is that the author uses the cheap trick of concealing from the reader facts that the protagonist knows, but leading you to think that you know everything that is going on in his head.	2007-01-11

This was unnecessary and a little insulting to the reader's intelligence because le Carre has already made this point with the story itself.  However, I'll chalk this up to an author in his youth.   <br /> <br />All in all, I cannot recommend a better spy story.	2006-08-15
