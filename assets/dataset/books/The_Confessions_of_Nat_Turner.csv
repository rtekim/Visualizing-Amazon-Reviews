US,11191604,R1UEWHGUKAR54J,0679736638,158144239,The Confessions of Nat Turner,Books,5,2,2,N,N,"31 Years a Slave","After two stabs at writing a masterpiece novel (Lie Down in Darkness and Set This House on Fire), William Styron finally nailed it on his third try with The Confessions of Nat Turner (1967), a fictionalized but meticulously researched chronicle about the bloodiest slave uprising in the Antebellum American South, which led to dozens of deaths, both black and white.  Riveting from beginning to end, the story is told mostly in first-person flashback by Turner, who led the revolt, oversaw the massacres that resulted, and is sitting in jail awaiting execution when the novel opens. A broad outline of what happened is given early on, and then there is a long stretch of exposition as Turner gives us the history of his short life (he is only 31). Meanwhile, the reader is on pins and needles to find out the details of just how all the killings went down in the end—especially one particular killing. But that’s all told only in a rush near the end of the book.  Most of The Confession chronicles Turner’s increasing frustration with his life as a slave, his growing messianic complex about leading his people out of bondage a la Old Testament figures like Joshua and Moses (Turner is an obsessive Bible reader) and his inner conflicts over the implications of his self-imposed mission, which, to put it bluntly, will require indiscriminate mass murder.  Styron’s prose is exquisite in describing this world, and his characterizations shun the easy Manicheanism of the Django Unchained school, where caricatured heroes and villains manipulate rooting interests. Instead, as in real life, there are fools, knaves, tentative heroes and, mostly, unremarkable everyday people on both sides of the racial divide, forcing readers to think deeply about which way to sympathize. It is a society that seems strange and outrageous to us in the early 21st century, but one that was probably unremarkable to those who lived in it, having known nothing else.  Several characters throughout the novel remark how the idea of black slaves ever rising up to free themselves in this society is literally inconceivable, and certainly unprecedented. Turner achieves a modicum of success in bucking this trend through a combination of guile, perseverance, force of personality, psychological insight and plain, dumb luck. The 30-year-old carpenter Turner manages to gather a small group of disciples: yes, the New Testament allusions are obviously very deliberate, from Turner's “sermon on the mount” (delivered in a street) and his retreats to the wilderness to fast and pray (and where he has visions) to a “last supper” with his closest disciples.  After a short burst of very bloody success, however, Turner's rebellion fizzles. Part of the problem is that the forces he unleashes, brutalized by their slave experiences and haunted by their own demons, are not especially controllable. His last desperate attempt to reassert his authority leads to the climactic moment in the novel where Turner is forced to make a choice between his two most fundamental impulses. Does he choose wisely, badly or simply inevitably? It’s up to each reader to make that determination.  Many critics of the book have taken Styron to task for his portrayal of Turner, a black slave, pining for the virginal white girl Margaret Whitehead as simply exploiting a crude and insulting stereotype. I disagree. Given Turner’s psychology, his sexual hangups and his life experiences, it is perfectly understandable and plausible. Forbidden fruit has always been a big turn-on (check out Alan Paton's excellent Too Late the Phalarope for a prominent example from the opposite perspective). Plus, from a simply artistic standpoint, it gives the novel its most powerful moments, both dramatic and thematic.  The Confessions of Nat Turner won Styron the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. They get no argument from me. This is a masterful piece of literature that is both thought provoking and engrossing from end to end.",2015-08-27

I cannot intelligently discuss the political furor caused by The Confessions when it was first published:  how could a white man write convincingly about the experience of a slave in America?  Many hated and denounced Styron as racist, and continue to do so.  I cannot say who is wrong or write in this argument.  Many African American writers, including James Baldwin, shared my own personal feeling about the book, that it was a beautifully written and powerful novel, one of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br />Above and far beyond the discussion of The Confessions political merit, it would have been a tragedy if I refrained from reading it for that reason.

The need to combat racism is ever-present; but in the all-or-nothing atmosphere of the late 60s it's not surprising that this novel should have fallen victim to an increasingly polarised debate. That it did so is to be regretted, however.<br /><br />A good novel should have the ability to offer new and intriguing insights to any succeeding generation of readers. On this basis alone, THE CONFESSIONS OF NAT TURNER delivers. Many readers have written passionately about Styron's complex and gripping account of Nat Turner's evolution into the instigator and leader of the only violent, armed revolt planned and enacted by slaves in the history of American Slavery. Styron offers compelling and uncomfortable reasons for why the revolt failed in even its most limited aims, outside of wholesale and bloody revenge. His eye is unremitting in its evaluation of the moral failings of everyone involved in the Special Institution. And his humanity, poetic sensibility and fairness shine through an emotionally heart (and gut)-wrenching story.<br /><br />What struck a chord with this reader was the exchange between Gray and Turner in Part One, where Gray berates Turner for his messianic complex and his belief in God, citing such a psychological complex and system of belief as being the well-spring of the whole murderous endeavour. It's a recognisably `modern' attitude on the part of a character so virulently opposed to emancipation, racial equality and manumission. It resonates in our day and age when so many atrocities are committed in the name of this God or that God; and where political violence is clothed in the rhetoric of a Heavenly Mandate against this or that unclean group and/or Other. Styron places Nat's Divinely-ordained blood-bath at the very centre of his story, and ends with Nat Turner's belated realisation that hemay have misunderstood God's message all along. Amen. And yet that in no way vitiates the fact that Slavery as a system brutalised millions and millions of men, women and children, black as well as white.<br /><br />If we can reassess this novel and allow it to breathe on its own terms, we may re-discover a genuine American Classic.",2013-08-05

If you're a part of the New York State Regents program you learned it again during the 12th grade. But so little is actually known about Nat Turner, short of the confession he \\""dictated\\"" to attorney T.R. Gray on 5 November 1831 in his unheated, open to the elements jail cell. We also know of the personal witness accounts of his execution, including a posthumous article in The Southampton Insurrection by a writer named Drewry that said:<br />\\""The bodies of those executed, with one exception, were buried in a decent and becoming manner. That of Nat Turner was delivered to the doctors, who skinned it and made grease of the flesh. Mr. R.S. Barham's father owned a money purse made of his hide. His skeleton was for many years in the possession of Dr. Massenberg, but has since been misplaced.\\""<br />These are the facts we're given in William Styron's 1966 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\""The Confessions of Nat Turner\\"". There are so few books in print that have had the ability to bring water to my eyes. Perhaps no more than four in total. William Styron is responsible for two: this one and Sophie's Choice.<br /><br /> Nat Turner's Confession is two fold. The first of course is literal and pertains to the God-driven war he executed against the dominant white man from his place of bondage. Mr. Styron's is very open about how he took remarkable license with actual facts, but the truth is that so many of the events he has given us in this book- all in first person and most in remembrance since the entire book takes place during the four days before Turner's execution at the gallows in the small town of Jerusalem, Virginia, but there's much here we haven't studied about, seen pictures of and certainly nothing here that is remotely worse than modern day treatment of our current sub-cultures (of which African Americans remain one.) It is not at all possible that in the some 8 million slaves who lived and died in America, that every single event of this book didn't happen somewhere to some0one. And as survivors of the Holocaust have said about Spielberg's shocking film, \\""Schindler's List\\"" it isn't even 10% of how awful it really was.<br /><br /> Perhaps the greatest injustice to Nat Turner was for his first Master to teach him to read , write and do math. Then, the Master's neice gave Nat his own Bible and began to teach him the word of the Lord. As a young \\""pickani**y\\"" he was brought out for company and made to perform: \\""Go ahead. Ask `im to spell somethin'. Nothin' easy neither- give `im a hard word.\\"" The boy grew up knowing that he was special because he was the only slave on that plantation- or any after it- who could read write and reason. Turner was a man and one of his greatest sins was that of Pride, a sin for which he went to his death carrying fear and doubt. Each of his visits from God could be explained biophysically- one after a five day fast, awakening to a full eclipse of the sun, the vision of the morning star on the day of his execution. These were enough for Turner- or just enough - because in addition, he heard the voice of God telling him that like the Jews out of Egypt the Blacks needed to be freed from the whites. Indeed, even the kindest abolitionists brought about hatred inside Nat Turner- a man who (at least in this book) chose to die chaste. Styron is very subtle about this but he manages to suggest that Nat Turner is a prophet as was Christ and Moses. The similarities are small, but they're everywhere. But Styron's Nat Turner is also sickened and embarrassed by the \\""nigg#rs\\"" (as Turner calls them) who play dumb for the Massah, who ARE dumb, ignorant, foolishly chasing sex and apple wine or brandy. This, despite the fact that Turner himself modifies his speech patterns and accent around the white people but we gather that Nat Turner believes that the others are not in fact performing as they behave and speak in this way even when nary a white man is around, whose eyes he never meets, It is just such an act of indignation (a white slave owner forces to black slaves to fight each other and a crowd of black men- bond and free - cheer) that first causes Turner to stand up and admonish these men to take pride. He thus becomes known as the Reverend.<br /><br /> Still, between the foolish bumbling of the slaves and the white skin of all others, Nat Turner feels hatred: Another sin.<br /><br /> Perhaps the greatest element is the sin of doubt, since Turner was very sure of his mission until the very day it began. A wide-spread mass murder that would cost the lives of nearly two hundred people that began with Nat freezing up- out of fasting exhaustion or of doubt. Nat Turner was the very last execution to occur so he was, fiction and non-fiction, more than aware of the price that some sixty odd black men involved in this mass execution paid, to say nothing of the more than one hundred white deaths, some of them children from infancy to age thirteen, were to suffer at his hand.<br /><br /> The strongest element of Styron's book is that upon careful thought we are forced to look upon the bottom line: birthright. As it has always been. In 1966, Styron's book won the Pulitzer in the midst of the National Civil Rights Movement (the first). As we think of the white two year old who died by the hatchet blow of one of Turner's men and think anything other than his death was caused by a miracle of birth? And Nat himself, as a very young boy, was forced to watch his mother raped by a white visitor at the plantation simply because of how he was born? The mind can continue on thinking: A white man in America is, by birth, the luckiest person on the planet, a white woman in America is second- though only slightly higher than a black man in America. A  Jewish child born in Poland in 1930 was no more lucky than a Jewish Child born in 4145BC. A black man born in the Congo from any time in history right up to this writing is incredibly unlucky.<br /><br /> Birthright. Birthwrong. And a million  stories that exist as a result. It is hard to draw the line between fiction and non-fiction. If you want to live through reading in the  time period here through non-fiction, then read Elizabeth Dowling Taylor's recently published A Slave In The White House which not only outlines the same domesticity for both skin colors but even touches upon Nat Turner. The difference is that a story that is told well is remarkably rare. And William Styron, the generation between Faulkner, Hemingway, Steinbeck and Irving, Lamb and Kingsolver has written a book well worthy of study. Do not read it fast. Treat yourself to some self- education. Rest in between sections and when you find yourself breathless, put the book down instead of turning pages ahead to see how long before there is a break of some kind- a literary park bench on which to rest- because writers like Styron are rare and books like The Confessions of Nat Turner even more rare.<br /><br /> Rarer still is a reader who does the book justice.

It is a haunting rumination on the sadness of the human condition.<br /><br />Nat Turner is a slave in Virginia in the early 1830s. All his life he has been better off than most slaves, sometimes even comfortable, to the point where he once looked down on his fellow blacks. But slowly he changes, a moment crystallized when a master promises Nat his freedom while a coffle of slaves en route to Georgia pass by. Nat's reading of the Bible enforces a calling he hears to serve God by freeing his fellow men. It's a calling that will leave hundreds dead, and Nat a broken, self-questioning man in his cell awaiting execution.<br /><br />A magnet for controversy since its 1967 publication, \\""Confessions\\"" is a white secular liberal's take on a black religious zealot's life a century-and-change later. As many reviewers here point out, it's not meant as history but fiction. Turner himself is something of a mystery to historians, his only words come down to us through the writings of his oppressors. Styron wasn't writing here to fill a hole, however; he wants to employ Turner in a different cause than Turner's own, to examine how one might find meaning in a meaningless existence full of strife and injustice. Once you go with that, rather than fight it as a vision perhaps different from yours or the historic record, \\""Confessions\\"" becomes a helluva ride.<br /><br />A central riddle of the story is why the rebellion happened where it did. Virginia in the 1830s was a far milder place for slaves than was the Deep South. Styron portrays Jerusalem, where Turner led the slaves to not just rise up but indiscriminately slay every white, as almost pleasant. The greatest harm done Nat by a white is by a well-meaning owner who simply doesn't follow through on his good intentions. Styron's point, I think, is this: It's not the individuals but the institution itself that brings the wrath of centuries down upon man, woman, and babe alike.<br /><br />\\""Does it seem a hopeless paradox that the less toilsome became the circumstances of my life the more I ached to escape it?\\"" Turner asks us, his silent audience in his cell. \\""That the more tolerable and human white people became in their dealings with me the keener was my passion to destroy them?\\""<br /><br />Styron writes with an easy eloquence and a direct point of view that makes the pages whiz by. As his character of Nat is the narrator, we come to know him from the narration as much as by his actions. There are moments of uneasy levity, like some of the antics of Nat's various white masters, but overall the tone is serious. Even when action is sparse, you know it's coming, and when it does, the descriptions are ferocious.<br /><br />Styron spares no one's sensibilities. Nat has an explicitly rendered dalliance with another male slave, and sexually tangled feelings about white women, one in particular, which seems to influence his religious visions. His rebellion is presented as a take-no-prisoners escape attempt, rather than a suicide mission of retribution, which undercuts how many radicals prefer to see Turner today. White Southerners, which Styron was himself, are depicted in various shadings of damned and depraved.<br /><br />Styron struggles, as do the historians, with the concept of who Turner was and what he wanted, but I think where he succeeds, brilliantly, is in finding some principle for his existence. If there is any hope for man, it is in the passion to right wrongs against impossible odds. Alas, another brilliant aspect to Styron's book is its suggestion of ultimate hopelessness.<br /><br />Bleakness does not equal greatness, but when backed up by the depth of knowledge, of human feeling, of pure nerve and biting wit, that \\""Confessions\\"" contains, you don't put it down, let alone argue with it. The arguments come after, which is where they should with works of art like this.t like this.",2011-03-28

Turner was the literate slave who plotted and led the rebellion against white families in southeast Virginia in 1831, \\""hastening 55 persons to their grave\\"", as Styron phrases it from the mouth of Turner's court-appointed attorney.  Styron bases his novel on the actual confessions of Turner, recorded by the same attorney during Turner's short incarceration before hanging.  Styron offers up his intention \\""to try to re-create a man and his era, and to produce a work that is less an 'historical novel' in conventional terms than a meditation on history\\"".<br /><br />Styron's powers of description are on considerable display.  He pulls you into the story as surely as if he were there.  He thoroughly captures the burning resentment and ultimate hatred produced by a lifetime of degradation under the institution of human slavery.  Styron takes the time to portray several types of slaveholders, from Nat's first enlightened owner who helped to educate him and made extensive plans for his ultimate freedom, to a pair of surly and benighted men into whose hands he fell, and ultimately to the benign but traditional master who was the first victim of the uprising.<br /><br />Styron made me thoroughly identify with the slaves all the way up until the actual murders began.

Before one comments on racism, it seems best to explain who you are.  I am a caucasian male who would be classified as liberal.  I acknowledge that, from my perspective, I don't always see racism or feel it in the same way as many minorities do.  As with anyone, I can only view things from my perspective.    I found this book to be beautifully written, heartbreaking and with many layers.    As a previous reviewer wrote, this was a book where no character was portrayed as fully good or fully bad.      Nat Turner was highly intelligent and his rage and actions were understandable given the horrific injustice of slavery.  I think his portrayal was complex and sympathetic.  I felt I understood why a man exposed to what he had been exposed to and treated as chattel would act as he did.  I was horrified by some of the choices to kill children but again I can't say how I would act in his situation.    This is a very hard hitting, disturbing work and I admire it tremendously.  A point that is made very clearly is that slaveowners were different.  Some were sympathetic and some were abusive.  In the end, their characteristics did not save them.  They were all slaveowners and were targets of the uprising.  There were no good slaveowners and I like that this point was made.    There is a segment where Turner lusts for a young white girl and some believe that this is a demonstration of racism in that it propagates the idea that all black men want white women.  I think it is a lot more complex than that.  As Styron writes in his afterword, Turner only killed one person personally and it was a young girl who he likely knew.  Styron invented a story to connect the two and it made for a very powerful scene when Turner kills her.    Whether you think this is racist or not, I'd encourage you to read it.      I think it's an absolute masterpiece and viewing it as racist seems a very twisted interpretation.",2009-03-18

It was only after I was into the book that I learned that this vintage sixties' book was the subject of a major controversy over the depiction of the title character, Nat Turner.<br /><br />I learned that Styron openly acknowledged fictionalizing large portions of Turner's life, including his motivations for leading the slave revolt.  I also learned that Styron's largely fictionalized portrait of Turner outraged many black leaders of the time.  Rather than painting Turner (entirely) as a hero, called to action by the injustices of slavery, Styron created a darker picture of a man fixated on religion, a vision of himself as a prophet, and frustrated by lust and desire (particularly, for a young, blond haired white girl).<br /><br />As I read the book, I search my own feelings, and felt that if I were black, I would certainly have objected similarly.  We all need our heroes, who become much larger as symbols than they could ever be as people.  For the sake of those that come after, such icons are perhaps entitled to be treated with a greater level of sensitivity and care--even at the cost of literary restraint.<br /><br />It is here that the story gets fascinating.  After I finished the novel, I read Styron's Afterword.  Styron was truly stung by the criticism and in the Afterword, provided an elegant and persuasive defense of his writings.  While I will not say that Styron entirely changed my position, he definitely made me see the other side of the argument.  The dialogue between Styron and his critics not only allows the reader to consider one of the great social and political issues of our time, but permits the reader a unique insight into the thinking of a great writer--and suffices, in and of itself, as a reason for reading this novel.

Despite these and other glowing reviews, the book was also denounced as racist garbage which perpetuates dangerous stereotypes about African-Americans - particularly the stereotype of the sexual aggressive black male.      I will talk more about this in a moment, but first I would like to say that I did not find anything racist about this novel.  I found it instead to be a raw, brutal, yet strangely beautiful, work about the horror and injustice of slavery.  While there are several scenes of physical brutality and deprivation between masters and slaves in this novel, Styron, through the voice of Nat, focuses more on the grinding psychological and emotional toll of slavery.  Even in Virginia, the setting of the novel, where the condition of the average slave was considered \\""not that bad\\"" by the standards of the time, the soul-crushing, mind-annihilating condition of being human chattel was an overwhelming burden.  Nat's description of this sort of \\""life\\"", and his fiery rage at the white characters of this novel are truly terrifying and unforgettable.             Nat himself is portrayed as a complex and (usually) sympathetic character.  He is neither a zealot or a mad-man or a one-dimensional symbol.  Styron notably leaves out some of the known biographic details of Turner in his narrative - Turner's wife and child, for example - perhaps in order to develop (the fictional) Nat's inner-conflicts regarding love, hate, sexuality and sanctity, all of which are central to the novel.  To return to the above-mentioned allegations of racism, it will not give too much away to reveal that Nat at one point fantasizes about raping a white woman after she reveals her own vulnerability to him and several other slaves.  I saw this, and similar scenes, not as a stereotypical portrayal of uncontrollable, animal lust (a la \\""Gone with the Wind\\"") but rather as a symptom of mental and emotional confusion/frustration stemming from a cruel lifetime of hatred, betrayal and deprivation.  Other, perhaps less \\""self aware\\"", black characters I believe are similarly meant to be viewed as products of their environments.  This was my interpretation of the more controversial aspects of the novel, and I hope that other readers will not have their views towards an entire race of people diminished or altered by scenes which, I believe, are meant to shock the reader into a deeper understanding of the iniquities of human bondage.           This is a deeply haunting work of fiction (and I emphasize the word fiction, as other reviewers before me have) and one that will be hard to forget.

Part and parcel with that awakening struggle came an increased interest in the roots of the black struggle, especially in slavery times. Such intellectuals as Herbert Apteker, the Genoveses, the Foners, Harold Cruise, James Baldwin, John Hope Franklin and others, black and white, were very interested in exploring or discovering a black resistance to the conditions of slavery not apparent on any then general reading of the black experience in America. This is the place where the recently deceased William Styron and his novelistic interpretation of one aspect of that struggle- Nat Turner's Virginia slave rebellion enters the fray.     No Styron is not politically correct in his appreciation of Turner or his followers. Nor are latter day Southern whites and their sympathizers who have recoiled in horror at what expansion of Turner's rebellion might have meant for the `peculiar institution'. But being politically correct, etc. now or historically is beside the point. Slavery was brutal. Slavery brutalized whole generations of black people for a very long time. If one expects nature's noblemen and women to come out of such a process, one will be very sadly mistaken. That the white benificaries of this system were brutalized is a given. Human progress has come about through fits and starts not a seamless curve onward and upward. Nevertheless all our sympathies are with Nat and his fellow rebels.       Moreover, here are some things to think about if you are not worried about your political correctness status. Outside of John Brown at Harper's Ferry Turner's rebellion represented the highest achievement of resistance to the white slaveholders in the early 19th century. Although the fight was not pretty on either side every progressive today should stand in historical solidarity with that fight. Then one will understand not only that oppression oppresses but also that the militaryconditions for a successful rebellion for isolated blacks in pre- Civil War American were slim. The later incorporation of 200,000 black soldiers and sailors among the Northern forces in the Civil War are a very, very profound argument that once off the plantation blacks were as capable of bravery, courage and honor as an other American.

In 1831 Nat Turner, a Virginia slave and preacher, led the only sustained, effective slave revolt in American history, yet few records of the event offer much detail. The only one! After years of solemn, secret planning, into which the reader is methodically and eagerly enlisted, over the course of two days Nat and some 75 followers rampaged the countryside, laying waste to 55 white souls of all ages, including women and babies, before they were caught and, of course, hanged. Fifty-five cold-blooded murders plus dozens of wounded makes Charles Manson look like Martha Stewart. Styron attempts to penetrate the mind of Turner to uncover his motive and psychology and succeeds to a considerable degree, in my opinion.    The book is told in first person, most of it directly by the chained Nat awaiting execution in his cold, dank cell, the rest of it summarized in dialogue with his lawyer, a neat way to get across a lot of plot points in a hurry while maintaining scene and drama. Story begins with a vision Nat has of an inscrutable, white building high on a sea cliff -- his version of freedom and glory (he has never seen the sea). Then back to the cell, and we get what happened in dialogue with his lawyer, a befuddled white man assigned to the case. The second part of the book retraces Nat's remarkable life story in recollections, slowly, gorgeously laying the groundwork for his religious convictions that lead to his plan to plunder the countryside that has served as the backdrop for the unspeakable horrors endured by his fellow slaves. Particularly effective is Styron's use of Old Testament martyrs and prophets who rose up against the Egyptians and whose fiery rhetoric lights a blaze in Nat's mind that cannot be put out. This leads right up to the climax, which the reader has been prepared for and can't wait to read, and the scene where he storms his master's bedroom does not disappoint. The deneoument brings us back to Nat's final meeting with his lawyer on the morning of his execution and his bidding goodbye to his last living comrade, led past Nat's cell, crying out that it will be all right, that it's \\""nuthin'!\\"" The hangmen's call from behind the door to \\""Come!\\"" becomes in Nat's mind the voice of the Lord at last, the Lord who has, for years, abandoned him and tested his will by His silence. Nat's vision of the mysterious white building on the hill becomes a metaphor for the peace of the finally imminent Afterlife.    Interesting how Nat's retrospective first-person prose is simply scrumptious, lavish, almost insanely wonderful, but when he speaks, his words come out in the same impoverished dialect as the other slave characters. No excuse or explanation is given for this discrepancy -- a reminder of just how much you can get away with provided you set the standard from the get-go and never look back. Styron's prose, which I had only encountered once before, in his terrific novella The Long March, is what I would call transparent. Clear, perfect, to be devoured compulsively as you think \\""he can't possibly keep this up\\"" and he does. When I read Styron's natural kinsmen such as Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Cheever, Richard Yates, I think as I read, \\""Goodness gracious but this [guy] is freaking talented with words, and he clearly knows it,\\"" but when reading this book, I found myself thinking, \\""Goodness gracious but this [guy] is freaking talented with words, and he's sparing the reader the hint of his own swaggering ego to boot.\\"" Hence, tranparency. The lily rendered as it is, no gilding required. Hence, my excitement upon emerging from this book is partly the prospect of his other novels, waiting for me in used bookstores and eBay auctions and garage sales.    Styron took a lot of heat for his matter-of-fact treatment of Nat's character, mainly from black leaders who denounced it as perpetuating the stereotype of the sex-obsessed, violent black man. Maybe they had a point. It was 1968 after all. Then again, Nat's natural development, morally and sexually, was so warped and twisted by even the mundane practical restraints of slavery, as to supply reason enough for me. And the man presided over such unprecedented and widespread carnage -- it must be remembered that he was a mass murderer, no matter his skin color. Yet, amazingly, and probably significantly, Nat himself committed just a single murder -- that of a white girl whose beauty and sincere kindness toward him somehow overboiled his frustrated rage more than all the cruelty of his various masters and their surrogates. Finally, though, and most important to a writer, Nat is written with such humanity and compassion and courage and honesty and wit that, in the usual sense, it hardly matters what he did -- the reader is with him till the end. \\""Write unlikeable characters,\\"" my writing teacher Ethan Canin told us. \\""The reader will always like them.\\"" James Baldwin had his own take on the book when it came out: \\""He [Styron] has begun the common history -- ours.\\"" Achieving a common history is something another writing teacher of mine, James Alan McPherson, often said should be the goal: \\""We must develop what Ralph Ellison called the omni-American sensibility.\\"" Jim also once said, \\""There should be no limits whatever to the writer's imagination.\\"" Amen!",2005-04-28

Is Styron's novel the mature, scholarly work of a man who is genuinely fascinated with an ugly historical incident in his homeland (the Tidewater region of southeastern Virginia), or just an iconic relic of the Civil Rights era?  Styron would insist on the former, but posterity may judge it to be the latter.     Intentionally or not, the novel is certainly a magnet for controversy simply because so few facts are known about Nat Turner's life, which required Styron to fill in the blanks with as many fictional elements as he could imagine; and many readers, perhaps misunderstanding Styron's agenda, are liable to dispute and even attack the fictional material for various reasons.  Since this is not a biography, Styron was violating no ethical taboos by employing artistic license where he saw fit.    The novel begins with Turner sitting in a jail cell awaiting trial for his bloody crimes and delivering to his lawyer, Thomas Gray, what will be recorded in history as his \\""confessions.\\""  Speaking his bilious, violent words with precision, insight, and erudition, Nat tells the story of his life in a series of flashbacks, beginning with his childhood at the plantation of a wealthy miller named Samuel Turner, where his mother was a cook and therefore enjoyed a few more privileges than did most of the other slaves.  Nat was a bright boy who, when he demonstrated a desire to learn how to read, was taught the Bible by Samuel Turner's wife and daughter.  When financial ruin befell the Turner family, Nat was sold to a variety of owners until he finally came into the possession of a wheelwright namedJoseph Travis.      As a sincerely devout man who strove to suppress his lust and remain celibate, and as probably the only literate black man in the county, Nat became a preacher to the other slaves, who were granted some liberties on Sundays but were not allowed to assemble.  The hatred he had been nursing towards white people culminated on a day he received a divine vision to kill them all, to assume the role of a murderous Moses leading his people out of bondage to the promised land.  While his friend and closest associate, Hark, enlisted as many slaves as possible for a revolt, he devised plans for the most merciless of massacres that succeeded to the extent that any white Southern sentiment for abolition was consequently cooled for the time being.      Styron is a meticulous, highly disciplined prose artist who writes novels that are compellingly readable and filled with savory details but somehow fail to substantiate themselves beyond the surface.  The compensation for this in \\""The Confessions of Nat Turner\\"" is the selection of a loaded and endlessly discussable topic:  Is a man born in chains and consigned to die in chains to be blamed if he attacks his captor in anger?  Turner, in Styron's eyes, would justify the murders as evil for evil, contending that the damage done to blacks by whites is irreparable and the only remaining option is destruction.  Styron calls Nat Turner a psychopath, yet composes a portrait of him that is tense but controlled and, in its thematic denunciation of slavery, roundly empathic.",2004-08-18

Styron begins with a true historical event -- a slave rebellion that struck terror into the hearts of white southerners before ultimately being quelled. Styron sees in the psychological tinder box ignited by the rebellion, and in its leader, Nat Turner, a little-understood passion play. Critics who complain that Styron doesn't answer some historical questions: &quot;Gee, Nat's owner didn't treat him so bad, why'd he rebel?&quot; miss the point. What fascinates Styron, and a careful reader, is what the fact of rebellion does to the minds and emotions of those it touches. Besides, anyone who finishes Styron's novel without a sense of why Turner led the rebellion wasn't reading very carefully; the whole novel turns on Styron's hypothetical answer to this question. One of the central conceits of the book is Styron's imagination that Turner could have been fueled by his sense that he had been chosen by God to lead his fellow slaves in an uprising. Styron paints a powerful picture of one driven by the conviction -- whether divinely inspired or delusional -- that he is a vengeful avatar called upon by a higher power to wreak vengeance on the perceived enemies of God. There is an obvious parallel here to the Harper's Ferry uprising led by John Brown (whom Russell Banks, in Cloudsplitter, depicts as similarly driven by mania), as well as to figures like Joan D'Arc.

Like the other reviews here say, Nat Turner led the only somewhat successful slave rebellion in the South.<br />William Styron was very brave to write this book.  And he was much pilloried by Black intellectuals for having done so.<br />The novel is beautiful written and the prose is lyric.  We are drawn into Nat's life, the life of the slaves around him, and his masters.  They taught Nat to read and treated him kindly.  So it is with unexpected horror that we see him lead the blacks there in Virginia to rebel against and hack apart their masters with axes.  According to Styron, Turner never butchered anyone.  But he lost control of his rebel army and stood by as his owners and friends were hacked to pieces by the most violent slaves.  That is the great irony depicted by the novel.  On minute we have peaceful chariot rides with the mistress of the plantation.  The next we have brutal decapitation. The reason that Turner rose up in rebellion is never clearly explained.  The reader is left to draw his own conclusion.  That men can turn to monsters is very much thematic here.<br />I think what upset the black intellectuals so much was that William Styron broke two taboos.  First he depicted the slave owners in this novel as benevolent-there is not supposed to be any possibility of that so say the revisionists.  (Styron points out that slaves in the cotton fields of Missippi suffered more.  Farming in Virginia was not so large-scale so the work was or a different nature.)  But perhaps Styron's greater sin was describing in vivid detail Nat Turner's affection for a white female.  That this part of the novel was made up and that is touched on an unmentionable taboo got Sytron into much trouble.  A group of black intellectuals wrote essays that attacked Styron's novel.

Chattel slavery was,  in many cases, a \\""breaker of spirits\\"".<br />The depiction of the slaves in  this book is not always positive.  What Styron tries to show (sometimes  successfully) is that slavery was a heavy weight, and that the slaves who  bore this weight were not always noble.  This is what many readers have  found offensive, and why the book has been labeled \\""racist\\"".  This was not  my impression (my background: I'm an African American raised in  Texas.)<br />This is a novel full of ugliness and negative characters.  There  is not a single fully sympathetic character in the entire book, black or  white.  In this way, it is an exploration of the evil of slavery.<br />This  novel is not a history lesson; and in that many readers accept the fiction  as fact Styron might have done us an additional disservice.  Styron himself  acknowledges this in the forward of the recent addition.  The controversy  surrounding Confessions is not what it once was, but I'd encourage anyone  who has deliberately avoided the book because they've been told it is  racist to read it and decide for yourself.",2000-05-26

Styron is a novelist in the classic tradition, and is concerned with depth of theme and pyschological motivation--two things that are sneered at in todays academic climate. Yes, it is a problem straying into the political  arena--but Styron achieves the important task of humanising Nat  Turner--making him real, and not some dusty abstract fictional  personage--consigned to the footnotes of History. Racism has many faces,  and as I read Styron's novel, I became angrier and angrier, as the  palpable, grinding and dehumanising aspects of America's slave legacy was  unfolded in Nat's story. The ending was incredibly powerful. I urge people,  of all creeds and colours, to read this book and keep an open mind. Styron  is NOT a racist, but a HUMANIST.The story he tells has eternal relevance,  and is told with integrity and great literary skill. A book should stand  alone, but I hope some day that this novel is made into a film. Its story  is too important to remain locked within the literary arena.",2000-03-12

A  brief overview of his work in both fiction and memoir shows civil rights to  be a cornerstone of his thematic untertaking; thematic material that, for  the most part,  anglo writers either ignore or address tentatively with  small equanimity.  One senses, not only in Styron's work, but in his  selection of narrative, a deep, vengeful need to understand a psychology  and a violence that seems humanly irreconcilable.  And of course it is not;  Styron's, like any useful imagination, is boundless and capable of  understanding all human action, no matter how sinister.  Styron must have  known many decades ago that what we are for any reason afraid to address  satisfactorily will continue in a more destructive form in time.  What  better hero then, than Nat Turner?

I agree. William Styron shows not only the pain and suffering of Nat Turner (more or less an average slave), but it also tells what kind of decisions a  slave really made. <br />You get paid pennies a week for the grueling work you  are doing. In a few years you can buy your freedom and start a life for  yourself, maybe a life in a humble cabin built by your own hands, a life  full of racism, but a life non the less. At this point you would happy with  whatever you could get. Or, there is the decision of revolting. With enough  support you could overrun your owner and escape to the North.  Unfortunately, that is a very dangerous proposition. <br />William Styron  tells the life of this religious slave in the early 19th centurey and why  he did what he did. Many people would agree it is stupid to revolt. On the  other hand, many say they would make the same decision, &quot;Give me  Liberty or give me death.&quot; Nat Turner's revolt was debateably the only  successful revolt.

I was unaware that at the time the book was released, it was panned as racist by some black writers as racist.  I wish they would read it again; it is a phenomenal story.  Although Nat Turner is represented as a little mentally off-balanced,  he is also represented as extremely smart, extremely kind, extremely strong and talented.  I am reminded of Toni Morrison's Beloved, where the protaganist was also a little disturbed - driven by racism and the oppression of white society.  Although her protaganist isn't as thoughtful and spiritual as Nat Turner, the idea that racism and oppression inflicted such pain is there.

I found the author's afterword, in this 25th Anniversary edition, particulary insightful on the reaction the book received from various critics.

Almost unbearable in its graphic violence and Biblically-dimensioned  heartbreak, the novel (for it *is* fictional) has Turner  telling the whole story in painfully honest detail.  Styron  neither defends Turner nor paints him as crazy; he is less  interested in pointing out right or wrong than in trying to  understand the broad ironies of the system of slavery and its  effects on the people who ran it and were subject to it.    Styron's Nat Turner is a man who is both educated and destroyed  by his masters; he is both uplifted and misled by the Bible.    His hatred is not fueled by the hatred of whites, but by the  pity of whites.  And when he kills, he is only able to commit  one physical murder, though he takes responsibility for 60.     The book is often painful to read, especially for one who  might think that race relations today have little to do with  19th-century slavery.
