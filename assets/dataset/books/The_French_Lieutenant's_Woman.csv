Fowles' faux-Victorian novel works as a story, works as an exploration of Victorian life and literature, and works as a meditation on the nature of fiction.

It's also a very enjoyable read, with sparkling minor characters, enlightening looks at Victorian mores and fiction, and witty apercus scattered like confetti.<br /><br />The story traces the growing passion of the at first conventional Charles for the mysterious Sarah Woodruff, a.k.a. the French Lieutenant's Woman (or Whore).  This runs right into his engagement to sweet and shallow (and rich) Ernestina, and eventually into his entire vision of life.  Various interesting minor and not-so-minor characters abound, giving the same sense that one has in a \\""real\\"" Victorian novel -- of a fully populated world, full of people who are interesting for their own sakes, as well as active in the plot.

Thus, not only do we get a story that takes place in Victorian England (and a great story at that), we also get a psychoanalysis of Victorian England and a series of asides which attempt to explain and defend the ridiculous actions taken by the characters.

On the other hand, if what you are seeking is anecdotal testimony, then perhaps you'll find value in a 'recidivist' reader's lingering reflections...    Sometime in the mid-1970s, when I was home from school (and looking for something new to read), I picked up a paperback in my parents' library. The red-orange cover, the graphic of a woman lost in thought, the title The French Lieutenant's Woman, all intriguing. I was riveted. Drawn quickly into the story and the storytelling, engaged on an emotional and psychological level, finding in the words, the story an echo of almost primal origin. A connection that no other novel had ever approximated, even as Fowles, the novelist, kept reminding me this was fiction.     Some months, maybe even a year afterwards, my Dad and I went to a bookstore in Coconut Grove, Florida that sold `used' books exclusively. It was the first trip I'd made to a `used books' store, and in it I found a handsome, hardcover copy of The French Lieutenant's Woman. My memory of the event is not particularly vivid. As with so many experiences, it is lost to the corners of time, a dust mote. But what I do remember is the flood of sensations set in motion as I studied this slightly worn copy of the hardcover edition: the mood of the dust jacket, its enigmatic beauty, so much greater an honor to the qualities of the novel. (If one can attribute causality to a single event, with that purchase, I became a book collector.)     Upon completion of undergraduate studies, I traveled for three months to Europe. It was the autumn of 1979 and this was something of a last fling before I embarked upon the `rest of my life.' During my time in England, I traveled to Lyme Regis, the setting for this novel, spent a largely rain-swept week with my journal and camera. I walked along the Cobb and in Ware Commons. The time alone was peaceful and contemplative. And yet, in keeping with the more muted tones of the novel, the visit was colored by a saddened almost inexplicable sense of loss.

He is a member of the aristocracy; she is spoiled and rich. They see from afar a mysterious woman standing still, staring out to sea. Ernestina tells Charles that the woman is variously called \\""the French lieutenant's whore\\"" and \\""Tragedy\\""; she had an affair with a French lieutenant who went home and was never heard from again. Charles becomes curious.    The mysterious woman, Sarah, will keep you guessing throughout, right to the very end. You'll think she's pitiful, then you'll wonder if she's crazy, then you think she may be mean, and round and round.    THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMAN by John Fowles, written in 1969, is a Victorian-sounding novel. Fowles mimics the style of, maybe, Jane Austen or maybe Charles Dickens. At the same time, he interjects his own voice and compares the Victorian age with modern (1969) times.    This book is, although long, not long enough. When you read it, get very comfortable; you won't want to put it down. And you'll hate to see it end.",2010-06-19

The author's novels have been called many things: strange, confusing, and even cruel, but one thing they are not is boring!    The French Lieutenant's Woman is no exception to the author's style. This book is a Victorian novel about a Victorian novel. It is set in the late nineteenth century, but is narrated by Fowles in the present century. As in The Magus, Fowles toys with his characters and the readers while he decides what future awaits the protagonists. He offers more than one possible ending and even places himself in the novel as he contemplates how the novel will end.    If you have never read any novel by John Fowles, I recommend that you read The Collector and The Magus first in that order. The Magus will prepare you for the author's style and the manner in his which he develops his characters and plot. If you've read The French Lieutenant's Woman and didn't care for it, then you probably won't enjoy The Magus, which  is considered the author's masterpiece.    The French Lieutenant's Woman's has all the ingredients of a typial Victorian novel: a mysterious woman, an invalid (a Victorian novel is not a Victorian novel without at least one invalid), and a marriage between an aristocratic groom and a titleless heiress where only one of the parties bears love for the other.    John Fowles is a contemporary writer. This novel shouldn't be compared to the great Victorian novels. I don't think the author meant to be compared to any nineteen-century writers. The French Lieutenant's Woman explores nineteenth-century customs and at times compares them to our own. I still haven't read every Fowles novel, but I'm excited to see there are still quite a few for me to discover!",2009-12-02

But here is the thing, on a literary level, this is easily a 4 star, probably even 5 star book. Fowles destroyed the boundaries of fiction writing with this book. He took a Victorian novel, filled it with authorial intrusions (chapter 13 anybody?), anachronisms, mockery, and it is full of irony. Hey, he even places himself, as the author writing the book in the late 1960's, into the story taking place 100 years earlier. Why? Well, that is for you to decide. Ultimately, Fowles set out to do something completely original in the field of literature and fiction. And he accomplished it.<br /><br />So then, what is the problem? Well, for one, I found the basic story to be extremely boring. This story was not in my tastes at all. But that is a personal choice. Another part was Fowles syntax and diction. This guy can throw together sentences that are just staggering. And his vocabulary is uncanny. If you often lookup words you are unfamiliar with, I would keep a dictionary duct taped to this book--you will need it. I am all for using your writing skills to the best of your ability, but this books comes across as nothing more than show-boating at times. As if Fowles just wants to show you how much better his skills are than yours. I found it to be frustrating at best. It often becomes very wordy, with a lot of fluff and entire chapters of more fluff. I skipped several simply because it had little to do with anything else going on. Just read the first and last paragraph and I was good to go.<br /><br />I suppose that the main point is that this is not a book for everybody. It was written with lit majors, critics, and English professors in mind. Actually, it was written in response to a critic who said the field of literary fiction was dead and that nothing new would come from it. Fowles proved him wrong obviously. If you like Victorian literature, you will likely find this an entertaining read. But you have to read it with a tongue-in-cheek style. Fowles is writing a modern novel in a Victorian style (an odd combination for sure). If Victorian works are not your style, then be warned. This book spent a lot of time in the NY times best seller list, which says a lot, but wow...it is a harder read than one would generally expect from a NYT best seller.<br /><br />Oh, and don't bother with the movie, it does not even compare to the book. This is a book that people should read or be generally familiar with, but I for one found it to be an average read as far as entertainment goes.is writing a modern novel in a Victorian style (an odd combination for sure).

It is a real brain feast for anyone interested in high Victorian Britain, and the mores and hypocrisies that lay within (this was a society where the legs of pianos were covered up lest gentlemen become aroused by them, yet had more brothels per head than almost any other society in any part of the world before or since).<br /><br />Fowles was a great and strange novelist of the curiously fallow middle part of the 20th Century in British letters, the period where Evelyn Waugh was moved to commend the lonely souls who kept the flame of literature burning through the quiet years. A scholar of Victorian England himself, he collected many rare books from the period, and worked diligently at his home in Lyme Regis, away from the bustle of literary salon London to produce big books that challenged novelistic convention. Drawing on French existentialist theory (rather heavy handedly it must be said), he offers a tragic portrayal of two 19th Century lovers: Charles Smithson, a dilletante, rather effete upper class man who struggles with intimations at a freedom that flowered in 1960s England (the time the novel was written) yet for his age were freedoms buried underground. He struggles with the responsibilities of age, and loss of liberty (perennial issues) and encounters the mysterious Sarah Woodruff on a cliff top. Is Sarah a tragic heroine, done a great injustice by the social snobberies of the time, or is she a sly manipulator of Charles's emotions? Fowles plays with these issues, and the narrative in a pyrotechnic, multi-ended conclusion that results in the novel being a curious fusion of 19th Century social realist baggy monster and cunningly playful 20th Century metafiction.

Not that there's no place for that in the world of literature. Mock inventions are notable and necessary, and besides, no one knows what's going on in the mind of a writer. Why would one attempt artful imitation rather than writing the \\""real thing?\\"" Fowles has produced a faux novel. Maybe he wants us to hearken back to the clash of modernism and romanticism. Maybe he wants to wax nostalgic about times when it seemed like there was a chance to counter the relentless increase in the slavery of souls as Marx calculated; when there was, at least, a hope that things might be made right in the world. So he wrote a \\""Romantic\\"" Victorian romance; Charlotte Bronte did it best. An anti- romance,is there any other kind? Replete with feckless heros and heroines, and stereotyped \\""villains\\"" caught up in the machinery of Victorian life--even as we still know it.

The wheel was invented long ago, and it was and still is round; nothing but a miralce is going to change that.<br /><br />Fowles' effort is estimably valuable, and his prose is swooning and artful,as well as a labored pastiche; although the book may not be many readers cup of tea. It is important that we relive the frustrations of life through art, regardless of the period of the production. Art holds the mirror to life, and the modernist novelists of the late Victorian era were pre-eminent in their patient use of language to paint nuances of human experience. The best of them were brilliant, and Fowles pays them homage,and wishes he was one of them. They captured their time for our instruction and delight, and they did a wonderful job. They were courageous,and roundly rejected by the public and literati of the times. So, in a sense, bravo to Fowles for worshipping at their altar; rehashing and championing their cause.<br /><br />Why he wouldn't take it up to warp speed; things aren't, and won't be much different in the future;perhaps only worse, was his choice.

I thought it might be a romantic thriller set during one of the world wars and was surprised to read a book set in one of my favorite English periods, the Victorian, written from the perspective of the late 1960s.<br /><br />The waning aristocracy is represented by Charles Smithson, dilettante and heir to his aging, unmarried uncle's wealth and title. His bride-to-be, Ernestina Freeman, heiress to the fortune her father has accumulated at his enormous London emporium, represents the rising, affluent middle class. While Charles and Tina seem to share the idealized Victorian view of marriage and family life, they are also keenly aware that their engagement is a legal contract that will benefit each of them in different ways. After Mr. Freeman's death, Charles will gain control over the family's money. For Tina, marriage means an entr&eacute;e into the aristocracy, elevating her above being a mere \\""tradesman's daughter.\\""<br /><br />This is only one of many Victorian dualities that Fowles highlights; he is not subtle about his theme. Darwin's theory, as seen by the science dabbler Charles, is as harsh as practitioners of Christianity like Mrs. Poulteney. The advantage of evolution seems to be its lack of bias and judgment. Charles, unwilling or unable to adapt to a changing society in which money is coming to matter more than manners, is as much a victim of evolution as Sarah appears to be of the hypocritical morality of Mrs. Poulteney's religion.<br /><br />Idealized Victorian life centered on the home and family. The poem that Ernestina reads to her contracted lover is about a sterile, lofty form of love devoid of real passion--and it promptly puts Charles to sleep. According to Fowles, it was believed that respectable women merely tolerated men's carnal desires, but did not share them. Ernestina \\""must not\\"" think about such things, even though they are natural. Nature is to be controlled. She is shown mostly within the confines of her aunt's house or social settings. In contrast, Sarah Woodruff, the French lieutenant's woman, is first seen at the end of the seawall, in the wind, exposed symbolically to the world. Later, Charles discovers her \\""on that wild cliff meadow\\""; at some point, he \\""recalled very vividly how she had lain that day.\\"" Charles sees her in a way in which he will never see Ernestina; she is sleeping openly in a natural position which is, not surprisingly, sexually suggestive.<br /><br />If the close-minded, tightly clothed Ernestina represents the Victorian marriage-and-family ideal, Sarah seems to represent the unspoken male ideal, at least for men like Charles--a natural woman, a woman of intelligence, of spirit and independence, who is not afraid to shun the ideal in favor of the real, to prefer passion to posturing. Her interactions with Charles make the \\""love\\"" of Charles and Ernestina seem like the play-acting of children. Even with Sarah, however, Charles cannot escape the duality of his perceptions and desires. \\""He was at one and the same time Varguennes enjoying her and the man who sprang forward and struck him down; just as Sarah was to him both an innocent victim and a wild, abandoned woman.\\""<br /><br />While Ernestina sees herself in the perfect Victorian marriage--one in which love is pure, and carnal demands are submitted to primarily to produce the ideal family--Fowles shows some of the alternatives. There is the prostitute mother, for whom sex is a mechanical means to the end of supporting herself and her child. There is Mrs. Tomkins, intent on producing the rich heir to what would have been Charles's title and inheritance. There is Mary, and the servants and country girls like her, who see sex as a way to land a man but who also seem to enjoy it for its own sake. There is Mrs. Poulteney, whom one can never imagine experiencing love of any kind, pure or not. There is the sexualized Sarah, the French lieutenant's whore, whom Charles encounters in the wild, in a natural state unencumbered by social expectations. There is also the Sarah of one proposed ending, the sophisticate artist's assistant in London, committed to her single status and her freedom.<br /><br />The narrator often intrudes into the story, deliberately undermining it. Just as the reader may be getting wrapped up in the odd, tension-filled relationship between Charles and Sarah, the narrator interjects a comment from contemporary times; words like \\""computer\\"" clash with the old-fashioned stays of Mrs. Poulteney's dress and the limits of her mentality. While drawing us into the Victorian world, the narrator pulls us back with his ironic, detached commentary on what he wants us to understand is fiction if not fantasy. Charles and Sarah are no more real to a man of the 1960s than the mores of Victorian society.<br /><br />While the Victorians may have feared the power of sex and desire, the narrator points out that we have succeeded where the Victorians did not of stripping sex of that power. He notes that, by his time, any relationship that is more than casual quickly becomes sexual. For Charles and Sarah, the tension is cumulative, building to a proportional climax. By the 1960s, Charles would simply have dumped Ernestina and gone to bed with Sarah as a matter of routine, transforming sex into as casual an activity as changing the sheets.

However, Fowles' book is not a romance, in the traditional sense, but is more a discussion about the author's rebellion against the process of writing a romance. When Charles Smithson discovers Sarah Woodruff sleeping in the Undercliff, he is unaware how much his life is going to change. He does not know that she will fuel his evolution from the historical, religious, and social stance on sexuality toward a life liberated and free of those same institutions.<br /><br />His backward glance at Victorian England highlights the two-faced nature of sexuality. Men are allowed a few extra-contractual jaunts with women, while women are viewed as tarnished goods for those same sexual experiences. Religion, society, and the law have clearly lain down the rules detailing what is proper regarding sex. Fowles attempts to discuss the evolution that would be necessary for society to progress beyond this point. He seems to say that is someone was willing to go against the sexual morays of the time and could get people to follow him that he could lead the sexual (r)-evolution. It is interesting that the man who tries it in the novel is named Charles, as much attention is given to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. However, only the living can evolve, and the novel also seems to say that most people of Victorian times are dead, not willing to change, and not willing to live.<br /><br />While he struggles between giving in to society's expectations or breaking away from his former self and the rules, Charles makes himself an outcast, much like Sarah is at the beginning of the novel. He has a sort of St. Paul on the road to Damascus experience, even though Fowles says he refuses to make the comparison between the two. Charles is a man fighting against history and social biology. While he clearly wants to enjoy the carnal pleasures of sex, he is wary of the consequences, acquiring a disease, becoming an outcast, and receiving social scrutiny. On the other hand, he underestimates the power of the social construct and the magnitude of the (r)-evolution he is attempting to effectuate, an example of which is shown in his apparent shock in response to the legal papers from Ernestina's father.

This unnamed narrator, almost certainly Fowles, himself, is all-knowing and never unaware of the fates and ultimate decisions of those he describes in this novel.

Though she is locally called \\""Poor Tragedy\\"" (along with other less respectful names like  w hore) slender, beautiful Sarah is a beguiling figure of mystery who captivates the romantic Charles simply by her distant presence. As he walks the local sea cliffs in search of fossil remains of earlier life forms, the visiting Charles, already engaged to wed a wealthy merchant's daughter, often sees Sarah standing alone on the shore, staring wistfully into the impenetrable distance, speaking to no one, unmoving for stretches of what seems to be hours, and he becomes obsessed with her. He seeks to know her and heal her of whatever pains she bears that have driven her to such a state. However, Sarah rejects Charles and seeks no assistance from him or anyone else. Charles makes inquires and learns Sarah's tale. He hears how she became an outcast as a result of her risking everything for the love of a French naval officer, who jilted her when he left the English coast to return to his homeland.

That feeling never let up; indeed, it grew even stronger as I approached the end, when I began to feel a frantic eagerness to discover what would become of these characters that I had grown to care so much for.<br />Sarah Woodruff (aka the French Lieutenant's Woman) is one of my favorite characters in literature.  She is a complex, nuanced character, intriguingly covered by a delicate veil of mystery throughout the first half of the book.  Her pain, her selfless sacrifice, and her courage are deeply and powerfully drawn.  She is a true example of a woman ahead of her time, a woman who challenges the norms of her society by simply ignoring them.  Her confidence and her quiet scorn for the Puritanism of the times in which she lives raise her to a level above the so-called moral leaders who condemn her.  In a strange way, she is a true hero.<br />This book, written in the late 1960s but set one hundred years earlier, is a beautiful example of period literature.  Fowles, through his remarkably genuine narrative voice, recreates the world of Victorian England in such a way that if it weren't for the occasional references to modern life you might think the book was a century older than it is.  It is filled with all the pomp and formality you would expect, but also with a wit, dry humor, and quiet mocking of the period that lend it an added flavor.<br />But Fowles is not simply trying to create a period piece or social commentary.  I believe that first and foremost he was creating a love story.  I would put Charles and Sarah in the same category with Romeo and Juliet as far as love stories go.  The relationship is developed slowly, so slow that it is exquisitely painful almost.  And though the time they spend together is brief, it is filled with an unmistakable air of eventual tragedy.<br />The only question left in my mind is whether to categorize this book as a classic of modern fiction or of 19th century fiction.

With all of the literary devices that Fowles employs in his novel to make it-according to one reviewer-\\""so utterly compelling,\\"" it comes as no surprise that this novel does not adapt easily to the screen.  In fact, the screenwriter, Harold Pinter, completely disregards the true intended nature of the aforementioned rhetorical strategies in his adaptation of the novel.  <BR>Instead of portraying these essential elements as Fowles wrote them, Pinter creates a \\""movie within a movie\\"" by constructing a passionate affair that the actors portraying Sarah and Charles involve themselves in while filming the screen version of Fowles' novel.  He then cleverly weaves the two stories-one taking place in the 1860s and `70s, the other in the late-1970s/early-1980s-in and out of each other.  He does so in order to give the audience a sense of the comparing of times that Fowles produces by interjecting 1960s views-on subjects including politics, religion, and social customs-in the classic style of the Victorian novel.  Pinter sees this as an opportunity to use both of the novels endings, as well-the \\""happy\\"" ending for the screen lovers, and the more realistic for the \\""real\\"" lovers.  Despite the deliberate effort to make the endings seem as genuine as possible, the do not invoke in the audience the \\""Mystery of the True Ending\\"" that the novel does.  And by utilizing the double-romance technique, Pinter falls prey to time constraints.  <BR>Pinter realizes that he must sacrifice plot developments and some of the other devices that make this Fowles novel unique.  For example, Pinter discards of Fowles' use of the epigraphs and primary documents (including case reports) that give The French Lieutenant's Woman its Darwinian flair.  Again, Pinter hopes to achieve this sense of evolution and historicism by comparing the Victorian love story with the modern one, but for anyone that has read the novel, the film just seems to lack that \\""something.\\""  Pinter also cuts what many readers consider key plot points from the story.  This makes grasping character motivations very difficult, despite the obvious attention to detail given to keeping the dialogue consistent with that in the novel.  For example, not a single frame of the film mentions Charles' uncle and the fact that Charles will no longer inherit his uncle's estate.  Nor does the film address the lengths to which Sam goes to try to ensure his and his soon-to-be-bride's financial security.  Without Fowles' rhetorical ingenuity and sub-plots that reveal characters' drive, the film slips further into the pattern of slaughtering the makeup of the author's creative skill.<BR>Surely anyone who's read the book will most likely concede that they would rather adapt virtually any other book for the silver screen than The French Lieutenant's Woman.  John Fowles' narration technique, designed to involve the audience in the story by speaking directly to them, and the infamous alternate endings present the most difficult aspects of the novel to overcome in the rewriting process.  Surely there must exist a better way to show these aspects of the novel than the way that Pinter ultimately released it.  Perhaps a narrator or even Shakespearian-inspired, one-man chorus could narrate the film in a truly Darwinian fashion, making it almost seem like a romantic documentary.  Therefore, it would not seem absurd to include some of Fowles' side comments, and the narrator could then even plug in a few epigraphs or primary document excerpts.  The problem of the alternate endings would then also be solved: the narrator would present them as John Fowles does in the novel.  Obviously this version of the film would last longer than the two hours that Pinter's version fills, but without the second, parallel love story, the new version would occupy less time than one might think.  Even so, this new longer, documentary-like version would probably not reap the same fiscal benefits that the 1981 blockbuster did, but at least the film would uphold the integrity of Fowles' novel.<BR>Despite paltry attempts to portray Fowles' literary flair on screen, the film version of The French Lieutenant's Woman comes off as nothing more than a summary of the dominant plotline with a few glimpses into the lives of people that readers of the book have no acquaintance with.  Do not misconceive this, however, as a complete bashing of the film.  In deed, the film portrays Lyme Regis in an extremely visually stimulating manner, having been shot on location.  And the cast, including Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep, did an outstanding job playing the well-dialogued characters that, due to unfortunate adaptation circumstances, had very little motivation to guide them.  But what does exemplary acting and an aesthetically pleasing setting matter if no one makes an effort to uphold the artistic integrity of the piece that inspired the film?  The novel's authorial interjections, alternate ending, epigraphs and primary source documents give the novel its reverence in the literary world.  Without them, the film completely fails to capture the essence of the novel, no matter how well it portrays the dialogue and visual aesthetics of the book.",2004-04-12

But to Sarah Woodruff, the woman in question, shame equals freedom: freedom from constraints both social and emotional.<br />Sarah Woodruff is as full-blooded and full-bodied a literary invention as any character of the 20th century canon, yet she retains a sense of mystery which is absolutely essential.  It is for this sense she projects of being impossible to know that she becomes impossibly alluring to Charles Smithson, a wealthy, not-bad-looking, touchingly innocent gentleman who thinks of himself as a man of the world.  The action of the book is propelled forward by the attraction Sarah holds for Charles, especially as it is forbidden (he is engaged to marry someone else).  <br />I will mention the film here only because it is probably the only film I've ever seen that actually adds something to the book.  In the film (made in 1983, if memory serves), Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons play Sarah and Charles, but they ALSO play their modern-day counterparts, making it a movie within a movie.

He is an acute social commentator who regularly achieves what few authors are capable of - he creates a compelling story with real moral weight and makes the reader apply the questions at its core to themselves. He is a moralist without Eliot's tendency to preach, unfettered by the moral code of the nineteenth century writers, yet still not shying away from the complexities of his characters' situations. 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' brings a twentieth century view to a nineteenth century story quite brilliantly, showing how a century can change the code a society operates under, but not what drives its human beings: the need for acceptance and the desire for intimacy. Sarah is one of the great enigmas of twentieth century fiction, and casts a spell over the reader as much as she does over Charles.

That story involves a young gentleman, Charles, engaged to a suitable young lady, Ernestina, the daughter of a successful tradesman. Charles becomes intrigued by the local outcast Sarah, also known (most euphemistically) as &quot;The French Lieutenant's Woman,&quot; and they share an attraction that defies his social station and, as a societal outcast, her lack of one.<BR><BR> Throughout the novel, Fowles inserts information about the era, and highlights in particular the hypocrisy of sexual attitudes and roles. Charles and Sarah find themselves victims of these restrictions, and as such their romance is doomed from the start. Charles convinces himself that he has a truly selfless motive in attempting to help Sarah, whom he sees as a victim, and ends up weaving a web of deceit to himself and others as he fails to see himself falling in love with her. As the novel progresses, one can read in the comments about Victorian standards, commentary about our own modern age. By holding this bygone age up to our own, Fowles shows us how far we've come, and how little we've left behind.<BR><BR> To enhance the immersive storytelling, the prose is written in a style reminiscent of the Victorian authors themselves.

I am another person who read this book because a friend had read it, and was so enthusiastic about it that I could not bear not knowing what she was talking about.  That was two months ago.  I've read it twice since then, and started college, and any myriad of other things.<br />In brief:  It's a traditional tale; young man of means (Charles) is engaged to socially acceptable, safe young woman (Tina).  He meets enigmatic, enticing other woman; finds her incredibly attractive; his life changes utterly and completely because of this.  (Sounds a bit like _The Age of Innocence_.)  Ah, but as a reviewer said about another eminent author, describing the plot does not begin to describe the novel.  The plot is to the book as noodles are to tuna noodle casserole: important, but not half of it.<br />The book is set in Victorian England; it is rife with philosophical speculation, but not in such a way as to make you feel that you are reading a textbook.  He sets forth Charles's experiences and his changing worldview in such a sensible way, letting you draw Charles's conclusions with him.  Fowles does an amazing job of showing you his mind, as well as those of lesser characters.<br />Which brings me to another point.  Even if you do not like the philosophical side of it, TFLW is worth reading for the language and the style.  It is written in Victorian English, with a strange twist of modernity (mid-twentieth century and ageless modernity).  Fowles is amazing at showing-not-telling (as the English teachers counsel) and his descriptions will blow you away.<br />On top of all that, it is a good story.  It is not a happy story, really, but it is not, in truth, depressing.  It's romantic, it's elating, it's sad, it's powerful . . . It is the kind of story you want to reread immediately.

I love  nineteenth century novels, and the prose in this book is amongst the best  I've encountered by a 20th Century novelist.  It's rich, sensuous, a  tactile experience with words.  When the little oddities started showing  up, I couldn't figure whether I was irritated that he'd ruined a perfectly  good book by adopting the rather quirky, experimental art forms common to  the 1960's and 70's, or whether I was struck dumb by the sheer brilliance  of the experiment.  In regard to the meaning of it all, I have to agree  with every reviewer here, including the one who gave it one star.  I  pondered the existentialism, concluded, revised, dismissed, pondered,  concluded with proviso's, and on and on until I felt like Elliot's poor  women, coming and going and talking about Michaelangelo.  Wouldn't it be a  stitch if the author meant this as a grand prank, and every single one of  us has fallen into the trap?  Brilliant.

As a high school student, I was simply blown away by the story, the virtuosity of the endings, by its ambiguity, but most of all by the  richness of its language. <br />The scene when Charles and Sarah confront each  other in the shed in the undercliff has more tension and suspense than a  thousand horror movies, because it was so real.  <br />In the intervening 30  years, I've re-read this novel every five years or so. Like other great  works, each re-reading brings something new (because I continue to change).   <br />The great tragedy, at least in my view, is that what has followed from  John Fowles has never risen to the heights of this novel.  Daniel Martin  was a huge disappointment to me (so self-indulgent and empty).  The Maggot  has some moments, but was ultimately disappointing.  Only The Magus, and,  to a lesser degree, The Collector, rival The French Lieutentant's Woman.   <br />That said, Fowles has always been his own man and has stuck to his view  of the world.  I've read some of his philosophy of life in the Aristos and  found most of it to be inconsistent with my own world view. <br />But in this  great book, Fowles and I connected.

I got the heroine mixed up in the personal  mythology of my mind with my high school girlfriend, Joni Mitchell, Anais  Nin, and all that is eternally mysterious and wonderful about  women.<br />Having read the book three or four more times, I am much better  able to appreciate the ideas -- existential, Darwinian, Marxist -- that fit  into the web of a rollicking good story.  This is a novel that punches the  head as unerringly as the heart.<br />And don't forget the element of PLAY:  Fowles has said this novel was written by a man who was very tired of  novels and the usual constraints under which they were written.  So there  are THREE endings: a false,  everything-tidied-up-as-it-would-have-been-in-a-true-Victorian-novel ending  about two-thirds through the book; and two opposing endings at the  finish.<br />Fowles reportedly even wrote a farcical chapter in the style of  Alice in Wonderland in which the narrator chases after the hero with an axe  ... but his wife and other advisors made him leave it out.  I hope we will  someday get to see that one.<br />Why did the latest publisher put a cute  blonde on the cover!  (I'm assuming she is NOT meant to depict the  secondary love interest, Charles's fiancee.)  This is almost as bad an  aesthetic decision as casting Meryl Streep in the movie version, though she  made an admirable attempt to be Sarah.
