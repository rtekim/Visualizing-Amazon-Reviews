PKD had a tendency to write highly allegorical characters based on archetypes, which is good for a parable but bad for a serious story.  Stylistically, his work doesn't know whether it wants to be an allegory after some medieval idiom or a compelling 20th century story and it's certainly enough to put many people off.  In particular his female characters are annoying and stereotyped.    Some people may find the plain-spoken prose and quick pacing not to their liking but that's strictly YMMV.    All that being said, I would say that whenever I meet someone who's not too interested in reading the whole body of Dick's work, I recommend this one as a sampler of his \\""classic\\"" pre-1974 style.  It's fairly accessible, not as bizarre or steeped in Gnosticism as \\""Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\\"" but it still gives the full scope of what he was capable of in his better work.    Also, this book will quite often leave the reader with an uneasy feeling that maybe the admonition \\""I am alive and you are dead\\"" is addressed to them.  I certainly had that effect after reading it and others I've spoken to have shared that experience.  On the one hand bleak and eerie and on the other hand, a story where hope burns but is not extinguished.    As a writer, this book taught me more than a few pointers on both what to do and what not to do in my own work.

Dick. It's a title that's on &#34;Time's 100 Best English-language Novels&#34; and is written by one of the biggest science fiction writers of the 20th century. After reading Ubik, it's become one of my favorite science fiction books of all time.<br /><br />In this world, there is a struggle between people with mental abilities (telepaths, sightseers, etc.) and those who have abilities to fight them. Glen Runciter and his wife, who he can speak to through technology even though he is dead. He and and a team of his strongest anti-psychics were then ambushed while on assignment and the books descends into a crazy journey through time and space.<br /><br />I found it really hard to really understand what was going on in the book at some moments, especially when Dick was setting the plot up at the beginning. He really just threw you into the world with very little to go off of. Yes, there were some explanations of certain skills or people, but it was hard to figure out what was going on in the big picture of things. To make this confusion a little worse, the book is chock full of twists and turns. What you think was going on at one moment isn't reality... and that also may not be reality either. It makes for a very entertaining read, much better than the crazy thrillers that you can find today, but without a strong introduction, it lost some of its clarity in the process.<br /><br />Its a bit of a conundrum really. I really enjoy just how crazy the book seem to be. It almost felt like it constantly left me wanting, but not necessarily related to the advancement of the plot. It's more of a wanting to figure out just what the heck is going on in the first place. You are almost stuck in the &#34;now&#34; time frame instead of the &#34;what's next.&#34; It's a really different type of feeling of a book, in my opinion, and even for the trouble it gives, it is most definitely worth it.<br /><br />Since it's a science fiction book, one of the major parts of the book should be the idea of a &#34;vision of the future.&#34; In a way, Dick turns that idea on its head and fuses it with a &#34;vision to the past.&#34; It starts with that vision of the future, a world where psychics and anti-psychics have become a business, a world where everything requires payment. By the end, everything just flips over. I don't want to spoil the book at all, but things can get pretty crazy as you make your way through the pages of the book. You can find yourself moving back in time just as time is moving forwards as well. It's a really weird concept, but it is also really intriguing.<br /><br />Ubik has become one of my favorite science fiction novels of all time. Apart from the initial confusion from the near-nonexistent introduction to the world, it will grab you and not let you go until you reach the end of the book.

Reading UBIK took no time at all; it's a fast read, packed with imaginative ideas and scenarios.  The topics of politics, capitalism, death and the afterlife, are artfully woven into this deeply pessimistic and funny story about the nature of reality and time itself. Dick's command of the narrative is first-rate, and his description of a future in which the entire damn planet is coin-operated, is not so far off the mark. A hilarious throwaway aspect involves the ludicrous and bizarre way people dress. One particularly prescient bit involves a character whose front teeth have been covered in gold, replete with carvings of the suits from a deck of cards. UBIK was written in 1969 but perfectly predicts the hip-hop bling of decades later.  The famously ambiguous ending is disconcerting and maybe a bit gratuitous, but certainly doesn't mar my respect for UBIK.  I take it as a bit of a joke on Dick's part -- he wanted to mess with our minds one last time on his way out the door.  Perhaps the biggest revelation for me is just how fine a writer Mr. Dick was. Is. This is literature disguised as science fiction. Apparently the rights to UBIK have been optioned and a film is in the works for release in the next couple of years.

Written in 1969, this novel was written in the future (1992), which is now our past.  Dick got virtually none of his future predictions right in this novel, which casts it in a bit of a negative light.  The main plot is that Glen Runciter runs an anti-psi agency to counter the use of agencies that are using telepathy and other paranormal means to gain an advantage in the business world.  Joe Chip is his right hand man who tests anti-psy abilities for the agencies.  Things change when they encounter a woman who has a talent they have never seen before, which is to change the past.  Chip recognizes that she is very dangerous, which proves to be true.  The other main aspect of the plot is that people don't die.  They go into cold stasis where they are still sort of alive and people can communicate with them, something that figures very prominently in the novel and becomes the main plot line after being a secondary one.<br /><br /> I liked the tone and voice of the novel.  It moves at a fast pace, and there is always either action or intrigue taking place.  On the other hand, the novel was often confusing, especially about mid-way through.  As I mentioned, his predictions of the future weren't very accurate.  In his future, machines can talk and have personalities. It also requires coins to operate them, even simple things like opening a door.  He has the foresight to come up with these machines, but then they use nickels and dimes to operate them, so he completely ignored the concept of inflation.  There is also never a resolution to the plot line where Runciter's people are ambushed.  That was more or less ignored about half way through.  As I mentioned, there is some good and some bad, but by and large this was an entertaining novel.<br /><br />Carl Alves - author of Reconquest: Mother Earth",2014-01-25

Or perhaps a better way of putting it is the book meets the high standards he creates for his works, and then some!<br /><br />As the book begins, we meet Glen Runciter, head of the world's top anti-psi agency (to combat all of the psi organizations that have arisen now that it is 1992 -- heh!), located in New York City. He confers with his late wife, Ella, who is dead and buried in a Swiss moratorium, where she is in a suspended state of &#34;half life,&#34; through &#34;cold-pac&#34; --- something like our cryogenics. The world's top psi's are disappearing, and Runciter wants his wife's opinion on what to do. She thinks they should advertise more.<br /><br />We then go off to met Joe Chip, Runciter's top man, who is dirt poor and in debt. A Runciter scout has brought a young woman named Pat by to meet Joe. Pat has an unusual ability to nullify events before they even happen. Her psi tests are off the charts, and Joe marks on her report that she should be watched, that she could be dangerous.<br /><br />Runciter has a visitor from a businessman with a business on Luna (the moon?), in need of immediate anti-psi help. Runciter agrees to overlook some typical preliminaries, since it's an emergency, and soon he's leading Joe, Pat, and nine others to Luna to save this company. Where they're sabotaged. A bomb goes off in the room in which they're gathered and Runciter takes it the worst. He's pretty much dead, and the team rushes to get him into cold-pac in the spaceship so he can be saved and consulted with his wife. Joe starts planning on how to get back at their enemies from that moment forward. And from that moment forward, things start unraveling. It gets really PKD-like as alternate realities are discovered and time moves backward. Joe starts receiving odd messages from Runciter while members of the team start dying off, decomposing quickly. Soon the surviving members find themselves back in 1939 in Des Moines IA -- Joe has to get there by bi-plane. They're there for Runciter's funeral, but by now, Pat is under deep suspicion for being behind this, plotting with their enemies, and Joe's really ticked. Soon the reader doesn't know who is dead and who is alive!<br /><br />I won't give away the ending, but I'll just let you know that it's a typical PKD mind-f*** which is immensely satisfying while still being a bit confusing. It's a lot to swallow at once. Ubik rears its head at the beginning of each chapter in the form of an unusual ad for an unusual product, and Ubik plays a real role at the end of the book, but it's a bit mysterious at that. Suffice it to say that it's a miraculous spray can that is Joe's only way to stay alive.<br /><br />Philip K.

When Runicter's company is offered a big job on the moon, he figures they've found the missing telepaths and he's eager to hire out as many of his inactive inertials as he can, including the new one who has a strange and disturbing power: she can nullify events before they happen. But when Runciter's inertials get to the moon, disaster strikes, and when they return to Earth, they find that life is not how they left it. In fact, time seems to be going backward and something is killing them off one by one. The only thing that might help is Ubik -- a mysterious product in an aerosol spray can... If only they can find it!<br /><br />Ubik is a fast-paced SF thriller full of classic PKD themes such as an unreliable reality, time running backward, precognition, telepathy, paranoia, drug abuse, hallucinations, and spirituality. The story is quite funny in places and includes a bit of horror, too.<br /><br />There are several plot twists in Ubik, including a big one at the end, which means that the reader is as unsure about what's going on as the characters are until the big reveal and, still, there are some questions left unanswered.

I love his books, I love his short stories, I even love things like Our Friends From Frolix 8. There is something raw and razor-sharp, almost clinical in Dick's writing, something that transcends style, ideas and story. You can always tell that a part of him - and it might very well be a dominant part - not only believes in what he writes, but lives it.    I haven't read all of Dick's books. I haven't even read half of them. Still I've read most of those whose names everyone knows, and I have read enough to think that even a genius of his magnitude would be hard pressed to write anything quite as good as Ubik twice. If I had to point at a single one of Philip Dick's works as his magnum opus, that would undoubtedly be it.    As Michael Marshall Smith aptly puts it in the forward of my edition of the book, there is a mind-boggling number of SF ideas in Ubik: time-travel; psychic abilities and their corresponding anti-abilities; the dead being kept in a state of \\""half-life\\"" where they could be reached by the living; alternate realities and reality revision; futuristic space-faring society; dystopian economic system. Many authors would spin a book around any ONE of those, but for Philip Dick it's always what's underneath the flesh that matters, so he casually presents them ALL in the first ten pages of his novel.    In Ubik's world technology has advanced to the state where colonization of the Moon and other worlds is possible. Psychic phenomena are common and many people employ psychics in their business ventures or shadier dealings. And since no law could control such powers, the so called \\""prudence organizations\\"" have appeared. Those who work in them have the ability to negate one psychic power like telepathy or precognition. Meanwhile, people could be put in \\""cold-pac\\"" after death - a half-life existence that slowly diminishes until the person dies again, this time - forever.    The main character,Joe Chip, is a technician for Glen Runciter's prudence organization. When a client hires twelve agents to negate telepathic spies in his lunar facilities, Runciter and Chip travel with them to the Moon. The assignment turns out to be a trap, possibly set by the company's nemesis Ray Hollis (who leads an organization of psychics), and Glen Runciter is killed in the ensuing explosion. The party quickly returns to Earth to put him in cold-pac.    But afterwords the twelve agents and Joe Chip begin to experience strange reality shifts. Food and drink deteriorate prematurely, and the world seems to regress into the past. What's more disturbing, they all receive messages from Glen Runciter, implying that it is actually he who is alive, and they who are in cold-pac. And above all is the ever-present Ubik, appearing in commercials on TV and radio. Nobody knows what it is, but it is everywhere. And it is important.    Then the deaths begin...    Ubik is a deeply unsettling book. The characters' hold on reality is at best loose, and the uncertainty they feel as to the nature of their very existence seeps into the reader's own mind, turning the novel into almost a horror story. When the action and the race (quite literally) against time begin, you are almost grateful for the opportunity to evade the disturbing questions concerning what's real, what's not, and which one is more dangerous. Dick's misleadingly simple language and the traditionally schematic relationships between his characters, only seem to accentuate the unnatural events he is painting.    Philip Dick is a master of multiple realities that intertwine and overlapp until the mind's ability to grasp it all simply fails, and madness begins. As Paul Di Filippo says in a review of the book, \\""No reality is priveliged\\"". Nowhere is Dick's ability to test the limits of perception and self more strikingly demonstrated than in Ubik. And even if you take nothing from the book, but the amazing mystery and suspense filled story, it would still have been one of the most satisfying reading experiences you've ever had.    10/10    [....]",2010-08-03

The story contains a number of his trademarks, but it is also one of his more straightforward books and contains a number of elements that would be familiar to many sci-fi fans.     The story itself is multi-faceted. The set-up involves Glen Runciter and his organisation of \\""anti-talents\\"", who are a sort of futuristic industrial counter-espionage. When a large-scale operation to the Moon goes badly wrong, Runciter is killed and his employees find reality beginning to disintegrate; time going backwards, Runctiner contacting them from beyond the grave, and themselves frighteningly wasting away. The bulk of the book deals with the efforts of the characters to figure out the cause of this degradation and how it can be stopped.     The book contains plenty of standard Philip K. Dick elements. Protagonist Joe Chip is the standard down-on-his-luck \\""everyman\\"" hero, with Pat being the cooly mysterious female lead. The dynamic between Joe and Pat is fascinating, with her highly original anti-talent possibly being connected to the bizzare circumstances in which they find themselves. Likewise, the idea of a warped or illusional reality is a standard feature among many of Dick's books, and is utilised well here. In addition, I particularly enjoyed the concept of \\""anti-talent\\"", which  highlights Dick's influence on the Cyberpunk genre. In his world, telepathy and precognition are not always used for good, and Dick has some interesting ideas about how they may be employed in an offensive manner against rival organisations.     The story fits together well; all of the pieces seem to be nicely in place by the end, only to have the final chapter throw in a disquietening twist that leaves the ending open. This is reinforced by the ominous introduction to the final chapter, which is complete change from the cheesy advertisement parodies than introduce the earlier chapters (\\""Eat Ubik toasted flakes\\""/\\""Get soft andsupple hair with Ubik conditioner\\""/\\""Borrow from Ubik Savings and Loan\\""!). A clever and well-executed touch.     One issue I have with this book (and several other of Dick's books) is what might diplomatically be called his \\""matter-of-fact\\"" writing. His quite dry style makes it difficult to get emotionally involved with the circumstances or the characters. The characters themselves (apart from Joe, Pat and Glen) are somewhat poorly sketched, and often abruptly die or disappear \\""off camera\\"". Also, his predictions for 1992 were way off. Keep in mind the book was published in 1969, so it wasn't as if he was looking a hundred years hence; even allowing for the fact that this might be a deliberately \\""ironic\\"" or alternate-reality approach, his predictions of hovercars and lunar colonies seem very dated in retrospect.     It is a pity that Dick couldn't bring out a little more emotion in the book, and really give a detailed insight into what the characters go through in such a bizzare situation. This means that 'Ubik' succeeds brilliantly as an intellectual puzzle but falls a little short as a novel. But if you can forgive that, 'Ubik' is a clever and thought-provoking science fiction book, and is the best place to introduce yourself to the original but disturbing world of Philip K. Dick.",2010-05-20

The author's 25th science fiction novel since 1955 (!), \\""Ubik\\"" was originally released as a Doubleday hardcover, with a cover price of $4.50, in May 1969. It finds Dick giving his favorite theme--the mutability of reality--a thorough workout in a wonderfully well-written, at times humorous, increasingly bizarre story. Indeed, the book may be Dick's \\""spaciest\\"" outing since 1964's \\""The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,\\"" and had me wishing that I had originally read it back in my college days, while under the influence of some, uh, psychotropic substance!        In the book, the reader makes the acquaintance of the various members of Runciter Associates, run by Glen Runciter and his half-dead wife, who is able to give business advice although in cryogenic \\""cold pac\\"" in a Swiss \\""moratorium.\\"" Runciter Associates is comprised of special individuals who almost come off like very unusual members of the X-Men, except that these individuals, rather than commanding superpowers, possess what must be called antipowers; that is, they can cancel out the fields put forth by telepaths, clairvoyants, telekineticists and so on. During a promisingly lucrative business venture on the moon, Runciter, his assistant Joe Chip, and 11 of the various antitalents are ambushed in an explosion, orchestrated by Glen's enemies. Runciter himself is gravely injured and put into cold-pac storage, while the other team members scramble to find out how this attack transpired. But wait...why does reality itself seem to be changing? And why are various objects reverting to earlier forms, such as a modern (1992) stereo in Joe's apartment suddenly morphing into a Victrola? And how is it that everyone suddenly seems to be living in the year 1939, while one by one the team members crumble to dust? And just what is up with Ubik, a miraculous spray can that seems to be their only ticket to salvation? Dick certainly had his imagination working on overtime when he plotted out this one, that's for sure, and the wonder of it all is that, ultimately, the story DOES hang together coherently and ingeniously. It is a bravura piece of work, and one that \\""Time\\"" magazine chose for inclusion in its \\""Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century\\"" article. No argument from me!        \\""Ubik\\"" really is a consistent pleasure to read. The aforementioned humor pops up in many guises, from throwaway remarks (such as a reference to a Supreme Court ruling to the effect that a man can murder his wife if he can prove that she would never grant him a divorce; the five-times-married Dick giving vent to some pleasant daydreaming, perhaps?) to hilarious turns of phrase (a man is said to be wearing a dress \\""the color of a baboon's ass\\"") and to the truly outlandish outfits that all the characters wear (the moratorium owner sports a \\""tweed toga, loafers, crimson sash and a purple airplane-propeller beanie\\""). As in so many of Dick's other novels, amphetamine and LSD use are spotlighted, and the author's empathy for the plight of his characters is strongly pronounced. Dick also gets to show off his knowledge of 1930s minutiae in this tale, whether from in-depth research or by dint of having been an 11-year-old himself in 1939 America. His details are not ALWAYS spot on, however; a 1939 issue of \\""Liberty\\"" magazine is said to contain a famous story entitled \\""Lightning in the Night,\\"" although that story actually appeared in the August 1940 issue; the Ford tri-motor plane is said to have come into existence in 1928, whereas 1925 would be closer to the mark. Still, these are the merest quibbles. \\""Ubik\\"" is basically an extraordinarily clever, mind-blowing entertainment. It may cause some to furrow their brow in bewilderment--\\""very confusing,\\"" Joe Chip thinks to himself at one point--but I can'timagine anyone not being bowled over by this amazing piece of work.

At some point in this book itself, the very characters find themselves firmly entangled in the past, so what hope do we have?  What's more, parts of this book show that PKD was indeed seeking to repeat his former glories, with limited success.<br /><br />For example, in his previous work he was very good at throwing in bizarre details for no particular reason; apteryx-shaped buildings, wood-burning automobiles.  The oddities in \\""Ubik,\\"" however, feel forced.  Take the outfits the characters wear in this story.  Outrageous styles of clothing can be a cheap way for sf authors to say \\""Hey, look!

Gets kind of old after a while.<br /><br />Which is ironic; for about two-thirds of its length, \\""Ubik\\"" gives us characters who find themselves and the entire world growing older at an astonishingly rapid pace.  A fresh cup of coffee turns cold and moldy, new cigarettes crumble at the merest touch, and worst of all, people die and immediately mummify like they've been underground for decades.  That's not even the weirdest thing; objects revert, too.  Hi-tech entertainment centers turn into cabinet-style radios, automatic elevators turn into wrought-iron cages with human operators, and eventually everyone finds themselves in 1939 Des Moines, Iowa.<br /><br />How does this happen?  Well, I'm not about to give the whole game away, but it might help to know who these characters are.  They're called inertials, and they render mental powers ineffective.  With them around, telepaths can't read minds, precognitives can't foretell the future, and so on.  They are all employees of a man named Glen Runciter, and they all get caught in a bomb blast that kills their employer.  Now, who do you suppose would want to destroy a bunch of people who suppress mental powers?  Figure that's the party responsible?  Well, yes and no - this is PKD, remember.<br /><br />Then, despite his death, messages from Runciter to his employees start popping up in the oddest places - in bathroom wall graffiti, on traffic tickets, even in skywriting.  Many of these messages advise the Runciter people to find something called Ubik.  Why?  For the moment, suffice to say that \\""ubik\\"" is short for \\""ubiquity\\"", Latin for \\""the state of being everywhere\\"".<br /><br />In short, this is a puzzle novel - one of those stories in which the characters have something to figure out, and when they do the story is over.  A darned good example of the species, too.

After Runciter is murdered, Joe Chip (the best tester in the business) and his counter-psionic companions struggle to survive in a world where time seems to have drifted backwards and death is striking out of nowhere.  Is their dreaded nemesis the telepath Hollis trying to destroy them?  Or is Joe's beautiful and dangerous wife Pat behind it all?  Or could there be some still darker force at work?  Their only hope lies with the fragmentary messages they receive from the absent Runciter, and the promise of the all-pervasive but ever-elusive product known as `Ubik'.<br /><br />As the above summary may suggest, this is not your usual sci-fi adventure, even granting that it's from the inventive mind of Philip K.

They not only exist, but they are highly organized and aggressive.  At the same time, there are individuals known as inertials who have the ability to counteract both telepaths and precogs.  The intertials are also organized and most work for \\""prudence organizations\\"" that hire out to counteract spy work that the psychics undertake and the conflicts can escalate to lethal levels.  The story hits a major turning point when the largest prudence organization takes on a job that sends 12 people into a trap that literally explodes in their faces.  In the aftermath, reality starts to unravel and the group of inertials races against time to put things right before it's too late.    This book sets up an interesting scenario of espionage and counter-espionage with various types of psychic phenomena as the tools of the trade.  Some aspects of the world are set up with a very clear logic that largely stays consistent throughout the story.  Other elements aren't defined as well, and some seem to shift a bit depending on where we are in the story.      Characterization is also a bit of a mixed bag.  The owner of the company seems larger than life, and one of his aides is pretty well fleshed out in an interesting way.  Unfortunately, the remaining cast is pretty sketchy and doesn't get much attention.  This lack of depth includes a prime suspect for the cause of their troubles, which was a lost opportunity.      Overall, I liked Ubik and found it interesting, but couldn't help feeling that it could have been even stronger still.  I would have liked another 50 pages or so to flesh out the characters and add more personal drama.

Set in a near-future society where things are much the same with some odd concepts tossed out with frightening casualness, events occur that slowly cause the protagonists to question the nature of reality.  If things go terribly awry, eventually reality starts to question them.  Dick didn't hit the ball out of the park every single time and at his worst the mindbending explorations into reality left us behind and lapsed into what seemed like incoherency.  That's not the case here, in \\""Ubik\\"" not only does everything work perfectly, but with an assured ease that lesser writers treading these waters would not have been able to accomplish.  Set in the aforementioned near future, Dick concocts a world with elements that are fantastic yet fit plausibly into the scenario.  It's a world where people actually have psychic powers (yet they're not overt and rarely glimpsed, making any potential use of them somewhat creepy) and other people have anti-psychic powers.  Its also a world where cold storage crypts exist to extend the \\""half-life\\"" of a near-deceased, so that relatives can still interact with them, at least until a final death takes hold.  Any of these concepts could be the center of a book but Dick merely places them as part of a wider society.  Glen Runciter runs a company of the anti-psys and when they're dispatched on an assignment that turns out to be a trap set by a competitor, that's when things start to get seriously weird.  Runciter is the only one killed in the explosion but soon enough the other members of the team start to receive messages from him and time starts to run backwards, with the advanced technology of today turning into record players and biplanes.  Are the layers of reality being pulled backwards slowly, or is something else entirely going on?  And what does it have to do with the elusive product Ubik, which while hard to find may truly cure everything that ails you?  Dick manages to be one of the few authors who can successfully pull off paranoia in a narrative alone, with the shifting nature of reality freaking out the characters enough that it starts to seep into the reader as well.  But there's never any notion that Dick is being strange for the sake of being strange, he's got a story to tell and a viewpoint to get across, and no matter how offkilter things get, he never forgets that he's telling a story.  Indeed the revelation of what is going on makes perfect sense within the context of the story itself, even as Dick yanks the rug out a little bit from under us at the end, and leaves just the tiniest seed of doubt to linger on when it's all over.  Probably the best showcase for him at the height of his powers, it touches upon his usual themes while still remainining concise and coherent, and may be the best place for a new reader to start.ay truly cure everything that ails you?

If you're into virtual realities - Matrix-like - and such, then you would appreciate Ubik. The novel begins like any other Dick novel I read: it's full of obscure terms such as \\""precog\\"" and other cryptical things, which are meant to be, and which you will soon enough understand clearly. That's not unusual of sci-fi novels.    So what you have in this novel is a world in which psychic people are used to spy on people, and to counter this, anti-psychic people are used to neutralise the threat. That's the background, but it's far from being very telling about the novel. In this futuristic world, when people die, they're not entirely dead. Indeed, they are kept alive, or half-alive, via cold-pacs. These are the two elements that structure the story.    Then the real plot gets started, and I won't tell you much about it because it is reality-destroying, mind-tearing, and everything. I'll only tell you that at some point, reality regresses. Cars turn into older cars, elevators devolve, milk goes stale, cigarettes become dry and break under the touch, etc. Time is turning back!     And then there is even more interesting material. The novel gets better and better, and even the ending is excellent, which is not something I often found with Dick.     Of the four novels I read from this author, Ubik stands out as having that superior crafting, or something, and it makes a difference. Little things like the fact that every chapter begins with a quote that's in fact a piece of advertising for Ubik, the product, added some goodness to the novel.

I was by stages amused and appalled by the vision of 1992 painted in this novel - apparently we were supposed to have made our way to Mars and the Moon by now, with colonies on each, and we're supposed to be dressing even more outlandishly than we do now.  However, it seems odd to me, as I have been reading through the omnibus in which this story resides ([[ASIN:0739426141 Counterfeit Unrealities (contains Ubik, A Scanner Darkly, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep [aka Blade Runner], The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch)]]) to note the things that are kept in the 50s and 60s.  Women are either young and in the service industry or they are matrons and stay at home.  If they are other than that, then they are shown as . . . strange, even dangerous, such as Pat Conroy in this story.  It is this that makes her such an appropriate foil for Joe Chip, as he stumbles through his attempts to keep the group together after a major fiasco occurs when the Glen Runciter - the owner of the company - takes a group of his most highly skilled workers to the Lunar colony for a job and is there attacked.<br /><br />The rest of the story shakes down while the surviving characters notice a strange combination of entropy and growth - recession and coming into being.

By best I mean that it's one that I can read time and time again without ever feeling as though I've 'got' it.  This is no comfy sweater book - you're not going to slip between its pages for a mind numbing reaffirmation of the beauty of life.  Instead you're going to enter his black humor masterpiece that opens itself up to various interpretations - a satire of late capitalism, a metaphysical quandry, a who-done-it - all with a healthy dose of ontological angst.  Add in a postmodern (or at least quasi-pomo) narrative further problematized by the ending, and you've got a book that will make you think.  Therefore, for some, 'Ubik' may not be the best Dick book to start with ('Time out of Joint' provides an early entry into his canon), but it's a great one to return to repeatedly.    Many of the ideas presented in this novel are some of Dick's best.  A prolonged period of artificial half-life maintained after death proves both a comfort to living loved ones and a lucrative business venture.  Psi powers can be effectively blocked by anti-psis - as long as you can afford to pay them for the service.  You may own your conapt, but you'll still have to pay your door every time you want to open it, or else it can sue you.  And how can your dead boss appear on money, matchbook ads, and TV?    Dick turns almost all of the Golden Age of sf conventions on their heads:  there are no heroes triumphing majestically - just normal, little people; technology hasn't solved all of our problems - instead it just lets advertisers hound us more thoroughly; his near futures are weirdly dystopic.  In fact, for Dick we can not even take for granted that we know what reality is or what it means to be human.  If this sounds normal for what you watch and read now (he's had a huge impact on sf and mainstream fiction, from 'The Matrix' and 'The Truman Show' to Gibson and Pynchon), just remember he started doing this in the 50s!

Given the paranoid nature of PKD's writings, Ubik taps in to that subtle feeling we all have that something is not quite right with the world.  <br /> <br />PKD, himself having suffered from Schizophrenia, has remarkable insight into paranoia.  One can't help but experience a broad range of confusion as the protagonist of Ubik struggles to find a meaningful explanation for why things are not what they seem.  <br /> <br />As in the mind of PKD, things are not quite right with the world in Ubik.

You can see how books like The Divine Invasion and The Unteleported Man (aka Lies, Inc.) would arrive later. In UBIK, PKD deals with his most repeated theme, the whole \\""What is reality?\\"" thing he so often dabbles with, but here we also mix in the afterlife, psychic ability and minor hints of theology.

But I have just reread this novel and the light of my life experience has exposed so much more in it. Philip Dick is my absolute favourite writer - ahead of such others as Ivan Turgenev, Joseph Conrad, WH Hudson, Anna Kavan, Mary Shelley.... Not only is it his mind-bending plot lines, his dead pan humour, his gruelling descriptions of disaster (almost minimalist but enormously effective) but also his research - philosophy, theology, psychology. When I read 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' he taught me all about empathy.<br /><br />This novel is about a psychopath - hidden until the very end, but impacting everywhere. There is a remedy for the disastrous personal collapses the psychopath triggers and how I wish I had just such a remedy for a colleague of mine! Not for me, but for her and all those who work and live around her. I suffered a recent bout of bullying in the workplace which alerted me to the fact that this bully might be something much worse and his impact in our community of workers may be much wider than just against me.<br /><br />By chance a television program alerted me to a book, just published, called 'Working with Monster' by John Clarke and published by Random House Australia. Reading Clarke's book - not only about the workplace psychopath but also about his or her victims - has shown me how well Philip Dick plotted these characteristics into his novel.

Here are two things to look out for in 'Ubik'. Firstly there is a character description of Wendy Wright that starts 'As always, when the opportunity arose, Joe took a long astute look at the girl whom, if he could have managed it, he would have had as his mistress, or even better, his wife.' and ends with '...... She had too much control over herself and outside reality for that.' And then there is the chilling collapse of Joe Chip at the start of Chapter 13, watched by an apparently unsympathetic Pat Conley.<br />I recommend those who have not yet experienced 'Ubik' to read it with an open mind and a preparedness to let the plot take you for a ride - whatever you do, don't try to make your 'solution' to the twists and turns as they unfold THE only possible resolution.

I read UBIK after VALIS. There is a vast difference in the material and the plot. UBIK, is core sci-fi. It describes a society where, Psi, telepathic and precog ability is a norm and is considered a menace against society. Pre-cogs are people who have the native ability to predict events before they happen. You'll recognize the universe in this novel, if you have seen the movie. \\""Minority report\\"" which is based on the short story by PKD of the same name.     The universe in this novel: In this PKD universe, People don't completely die, when they die so to speak. There is a continuous \\""half-life\\"" which follows the death in full life. Here, People don't get buried when they die, but are kept in \\""Cold-Pac\\"", that is they are kept in freezer like temperatures, connected to certain high-tech apparatus, due to which they can commune with the living for half hour periods a month till the half-life energy exist. This storage happens in moratoriums, where a relative could come, present the id no of the deceased after which the deceased will be pulled out to the consultation room and will be revived for real world communication with the visitor. The person continuous to be awake in half-life, that is the person continuous to live in his own mind, but communicating with the external world, requires the use of photo-phasons and the strength of photophasons keeps diminishing with more communication with the outside world. There are  photo-phason amplifiers which try to keep the half-lifer going as much as possible, but a time will come when the half-lifer will even consume this and then even half-life ends and actual brain-death also takes place. This is complete death, death in full and half-life, after which half-lifers take birth in other wombs to start a new life. In this way all energy in the universe is conserved. Anti-psi, anti precog and anti telepath are the people who can be hired, for keeping the Psi's, precogs and telepaths out. The Psi, Precogs and telepaths are not desirable elements as they are an affront to human privacy and hope as they can feel your thoughts and predict your future.     The story: Runciter Associates, a firm providing anti-force services, is run by Mr. Runciter who is  alive and Ella Runciter, his wife (in half-life). In matters of business, Mr. Runciter trusts the sharp business acumen of his wife even in half-life, but Ella is slowly dying, but despite this Runciter must revive her now and them for matters of business. The plot gets darker when the firm gets retained for very lucrative deal, the site of work being Luna. The other main character is Joe Chip who is the right hand man of Runciter. He is the group tester upon whom falls the responsibility of testing out the recruits when new talent is brought in by the bounty and to see if they are worthy enough to be recruited as part of the firm. Things don't go as planned on Luna and we are in for a very unnerving experience as PKD decides to confuse us as to what is real and what is an illusion. I won't spill out too much cause that would be an insult to PKD. The kernel ideas in this book are so central to the surprise element in the story that saying much may diminish the enjoyment impact of the book.    In a basic sense, PKD as in all his novels tries to make sense of what is real and what is unreal. Are we alive and if so what makes us think we are alive, what if actually we are all dead and someone else is alive and what we see and perceive as the real world is just an imaginary illusion. What if we are in the MATRIX, so to speak. What is actually that what we call real time, should it always move forward ?. What if real time is actually spiral time, time flowing backwards and what if this is the way it is actually and that we when alive perceive it as the real real time in reverse chronology, which for us, then falsely implies forward goingtime. The ideas and concepts are skillfully brought to the fore in this dynamite of a novel. At 200 pages odd, it's explosive and inventive shrapnel. You'll get hit by it, before you know what happened. So you want to know what is UBIK...obviously, it's the title and of the novel and you want to know what it means, rite...well,... What If I told you, UBIK is nothing and at the same time everything. That it is present everywhere and at the same time nowhere...doesn't make sense, does it? . Read the book, you will not regret it. THIS BOOK ROCKS !!!!    Lately I am doing a lot of PKD reading. By the time you are probably reading this, I would have reviewed a good many PKD books.I have stocked up on 7 novels of his, which I will be reviewing as I finish with them. I have come to the conclusion that the matrix movie has got to be a PKD idea, as I found out PKD talks about the MATRIX- programmer-reprogrammer and parallel multiple universe concepts in his speech \\""If you find this world bad, you should see some of the others\\"". This speech is present in the compilation \\""The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick : Selected Literary and Philosophical Writings\\"": edited by Lawrence Sutin.

Dick for several years now, and have read most of his more well-known works, thought I still have a lot to go. I have read a lot of books from many different genres, including the classics and technical writings, and the books of Philip K. Dick are, in many ways, the most complex of them all. Ubik was not his most original or creative work, as the author himself admitted, but is a great blending of many of the elements that make up the PhiDickian universe. Here we find Dick toying with many of his favorite themes:  paranoia, isolation, alienation, paranormal phenomenon, and, of course, the slippery nature of reality. Ubik works on several levels, as do all of Dick's books; one is a quasi-detective story, which will interest the average reader with its suspense and intrigue, and another is as a dark metaphysical comedy. Much of the book is funny, in its way, wavering from black humor to near-slapstick. All the time, we are drawn further and further into the world of the book as weirdness piles upon weirdness and the mystery of the book thickens. Like all PKD, it is superbly and complexly plotted -- almost unimaginably so. His works never cease to amaze me. How did he come up with this stuff? It is almost incredible that he did -- and so easily and quickly at that. Dick spits out immensely imaginative subplots and asides that lesser authors could build an entire career on. His plots are the most complex I have ever encountered in literature, surpassing even the convuluted multiplexity of other science fiction works. Dick had a truly incredible imagination. That said, Ubik, as with all PKD, is very tightly written and extremely focused; though all of his books contain enough material for years of pondering, most all of them are around the 200 page range. Not a word is wasted. Aside from the ideas -- Dick peppers all of his books with philosophical asides, caustically witty remarks, and laugh-out-loud funny dialogues -- Dick is always worth reading for his superb writing and masterful technique. Ubik is quite a disorienting read at first:  it drops right into the middle of the story, and it will take the reader a little bit to come to grips with what is going on (as another reviewer pointed out, another author would've spend many pages setting this part of the story up.) As with the best PKD, just when it all starts to come together in one's mind, the book takes a completely different turn, and everything that one has thought up to that point is eradicated. And then it makes another twist, destroying again everything that had come before. And then another.

You get repetitive themes: alternate realities, psychic phenomenon, alienation, a constant questioning of the nature of reality, and so on.  But he managed to make it fresh and exciting nearly every time.  And if the uniqueness of his prose and plotting isn't enough, he off-handedly peppered all his writing, especially his best, with interesting thoughts, bits of philosophy, and keen insight.  Granted, the man's no philosopher, but he'll still get you thinking.<br />Ubik as a particular manifestation of Dick's psyche is no different.  From a few chapters onward, Dick continuously keeps us guessing, trying to figure out what the heck is going on, what Ubik is, and why reality keeps slipping out from under our feet.  With almost disgusting ease, Dick manufactures worlds, situations, people, and technology that, though slightly dated faced by today's hyper-aware (of itself, science, theory, fad psychology, what-have-you) sci-fi, nonetheless flawlessly convey something true about man and his relationship to a rapidly changing (some, including Dick, might say disintegrating) world.<br />What is Ubik?  How safe is it?  Is Glen Runciter really dead?  Why do all the objects in the book keep morphing into earlier technologies (so that what is a state-of-the-art stereo one day is an old phonograph the next)?  This book will keep you guessing until the very last page, building up new theories of what's 'really' going on only to dash them to pieces a few pages later.  <br />If you like PKD and haven't read Ubik, get it now.  It's one of his best.  If you haven't read any PKD, Ubik is a good place to start.  Though it's a little disorienting at first, especially if you aren't familiar with his fascination with psychic phenomena, the story quickly grips you, and will also introduce you to most of his major themes.

So don't expect Dostoievsky, but Wachowsky: entertaining pulp fiction written by a born (gnostic?) philosopher.

Dick were to rise from his grave today, he would probably peruse the current state of `alternative entertainment' with a knowing smirk.  The dominant themes Dick mined in his thirty-year career - including alien invasions, time/reality distortion, psychoactive illness, drug abuse, paranoia, metaphysical yearning - have been used and reused so much in the last decade that `alternative entertainment' now has a solid niche in the mainstream.  Note the recent success (in theater or video) of Momento, The Matrix, Mulholland Drive, Fight Club, etc.  Dick's own work has been drafted for the mainstream buck from time to time, as well, though usually in clipped or totally reworked format, _Total Recall_ being a good example of the former, _Blade Runner_ of the latter. <br />I state the above because it helps to read some of Dick's sci-fi with strong hindsight; to realize that when Dick was writing it, there was nothing else like it.  Such is the case with _Ubik_.  For though this book suffers from some typical Dick sloppiness (two dimensional characters, lazy grammar, a meandering plot that almost made me throw the book down in disgust - ) the core ideas Dick introduces and uses were undoubtedly radical for its time, far beyond cliché or contrived conflict.  <br />The specifics: Glen Runciter is the owner of an `anti-psi' organization, which roots out errant telepaths and protects the `unevolved' layman from mental sabotage.  After Runciter is slain by a business competitor, his gifted employees scramble to keep the company afloat...then scramble to stay alive, for reality itself seems to be disintegrating before their very eyes.  Stranger still, Runciter's face appears on money; he (or his ghost, perhaps?) leaves surreal messages on the walls of bathroom stalls.  Is Runciter dead? Or is everyone else? And how does the universal panacea Ubik figure into all of this?<br />_Ubik_ is not one of Dick's better novels.  The characters are dull; many interesting ideas are quickly introduced and just as quickly discarded; the whole middle section of the book is a bit of a slog.

In a way, it is also reminiscent of VALIS (the Godlike entity which communicates with the hero by mystical means), which was written 12 years after UBIK!<br />How could so many themes be exploited so intelligently in such a short novel? The answer is: thanks to Dick's straightforward style. In UBIK, every word counts. The hero, Joe Chip, races with Death: each passing minute lowers his chances to find a UBIK vaporizer and to save his skin. Through Dick's sparing use of words, the reader understands this message: if Joe Chip rests, he will die. Some of Dick's despisers criticize his so-called \\""hasty\\"" style: can't they see that, thanks to this style, he could describe the undescribable? When you get rid of the superfluous, you get a chance to grab the true essence of horror. At least, that's what Dick thought; I personnally think he was right and that he should be remebered of today not only for his hallucinatory visions but also for his style.<br />The style allows Dick to exploit the above themes \\""intelligently\\"", ie in depth and by intertwinig them. But it will probably not allow the reader to fully understand the book after the first reading, unless he's VERY familiar with Dick's tricks, mainly the different levels of reality. One of my friends, who is an experienced sci-fi reader (but not a Dick's reader), still can't understand the last few lines of UBIK, where Runciter finds a Joe Chip coin in his pocket. She asked me, and I said: \\""I think you should re-read the book entirely.\\"" I all the less recommend UBIK to people who don't usually read sci-fi: insofar as the style is pleasant, and the basic cat-and-mouse story catching, they may 1) have a superficial reading of it, ie think that it works only on one level (as an \\""adventure\\"" novel, like, for instance, Solar Lottery); 2) thus, read 90 per cent of it and think they have understood it all; 3) be completely bewildered by the last 10 per cent and make the conclusion that all the book is a piece of nonsense.<br />At the end of his life, Dick said in an interview that he was not very satisfied with UBIK: he felt that with this novel, he started to repeat himself. That is absolutely true. There is nothing new in UBIK - Dick only picked up the best of his previous books, confronted for the first time his obsessions one with another, and tried to examine whether the whole could be superior to the sum of its parts. It was like playing poker, canasta, baccara and gin rummy with the same deck of cards. The result is convincing.",2002-07-01

I enjoyed the speculation it offers, where the futures of the afterlife, corporate culture, and advertising are imagined in a very believable (and simply explained) way.  I also enjoyed the suspense and mystery elements it offers.  Someone has sabotaged Runciter Associates, the world's leading &quot;prudence organization&quot; (telepathic defenders against precognitive corporate raiders; don't trust my explanation, just know that Dick's is much more clear), and now they're slowly dying off.  But how, and why?  It is an interesting setup and the answer comes slowly and assuredly (except for the ending, which felt like an unnecessary tweaking of the tension, and logically made little sense).  These disparate elements were handled well.<br />The problem is that the elements don't add up to a cohesive whole.  Or rather, a cohesive whole that transcends the genre.  Science fiction, to me, should speak about grand issues on a grand scale.  The issues here were focussed on a very small group of people, and did not really speak to a larger community.  I don't feel threatened by a half-life menace, such as the one that stalks Joe Chip and his crew.  Although the idea of inertials, precogs, telepaths, etc. does hit close to home, the dystopian future Dick creates just didn't scare me enough.  And besides, the characters he creates are quite slight, nothing more than two-dimensional devices around which paranoia swirls.<br />Another problem is more a result of wasted opportunity, based on personal biases.  I truly enjoy works that explore the possibilities and perils of time travel (the second &quot;Back to the Future&quot; movie is my favourite of that series, and a fine example of the fun a warped space-time continuum can provide in a narrative context).  When the Runciter gang goes back in time (in a way), Dick only tangentially explores this phenomenon (e.g. Joe Chip discussing the outcome of WWII witha xenophobic pilot), and to me that's not enough.  Like I said, it's an opportunity wasted.<br />Dick does his best work here within the epigraphs that begin each chapter.

It certainly provided a unique atmosphere to the plane journey! As is common in Dick's books, Ubik takes the reader through one of PKD's many nightmarish distopian worlds.  I was pretty disorientated by the time I got off the plane, which is one of the things which makes his writing so special. I think an element of truth lies in the statement that structure-wise,  much of Dick's work can be sloppy and disjointed, but I think those statements only really apply to the 'structure' of his novels. His stories are so rich with ideas and themes, and the reader is never left to feel 'secure', constantly being flung from one nightmarish pseudo-reality to another. I dislike strategically-structured novels, which can often appear stale and too thought-out. Dicks stuff is fast-paced and at times overwhelming which is why its so wonderful.

Dick novel I read (having read just about all of them now, it's hard to remember which was first, but I think it was &quot;Martian Time-Slip&quot;), I would recommend it as the best starting point for someone trying to decide if PKD is your cup of tea.  &quot;Ubik&quot; has all of the major elements of the typical PKD novel (to the extent there is any typicality): (1) questioning of the meaning of reality; (2) an almost pathetic sense of humor in the face of the unraveling of reality; (3) an everyman protagonist; and (4) extreme readability despite a somewhat pedestrian writing style.<br />The plot can be summed up like this: some humans have psychic powers, but rather than being seen as heroes (as is the case in most sci-fi), they're possible sources of invasions of your privacy.  Never fear, however, because some humans have developed anti-psychic powers -- they block the powers of the others.  A bunch of anti-psychics go on a mission, but something goes wrong and they barely get away with their lives.  Almost immediately, they notice that something is not right.  Phone directories are out of date, coffee is disgustingly stale, and so on.  Time, it seems, is flowing backwards!<br />For readers who aren't aware, PKD was one of the most influential sci-fi writers, with his reality-warping stories.  His interest in this topic can be traced, no doubt, to his youthful experimentation with narcotics -- an experience recounted largely in &quot;A Scanner Darkly.&quot;<br />PKD was an incredibly prolific writer; he wrote something like 16 novels in a five year stretch in the late-1960s, including &quot;Ubik.&quot;  Many of his best novels were written during that stretch.  If you like &quot;Ubik,&quot; I would suggest in no particular order: &quot;The Gameplayers of Titan,&quot; &quot;The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,&quot; &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; (made into the movie &quot;Bladerunner&quot;), &quot;Dr. Bloodmoney,&quot; and &quot;The Man in the High Castle.&quot;  By the 1970's, PKD stopped writing as many novels, and they became more thematically complex, with increasing emphasis on religious spirituality.",2000-10-08

At this stage, the book begins, and the  next sections, while hastily written, are some of the best chapters in the  PKD canon. I assert that PKD was much better at dealing the past or  present(in this case, USA 1939) than he was at sketching the future. He has  had many prophetic inventions (like the homeopape, which is soon to be  reality) but he had a genuine interest in the past, see what type of books  he read, his interest in classical music and classical cultures. PKD's 1939  is brilliant, and the story matches. The concept of Ubik, in its varying  incarnations, is excellent, as is the uncertainty with half-life etc, and  those little rhyming verses... very good. There are a couple of brilliant  metaphors that have stayed with me, one where something is compared to a  primitive creature using its own skin as a sail, and the other I have  forgotten. No matter.

After years of reading Piers Anthony, Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov, Richard Matheson and watching shows like Twilight Zone, I did not find this to be that strange. My most favorite, most revisited books were written before 1990 and hit the strange mark way before vampires and psychological thrillers became mainstream. Which is probably why I’m so critical of the books written today.<br /><br />Reading Ubik was like visiting the past where solid writing and breaking new ground really dragged you kicking and screaming into another world. It’s one of those books that will stay with you and beg to be read again and again. Even though you know the ending, it’s the getting there that will entertain you and play with your mind over and over.<br /><br />I cannot add much to the reviews already written.

Sadly that trend continues with the science fiction novel &#34;Ubik&#34;.  I bought it upon a multitude of positive recommendations and reviews, most of which lauded this classic work by a well-established writer of science fiction.<br /><br />Perhaps it is the era in which the novel was written - which coincides with the year of my birth. I read a lot of books like this as a kid and was perhaps more easily impressed by clever plot devices and exotic ideas. As a more experienced reader, however, I want to care about the characters. I want to feel upset when something bad happens to them and I want to shed a few tears when something sad or heartwarming occurs.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - I still like clever plot devices, which in the case of this novel involves the characters losing touch with the reality of what is present and what is past. And I love reading about imagined futures that I have already lived through, which in the case of this novel involves a 1960s author speculating on what technology and society would be like in the 90s. (They got hover cars and moon bases, but no internet as it turns out!). That's great classic sci-fi. Bring it on! But just make me give a damn about the protagonist. Unfortunately, as Joe Chip struggled to get a grip on reality, I felt like I was watching an insect navigate across the pavement.

It was a fun read and I enjoyed it. Most people in book club thought that this was not his best work so I will have to check out more in the future.<br /><br />I started reading Ubik late one night. I was tired and probably should have just went to bed, but I wasn't quite ready. I thought I will just read a chapter or two and then go to sleep. Well that lasted a few pages and I gave up. I told my husband I am either really tired or this is just nonsense. I think it was a little but of both. At first it was confusing what was even happening, but I quickly got with the program and started enjoying it. Well no, that is not completely true. The first part, before the big explosion, I was just kind of eh on. It was alright, but it was just alright.<br /><br />After the explosion, when everything started to go backwards in time, then I really started enjoying the story. I loved how you could see everything reverting back to an older model and such. It was a lot of fun to read and really not like much else I have ever read. It also made you question a lot, what is really going on, are they dead or alive, how is this all going to work out. It was an interesting concept with the half-life and talking to the dead, but only for a set amount of time you could speak with them. Don't want to use up all your time at once. Not that I think I would really want to be in this half-life state, but an interesting idea none the less. It is all very entertaining, but also made me think. Watching all of the characters and what was happening and trying to figure it out was just a lot of fun.<br /><br />The you get to the end and you are just like alright, perfect, this makes sense and you are happy. Till you read the last chapter and it just calls everything into question again. What is really going on? That is part of the fun I think. Not really knowing and trying to figure it out for yourself. How do you know if you are alive or dead? How does anyone? It was just an interesting read and I will have to give more of the authors works a try.<br /><br />This review was originally posted to Jen in Booklandknow if you are alive or dead? How does anyone?

Dick mentioned in the pantheon of sci-fi writers like Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke and Le Guin. But even though these authors are some of my favorites, I'd never read anything by Mr. Dick. So I decided it was time. When I researched his works, I found that Ubik is considered one of his best and that Time magazine had named it one of the 100 all-time novels (written during Time's publication years 1923-2005).<br /><br />Starting out, I wondered why. While the plot and world building were intriguing, I found the writing a bit clunky (lots of adjectives and made-up words) and the attempt at future technology dated. (not surprising--it was written in 1969 and takes place in 1992). The style reminded me of a sci-fi version of a Phillip Marlowe detective story--a bit clich&eacute; even though it may have been the prototype for the clich&eacute;.<br /><br />But as the book progressed, the mood took hold of me, an unsettling feeling like the kind you get in those seconds between dreaming and awakening, when you struggle to figure out which is which. By the end, I knew I'd been treated to a great book, a complex, well-crafted and intertwined story of multiple realities, none of which is ever grounded enough to let you sort through them. But there's something more: these realities make you question your sense of life, like The Matrix without the machines, a floating reality that is the state of being itself.<br /><br />The ideas rather than the characters are central to this story. Most of the characters are pretty flat. But once you get used to the world (psychic powers, colony on the moon, dead people in half-life), the mood takes over, as what appears to be reality fluctuates and changes.<br /><br />It's a slow start, but as I stuck with it, I found it well worthwhile, an original work with a deeply unsettling feel. Think Kafka plus Twilight Zone in the Matrix.<br /><br />Down-to-earth folks whose world view is grounded in what they perceive to be reality should probably avoid this book.

The problem is that the original version, which I read soon after it came out in 1969, has been extensively revised--I hope by Dick himself.  The result is a more elaborate and probably a structurally superior novel, with more characters and an additional major plot line.  UBIK was one of Dick's novels that the critics at the time saluted as a work of &#34;genius&#34; which, however, was &#34;flawed.&#34;  Also, the revised version may be seen to be closer to Dick's central theme, that we all create our own worlds and no one knows what's really going on until near the end of the story, if then.  However, the more rational plot development loses some of the intensity and plain terror of the more focused treatment given the original antagonist, and therefore the immense relief I remember feeling when his power is finally blunted.  It's as though some of Dick's critics rewrote his book.

Still with me?  Moving on . . . ] After talking to his dead wife, Runciter is handed what appears to be a great job on the moon, which is where he believes Hollis' psis have gone. Collecting a dozen or so of his best anti-psis, including Joe Chip, his chosen heir, and a strange new anti-psi named Pat, he heads off to the moon. Things, however, take a turn for the worse and when the group returns to Earth, they find that time seems to be \\""regressing,\\""--sleek futuristic cars begin turning intosubsequently older versions of themselves until by the end they're puttering around in late Model-T type cars. Worse, an accelerated regression effect begins to strike them personally, and as they begin dying off one at a time, they start a frantic search for Ubik, a mysterious substance that allegedly holds the key to stopping the time regression.<br /><br />Now, people have differing views on Dick's style. Personally, I tend to enjoy him more for his ideas than his writing craft, and the same holds in Ubik. Exposition can be clunky, dialogue more so. The first 50 pages or so are hard to get into thanks to said clunkiness, but also due to a lot of unfamiliar terms being tossed the readers way and many abrupt shifts between scenes. The terms start to become more familiar or better integrated, though the scene shifts never really get handled smoothly, nor does the exposition/dialogue improve much. There are certainly some plot holes, or at least, some possible plot holes (when reality itself is questioned it's hard to be sure). And there is also the potential problem, always the case with older science fiction/fantasy, that experienced readers may come away thinking \\""I've seen this sort of thing before; it's not so original.\\"" At which point I can only say, \\""yes, you probably have. But that's because Dick did it first and so yes, it actually was original. Oh, and get off my lawn you kids.\\""<br /><br />So Ubik is not the most fluid or sophisticated of literary works from a craftsman point of view. But I enjoyed it all the way through nonetheless for its ideas and the world (s) being presented. As is almost always the case with Dick, the characters struggle with identity, with just who they are in this world, as well as struggling with just what world this is. Or even if this is a world. Reality is continually being questioned and I like that both as a game between reader and author and also as a more metaphysical question to explore.  Sometimes you just want to take poor Joe Chip and shake him up, but you also feel for him as he is assaulted by all these questions. What is reality? Who am I? Does the \\""me\\"" I am change if the world around me does? What forces make me who I am? Are they malevolent?  Benign?  Wholly, coldly indifferent to my existence?  Am I, in the end, truly and solely alone?  Or can my existential isolation be broken through?  And so on.<br /><br />The fact that such questions are wedded to an interesting narrative, a murder mystery, some neat physical effects such as artifacts regressing, and that they are also surrounded by some classic Dick humor surrounding where modern society is going (one running gag is how everything in this society is coin-operated--including the door of one's apartment, which won't let you out of your own home unless you scarf up that money). In addition to the big questions, Dick wonders about all this modern \\""improvement,\\"" having Joe Chip react positively to some of the regression changes in objects--the nicer feel of a cowhide wallet versus the plastic one it had been, the purr of an old gasoline engine.<br /><br />Ubik can be a rough read in terms of writing style, but it's mostly a quick one: fast-paced, relatively focused, driven by urgency. Though not my favorite by him, it does get at many of the foundational questions in his work and so I think it's an important one by him. But a better reason to read it beyond its \\""importance\\"" in a major author's output is that it is both enjoyable and makes the reader think. Sure, the writing is rough, but two out of three ain't bad.",2013-05-12

This time around, we get psychics of several varieties, time travel of sorts, talking appliances (including a particularly troublesome door), a trip to the moon, inter-corporation rivalry and contact with people from beyond the grave.

You know the whole time that the character's efforts to puzzle out his predicament are going to come to nothing, but you can't stop watching. And there's so much weirdness going on that when a character comes to what should be a stunning realization about his situation, he sort of shrugs and just keeps going, like the ant walking off the edge of the leaf. You remember how freaked out you when you watched The Matrix for the first time and you found out that Neo's whole life was just a computer program? Imagine a moment like that, except that Neo doesn't really notice that anything has changed. He just kind of goes, &#34;Oh, that makes sense. I've been in a computer program this whole time.

Thankfully, \\""Ubik\\"" has both those things in spades.<br /><br />\\""Ubik\\"" exists in a world where there are a variety of psychic humans who can be hired (like the precogs that were central to Dick's \\""Minority Report\\"") for nearly any psychic activity, including nefarious things like corporate espionage.<br /><br />Ubik takes it a speculative step further, though, in that while whole companies of psychic individuals exist, there are also companies dedicated to countering (or blocking) psychic activities. So if you have a telepath reading your mind, you could hire an anti-telepath to block that reading. Interesting and unique idea.<br /><br />Another interesting \\""Ubik\\"" concept is \\""half-life\\"". This is the idea that some people, if they are caught soon enough after death, can be frozen and communicated with for many years after they otherwise would've died.

What the casual reader may not know is that for Dick this problem wasn't a literary exercise, apparently he really had trouble distinguishing reality, so this book, like the others, is most of all a fascinating tour of a disturbed mind. Unfortunately some of his problems manifest themselves in his writing, which can be quite disorganized. Ubik starts being about this future world of telepathic espionage and supernatural gifts only to take a sharp turn in a completely different direction before you know it. Those who appreciate PKD for what he is, warts and all, won't be too upset and will obediently follow the author in whatever ride he has in store for them. And quite a ride it is! A ride in a reality that is as fragile and ephemeral as a cardboard movie set (remember those? Before CG?), a constantly changing reality that more often than not makes little sense to both the characters and the reader. There is, of course, some kind of resolution to the mystery, which may not be a resolution at all, and not all readers may appreciate it.<br />All in all, I disagree with those who call this Dick's best book, it is enjoyable but not his best. The characters are terrible, the story is schizophrenic and disorganized with the distinct feeling the author started it without knowing where he was going to go with it. But as always with PKD, the basic ideas are fascinating and entertaining and the quirks of the future he never fails to pepper his books with are clever and slightly unsettling in their plausibility.",2012-05-14
