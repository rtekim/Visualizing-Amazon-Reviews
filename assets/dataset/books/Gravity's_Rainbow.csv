I don't read it as a chore or because I'm supposed to admire it.  I read it because it is so much fun.    Most of the people who have trouble reading this book are trying to read it the way your English teacher taught you to read \\""serious literature\\"".  Ignore that.  Pynchon is deliberately trying to subvert that kind of reading.  Rather think of Susan Sontag's \\""Style is content\\"" and think of an amusement park ride.  Begin at page one and hold on.  Don't worry about what you don't understand.  The important points are made quite clearly and repeatedly.  Just enjoy the ride and marvel at the world he shows us.  The writing ranges from sublimely \\""writerly\\"", worthy of use in any creative writing workshop, to boldly preposterous, sometimes downright silly.  But it is always imteresting, always fun.    Pynchon's themes are consistent.  How we came to this modern world where immensely powerful forces, governmental and corporate, rule our world.  Gravity's Rainbow, more than any of his other books, is fundamentally about the creation of our modern world.  Corporations more powerful, more enduring than mere governments.  The rooftops of Shell Oil in Holland being used to aim rockets at London, site of Shell Oil's English headquarters.  Unlike other posters here, I love the early chapters set in the London of the Blitz.  The writing is superb, the over-arching themes clearer.    Once we are set loose in the \\""Zone\\"", the novel diffuses, wandering wildly, but the crushing weight of the multi-national forces is a constant.  Until the smothering, unavoidable power of the real forces that define the modern world simply subsume the plot, extinquishing all other possibilities.    This is truly an exciting book to read, but not if you insist on highlighting and footnoting.  Instead focus on rhythms and recurrence, brilliant insights and mad riffs.    In short, experience it more like music.  Honest, its worth it.",2009-09-07

Upon finishing it I feel that I probably won't ever bother.  It's a whole lot of things, about a whole lot of things.  It's beautiful, sad, and gross.  It's a geopolitical conspiracy tale, the outlandish roadtrip of a sexual deviant, and the bite of S sandwhich we as the little people eat every day.  There is no doubt that the author is some kind of genius.  This book is dense and overflowing with the evidence of that fact.  In the end it just didn't interest me that much.  I have no feelings for any of the characters, other than repugnance.  It's not as if I was just aghast page after page by Slothrup's antics, including sex with a 12 year old girl, but instead I suppose I became jaded and weary of the barrage.  I'm reminded of listening to a comedian from the '60s, dropping the N word and F bombs a mile a minute.  How funny is that nowdays, how shocking is it?  This is how I feel about the sexual content in GR.  Outlandish, perverse, yes, but it loses it's bite quickly.  Frankly, I feel that way about many aspects of the novel.  Like anyone else I'll mark a page when I come across a beautiful passage or something that really sticks with me.  I did that once in GR....the goodbye scene between Slothrup and Katje.  Nothing else in this book really grabbed me.  I don't consider the time invested as wasted, yet nor do I consider myself enriched or better off for the experience.",2009-03-09

Here's my bottom line opinion: It is evident from the novel that Pynchon is unquestionably a smart man and more knowledgable about most things than I could ever hope to be, but Gravity's Rainbow is on the whole pretty bad.    If extracted, the mediocre main plot would occupy all of perhaps 200 pages.  It might have been somewhat interesting standing on its own.  But the other 650+ (!!!) pages of non value adding digression utterly ruins this novel.  Occasionally humorous but mostly a tiresome chore to get through.  I'm not even sure how I did it.  I read it during lunch hour perhaps twice a week, over a period of maybe five or six months.  Never got engrossed and only enjoyed what I was reading maybe 5%-10% of the time.  But I persevered for two reasons:    1. I'd heard it was the most difficult fiction novel ever and challenging to finish.  I wanted to see if I could do it.    2. I'd hoped the plot would improve further in as Slothrop neared his goal.    Ok, so I finished it but was the time spent worth it?  Absolutely not, without question.

The prose was dense and stumbling. And \\""dense and stumbling\\"" does not translate into \\""my mental genius was only able to attain the mystical Pynchon epiphany after purchasing an annotated guide\\"" -- it means that the writing was clumsy, halting, poorly structured, and a royal pain.     \\""Dense\\"" seems to come up as a compliment in many of the reviews here -- as some sort of self-congratulatory pat on the back for the fact that the reviewer is discerning enough (and lonely enough) to read this book cover to cover multiple times. Oddly enough, I think that \\""inability to express oneself clearly in writing\\"" is not an overwhelming reference for an author.     The schizophrenic non-linear method of laying the story out is not clever and was not by any means new or groundbreaking when this book came out -- it had been done before, and it had been done well. It was done badly here. In this case, the literary gimmick seemed like an attempt to cover for a shoddy story.     An overwhelming fascination with genitalia does not make a book \\""edgy\\"".

If you are unable to derive intense meaning from the randomly strung-together thoughts (being generous here) don't think of it as a personal failing, you've just not been properly hoodwinked into rejecting a belief that good literature ought to be well-written and meaningful.     If you do choose to make the effort to attain the Gravity Rainbow epiphany, you will no doubt be thoroughly rewarded since you could read anything into this load of garbage that you might desire.

Much has been said about Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow; even more written about it since it was published 35 years ago.    There are a myriad of threads running through this novel.  I have read Gravity's Rainbow four times in my life thus far; each reading offered something new; something I did not pick up on the last time.

The only reason I felt compelled to persevere with it was to try to understand the comparisons to my fave writer David Foster Wallace, but beyond a few obvious homages I can't see anything I like about DFW's writing in Pynchon.   The bit with the dude eating all these gross sweets an old lady is giving him because he wants to be polite was pretty good, part of the 5% of the book that seems to suggest that Pynchon could actually write something engaging if he wanted to. The bit about the Schwarzkommando, a supernatural soldier created by a spell which the casters think failed, who go to Africa and take over colonies, presumably as the sinister beginnings of some world domination, sounds like a great outline for a sci-fi film/novel, but this concept is talked about for like one page and then disappears.

The rain was pounding down for weeks with a ferocity that was unusual even for the rainy Northwest. I remember on the third day the gutters fell off the roof. I sat in my basement room, (luckily on high ground,) turning page after page trying to decipher this vast tome, unable to work at my outdoor job during the time-a perfect time to read this book! It almost takes a degree in Engineering and a degree in History to understand the myriad of concepts that are unleashed. The plot is highly experimental and full of digressions. You can't take it all in in one reading, its nearly impossible. If concepts evade you or you get lost its best not to linger, move on through the book and after a few hundred pages you'll either catch on or toss this one in the circular file. This book isn't for everyone. Legend has it that Thomas Pynchon wrote this book by hand in the tiny neat handwriting of an engineer, on graph paper, wacked out of his mind on LSD and speed in a Mexico City apartment building. It doesn't matter how this book was conceived, the fact is this is one of the great minds and most elusive literary talents out there.<br /><br />My approach to Gravity's Rainbow was to not try to understand it, rather, just try to finish it. In the end there was some coherence to the story although I can't say it was easy to understand. Its best to get a guide to the novel, a plot summary that includes a background into some the history of German Rocketry, as well as a background of the history of the 2nd world war and the V2 rocket attacks in England. The black humor in this book is all over the place and never try to take the novel seriously-this is satire in its highest form. Absurdity runs rampant and reality is constantly breaking down.

It's sort of a historical novel set in Europe during WWII, and the style ranges from bawdy parody of serious war novels to elegy for lost worlds to...everything else? At first it was baffling because it was impossible to pick out a theme, (unless you count the many strange uses for calculus).

In the end I enjoyed GR, even though I'd estimate that there are 150 pages of filler, made up of dated pop culture references, mildly amusing songs, dead end characters, and anecdotes that aren't good enough to warrant deep analysis, however historically accurate.<br /><br />The whole lets-describe-sex-a-la-Henry-Miller thing, may have rattled cages and shaken up the man in '71, but it feels self indulgent now. I understand we live in a horrible, depraved world, where horrible depraved things happen, but Pynchon appears to get a masochistic thrill of rubbing our faces in it (Kajte `gift' to Brigadeer Pudding and Slothrup and Bianca's introduction/relationship spring to mind). What purpose do these depraved anecdotes serve?<br /><br /> What I am interested in, and why I think most people would bother to read a book as meandering and Important as GR, is to divine the meaning, some irreducible Point, about the nature of the world.<br /><br /> Towards the end it seems like P lets his guard down when he says, \\""human consciousness, that poor cripple, that deformed and doomed thing,\\""839 leads us blindly in a world where, \\""generation after generation of men in love with pain and passivity serve out their time in the Zone ...desperately addicted to the comforts others sells them, however useless, ugly or shallow, willing to have life defined for them by men whose only talent is for death.\\"" (872 in a crappy bantam paperback edition) It is difficult to see where exactly the hope lies, and some amount of hope, I would argue, is needed in all great works of art.<br /><br /> I would summarize P's perspective in GR as: People are deluded, nasty creatures whose morals and behaviors are easily conditioned and manipulated.

I have no idea why 400 characters were necessary to tell this enigmatic tale -- publishers, a scorecard, upon reprint, would help even diligent readers keep track. One suspects that passages of drafts were composed by a not altogether sober mind, although the edited drafts show discipline. However, there are places where all semblance of taste is altogether forsaken, not sure why, unless the forces of anti-gravity were simply just too overpowering. We live under a death sentence, true enough, as we all know -- the silent rocket may strike us randomly at any time. Randomly, that is, unless you're Tyrone Slothrup. With his track record it should have been harder for him to get a date. Didn't find many, or even any, lady characters who weren't predictably drawn as simple objects of desire. I think Pynchon aspired to be an American James Joyce in this novel. The writing is brilliant in many passages but Mason & Dixon transported where this novel did not, nor did V. Saul Bellow's audience once was estimated to be in the range of 20,000. Pynchon's audience is narrower -- truth be told, I fear, the audience which really understood this work is 0001. At this point Pynchon seemed to write for himself whatever he damn well pleased. Perhaps, he has earned this distinction by virtue of the merits of his extraordinary work. Perhaps, he wants to lift us beyond the realm of gravity to a higher place.

Sure, everyone has heard about how hard Gravity's Rainbow is to read and understand, but it's not until you actually start reading it that you know what these people are talking about.  You can imagine the horrors that await when approaching a tome of this size, but the only way into this monster is through the first page, and once the journey has begun, the only way out is through the farthest exit, the last page, 776 pages later.  But, alas, I exaggerate.<br /><br />There are a couple of things to do to prepare yourself for reading this book.  First, as most reviewers have suggested, buy the freaking reader's guide, OK?  It doesn't explain everything, but it's a great help.  Second, set aside some time for reading, because it's going to take some time to finish this one.  Just because it's nearly 800 pages long doesn't mean it's the newest Stephen King novel with a simplistic plot.  Third, and finally, realize that if you get confused while reading, you're not the only one.  If you can't understand a sentence or a paragraph, read it three or four times to get the full meaning.  That really helped me in reading Gravity's Rainbow.  Now, for my review...<br /><br />The major thing about this book is perspective.  If you can't perceive the order of the novel and understand the obscure references, you're going to call the novel trash, most likely.  This novel is most certainly not trash.  However, I have also seen more than one review on Amazon praising Gravity's Rainbow to such an extent that I'm assuming these readers imagine it to be a postmodern bible, and I don't think it's that, either.  In essence, Thomas Pynchon has created a very complex plot that is fairly historically accurate and, as Tim Leary said in his book Intelligence Agents, portrays the forces of government and business at work in the world accurately as well.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing about this novel is that the Gravity's Rainbow-worshippers that I mentioned earlier take the lives and paranoias of the characters that live in the Zone of the novel as models for their lives.  While I do think that Pynchon is encouraging a healthy skepticism about those in authority, he also seems to be damning those forces which create paranoia and treachery in the world.  The paranoias of Pynchon's characters are due to this treachery; there is nothing glamourous about them.  And for Slothrop, the main character of the novel (if there is any main character), his paranoia (or lack thereof at key times) leads him to become the Fool, the sympathetic figure who has stumbled blindly into a world he cannot control, and, eventually, causes him to break into fragments.  Slothrop is not a grand man; he is the pawn of great forces even when he thinks he is free.<br /><br />In general, Gravity's Rainbow is a great novel, although it rambles on too much in places.  Both universal and modern themes get explored.  One of the big themes of the novel, for instance, and probably the theme that raises the most questions for me, is Pynchon's Gnostic theme, in which he suggests that the forces of nature, Nature's God, if you will, might actually be an evil entity bent on torturing and killing the very creations it was meant to protect.  To me, a theme like that proves that Gravity's Rainbow is a deep and important novel, even if it seems childish at points.  But it's certainly not easy to understand, so don't say I didn't warn you.  Those who enter the book without intelligence will not likely find any intelligence.ainbow-worshippers that I mentioned earlier take the lives and paranoias of the characters that live in the Zone of the novel as models for their lives.

Slothrop is not a grand man; he is the pawn of great forces even when he thinks he is free. <br /> <br />In general, Gravity's Rainbow is a great novel, although it rambles on too much in places.  Both universal and modern themes get explored.  One of the big themes of the novel, for instance, and probably the theme that raises the most questions for me, is Pynchon's Gnostic theme, in which he suggests that the forces of nature, Nature's God, if you will, might actually be an evil entity bent on torturing and killing the very creations it was meant to protect.  To me, a theme like that proves that Gravity's Rainbow is a deep and important novel, even if it seems childish at points.  But it's certainly not easy to understand, so don't say I didn't warn you.

If you just read it, I think, you'll enjoy yourself, and maybe some resonance of a point will emerge afterwards. There is a motive here, but basically the book is just fun. I hear GR condemned as 'pretentious' all the time. But how can you say that about a book in which ten pages never pass without some character bursting into song, in which the protagonist is chased in a hot-air balloon by a gang of limerick-reciting thugs, in which a girl is attacked by a giant octopus, a book which sheds light on the great Mother's Conspiracy? One thing GR never is is boring. At the beginning, the narrative is perfectly coherent with only a few eccentricities of style; by the end, when it really starts disintegrating, you've gotten used to it.

This can lead to some creative anecdotes, I grant, but there are just too many ancillary passages that peter out into \\"". . . . . .\\"" when the steam's run out that I'm quite convinced Pynchon himself lost the thread. It isn't his, \\"". . . Tree of Life, which must be apprehended all at once, together, in parallel\\"" style, or the way the story bounced around in space and time that caused my eyes to glaze over but these rants of Pynchon's, which add nothing to our understanding of Tyrone Slothrop or the overall mood of the book unless that mood is one of random meaninglessness - completely antithetical to the Grand Conspiracy in which Pynchon is so insistent his characters believe they are immersed. Pynchon spews forth these digressions in an unending torrent (digressions heading off on tangents, defined by ever finer changes in the \\""Ecks!\\"" and \\""Why?\\"") as if he expects the reader to share the same paranoid/drug-addled state of mind as his characters (\\""in the zone,\\"" so to speak har-har, where, since anything can happen, it necessarily does!) so that the proper irrational conclusions will be drawn, \\""Oh, the complete history of Slothrop's zoot suit and Planetoid Katspiel where pinballs come from . . . a-and oh yeah!

Sweet anticipation of the Big Revelation when the scales will fall and They will be named. Pynchon is a master at postponing that moment indefinitely and keeping it all lively with his fancy oh-wow-man-I-wish-I-was-high-right-now-so-I-could-appreciate-this footwork.<br />The humor in the book mainly derives from Pynchon's cranking up the gross-out factor which I'm sure was cutting edge in 1973 and seems to be the reason Gravity's Rainbow has been able to coast so long on it's notoriety. Burlesque denizens of the Zone soft-shoe (or sometimes foxtrot) their way across the story in droves. The effeminate soldier who is not taken in by a diversionary ploy involving buxom showgirls, and who, when confronted at gunpoint (\\""'. . .this is out of bounds, you big sillies.'\\""), fairly hikes up skirt and scampers off Stage Left is played for laughs, but such humor strikes me as being more hopelessly dated than universal, the innuendo about as subtle as Eric Idle as that Monty Python character, poking us in the ribs, \\""Wink wink, nudge nudge. Say no more, say no more. Eh? Eh?!\\""<br />However, while I can resent Pynchon for his self-indulgence, I can't hate him because there is some fine writing in Gravity's Rainbow, but pointing out what exactly is appealing is a task akin to pulling hair out of molasses. The problem is he oversells the lie that is supposed to contain the kernel of truth hidden within. The facade is encrusted with too many gargoyles; cherubim and succubi jostle for space, bodies pressed together obscenely; caryatids groan under the weight not only of spires, clock towers, dormers, balconies, balustrades and the crenulated eaves of the roof, but are called upon to support each other. There's graffiti over the gilded, gessoed, plastered, parqueted, mosaicked, painted, carpeted surfaces. It snakes around corners, up and over statuary and seems innocuous enough - a tooth blacked out on Priapus, Aphrodite with Groucho brows -oh look! A marble micromosaic depicting an alchemist holding aloft the Philosopher's Stone, said Stone surrounded by requisite halo of cartoony light-rays (and that's not meant to be *sun* light, if you know what I mean) - or is that a Chess piece he's holding? Made of Imipolex G? Hard to tell: it's been obscured by the words, \\""Rocketman was here!\\"" But mentally unfold the surfaces: ceiling, wall, floor; lay them flat, smooth the ripples in masonry and certain areas of graffiti spread, break apart while others overlap, creating dark shadows and a form takes shape - like a Mad Magazine Fold-In but in reverse - a pictogram emerges - the back of a giant hand, fingers curled away except the middle one. But no. That's not the message we want to see and now the spell's been broken. Anything we might have seen there dissipates into the Aether, much like Slothrop himself eventually does.

Yes, it does have stunning imagery throughout (and can be considered a classic on that alone), but the novel is primarily concerned with the major forces driving the planet. There are too many themes to mention here (in the line of life's embrace of death, the inability to ever be free of a tyrannical control whether that tyranny is yourself or huge industrial cabals, fate/paranoia v. entropy, etc.) Simply put, I can think of no other author ...who can use symbolism and allegory so well. Every detail is carefully chosen....It would take years of reading to even partially comprehend the layers of symbolism in the novel and Pynchon's power to tie plots and concepts together, besides reflecting the paranoia of the characters, are amazing feats. As for the external information applied to the central plot, I'd be lying if I said I understood even a fifth of it, but from what I picked up things like Poisson distribution and Godel's Theorum are applied to the plot with total satisfaction, reinforcing the themes instead of detracting from it as others have said. ...the novel also has some of the greatest set pieces I've ever seen. Totally surrealistic, Pynchon writes of lost harmonicas in sewers guarded by Malcolm X, giant pompous Adenoids and their cocaine, aerial pie fights, pig-costumed Americans with sexual attractions to bizarre plastics running from a group of African scientists that appear to have manifested themselves from a German propaganda film, disenchanted tragic lightbulbs, Kazoo quartets, a Pavlovian octopus, S&M adventures that segue into WWI flashbacks, masturbation to a Nobel prize, and on and on for almost 800 pages. And for all everyone says the book is not that difficult to read. You can't watch TV or something while reading it. It demands concentration. But it does make sense when it's supposed to...and is even fairly chronological. In my opinion, Pynchon's literary strengths (as opposed to philosophical strenghts), is his ability to imitate authors, but turn their prose inside out and combine it to the point where it becomes a seperate entity. Thus, you get Faulkner, Beckett,Melville, Fitzgerald, Joyce, Borges, Calvino,Vonnegut etc. all in one page of mind-numbingly great prose.

I read the book (Yes; `cover to cover,' all you one star skeptics). I am not an English major. I did not read it with a dissertation or any sort of annotations. I admit I took some notes on things that happened, because it is such a long read. However, I must say that it is well written and that I enjoyed it. I found the dense style entertaining; Pynchon spins yarns that sound like paranoid graduate school theses. He begins to make it so convincing that for a few moments he has you believing in some paranoid/abnormal conception of history, and at that moment he winds up and says something completely ridiculous , which shatters the whole idea that he had been selling. The novel frequently had me in stitches, and though the jokes took a little bit more thought than the average novel, they were `worth the work' to understand (that much more amusing). The book was something of a cosmic farce, but also made some very worthwhile commentary on the nature of life (or more precisely, the nature of history). As far as the style goes, this book is for people who hate the exposition and denouement (resolution) sections of a novel. It is layer upon layer of development with barely any (or no exposition and denouement). We learn about characters only as they apply to the issues at hand; the characters are subsidiary to the larger themes of the work. I don't understand why people denounce this novel because the style is difficult, or say that Pynchon is a bad writer because he makes the reader work so hard. That is precisely what makes him a good writer; he has the scruples to make the reader work. If the reader doesn't work there is no art in the novel, only entertainment. It is only by inspiring us to learn and rethink that art has meaning; if you sigh contentedly in your easy chair after finishing a book, that simply isn'thappening. Poor writers work so that the audience doesn't have to; they are not artists, they are worse than the people, to which they are pandering.

I  loved the chase sequences after Slothrop, the scenes of Roger and Jessica  alone at night in bed as the Rockets descended upon their city, the  incredible openingallusions, the heartbreaking last appearance of Roger at  the dinner as he finally comes to grips with the reality that he lost the  one he loved, the crazy, cinematic, and beautiful ending, and on, and on,  and on. If you're serious about reading and Literature, this is a must.  This book has more to offer then any other I've ever come across, and if  you're willing to put up a lot of effort, you will be rewarded. (And hey,  I've read that Pynchon didn't even understand a lot of what he wrote as he  was at the time of writing it ... on various  drugs... it was the early 70's after all).",2000-06-20

I find alarming, however, the cult-mystique that readers have towards writers. The weird, shifty phrases they utilize in their  reviews; very irreverent towards the artist, methinks. It is dangerous to  think such a way. Leave the poor man be. 'Tis only art. Please don't  overintellectize it any more than it already has been.

The first time around, I was focused purely on the novel's plot (or for some people, the lack thereof); the second reading was for a class; this last reading was probably the most entertaining one, though i don't think it should take  three readings for everyone, just me.  Anyway, here's what i learned this  time around:<br />I think it's important to read Pynchon as a surprisingly  sentimental writer who cares about his characters, despite their  eccentricities and maladjustments.  Various passages of the novel like the  Christmas service which Jessica and Roger stumble onto, or Slothrop's last  scene of &quot;feeling natural&quot; are complex, delicate, but intensely  beautiful examples of Pynchon's prosaic skill and the great deal of care  with which he situates his characters during moments of epiphany or  transition.  I think a lot of people get turned off by Pynchon's ostensible  disregard for morality or literary formality; in actuality, he's a very  sensitive writer.  <br />I was also able to eschew the need for doing readerly  detective work of my own this time; there really aren't much answers to the  novel's paranoid queries.  I think the plot synopsis at Amazon.com is  pretty much as clear as it gets.  But getting rid of plot expectations is  actually quite liberating, and I've discovered that GR is really more a  process than a story.   <br />I hope other readers, even those who bashed  Pynchon in the past, might give him a chance without projecting  expectations onto him; there's so much to be discovered in this book and  all it takes is an open and willing mind (and probably fewer than three  readings!).",2000-05-03

If reading a book quickly and for fast entertainment is your approach, then its  accumulation of characters, themes, and history probably won't find  purchase in your imagination.  My first reading took half a year -- reading  little else -- and while I can't claim 100% understanding of all its  references, it's hard to deny that it's an amazing treat for serious  readers.  <br />It's hard to imagine a modern reader would pass up the  opportunity to read this for the first, or even a second time.",2000-04-25

Ah!  The &quot;I&quot; of  the beholder!

Probably right. I can now judge it  in all its glory. This is undoubtedly all those things everyone else has  said: the Great Postwar Novel, the Great American Novel, one of the top  five novels of the century. I was simply astonished by its sheer brilliance  and technical trailblazing in every department. No book has ever seemed so  unique to me. And, although it will sound stupid, this is the only book  that I have finished feeling a different person. I'm not aware of any book  that has so much in it, in terms of ideas, emotions, characters, cultural  and scientific references - there is something for everyone here, everyone  has their own favourite passage, their own favourite scene, their own  favourite quote.<br />As a Brit I'm always interested as to how Pynchon  portrays us, and for the most part in all his books (particularly Mason and  Dixon) he does it well. However, in GR there were two points I wanted to  rectify before the great American public. First, Pynchon falls into the  usual trap of thinking &quot;Britain&quot; and &quot;England&quot; are  synonymous - they're not. England is just one part of Britain, as are  Scotland and Wales. It's inaccurate and annoying to think they're the same  thing. Secondly, there's a grating slip early on, on p.38, where Pynchon  mentions &quot;downtown Tunbridge Wells&quot;. Let's get this quite clear -  no town outside America has a &quot;downtown&quot;, and certainly not  Tunbridge Wells which is a deeply conservative little place. It may pass  unoticed by foreign readers but for Brits is is a slight hiccup.<br />Anyway,  these trifles pale in comparison to the genius and epic stature of this  book. What amazed me is that it seems even more relevant today, with out  concerns about globalised companies controlling the world. This is animportant work of fiction that will never leave you.

I keep two copies, to be able to give one if I run across the right person (so far, just twice). <br />In the fifteen years since first learning about it, I suppose I've read it  straight through three times. After reaching a certain point of familiarity  though, I realized it made just as much sense to read it in a non-linear  manner -- you won't gain any more reading it sequentially and the  &quot;ending&quot; does not function as one in any traditional  sense.<br />Yes, it is hard to read and disappointing at first. The cut and  paste format is a frustrating initial barrier. I didn't finish it the first  two times I started it, but every time I put it back on the shelf it  acquired more weight than the books around it. So many of these reviews  concentrate on the difficulty of reading this, but it's not a &quot;get  it/don't get it&quot; book, despite all the comments to the contrary, and  reducing it to a simple binary doesn't begin to do it justice.<br />Others may  have been written before this, but Gravity's Rainbow is the world's finest  Random-Access Manuscript. Drop your cortex on any page and be entertained.  You will be placed in the immediate presence of a ferocious intelligence  (is there any other fiction work of this stature that has inlaid nature,  science and engineering so adroitly?) and, more importantly, a ferocious  heart. Don't be fooled by the sex, drugs and gross juvenile humor (yes,  there's a lot of all three). This is a passionate, epic evocation of the  world at large, and will not be reduced or bound to definition.<br />It is  _not_ frivolous _or_ the work of a burn-out. The discipline and energy in  it is singular both in the author's writing (no, I don't think that Mason  &amp; Dixon is as good, despite its maturity) as well as in literature in  general. I like some of the other authors whose names are compared here,  but there is no meaningful comparison.<br />A help guide for this book is likethe proverbial vivisection -- you may think you're learning a lot, but the  frog will be dead when you're done. Challenge yourself: go it alone and  leave the tour guides for someone else, or come back to them when you have  more familiarity with it.<br />Thirty years after a novel was written about a  time thirty years before it, the world has yet to catch up to it, and  that's _not_ an April Fool's joke!",2000-04-01

I've read  Gravity's Rainbow and can only pity the poor, alienated, intellectual who  would actually read it five times.

Later on, I read it in English, and although I consider it one of the best, most complex books I have ever read, I was a little disappointed in the rest of Pynchon's production. I think he reached his zenith with  &quot;Rainbow&quot; and it has been all downhill ever since. The book is  not easy to read, and the action is not easy to follow, because the author  likes to take the scenic route to enrich our view, so we get the whole  treatment with physics, engineering, strategy, espionage, sex, love, fear,  paranoia, and an assortment of other fields -some strange, some crude- that  provide us with the view of a world gone mad from the prizm of an author  that seems to have been down the rabbit hole once or twice. The only thing  that has always bothered me about &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot; is my  inability to understand its ending. I want to believe the author designed  it in such a way that it would be very ambiguous, but I am really not sure.  In any case, a great reading experience, although, reader, beware: those  who look for uplifting messages; those who don't like harsh language; those  who don't like depictions of sex; those who would not be able to read  through very descriptive passages of (one hopes) less than popular and  rather grotesque sexual practices; those who would not continue reading  after the lavishly descripted love scene between a grown man and a twelve  year-old girl; those who dislike &quot;dense&quot;, descriptive literature;  those who don't really go for the stream of consciousness stuff; those who  don't like war books; those who have read this far and already hate the  book and the review; all those potential readers should know that in  &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot; you get hundreds of pages of what I have just  outlined, and more.

(So obviously I like it.)  And it's true, as they say, that on each reading you find something new.  And fresh perspective.   <br />How to prepare for Gravity's Rainbow to get the most out of it?  Well,  if style's a problem, I suggest reading W.S. Burroughs, D. Barthelme, and  early I. Reed.  (Comparisons to light weights like Wallace, Vollman,  Stephenson strike this reader as absurd.)  Perhaps it's not discussed as  much as it ought to be, but GR's style owes a lot to the famous Buroughs  &quot;cut-up&quot; method used to great in effect in the Soft Machine  trilogy.  The only difference being that in GR the splices in the text are  made to seem seamless.  The resulting style, then, is comparable to the  associations in a dream.  GR is basically a *dreamscape*.  Do our dreams  have plots and consistent characterization?  Not usually, and so it's no  surprise that GR also lacks these.<br />Style aide, as for the content.  You  don't need an encyclopedia or concordance, etc. to enjoy this novel.   Believe or it or not, it's true.  Of course, it's also fun to treat it like  a big tome of clues. . . and to follow their leads . . . somewhere.  But  first and foremost it's the beautiful palimpsest of a dream.  It takes some  practice perhaps for a first-time reader to adapt to the flow, so to speak.   <br />How does GR compare to Pynchon's other works?  IMO, it far surpasses  all them.  If I were to assign a second place, it would be to V.,  definitely not CoL 49 which Pynchon has in fact repudiated (see intro to  Slow Learner), nor the rather trite Vineland, nor Manson&amp;Dixon (if only  the latter had been written entirely in the style of the opening pages).   Anyhow, none of these novels can in any meaningful sense  &quot;prepare&quot; the first time reader for GR.<br />It's more than a novel,  it's Work.  A reader should treat it that way.",2000-01-18
