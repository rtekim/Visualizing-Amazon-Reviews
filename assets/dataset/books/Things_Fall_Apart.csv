Living through the 80's in Dublin in many ways gave me a connection to Edinburgh during the same period.  Both cities were ravaged by drugs, particularly an influx of cheap heroin and families and communities were destroyed by the devastating effect it had on them.  Here we have a mother trying to cope with her children as the epidemic sneaks up on her and her struggle with the self-denial is at sometimes painful.  This is an excellent portrayal of people on the edge, fighting to cope with the colossal assault that addiction is on a family.  Having witnessed the effect on families in my own community at the time, I can confidently applaud the author for getting her portrayal spot on.  But leave that aside for a minute.  Was I hooked from early on, did I love the narrative and was I convinced by the dialogue and drawn in by the story as it developed.  It was a yes in every case. This is a cracking read. A well deserved 5 stars from me.	2015-08-11

In Things Fall Apart, Chinua Achebe has introduced us to Okonkwo, a perfect example of a tragic hero. The irony in Achebe's novel is that Okonkwo's error is in his false judgement of gentleness as frailty. Attempting to compensate for his father's lack of success, Okonkwo dons a mask of rigidity and ultimately breaks because of his own faults. Although Okonkwo is recognized by society as a successful man because of his accomplishments within the clan, throughout the novel he continuously errs; thus his life spirals out of control. One particular misfortune that befalls Okonkwo's clan toward the end of the book is out of his hands but intertwining subplots that Achebe weaves into the story show that Okonkwo, through dealing with these misfortunes in his own way, is still fumbling around in the dark. This is a great book and the ending is truly tragic in every sense of the word.	2015-06-13

Chinua Achebe's unassuming voice spins a raw picture of Nigerian tribal life before and after the  colonial struggle. Achebe attempts to balance the story without being overly critical of colonialism by introducing a war ridden community where conflicting interests run amok in collision courses all the time. Interestingly, Achebe sheds a peculiar light on what it takes to be the ruler or the ruled compared to African traditions that had enslaved the Africans before they found themselves victimized by unassailable force of colonialism. Achebe's protagonist Okonkwo ruled his household with absolute authority feeding on fear and atrocity heavily fortified in the name of tradition. Things Fall Apart is not apologetic in depicting African norms, and its end seems to leave more puzzling questions than answers especially regarding morals.  But overall it is a good read.	2015-06-07

Unfortunately, there are no advantages of plot or character development, or even use of language, to offset the ugliness of daily beatings of women, human sacrifice, women bought and sold in marriage like cattle, and beatings of children. The main character is unlikeable and does not change. The plot is meandering and uncertain; there is almost no dialogue and little structure. Interesting and important events are separated by long descriptions of daily life, which read like descriptive articles in a magazine or encyclopedia. Characters are introduced suddenly and for no apparent reason and then disappear with no comment.  price, like cattle.

I read this book in order to learn about the tribal cultures that I minister to. The best part of the book were the bits of tribal wisdom that are scattered throughout.<br /><br />After visiting Nigeria, I am struck by how much Christianity has improved the lives of the people. Okonkwo, the tragic hero of the book, lives in a world of magic and intertribal conflict. His wives and kids are afraid of him. He works hard to provide for his family, but continually faces setbacks. He takes the heads of his enemies and ultimately commits suicide because he kills a man in a fit of rage. Even though missionaries are not presented in a sympathetic manner in the book, ultimately missionaries brought a message of hope that changed people's lives for the better. The story of Okonkwo is the story of &#34;every man&#34; and the truth is that every man needs Jesus. Achebe had a different opinion, but for me, the message of this book is that without Jesus, &#34;Things Fall Apart.&#34;<br /><br />Today in Nigeria, the clash between traditional animist religion (which is seen in this book) and Christianity is almost completely over. Now the conflict is between Christianity and Islam. It remains to be seen which of the monotheist religions will triumph.<br /><br />Here is something I wrote after visiting one of the last Sacred Forests (mentioned in the book) that still exist in Nigeria.<br /><br />‚ÄúKnock, knock, knock.‚Äù There was no answer. I banged on the door harder. ‚ÄúIs anyone there?‚Äù I shouted. Still no answer. The door I was banging on belongs to a temple dedicated to worshiping demon spirits. Surrounding the door were multiple idols with grotesque faces carved into wood. At the feet of the idols were offerings left by devout supplicants.<br /><br />I was in the heart of Nigeria, visiting the Osogbo Sacred Grove. It is a small but dense forest on the outskirts of the city of Ede that has been named as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest is considered to be the home of Osun and a pantheon of Yoruba gods. Scattered along a meandering river are sanctuaries, shrines, sculptures, and works of art all dedicated to celebrating demonic spirits.<br /><br />For the Yoruba tribe, Osun is a goddess of fertility, the personification of the ‚Äúwaters of life,‚Äù and the spiritual mother of the people of the town. The founder of the town of Osogbo was Larooye. She made a pact with the goddess and in return the demon spirit promised prosperity and protection for her people. The people believe that as long as they worship at her shrine, they will continue to be blessed. Priestesses from the Yoruba tribe go out into the forest at night and see visions of spirits. During the day they build statues of mud, wire, concrete, and wood in the image of the spirits that they have seen.<br /><br />The problem with praying to idols made of wood and stone is that they never answer.  The Bible says, ‚ÄúTheir idols are silver and gold, the work of men‚Äôs hands. They have mouths, but they do not speak;'eyes they have, but they do not see; They have ears, but they do not hear;'noses they have, but they do not smell; They have hands, but they do not handle;'feet they have, but they do not walk;'nor do they mutter through their throat‚Ä¶‚Äù (Psalm 115:4-7)<br /><br />But Jesus answers prayer. When we cry out to Him, He hears us. This was the message I preached in Nigeria and this is the good news I share with you today!Site.

In the beginning, I absolutely hated this book and could not stand the character of Okonkwo. Okonkwo is headstrong, domineering and often beats his wives and children. As the story progressed, I began to feel pity for Okonkwo. Too often we hear of colonization from the European point of view, so for me it was quite different to hear about it from the African point of view. The way the author described the loss of clan traditions and brotherhood broke my heart.<br /><br />Additionally, this book is well written with powerful quotes such as: ‚ÄúThe white man is very clever. He came quietly and peaceably with his religion. We were amused at his foolishness and allowed him to stay. Now he has won our brothers, and our clan can no longer act like one. He has put a knife on the things that held us together and we have fallen apart.‚Äù<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Africa or who is just looking for something different to read.	2015-04-08

I read this novel in English Literature class in college and now I'm teaching it at the High School level. The students have varying reactions to the novel and truthfully, I didn't really appreciate it as much as I should have on my first read-through. A lot of this was due to my impression of the &#34;protagonist&#34; Okonkwo being a bit one-dimensional. On a second reading, however, he is a more nuanced and textured character than I remember in college and in spite of his short-comings as a person, I found that the character is fleshed-out enough that I don't really hate him for the awful things he does because it's understandable why someone who led the life that he in the culture he lived in could turn out the way he did.<br /><br />The book is an undeniable masterpiece with a lot to say about colonialism, racism and masculinity. Achebe wrote the novel so that the late-nineteenth century &#34;Scramble for Africa,&#34; as it has come to be known, would stop being told in an incorrect and condescending way by the colonizers. He wanted to put to bed the idea of the &#34;noble savage,&#34; and demonstrate that the reality of life in nineteenth-century Nigeria was far more complex than Westerners have come to believe and that, in spite of being less developed, the people of that place and time had rich traditions, vibrant cultures and complex social and religious institutions that weren't all that dissimilar to those found in the Western world. Achebe is able to bridge the divide between cultures and paints the picture of a world that is both alien and at the same time familiar to those of us living in the West today.<br /><br />This is a remarkable work that is worthy of all the accolades it has received. It is also a relatively quick read and can be finished over the span of a weekend. If you haven't already read it, then I'd highly recommend doing so.	2015-02-27

Granted the author provided a glossary of Ibo words and phrases, but I found it practically impossible to follow the story line because of so many unknown words and so many characters with names I could not pronounce.  Keeping track of who was who was very disruptive.  I might as well have been trying to read a story in a foreign language.  And the treatment of women and children by the males was atrocious!  Okonkwo was a mean, explosive male chauvinist always beating people and bellowing and screaming!  Sheesh what a nightmare to live in his world!!	2015-02-12

Having risen through his own efforts from being son of a wastrel father, he is now an important man in his Nigerian village, a position he jealously guards by ruling his wives and children with an iron hand.<br />Achebe gives a good picture of what life was like before white settlers came - the superstitions, wars and beheadings of rival clans, the fear of the oracle. And then the first missionaries arrive with their apparently harmless religion, followed by the first administrators, and the clan appears to be 'breaking up and falling apart'...<br />Vivid and enjoyable portrayal of old Nigeria, leaving the reader uncertain whether 'westernization' was a good thing for the ordinary people.	2015-01-24

This little book was selected by my book club as our January 2015 selection. Although written half a century ago it is still a compelling tale. Achebe brings village life to life in a curious way. We follow the protagonist through his struggles to achieve wealth and status while overcoming the failures of his father. We watch his fall and exile. We watch his humbling and possible redemption.<br />It matters not that this story is set in Africa. Achebe explores universal human characteristics, even if the particular geographic setting is unfamiliar.<br />It is a curious read which I found addictive. I've now read it twice this month. Captivating.	2015-01-15

I've given copies of this book to two different people, one American, Catholic, who praised highly the work of the early missionaries, the other, a Nigerian, who agreed with me, they opened the door after which all hell broke loose.<br />Mr. Achebe's ability to explain history in the context of tribal generations is more authentic than anything you would get from textbooks.  You know in your heart, as you read, this is what really took place.<br />Let us honor his memory and his incredible accomplishments, the highest of which very well may be this book.	2015-01-09

The story starts out with the main character Okonkwo who is well known in his clan in Umuofia. He is also known for his farming skills on how much time and work he spent on to make it one of the best. One of Okonkwo‚Äôs flaws is that he doesn't want to seem weak. This makes him do irrational things when his name is close to being shamed. He also doesn't want to end like his father who was lazy and owed money to other clansmen, which is weak in his mind. Okonkwo plans on being the chief of his village one day and become the strongest member of his clan. As the reading goes on Chinua Achebe uses some of the African tribal words to stay close to his heritage which gives a better feeling for the story. Later in the story Okonkwo was sent to in exile for seven years for killing someone in the clan; While in exile he hears that some men came to his village and started to convert the clan members to their religion. This fumes Okonkwo knowing that his fellow members are leaving their own religion and not trying to fight back to keep their religion. I would recommend this book to everyone, it is a great book which a great literal in climate. The way that Chinua Achebe describes the story and implements the African words makes it seem like you are actually there.	2014-10-10

This is my impression after reading the book. I agree with most of the other positive reviews here so I want to keep it short. IMO Things Fall Apart is not just another autobiographie but also part of Hilary Neiman's new life as a mentor and shows how quick good things can fall apart but also that bad things can fall apart too. This makes the book interesting not only for those who have heared in the past about the author and her well-appreciated, successful work as a family-attorney or later read the news about the scandal but simply for everybody.	2014-09-09

This might be somewhat challenging but the messages and tones are clear, and the chapters are short, so that even flipping back to the beginning of a chapter, or to the glossary in the back, or looking up an Igbo word on your smartphone won't take you out of the flow of the story or make this book too daunting to read. The short chapter are constructed in a way to be part of the story - the way the story is told is part of the total message of the book. But whether you pick up on it subconsciously or through careful and thoughtful reading and analysis, Achebe is always pulling you in one direction so you won't get lost and the meaning is always clear.<br /><br />I really appreciate how the book presents a variety of emotions and so-called &#34;sins&#34;, such as anger, shame, pride, laziness, and even love without judgement or sentiment. The book is as much about the inner-turmoil of the main characters as the external turmoil of a scoiety bounded by tradition and harried by imperialism.	2014-08-19

The story is lucidly, and gradually told with an acknowledgement of the reader's intelligence so there is no preachiness or use of symbolism and metaphor to convey ideas. In other words, there is no pretentiousness to this novel.

Things Fall Apart<br />By: Hillary Neiman<br />Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Purple Mango Publishing. 2014, 260 pages. (Reviewed 08/2014)<br /><br />In her book, Things Fall Apart, Neiman writes a riveting story that is impossible to put down. It is refreshing to find a writer who produces great work with the highest integrity and professionalism. She is completely transparent as she bears her heart for the world to see, not in an attempt to find pity as a victim, but to illustrate the boldness it takes to accept a second chance on life and make a difference. Neiman‚Äôs story is more than just about second chances, it is about the work and struggle life demands. She does not only admit to making a mistake, she does not make any excuses. She boldly takes the responsibility but this book is so much more than just a story about someone who falls then gets back up, it is a story of regaining faith in you after such a hard fall. Especially when so many are ready to condemn you.<br /><br />After being brought up in the convenience of upper-class America, Neiman makes no excuses correlating her upbringing to her crime. In fact, she brings to light the wonderful childhood she shared in a wonderful family. Her story makes it clear that no one is immune to the stress of this material world, and even with the complete formula of great parents and living in the right neighborhood ‚Äì problems will find us. In this society of blaming the ‚Äúworld‚Äù or the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù for everything, Neiman is completely transparent and owns her mistakes. It is amazing how she takes her readers by the hand and walks them through her fight of losing everything and having to get herself back up. She was able to find success again but most importantly, she was able to love herself again. This is such an important lesson and I recommend this book to everyone, no matter what your social status or the level of your success. This story will bless your life immensely, it has mine.<br /><br />Things Fall Apart is more than just a self-help book painting a picture of someone‚Äôs unbelievable success after a fall, it is a heartfelt true story outlining the reality that people can recover from decisions that seem to destroy one‚Äôs life and successful career. This is a wonderful love story providing hope where there seems to be none.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />J. P.

If you didn't like it then, I'd encourage you to give it another chance.<br /><br />Things Fall Apart, set in pre-colonial Nigeria, follows the life of ultra-masculine yam-farmer Okonkwo until he and his people ultimately encounter British colonists.<br /><br />Things Fall Apart was part of my high school curriculum. Back then, I dismissed the book as boring, anti-Western propaganda. I reread it (multiple times) years later, and realized that I had misjudged the book and Chinua Achebe.<br /><br />There are no good guys or bad guys in this book. You will be both fascinated and repulsed by the customs of Okonkwo and the Ibo people. I believe Achebe exaggerated the sexism and brutality of Okonkwo and the Ibo deliberately to prevent the reader from seeing them as &#34;the good guys.&#34; The British and their African allies are also not &#34;the good guys.&#34;<br /><br />Things Fall Apart is a deeply complex, unsettling, entertaining, and powerful story on the pain of unavoidable change. The players in this tale are not perfect, but when things do fall apart, you feel it. This is now my favorite book.	2014-07-05

This is the phrase that keeps creeping into my mind as I read through Hilary Neiman's auto biographical novel, Things Fall Apart. In Neiman's chilling, personal novel told with a comical yet still serious tone, we learn about the mistakes that she made as a surrogacy lawyer in attempts that we learn from them. Throughout the Neiman doesn't try to play victim, but instead just present the facts to the reader and let the reader judge her actions. Instead of reading a novel where Neiman goes over and over that she's the victim in a sticky situation, we are presented with her insightful descriptions of her imprisonment.<br /><br />Things Fall Apart tells the story of na√Øve and blindness, through Neiman's mistakes in her career as a lawyer leading to her serving time in prison. Neiman's writing style makes the story interesting as we dive deeper into events that led to her incarceration. Nowhere in the novel will you start to feel the plot slow down and you start to lose interest in the novel, as Neiman does a great job making sure that even though she's telling a story about her life and mistakes, but knows that the novel has to still be interesting. This is achieved through her tone which changes from being comic, and switching into a more serious tone when needed.<br /><br />Neiman's novel is an extremely close, personal novel and it's extremely brave of her to share her experience and mistakes with us so that we can learn from them. Things That Falls Apart is ultimately a great novel and Neiman's journey is a great, fascinating read through her mistakes ultimately leading to her being jailed. I would recommend this novel to anyone who's looking for a great read and also learn a few things along the way.	2014-06-27

He writes about his own personal environment at the time, in hope to change some things. Everyone in the book has a fear, such as how  Okonkwo fears of becoming like his lazy, shameful father, Ekwefi fears of losing her daughter, and Nwoye fears his father‚Äôs wrath. Is he trying to say that everyone has a fear? Or that only the weak have fears? Achebe I believe is trying to say it‚Äôs okay to have fears and doubts, but it‚Äôs your choice to overcome them. Some people would argue that Achebe is fearing the public and that‚Äôs why he wrote this book, so that his voice could he heard. However, he wanted his voice to he heard in a non-violent way. Personally, I think that he was just trying to tell his readers that it‚Äôs okay to have fears, but don‚Äôt let them be hidden forever. Try to voice them, like he did. He didn‚Äôt go out screaming and yelling, he did it respectfully	2014-06-13

Chinua Achebe shows us what it was like for the African people of this time. We see this through the eyes of an African ‚Äústrong man‚Äù named Okonkwo. This novel provides great insight into the atrocities‚Äô performed by the European colonists. The author has written a masterpiece that is worth reading time and time again.  Okonkwo is an Ibo Tribesman from Nigeria. Through all of Okonkwo‚Äôs life he has lived with no knowledge of any other beliefs save his tribes. This changes as Christian missionaries appear in his village preaching of a strange religion that turns many of his friends away from their original beliefs. Okonkwo is faced with the decision; fight for his people‚Äôs beliefs, or abandon all that he knows to follow these strange new people. This novel does an excellent job of making the reader feel remorse for Okonkwo. As more people begin to join Christianity the pain that it brings Okonkwo is felt with every bit of rage that Okonkwo feels for the Christians. The final chapters of this book were particularly powerful sections, as Okonkwo shows how he feels about the Christians and the consequences that follow are dealt with. The only weak area of this novel comes in about half way through. Okonkwo is seen just sitting around his house and it is very uneventful. However, the ending makes up for this weakness and allows this novel to become an excellent read.  Things Fall Apart is historical fiction about the European colonization of Nigeria. People who wish to read an excellent historical fiction book should check this out. This book also delves into the African tribal life, people who wish to know more about the tribes or the language will not be disappointed. Readers with an interest to know more about the many crimes of humanity will learn much from this read. This book is appropriate for everyone of thirteen years and older. There is a little violencethat can be disturbing to some readers. The way that some characters are treated by others can also be disturbing, especially towards the end of the book. Boys and girls will both enjoy this novel as it has something for everyone.<br /><br />Chinua Achebe is the author of Things Fall Apart. Achebe has received over thirty honorary degrees for his writing. His other novels include Arrow of God, No Longer at Ease, and Anthills of the Savannah. Chinua has received praise for all of these works, and has been called the ‚ÄúAfrican father of writing.‚Äù Achebe was born in Nigeria on November 16th 1930. He spent his life trying to promote awareness for racism, and the struggles that are happening in Africa. Achebe was paralyzed in a car accident in 1990 and became a language professor at Bard College shortly after. Chinua died on the 21st of March in 2013, he was eighty two years old, and readers have said that he will be remembered as ‚Äúthe father of Nigerian literature.‚Äù  I recommend this novel because it has really opened my mind to what truly happened during the colonization of Africa. This novel really makes the reader think about the decisions that humanity has made. It is hard to believe the atrocities that we committed at the time without a second thought. This book is great for anyone that wishes to know more about the truth or wants to read a book with great insight to the human mind. Chinua Achebe has written a powerful novel depicting what it was like to live as an African tribesman during the European colonization of Nigeria. Achebe has written what no other author has done in Things Fall Apart.	2014-06-09
US	23411175	R2PDGKEDN2N8UD	0991547802	411282594	Things Fall Apart	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Things Fall Apart - And Then You Put Them Back Together Again	I found this book to be highly engaging and interesting.  I also felt myself empathizing with the author.  Everyone makes mistakes.  Hilary Neiman's were very big ones.  There is no denying that, and she vehemently repeats this over and over throughout her story.  She makes no excuses for what she did and makes it very clear that the only thing she wants the reader to know is the truth.  As with any controversial topic in our world today, there are people who will believe whatever they read and won't bother to do their own research, to dig a little deeper, and to learn what the real facts are.<br /><br />This woman is not a monster.  She is not a babyseller.  She was a lawyer who specialized in adoption and surrogacy, a field that lawyers rarely solely specialize in.  She wanted to help people who couldn't have children become parents.  A small handful of her cases originated from a certain surrogacy agency that, initially unbeknownst to her, was running an illegal operation by hiring surrogate mothers to become pregnant before parents were involved.<br /><br />This is the point where it is important to remind the reader that Miss Neiman did not know this at the onset.  When she eventually did learn these details - that was when she made her mistake.  She should have done more; she allowed herself to be lulled into a false sense of complacency by her state's bar association, who told her not to worry about it.  She fully admits that she didn't do enough to investigate and get to the bottom of the situation then.  She greatly regrets the decisions she made during that time.<br /><br />What I find endearing in this book is the effort that she makes to help others and find herself, both during and after her imprisonment at Atwood Federal Prison Camp.  While in prison, she begins to write a book to help others like her, who were completely unprepared for what prison was to bring.  With little information out there about what the real prison experience is like, she and one of her fellow inmates decided to write something to help others like themselves prepare for what is to come when they find out that they are destined to spend some portion of their lives in prison.  She also wrote a children's book to help explain a parent's absence in prison to their children. While in prison and during her home confinement, she did a lot of soul-searching and thought, in order to better herself and figure out where, fundamentally, she went wrong.  She made the effort to change her life and make sure her moral compass and outlook on life do not again lead her astray.  Everyone makes bad decisions, some worse than others.  Inevitably, she will still end up making mistakes, just like we all do.  However, she is doing her very best to make sure that she, and others who may need her help, do not make the kind of mistakes that upended her life.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  It really opened my eyes to reality and reminded me of the important things in life.  Never take your life, your family, friends, work, and passions for granted.  Do things and find success for the right reasons, not simply to be successful.  Happiness in life is found in the journey, not in reaching the goal of being successful in and of itself.  Goals come and go.  Once you've reached yours, what is left?  Take each day at a time, and make sure you're really living.  Help others, not just yourself.  In helping others, you might actually find that you are helping yourself. This isn't me going on a rant because I feel like it.  These are all things that I learned from Hilary Neiman's story.  Read it, and you can learn these things too.  Put aside everything you think you know about the author.  She tells the truth about what happened, how she dealt with it, and how she plans to deal with the rest of her life.  Despite what started it all, it is an amazing book.  Keep an open mind, and read it to see for yourself.	2014-05-31

Hilary Neiman shares a very personal account of her life as a young attorney who is quickly caught up in the unmanageable web of demands from her new practice, desperate clients, the legal system, and unscrupulous opportunists which led to her own prosecution and incarceration. As a new law school graduate, Neiman sought to skip the traditional years of mentorship that comes from working for someone else and instead decided to \\"go it alone\\" into the specialized world of surrogacy law. Neiman's high-demand specialty attracted the honest but desperate who were looking to surrogacy as their only hope for a family. In her overwhelm of pressure to keep up with her client base, more attention was focused on \\"how can I take on new clients\\" rather than evaluating \\"should I take on new clients\\". This ultimately led to involvement with clients who posed as legitimate surrogates but instead were convicted of wire fraud. While unintended, Neiman's entanglement crossed the line from a moral issue to a legal one.<br /><br />In her book, Neiman shares her accounts of what led her to the decisions she made and the experience involved in her incarceration. She doesn't spend time justifying her actions, but instead describes the journey that led to her decisions, actions and consequences. From her privileged upbringing through private school, to her graduation and founding of her law firm, to the decisions that ultimately led her to prison, and the experience of incarceration, Neiman writes her story to share with others so they may learn from her mistakes and avoid the errors and resulting consequences. This is a story of blindness and naivety to the world of law and a compassionate heed to others that good intentions are simply not enough. Both the spirit AND the letter of the law must be ensured. This proves to be a sound warning to others as they engage in the ethical dilemmas of today's complex business world.	2014-05-26

An eye-opening autobiography that is not for the faint of heart!<br /><br />Some of the reviews posted on here I felt are pretty harsh. Instead of turning me away from checking out this book, they actually captured my attention to see what all of the hype was about. The fact of the matter is that while no illegal action should not be praised, as is the case with Hilary Neiman, some people do deserve a second chance if they truly want to turn their life around. In the case of Hilary Neiman I felt that the book was written not as a ‚Äúpoor me‚Äù type style but rather as journey into the heart of change and challenges faced with starting over.<br /><br />I thought that it was well written and sincere with eye-opening information on a women's division of a federal penitentiary, which I know cannot be an ideal place for anyone to be in. I can say that the nature of her crime could not have been that severe if she only did time in a camp rather then in an actual prison. Ultimately she pleads guilty to Wire Fraud, which is quite the stretch from baby selling. Her auto-biography I think sheds light into a different world then we are all used to living in. If anything it teaches us all that even though you fall down you can still get back up if you truly are looking to make a change in your life.<br /><br />5 Stars and truly hope that she continues to make strides in making a change for the better.	2014-05-22

I find it hard to believe that those who wrote negative reviews here even read this book! It hardly seems appropriate to judge someone because of a &#34;crime&#34; they admittedly committed without hearing their side of the story. And that is what Things Fall Apart does - tell the author's side of the story. She doesn't paint herself as perfect (though her early life was pretty much so). She admits that she made some terrible decisions and mistakes - not the least of which was speaking to the FBI and turning everything over to them without any legal representation, though she, herself, was an attorney. I found the book fascinating reading. I had never heard of her case, though apparently it was part of the national news a few years back. So I went in with an open mind. One benefit of the author's story is such an insightful view of the judicial system and the prison scene. I felt I was living right along with the author. She makes no excuses for her behavior, though I personally gave her the benefit of the doubt about many of her actions. She writes about this difficult situation with great humor. It is a tragedy that apparently all she ever wanted to do was help children find loving homes, and though she may have done that many times, it literally did all &#34;fall apart&#34;, leaving her in a very different place than the life she once imagined.	2014-05-13

One editorial was so blatant that it even &#34;reviewed&#34; that &#34;I won't buy or read this...&#34;  These opinions obviously are not book reviews as they have not read the book.  They should not judge if they have not read the whole story.<br />If you read the book you would appreciate that the author does not portray herself as a victim and bares her soul to the people who may have been influenced by her decisions.  It is a sensitive story about learning valuable insights, looking for inspiration, and moving forward with a dream.  The author's recollection of federal prison is not all the comic situations as  portrayed in &#34;Orange is the New Black&#34;.  Her insight into religion and eastern philosophy is truly inspiring to anyone who feels they are in the depths of despair.  The author tells her story beautifully and with great insight into what went wrong and also how to move forward when &#34;Things Fall Apart&#34;.	2014-05-12

So I did.<br /><br />It was OK I guess and I see the &#34;Greek tragedy&#34; in it that ismentioned in some of the critiques of the book. But overall...I just didn't get it.<br /><br />Okowono was not a sympathetic character at all and seemed like a dumb, brute. There was no understanding or growth in him as a character and in the end...he ended. So again, no growth. The white men were typically written and maybe that was the point. But again, the whole thing read like a cliche. The only character I liked was Nwoye and he just disappeared.<br /><br />If the author was trying to get me to see the horror of one culture invading another, I didn't see it. There wasn't a lot of beauty in the indigenous culture so no real horror when it was intruded upon.<br /><br />The only good thing about this book was it was short and easy to read. So even though it was on the list, it was a speed bump on the list. I read it in four days and found myself thinking I need to finish this silly thing.<br /><br />Sorry I missed it but life goes on and literature goes on too.	2014-04-26

After reading this I had noticed its especially related to Joseph Conrad's ‚ÄúHeart Of Darkness‚Äù in an inverse  race scenario, from the white man's perspective. Achebe does a phenomenal job of getting every aspect of the African American tribe culture to the reader and whats its like to live and move up the social totem pole in the village. The first time around as a reader I despised Okonkwo because of his arrogance and cockiness, but the second time around I got to view him from another point of view. I realized the second time around how brilliant of a character he truly is, he's the perfect example of an anti-hero, although he's hardworking and strong at the same time he's deeply afraid of losing his social status which in result ends up being the cause of death.In a sense this book almost reminded me of a greek play but African American of course, Okonkwo being the Greek hero and slowly as his character developed you got the sense of dramatic irony because you knew his obsession with his reputation and physical status would be the death of him.	2014-03-24

Our protagonist, Okonkwe, thrives there but also comes into conflict with traditional values and customs. In the last third of the story, the village and wider community are destabilized by the arrival of Anglican missionaries and British colonial government. This sets up a clash between traditions and modernity, in which divisions within tribal society, and within the family, play important roles.<br /><br />Achebe tells his story beautifully, in a simple but powerful style. The story is richly evocative of pre-colonial society but its core themes are timeless.  Strongly recommended.	2014-03-04

And is acclaimed world-wide as the first novel to portray the African take-over by the British from an African's point of view.  Achebe clearly shows the break-up of the Igbo culture in Nigeria (which was actually occurring all over Africa at that time, around 1900) by the British missionaries at first, and later, by British governors, who all just came in, assumed these people had no civilization, and proceeded to destroy it, unwittingly perhaps, but cruel all the same.<br /><br />Achebe is careful to describe so much of the Igbo culture, from weddings, to trials, to religious beliefs and practices, to home life, to feasts and dances, to government.  In other words, to realize what a complex culture they actually did have, and what they were about to lose.  We come to know these people, and care for them, yes even Okonkwo, whose tragedy is both in his own character and in outside forces.  And who has been compared to Agamemnon or Orestes.<br /><br />This book is famous the world over, taught in universities, translated into many languages, and even has Cliff Notes.  It has two sequels, \\"No Longer at Ease\\" and \\"A Man of the People\\".  All three are very short reads, packed with powerful images and meaningful characters.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that while in the Igbo culture twins were taken to the Dark Forest and left to die, to the northwest, in the Yoruba culture, not very far away, twins were so revered that when one died, a sculpture was made to keep the dead one in the home.  Both cultures had a very high incidence of twins, yet reacted so differently.  Odd.	2014-01-28

In this very short book, the author raises many questions that have been raised but unanswered in the history of mankind--the ownership and the rights of rules and orders in communities that may be immensely different in the ways of execution, and yet universal in the justification of their own interpretation of good and evil, right and wrong, just and unjust in the name of tradition, religion, and culture etc.  The rulers and ruled, the ones with power and without, or whether you are born with the \\"right\\" genital or the \\"wrong\\" kind, determines whether your life will matter at all, or you will live and die just as collateral to a bigger cause.

Achebe lays out a story that is engaging enough, but I walked away wondering what it was all about.<br /><br />Is there a point to this sad story?  This fall from grace did not have a feel good ending and left me feeling terrible about the world in general.  Maybe because I see myself as part of the Christian group that basically tore apart Okonkwo world and I have too much guilt built up in my life.<br /><br />I wonder if I read this book in my youth without guilt, which is why I had a nice memory of this book.<br />Anyway, a beautifully written book that will only take you a couple of hours to plow through.

Its scope was so broad that it was jokingly labled the &#34;Plato to NATO&#34; course.  The curriculum was set by the university, but I was able to choose the books I wanted to teach from.  For the most part I used textbooks, but I could find no textbook that was anywhere near as effective as this novel, Things Fall Apart, in making the reality of colonialism in Africa comprehensible.  Relatively few works of literature really merit the much-overused adjective &#34;great,&#34; but this one certainly does.  A few years ago the New York City Public Library put on display what it called the 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written.  Alongside the Bible and the Koran, and works by Isaac Newton and Shakespeare, was Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe‚Äîa richly deserved honor.  I want to also recommend a sequel to Things Fall Apart that Achebe wrote entitled No Longer At Ease.  The sequel does a brilliant job of depicting the social reality of post-World War II neocolonialism, and does so as powerfully as its predecessor had depicted the earlier form of colonialism.	2013-12-02

While the work describes an Africa that no longer exists, it is still worth reading. The story centers around Okonkwo, a strong man from an Ibo village in Nigeria. The book is divided into two parts. Part one traces the rise of Okonkwo, from a father who was a failure to success in his community. He is hard working and diligent, but with fixed ideas. His success gives him three wives and a number of children, as well as a prominent place in the community. But a tragic incident forces him to leave the village and return to that of his mother for a period of seven years. Part two centers on his life in this village and introduces the entry of white missionaries to the area. Part three provides the climax between the traditional culture and values that Okonkwo represents and the introduction of Christianity and modernity.  The outcome is never in doubt and the novel ends tragically.<br /><br />The book also provides information and insight into the values and culture of these people. While we may disagree with many of their practices we can also sympathize with their desire to maintain their way of life. This book will provoke you to think about such issues as the price of success and the clash of cultures. It is well worth reading and thinking about.<br /><br />I give it four stars instead of five because the incident that forces Okonkwo from his village is introduces in a matter-of-fact manner and seems incidental rather than being built up to a climax. Moreover it is hard to understand why the natives seem to have easy access to guns, given their relative isolation from outside influences.	2013-11-01

I was introduced to this book in my Great Books discussion group. It has been one of my favorite books ever since.  The books I recently ordered were to be gifts for my friends.  The author unfortunately has recently died.  He was born in Africa, but he presents a picture of events in Africa when the white culture and the black cultures clash in a clear unprejudiced way. The book made me feel almost like I had lived the experience myself. I had a much warmer feeling for those living these events than I had before reading this book.  I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding the people involved in this period in history.	2013-10-16

The book focuses on Okonkwo, a well-regarded warrior and leader in Unuofia, a village in the lower Niger valley. Okonkwo is a hard man who has made his way in the clan and the world through hard work. He leads his house with a heavy and unyielding hand, and is driven by the desire to be recognized and titled in his clan. He especially values the traditions of his fathers and their gods.<br /><br />The people of Umuofia believe in a god above the gods who made the world, and who also made gods to interact with the people of the world. These gods are the gods of the land and sky. Umuofia has an oracle who is said to interact with one of these gods, and her word is highly valued. As part of their belief, twins are always discarded in the woods when they are born, and an entire class of people are considered outcasts because they are \\"set apart\\" to the gods.<br /><br />The book opens with the murder of a woman of Umuofia by some men from a neighboring village. The men of Umuoafia gather for war and send an emisary to the neighboring village, and to avoid war, the village agrees to send a virgin and a young man as the price for the lost life. The girl is given to the man whose wife had been murdered. The boy was given to Okonkwo to keep in his house until his fate was decided. After three years, the clan decided to have the boy killed, even though he had become like a son to Okonkwo. And despite advice to the contrary, Okonkwo had a hand in his death.<br /><br />Then one day, while celebrating a burial feast in the town square, Okonkwo inadvertantly killed a man when his gun exploded. As punishment for this offense against the clan and the gods, Okonkwo was banished from the clan for seven years, and he went off to the home of his mother. While there, he began to hear news of white men who were appearing the area. In one town, a white man was killed and then many white men came in and wiped out the village. And now white men had come to his mothers home and also to Umuofia.<br /><br />When Okonkwo returned to Umuofia, he found that the missionaries had started a church and a school, and had also set up a District Comissioner's office and a trading post. They were bringing not only religion but also the sovereignty of the queen of England to this part of Africa. And clashes were inevitable. We see what happens when cultures collide.<br /><br />Achebe has written a vivid account of African life, and a penetrating critique of a colonial attitude toward cultures. The influence of the Western culture truly causes the fabric of Umuofia to begin to fall apart. From one perspective, that can of course be viewed as a necessary influence of the grace and truth of the gospel, a putting off of the old wineskins for new in order to hold new wine. But Achebe also calls into question the enculturation that often comes with the message. Too often we attach our own cultural norms to the gospel message, when the relationship should be much more nuanced. And Achebe's book artfully brings this idea to the fore. I highly recommed it. It is a penetrating book that helps those of us in the dominant Western culture to see things from a different perspective, and to wrestle from the inside with issues that must be confronted in our multicultural world.n was killed and then many white men came in and wiped out the village.

US	23948805	R1OOSGB15K1D8U	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Decent	I had to read this book for a college class last semester.  I was ahead of the class, so when I got to it I wasn't really pertaining to any schedule or listening to my professor's interpretation of it (which can kill a book for some people).  With that in mind, I'd say this was decent.  Okonkwo is a flat character, which some people have a problem with, but I think his character was meant to be an example of an extreme.  Okonkwo isn't a person; he's a personification of certain ideals, meaning that he lacks subtlety.  He is not the hero of the novel, though he is the protagonist.  His morals are being critiqued, I think, and that's really where the conflict comes from: the reader disagreeing with Okonkwo's decisions and understanding why they aren't right.  The novel is, therefore, not promoting violence and sexism, and I feel sorry for the people who are too shallow to realize that not every author stands beside his or her protagonist.<br /><br />That said, the story lacks an overarching conflict to help carry the reader through the story.  There is, essentially, no plot until the last fifty pages, so you'll have to, if you can, content yourself with the smaller moments that make up Okonkwo's life and try to appreciate the cultural insight Achebe is trying to give.  I had a hard time doing that, at least in some places, and I found myself plowing through the book instead of actually reading it.<br /><br />Achebe's prose is also hit or miss.  His style is incredibly straight forward and typically doesn't bother describing emotions.  This allows the reader to interpret the scenes based on physical descriptions, but it also leaves the narrative feeling very bare.  There is such a thing as being too direct when it comes to fiction writing.<br /><br />I think what many people aren't liking about this is that, really, it's an intellectual book.  It's meant for analyzing.  That shouldn't really scare you away; I'm not talking about the high school English teacher kind ofanalyzing where you discuss, at length, the meaning of Holden Caufield's left toenail, but the kind of analysis where you have to stop every now and then and chew on what's being written, the kind of analysis where you're taking what's written and applying it to the knowledge you have and you ask yourself, \\"Is this right, what's being said?\\"  It's about asking moral questions, and while it's not perfect at doing that, I do think it achieves its goal, just not in an entertaining way.	2013-08-18

US	45622384	R2E54PM1UCP1LX	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	A Novel of Tragic Fault and Tragic Fate	Mr. Achebe is a giant of world literature, in this case presenting a universal theme in his native African setting.  The hero is a great man in his community, even though he is born to a father who is an impractical musician and is viewed in the community as being weak.  Enter the 'tragic flaw' familiar to students of Greek literature from the classical period.  The son feels driven to be everything the father wasn't (and none of what he was.)  As in the Greek tradition, no good ever comes from extremism applied over the long run.  We learn of our protagonist's early successes and they are presented in what I, an outsider, believe to be an authentic African cultural context.  Like audiences at the performance/recitation of a Greek tragedy, we read on in horror and with sympathy as a human being is broken by an inexorable chain of events.  Through the words of an African writer we explore issues such as what is means to be a son, to be a husband, to be a father...to be a member of a community...and to be a member of a wider 'humanity.'<br /><br />The story is told 'cleanly' and simply, in a way like the stories of John Steinbeck or of Hemmingway.  The 'Truth' of the author's intent stands out.  This book is fine literature!	2013-07-23

The book describes what day-to-day life is like in this village dominated by yam farming, with strict religious beliefs and tradition.  Okonkwo is rigid in his life and follows closely the rules of his tribe, even when those rules lead to his being exiled for years.  He seems to be one of the few who senses danger when missionaries move in, build a church, and steamroll over the village's traditions.<br /><br />I really liked reading about how this tribe functioned, and it was nice to read about it from an insider's perspective, which made all of the differences from my own culture and ways of understanding the world seem more logical.  I appreciated that this story didn't talk down to its audience or over-explain what was going on.  I would have liked a bit more closure at the end, though, and more insight into what Okonkwo and the others in his tribe were thinking.	2013-07-14

I can't and won't speak for that high praise.  However, having read the first in the series, \\"Things Fall Apart\\", I can state that I believe Mr. Achebe HAS succeeded in illustrating how times (with a big push from the colonial powers) altered tribal living in at least one part of Africa.<br /><br />Articles and books have been written analyzing this work; I won't presume to add my analysis on top of those scholarly works.  I WILL state that I was impressed by Mr. Achebe's narration; how he described events within and around the community without making it sound like he was explaining them to an outsider.  He would casually mention something that OF COURSE we would all know about, like \\"The Royal Python\\".  Then, in the same breath, describe it and its significance in such a way that it felt as though it was just a continuation of the story rather than a sidebar explanation for us poor outsiders.<br /><br />As someone who normally reads mysteries and thrillers, I can't say that Mr. Achebe grabbed me by the throat (or otherwise) and refused to let go.  HOWEVER, he did succeed in holding my interest; something that many other highly praised works of literature fail to do.  We all know of - and sometimes ourselves feel like - a man like Okonkwo, comfortable in the knowledge of how things were and how they still are, until facing the truth that those ways are changing, perhaps forever.  It is because of that commonality that this novel can touch anyone, no matter their country or circumstances.<br /><br />5 stars, Mr. Achebe.  I only wish I'd gotten to this a few months earlier, so that you could have celebrated this rating with us before your passing.	2013-07-04

The novel lovingly reconstructs the mental and spiritual world of the Ibo people at the end of the 19th century, when Britain was extending its colonial control over the Niger river delta.  Africans are put squarely at the center of the story, and not treated as exotic background scenery for white adventurers (the role played by Africans in so many books like \\"Heart of Darkness\\" or movies like \\"Blood Diamonds\\").  Thankfully, the book is devoid of sentimentality or political correctness:  Ibo culture comes across as profound in its own terms, but also warped by violence, patriarchy, and superstition.  Christianity comes across as an improvement, but also as a source of new injustice of its own.  (In one scene an Ibo debates theology with a Christian missionary.  It's hard to tell which culture is more deluded.)  That said, I'm not sure whether \\"Things Fall Apart\\" fully succeeds as a novel.  Much of it struck me as cultural anthropology rather than literature.	2013-06-22

In  other  words ,  the  reader  is  motivated  by  an  urge  to  get  to  know  the  connection  between  the  title  of  the  book  and  the  story  that  the  author  is  telling  in  the  book .  The  way  the  story  is  presented  causes  a  step-by-step  increase  in  the  urge  as  one  continues  reading  the  book  and  by  the  end  of  it ,  the  reader  sees  how  the  author  has  perfectly  tied  the  title  of  the  book  to  the  story .<br /><br />The  story  is  a  narration  of  the  day-to-day's  life  of  the  people  of  Umuofia  and  the  eight  neighboring  villages .  The  main  characters  in  the  story  are  Okonkwo  and  the  people  of  the  village  of  Umuofia,  and  then  the  white  man .  Achebe  introduces  these  characters  in  the  story ,  each  one  at  an  appropriate  time .  He  starts  with  Okonkwo  whom  he  says  is  well  known  throughout  the  nine  villages  and  that  Okonkwo's  fame  rests  on  his  solid  personal  achievement .<br /><br />From  the  story ,  we  learn  that  the  people  of  Umuofia  and  the  surrounding  eight  villages  are  a  people  who  have  a  deep-rooted  culture  with  strict  rules  which  are  derived  from  the  departed  spirits  of  their  ancestors .  The  white  man's  modern  system  of  government  and  his  modern  way  of  worship  are  not  known  to  these  people ,  and  when  he  tries  to  introduce  the  new  systems  to  them ,  the  people  bitterly  resent  them .<br /><br />One  reading  this  story  soon  finds  out  that  the  author  has  arranged  his  thoughts  in  a  logical  order  and  this  provides  a  smooth  transition  from  one  paragraph  or  character  to  the  next  one .  In  other  words ,  when  reading  the  book ,  one  can  correctly  guess  or  anticipate  what  is  to  follow  next .<br /><br />In  terms  of  language  and  expression ,  the  author  has  insured  that  he  communicates  at  a  level  that  most  people  who  speak  the  English  language  will  comfortably  follow  the  story.  He  has  deliberately  avoided  the  use  of  difficult  English  vocabularies  and  expressions  in  this  book,  and  in  that  way ,  he  has  widened  the  scope  of  his  prospective  readers  or  audience .<br /><br />The  last  paragraph  of  p183  of  the  book  says  \\"Okonkwo  deeply  grieved .  And  it  was  not  just  a  personal  grief .  He  mourned  for  the  clan ,  which  he  saw  breaking  up  and  falling  apart ,  and  he  mourned  for  the  warlike  men  of  Umuofia ,  who  had  so  unaccountably  become  soft  like  women,\\" (Achebe,  Sep. 1994 ) ,  and  in  the  last  paragraph  of  p176  of  the  same  book ,  Obierika  is  telling  Okonkwo ,  \\"The  white  man  is  very  clever.  He  came  quietly  and  peaceably  with  his  religion .  We  were  amused  at  his  foolishness  and  allowed  him  to  stay .  Now  he  has  won  our  brothers ,  and  our  clan  can  no  longer  act  like  one .  He  has  put  a  knife  on  the  things  that  held  us  together  and  we  have  fallen  apart\\"( Achebe,  Sep. 1994 ).<br /><br />The  above  two  citations  together  give  the  book  its  title  \\"Things  Fall  Apart.\\"<br /><br />In  conclusion ,  the  author  did  a  great  job .  Many  schools  around  the  world  have  chosen and  included  this  book  in  the  set  of  their  text  books  for  their  Literature  in  English  course .<br /><br />I recommend this book without any reservation to whoever wants to buy it.	2013-06-17

I now have a better understanding of African tribal life (of the period). People looked after one another. There were consequences. If you did something bad, you were banished from the community. There were rituals and practices that seem barbaric to Europeans (for example, the practice of leaving twins in the forest to die). However, for Europeans to proclaim they are more civilized and less violent is ridiculous. The atrocities the European colonialists subjected the Africans to were far worse than anything that African tribes did to one another. Achebe's book does a great job to show how each tribe considers themselves very different from another, which contradicts any supposition that Africans are all alike. This argument is often used in terms of the slave trade. &#34;But they sold their own people into slavery.&#34; Africans didn't sell their own people into slavery; tribes sold people from other tribes into slavery -- people whom they saw as being totally different from themselves. Perhaps the most lasting element of this book is the conclusion. The main character, who knows he will be imprisoned by the British, commits suicide. The British officer who comes to collect him, only to find him hanging from a tree, is fascinated by the tribal practices surrounding the suicide and wants to write about it. It is the perfect way to sum up how white Europeans did (and still do) belittle the lives of Africans by viewing them as more primitive and somehow lacking in importance, instead of seeing African lives as just as valuable as those of Europeans, if only differentiated by traditions and skin color.	2013-05-22

He prides himself on his cruelty and lack of compassion. He is a \\"great man\\" in the village, primarily because everyone is afraid of him; to my mind, that makes him more a thug than admirable. He is particularly cruel to anyone he has power over, such as his wives and children.<br /><br />While he is badly drawn, without any sympathetic aspects, none of the other characters are drawn at all. They are cardboard cut-outs. I suppose one can argue that that's how our protag sees them... but there's not even a hint around the edges that he is an unreliable narrator. In fact, I think we're supposed to identify and sympathize with him, appalling though he is!<br /><br />There's a bit of a plot stuck onto the end, and a brief bit at the beginning (our protag's father was a wastrel, so he naturally chose to become a thug)... and nothing for most of the book.  It randomly flits here and there. In its favor- and why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1- some of the traditional stories included briefly, and accounts of the cycle of the year, the food, the gods, and other cultural aspects were intriguing... but they did not make up a plot. I also wish some of them had been handled in a more cohesive way, rather than a tidbit here and another there.<br /><br />What really amazes me, looking back, is how the author accepted the \\"great men\\" and their casual and consistent brutality for much of the book... and then, when more powerful (European) forces came in and made THEM knuckle under, well, THAT was tragic. Now: I do not favor imperialism in any way. I do not think it worked to the benefit of the women and children and lower-ranking men who the \\"great men\\" were regularly abusing; they undoubtedly had it even worse when another layer of oppressor was added. But the \\"great men\\"? SO tragic when someone beats THEM up, because THEY are supposed to be the ones doing the beating! My sympathy for this perspective is lacking.<br /><br />In short, while there's some interesting content here, it's not a novel in the way such is usually described, and it requires spending way too much time with a loathsome protag that nonetheless the author seems to venerate.HEY are supposed to be the ones doing the beating!

The language, style, and syntax are definitely not American/European.  That did take me just a bit to get used to.  But as it reads on page 7:  \\"The art of conversation is regarded very highly, and proverbs are the palm-oil with which words are eaten.\\"  Throughout the book, proverbs, metaphors, and descriptive language paint the picture of life in the African Ibo culture.  In places the language of the book is biblical feeling.<br /><br />I will admit the very foreign names of the characters were sometimes difficult to keep straight, but the personalities of those individuals came through for me.  The main character, Okonkwo, is a flawed character.  He might not be admirable, but he was definitely believable.  The interaction of the characters is not what we are used to, but isn't that the point of good literature--allowing us to become someone so totally different than ourselves.<br /><br />The first part of the book sets the stage for what happens in the rest.  The reader is introduced to Ibo lifestyle and thinking.  The accidental killing of another man turns the story sharply into a new direction.  Now we see the Ibo culture directly up against western civilization.  But it didn't turn the book into a good culture/bad culture clash.  It simply portrayed the fear of change from the familiar to a life of total contradiction from what was long believed to be true.  And how many today are struggling with that same fear of the future which is turning over what we thought were truths?  This is more than just an outward struggle between the Ibo culture and the white Christian missionaries.  It is the struggle of one man's life as the things fall apart around him.<br /><br />I especially appreciated the author's portrayal of the missionary Mr. Brown who spent hours talking with the Ibo.  \\"Neither of them succeeded in converting the other but they learned more about their different beliefs.\\"  Wonder what our world would be like if that was the norm rather than the position taken by his successor, Mr. Smith.<br /><br />The ending of this is almost anticlimatic, but so well drawn.

It begins by developing the main character's persona by way of explaining the type of man his father was and how in backlash his son has grown to be just the opposite. Most of his fears and bad behavior are a reaction against becoming the kind of man his father was. We are then treated to plot progression- daily life over time in their village including interactions with other tribes and tribal customs including a gruesome murder. Later in the story the plot focus shifts to the interaction between the tribe and christian missionaries that have come to convert the tribe.<br /><br />I suppose the story was moderately interesting but I never connected with any of the characters and so for me, the novel failed. I stood on the outside of the author's world b/c he never successfully drew me in to identify or sympathize with any of his characters. The main character was too one-sided and awful to establish rapport with readers and no other characters were developed sufficiently to prompt a connection.	2013-03-27

When I married my husband (a native of Lagos, Nigeria), amongst his books and papers was a torn, yellowed, dog-earred copy of \\"When Things Fall Apart\\". I asked him what it was about, he told me and I shrugged; I then shoved the book in a box along with other things I figured we wouldn't need or would trash eventually.  But as time passed, I kept hearing about Chinua Achebe and his writings including \\"When Things Fall Apart\\". I also saw that it was required reading in one of the high schools our kids might attend. I went to the garage, looked in that box; and found the book I had previously dismissed as not important. I read the book, and was captiviated with the story of Okonkwo and his struggles between traditionalism and the threat of colonialism to his Ibo culture.  Although I don't agree with the choices he made, I enjoyed the book. \\"When Things Fall Apart\\" is one of those books that helps you learn, think, and understand about other people and their history. It should be required reading for all high school students---and up front and center in every library or book shelf!  Mr. Achebe's other books \\"No Longer at Ease\\" and Arrow of God\\" are for good reading too!	2013-03-27

I finally read it, and I understand now why I was told repeatedly to do so. The book is written in a manner that is literary, yet also mimics the cadence and style of the oral tradition method of storytelling that would have been native to the Ibo people of Nigeria of whom the novel is about. It takes the reader a while to get use to the Ibo names, terms, and colloquialisms and for that reason a short glossary of Ibo terms is included in the back of the text. It is useful, however you can figure out what most of the Ibo words mean from context.<br />The protagonist of \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is Okonkwo, a dislikable, insecure, mean man. He comes across to the surface reader as the archetypal ignorant male head of the house. That is a lazy read, as Chinua Achebe has written a novel that goes deep below the surface, and although the novel and many of the customs are very dated and specific to the Ibo people of the 1890s, the problems that plague the characters (but not many of the circumstances) are universal and always will be. Don't read this novel with the goal of feeling culturally superior. Read it and accept it on its own terms and you will get so much more out of it.<br />There are many characters in the text, and it is to Mr. Achebe's credit that they all come across as very real, and his ability to give a good characterization in just a few sentences is astounding at times. One of my favorite characters is Uchendu, the uncle of Okonkwo. Although he does not appear until halfway through the novel and does not speak much, when he does speak pay attention. Some of the novel's best moments are his and much of the thematic wisdom of the text comes from his mouth.<br />This novel is a surprisingly quick read, you are sucked in quite seductively and don't realize it until it is too late. I hesitate to say what \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is about, but I will say that I think the novel does deal with a man who is uncomfortable in the time in which he lives. Okonkwo is a man who should have been born 100 year earlier. He is a strong man, in the traditional sense, but weak in the ways that matter. He is a man living down his father (who isn't) and an insecure individual who masks his fears by abuse and anger. The novel's ending is a chilling warning about where that path leads.<br />I regret that I have not read this wonderful novel sooner.

The everyday life, customs, and traditions of an Ibo village in Nigeria are recorded as the plight of one warrior in particular is told in tragic fashion. Driven by a fear of succumbing to the laziness and worthlessness of his father, the protagonist strives for notoriety, but mostly endures misfortunes and his world inevitably begins to unravel. The title is at first prescient, then apt, as his family, status in the tribe, and way of life all crumble to pieces. On a larger scale, the encroaching of British Colonialism begins to fracture this part of the world in the name of progress and civilization. Achebe manages to capture both the sweeping overtones and the simple human elements of his tale with a clarity of precision and subtlety that is rare.	2013-02-20

The novel is effectively split into two halves, the first telling the life story of Okonkwo, the hero, in a traditional rural setting, and the second describing his village and clan's tribulations as the white man appears. The book reads at first quite differently from a novel, more like a loosely connected connection of tales, an epic interspersed with essential family history. Okonkwo, from modest origins, has risen to become a successful farmer, fighter, and a peer of his clan. His preoccupations are woven into village custom, traditional law, and religion. His story is one of everyday lore mixed in with the requisite homage to the supernatural. Then, in the novel's second part, the colonist arrives: missionary, policeman, judge. Okonkwo's world is irredeemable upset as its structures, its economy, and its very beliefs fall to the blows of superior force. Everything begins to fall apart. And the story, told from the point of view of the Africans, remains forever poignant, the irruption of unforgiving modernity among its unsuspecting victims forever incomprehensible. Eminently accessible, this is a compelling, wrenching read.	2013-02-13

The last book I read set in Africa was Ben Okri's The Famished Road, published 35 years after this Achebe classic, and I liked the Okri novel better. Not to say I didn't enjoy Things Fall Apart because I did, but I thought Okri's story was more complete and I preferred his writing of mysticism over Achebe's.<br /><br />To me, the central theme in Things Fall Apart is the question of whether our lives are controlled by our dedication to a higher power of if we have free will. Achebe mentions a deity multiple times who, to paraphrase, \\"strikes down a man when he loves himself most.\\" Is this the cause of protagonist Okonkwo's troubles, or are his own actions to blame?<br /><br />The introduction of Christianity to Okonkwo's village and surrounding villages makes for an interesting juxtaposition. Achebe highlights illogical and self-contradicting practices within Christianity and also within the polytheistic religion of the native Africans. While it became clear by the book's end which religion would hold power over the other, I didn't discern any real resolution, and I assume Achebe did not intend to present one.<br /><br />The two reasons I'm not giving this book 5 stars are:<br /><br />1) I didn't think Ikemefuma's role in the story went deep enough; I expected his character, alive or dead, to have some involvement throughout the narrative.<br /><br />2) The end came too suddenly for me.<br /><br />The above having been stated, I really enjoyed reading this novel, very thought provoking and an easy read.	2013-01-23

Each chapter gives insight into tribal cultural life through the religion, folkways, and ethic of the collection of tribes represented. Achebe  masterfully chronicles the cultural clashes and misunderstandings between the British and the Igo people, and writes of a life that was giving way to the westernization of missionary work and industrialization.  The book shows strengths and weaknesses in both cultures, yet leaves one appreciating what the Igo people had to offer.<br /><br />Okonkwo's  pain-filled existence and tragic conclusion is caused by both his choler and a way of life that cannot be sustained.  The loss of personal meaning that came through social cohesion, tribal values, tradition and acceptance of hierarchy is seen through  communal and personal misfortune.  As well, ideas about what is \\"primitive\\" and \\"advanced\\" are reconsidered as Achebe artfully narrates a tribal strength and wisdom that could not sustain itself in the face of western advance and modification.  Meaningful is the way Achebe concludes the book anticlimactically, yet in a way that shows the advance of the West to the detriment of much of what African tribes had to offer.<br /><br />I look forward to reading Chinua Achebe's other works that continue the saga of Africa in the modern age.	2012-12-23

Things Fall Apart is the story of an African man named Okonkwo. He is an important man in his tribe and lives the way he understands a man's life is meant to be lived. To compensate for the weaknesses of his father his main purpose is to demonstrate strength. In order to achieve a greater degree of success he figures he must be more ambitious, aggressive, and domineering. And this is what he pulls off. So long as his place is firmly established in a world that is familiar to him, one in which he understands the rules and what it takes to excel, all is well. But after Christian missionaries arrive in the village we learn that this is not the story of a man, but rather, the chronicle of a way of life that is destined to fall. Okonkwo's gods fail to measure up against the Christian God mainly because ancient ways are always overwhelmed by the march of modernity. The gun is mightier than the machete, science outmatches superstition, and what on the surface appears to be a more compassionate way of life triumphs over barbarism because biblical cruelty is more cleverly disguised. A fascinating novel indeed.	2012-10-10

Chinua Achebe derives the title to his magnum opus from a verse from W. B. Yeats' [[ASIN:B0041D8XRE The Second Coming - W. B. Yeats]]. An apt title indeed, for a novel whose central theme is what happened in Africa, from the African's perspective, when the white man (and yes, the gender is specific) showed up. The book was first published in the late `50's, shortly after Nigeria, where this novel is set, became independent. It concerns the Ibo (Igbo) region of southeastern Nigeria. This region sought its own independence as Biafra, in 1967, and Achebe became a spokesperson for their cause.  There are now more than 8 million copies in print, and Achebe is often referred to as the father of modern African literature. With the novel's widespread acceptance, it has become a \\"school assignment\\" book, (it even has its own \\"Cliffs Notes\\"!) and hence, the posting of numerous 1-star reviews. Some of the1-star reviews are thoughtful however, challenging the author for using the work of a white Irishman for his title, and did the slaughter of World War I really compare with the interactions of white Europeans with Africans? That leads to the true fool's errand of toting up the dead bodies. As for my own reading, I've read several books from the (American) Indian perspective on the coming of the white man, and I have read numerous books on Africa, almost exclusively by whites such as Alan Paton, Nadine Gordimer, Doris Lessing, Albert Camus, Jules Roy, Alistair Horne, and even Joseph Conrad, who Achebe has fiercely criticized. Certainly a read from an African perspective, perhaps the most famous one, has been LONG overdue.<br /><br />I liked Achebe's prose style. Straightforward, and unsentimental. He certainly does not depict a glorious Eden before the arrival of the white man. And almost three-fourths of the novel is set in the period before his arrival. The protagonist is Okonkwo, the son of an indolent father, Unoka. The son's upward social mobility commences with his wrestling victory over Amalinze the Cat. Okonkwo has the internal motivation to rise above his father's \\"station in life.\\" There is the \\"sociological aspect\\" to the novel. I kept thinking of a 600 page treatise, with leaden prose, and tables, describing the rituals of birth, marriage and death, along with the systems for religious observation, the administration of justice, and the economics of village life.  What are the family customs and beliefs that are held important? Achebe covers all of this, deftly, in novelistic vignettes. In addition, Achebe's characters display the universal qualities of the human condition: desire for advancement, greed, envy, sexual relations, pride, disappointment in one's children, and the response to natural disasters, such as too much rain, or too many locust. \\"Chi\\" is apparently the Ibo word for \\"fate,\\" and it is a dominant factor in the characters' lives.<br /><br />The white man first arrives on an \\"iron horse,\\" which turns out to be a bicycle. He pays with his life for his temerity, a \\"casus belli,\\" which quickly leads to an unequal exchange of life. But it is religion, and not armies, that provide the essential wedge for \\"things falling apart.\\" I thought Achebe did a brilliant job in describing how it so often happens. In his novel, the white missionary is rather inoffensive and bumbling. But oh so effective in appealing to the individuals at the lower rungs of Ibo society... basically giving them a \\"second chance\\" in life. The Christian religion gathers adherents, and effectively defeats the \\"gods\\" of the native religion. Achebe also realistically depicts the (in)famous \\"divide and rule\\" tactics of the colonial British. When two quite different social structures compete, all too often, at least for a period, it is the side with the larger warships that seems to win.<br /><br />Achebe's work is a classic, and despite Mark Twain's quip, one that should be read, by anyone seeking to truly understand why things are the way they are, particularly in Africa. Could it be made into a temporary home?  5-stars.ticularly in Africa. Could it be made into a temporary home?  5-stars.	2012-08-20

I've spent the last two days reading Chinua Achebe's book, \\"Things Fall Apart.\\" I had to read the book for a university course about five years ago and paid it little attention at the time. I am better off for rereading it and giving its due attention the second time around. The book is a masterpiece of clear writing style and didactic narrative.<br /><br />\\"Things Fall Apart,\\" is a page-turning story of Okonkwo, a Nigerian man, and his struggle to preserve tribal traditions and personal convictions in the face of the white man, Christianity, and his own rash actions. Here is a piece of literature that reads like Vera Britton's memoir, \\"Testament of Youth,\\" or Richard Wright's, \\"Black Boy.\\" Achebe's ability to capture human emotion from the reader may be unequaled, and the story is as valid today as it was over 50 years ago.<br /><br />There is a line in the book that encompasses Okonkwo's story, as well of each of our stories perfectly. Having been exiled for seven years to his motherland, Okonkwo finds himself in a sad state (they didn't have prozac) and feeling rather sorry for himself, when his friend launches into one of the great motivational soliloquies in modern literature:<br /><br />\\"For whom is it well, for whom is it well?<br />there is none for whom it is well.\\"<br /><br />Each of us have a story to tell, and each of us thinks his life to be fraught with difficulties and hard times, more so than the next man. Achebe begs us to see our neighbor as ourself - one for whom it is not well. And therein we will find strength, as we realize (I'm quoting \\"Shadowlands\\"), via reading, \\"that we are not alone.\\" I cannot recommend this book too highly; it is magisterial in its delivery. Read it, reread it.	2012-07-14

Written in the mid-twentieth century by a native Nigerian, Things Fall Apart is meant to depict the true culture of late nineteenth century West Africa.  In my opinion, Achebe succeeds in dispelling the myth that Africa was and is a cultureless, savage land full of senseless violence.  By telling the story of Okonkwo, his family, and their community, Achebe shows that though Nigerian culture may be very different from that of Western Europe or North America, it is no less a culture with structure and reason.<br />Chinua Achebe was born the son of a protestant Missionary in Nigeria in 1930.  Though he was educated primarily in English, he was fully immersed in the Ibo culture surrounding him.  Things Fall Apart is a novel he published in 1959 in response to widespread ignorance of African Culture.  The average western European or North American viewed Africa as cultureless and language-less, and Achebe decided that he may be able to change a few opinions.<br />Chinua Achebe's most important tool was language.  Achebe could have written in Ibo, but he chose to publish his novel in English. This was to be sure he reached his target audience, ignorant white men.  However, he chose very deliberately to use some Ibo words; words that cannot be translated precisely into English because of their complex nature.  These words include, among others, \\"nso-ani\\", describing a religious offense and \\"ajbala\\", referring to either a woman or to a man stripped of his titles.  He included a glossary of rough translations in the back of the novel, which I found to be instrumental in my understanding of the novel.<br />Another tool used by the author is emotional attachment to the main character, Okonkwo.  Okonkwo is a man's man with multiple wives living on his compound. From the perspective of a middle-class European, Okonkwo may be considered a savage. However, Achebe is sure to fully immerse his readers in the Ibo culture from the very beginning.  Okonkwo begins his journey as a respected man and I quickly became attached to him through an understanding of his cultural background.  The Ibo culture is patriarchal to the extreme. As a sheltered North American, it could have been a hard concept for me to appreciate, but being captivated by Achebe's writings I could not help but be swept into the Ibo culture right alongside Okonkwo.<br />I would categorize Things Fall Apart as a work of historical fiction.  The novel is very political and not an easy read.  But I felt at its conclusion that it was worth my time.  Things Fall Apart gives perspective that is otherwise lacking in my education thus far.  Anybody remotely interested in civil rights or in unfamiliar cultures would do well to give it a chance.<br />	2012-07-03

It provides an insight into African culture and the clash between this culture and the arrogance of the Europeans/Christians.<br /><br />Another reason I enjoyed the book is that in the first half I thoroughly disliked the protagonist; however, by the end of the book I was completely on his side. Kudos to Mr. Chinua Achebe for being able to string your emotions.<br /><br />P.S: As a person who was raised as a Christian, I am honestly disgusted by the actions of missionaries.

After reading it, I realized it is a masterpiece. Achebe writes the tale of a tribe and carries the reader through their many ceremonies and celebrations. He explains the values of the people through their negotiation for a bride price or the killing of a captive from a competing tribe. We see how the tribe establishes social relationships and how those relationships contribute to survival. Achebe tells the story of Okonkwo, a man of impulse and personal strength, a brave man who fears not acting as a man. This Nigerian Ibo everyman is all too human, making mistakes with his children, with his three wives, with his in-laws, with his relatives, and eventually with the colonial powers that invade the land. Achebe is able to show the religious and spiritual beliefs of the people that are fully integrated into their lives and actions. Their spiritual beliefs are linked to taboo objects, actions, and places. This may seem superstitious but we see how this constantly reminds and reinforces the spiritual beliefs of the people.  The book is full of humor but also personal tragedy. The writing style of Achebe is straightforward, understated and yet subtle. His direct writing style is clear and yet he is able to shade meaning and intention.  I must admit that it is one of the best books I have read this year and I strongly recommend it.	2012-06-07

I'm kidding in my question, but the first 75% of the book reminded me of science fiction: it described a culture so alien in their thought patterns that I had a hard time recognizing it as human.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead:<br /><br />I thought it was instinctive of humans  of all cultures to love their children and bond with them.  So I was surprised and chilled when the main character kills a boy that had lived with his family for 3 years and was his son's playmate.  The killing occurs because an \\"oracle\\" orders it.<br /><br />Similarly the clan abandons all twins at birth to die in the forest.  Seems contrary to human nature to me, but I suppose other cultures have their examples of \\"inhumane\\" behavior predicated on some religious rule.<br /><br />The book is probably hard to read for many because the first 50% of it has no plot, but just seems to be a series of incidents of tribal life. I listened to the audio version and I accidentally listened to disc 3 before disc 2, and didn't even realize it until I went to swap in the next disk.  That gives you some sense of how little \\"story\\" there is in the first half of the book.<br /><br />Some plot creeps in around the 3rd quarter of the book when the main character commits a crime and is sent into exile.<br /><br />The last 25% of the book that describes conflict with Christian Englishmen is the most interesting.  I'm an atheist, but I didn't dislike the missionaries as much I had expected I would, probably because the African tribal customs they were challenging were so repellant.<br /><br />The narrator of the audio version is excellent and really brought out the poetry of the writing.  That probably helped me get through the first half of the book a little more easily.  I have found audio books to be more accessible for some other \\"classics\\" of literature that are a bit dry to read.  Just a suggestion to any high school students (or teachers).	2012-05-23

As I have come to many conclusions, in regards to Things Fall Apart, none stand out in my mind as clearly and strongly as the commentary the novel makes on the colonialism aspect.<br />Things fall apart is a striking tale that follows the journey of one man, determined to maintain the archetype of \\"man\\" and remain a symbol to his people of utmost masculinity.  The issues that arise come from the conflict that has plagued the continent of Africa since it's exploration.  One cannot help but be taken aback at the stark and lush imagery, as well as the poignant symbolism that we find throughout the pages of the novel.<br /><br />It is so truthful to the plight of the African peoples who have found themselves misplaced in their own country, as a result of the worlds \\"white man's burden\\" nonsense.  It almost reads as a textbook, documenting the history of a people, seen through the eyes of one man's experience.<br /><br />I read this for the first time, and I am senior in college; I cannot believe that this novel was never taught in my high school.  The need for World Literature within the classrooms of the United States is pressing, for the exact reason that we need to see past the borderlines of our nation or more so Western nations.

It seems like I'm one of the few.<br /><br />Roughly, this fits into similar territory as Dances With Wolves, Little Big Man, or even Dune and Avatar. But while those stories of native vs. civilized man draw very sharp (and shallow?) lines in the moral sand, this book admiringly avoids it. The Ibgo are not a hippie's dream come true--unless you think polygamy and infanticide are groovy. But they are not savages either. In fact they are quite civilized--if by \\"civilized\\" we mean adhering to an agreed upon code of laws and conduct. Their only flaw is they are at times TOO civilized and conforming for their own good. For all of Okwonko's physical strength, he can't bring himself to refuse the oracle's order of the death of his adopted son, for example.<br /><br />The missionaries are the same. They believe so blindly in their own code that they can't see that they are wrong to murder half a village and impose their own set of laws on the Ibgo simply because they can. They are rule followers too--and their love of rules too often trumps their respect for all of humanity.<br /><br />In the end, I'm not sure the villain of this story is the White Man. I believe it's rather the blind, unquestioning faith in religious dogma and superstition on both sides. Without it, the Igbo wouldn't have granted the Christians unearned respect after nothing happened to them after building a church in the Evil Forest or after they killed a python. And without dogma and superstition, the Englishmen wouldn't have believed gunboat diplomacy was His wish.	2012-05-05

I picked it up, read the cover - it sounded very interesting - and decided to spend one dollar and give it a try.  I have just finished reading it and I absolutely loved it and can't stop thinking about it.  I can see why this book is so highly acclaimed and I plan to check out more of his writing.  The story made me feel very sad for the Ibo culture and how it and their belief system was changed by the arrival of the white missionaries.  Everyone has their own culture and belief system, and I really wonder if the Christian system is any better or worse that what the Ibo people had.  Not only that, I found the daily lives of the pre-missionary Ibo very peaceful, simple, and ritualistic.  This seemed to have all been ruined by the arrival of the outside world, which I suppose was inevitable, and I also suppose this to be one of the main points of the story.  This sort of invasion has happened countless times in history, of course, and being from the US I can't help but draw parallels with the Europen settlement of this country and how the Native Americans were treated.  I realize that Things Fall Apart is a work of fiction, and somewhat fableistic, but I believe a lot of it accuratly portrays life in a Nigerian village in the late 1800s or early 1900s.  Reading this book has really carved another facet in my undersatnding and appreciation of the world.    The line at the end of the book was very powerful and unexpected.  It led me to the following informative resource: [...]l  From there, you can delve as deeply into an anlysis of the book as you like.

The book is written from the perspective of an African folk writer, in his native town. The writing has a rhythm, almost as if a drum was playing while you read the book. The culture is dramatically different from our own, so everything in the book needs to be taken with an open mind. Much of the book focuses on the relationships the main character develops; which connects very strongly with the reader. It is a very simple read, and is only a mere 130 pages or so. If anyone ever wants to sit down and be immersed in a different culture, this is the book for you!	2012-03-17

And if you are seeking an understanding of African culture, this book could help.  But this work by Achebe is focused clearly on revealing the conflict in most culturally mixed societies today.  The problem is not one of values but of the expression of those values.  This is a great book to help the reader understand people of other cultures by seeking to understand their values and the expression of those values in comparison to those of the reader.  Being able to see the values of others aids in bringing people together to create a healthy living environment by reducing the conflicts often manifest in value expressions. This book was a required reading in a Cultural Anthropology Class and an enjoyable book to read.  I highly recommend it to people of all Religions and Cultures.	2012-03-01

Well-meaning foreigners brought their own religions and Western customs into a traditional African culture they viewed as backwards or savage, and in need of redemption and modernization. I never understood the deeper meaning of colonialism before I read this book. I was also left with a deeper understanding of indigenous cultures and a realization that people who lived in traditional societies didn't have anything broken that needed to be fixed by the colonialists.<br /><br />The characters aren't particularly likable, but I don't believe the author intended to write a book with admirable or lovable characters. Truly, some parts of the book were excruciatingly dull, but the importance of \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is the history behind it, even though the book is a work of fiction. If the book is required reading for a literature course, I highly recommend purchasing a study guide to accompany the text. This is a book that needs a roadmap if you're going to spend a serious amount of time analyzing it for a research or term paper.	2012-02-26

This is THEE most degrading book I've ever had to read.  Honestly, how is a story about a sinfully prideful man, who beats his family (wives and kids) and acts like a total whiny, savage a** throughout the entire novel; how does that seem okay over a banned book, such as Animal Farm, which has some of the best references to Stalin and Russia, as well as using animals as victims in the telling?  And let's be honest. Animal Farm actually IS interesting cause the author uses animals creatively to hide the darker undertones. It's clever and easier to read than this piece of trash they call Things Fall Apart.  TFA is just a major drag because it reads too much like text from a history book.  Seriously, who the heck wants to read a textbook for a reading assignment? Especially when high schools are trying to force this garbage down their students' throats.  The writing is sloppy and immediately turns the reader off with the mundane tone and overuse of African words they cannot define without the help of a translation guide / dictionary in the back of the book.  And then there's the abusive nature of the protagonist, who I cannot name cause I've scrubbed this book out of the existence of my mind (till today of course; still tastes like garbage after all these years).  Oh. My. Word.  How DARE we let children read this book. We have ENOUGH domestic violence in the United States.  And yet this book is still being forced upon students?  Newsflash: Harry Potter may have witchcraft, but I think a child is intelligent enough to recognize reality from fantasy.  Animal Farm is so cleverly written that it can actually pass for a children's book, when you get down to the basic format of the text itself. (come on, animal stories always get green-lighted)  Both works are FANTASY / ALLEGORY either way.  But with TFA...urgh.  Any child could try to read this book and they'd be upset that a man is beating his family.  And domestic violence is not entertaining to watch nor is it something anyone should be forced to read about, in GRAVE, EXPLICIT DETAIL, like in this book.  In fact, have any African natives ever read this book?  I imagine they must be pretty dang embarrassed with how Achebe degrades his own country with horrendous novel.  tl;dr: go read Animal Farm. Stay away from Things Fall Apart.  I'll spoil the story for ya, those who need help:  The main protagonist BAWS about how \\"tough\\" his life is, beats his family, then \\"accidentally\\" shoots a villager and is forced into exile. Comes home 7 years later and sees the White Man has ruined everything, so he commits suicide like the typical emo jerk he is.  Oh and the #1 symbol in the book is Yams. A freaking vegetable.  Yeah.  Just goes to show the creativity that went into this novel.  Which is NONE.	2012-02-21

Whilst the novel lacks a good storyline for such unique cultural and traditional content, it sends a powerful message for their colonizer. From historical and cultural perspective, the book rebelliously claims that they have an abundantly well-respected culture even before they were colonized and the new government didn't affect these people--but it actually did. Yet, it doesn't deny the power of the colonizers despite the dweller's rebel.<br /><br />Aside from the message it held, the novel is pretty boring and bland and sexist. It doesn't have an interesting plot to follow. It is a bunch of information about the tribe's culture, ritual, historical background, the colonization process and dweller's reaction to this movement. However it delivers a certain message: when something better comes along, (some) people would take advantage of it even if it means to leave their tribe or custom. Above all, the good news is that the main character fought for what he believed till death.	2012-01-22

Okonkwo overcomes his father's legacy, rises to greatness, is defeated by his own hubris and flaws, then is ultimately overcome by the Christian inquest into Africa which is incapable of seeing his life for more than an interesting, though impotent, rebellion against Europe's brand of civilization.  Okonkwo's world is at once accessible and deep, allowing the reader, no matter how different his background might be from that of Achebe or Okonkwo himself, to appreciate the humanity of the Africans who were viewed as primitive savages by European colonizers. It is profoundly important to examine the European abuse of Africans and Africa if one hopes to understand how colonialism and the treatment of Africa by foreign invaders has left Africa in such distress even decades after imperialist powers directed their interest toward Asia and the Middle East. Things Fall Apart offers a heartfelt and tragic story of how the relationship between Africa and Europeans worked.	2011-12-11

For most of the early 20th century, the colonization of Nigeria was portrayed as a necessary reformation of the unusually cruel, antiquated traditions of the Ibo people. But Nigerian writers like Chinua Achebe, upon obtaining mastery of the English language, spoke out against the narrow perspective of history cast by the oppressors.     Things Fall Apart is an accessible piece of African literature considering the gravity of its content. The simple yet elevated diction reflects Achebe's authentic cultural voice. He calmly weaves examples of camaraderie and local justice between the more often discussed primitive aspects of the village culture. The glossary of Ibo terms in the back of book enables the author to create a convincing atmosphere that immerses the reader into African village life.     As an antithesis to 20th century colonial literature, the book succeeds. Though sexism, infanticide, and a unjust class system persist, the Ibo culture redeems itself by displaying its ability to unify and bring together entire villages to celebrate life.     Through the prosperous yam farmer and storied wrestler Okonkwo, Achebe introduces us to the story's tragic hero. Scorning his father's feminine traits, he works hard to win the village's approval. At the peak of his success, he joins the council of village spirits, guiding the actions of his village. However, by the story's end, he finds himself utterly alone, deserted by those who are unwilling to defend the values and customs of the village.   There are two sides to every coin, and Achebe shows that on both the human and village levels. One can support Okonkwo's determination to become the highest ranked man in his village and at the same time feel disappointed when he blatantly disobeys tradition or displays unnecessary coldness. We mourn the destruction of village culture and Okwonko, despite all their faults, because we can see the vitality and goodness in them. This, of course, is due to the unique perspective Achebe lends us through his masterpiece.	2011-12-05

Every time I've read it (three times total) I find myself slowly becoming incorporated and indoctrinated into a foreign culture that at first seems so inscrutable. By the end, Achebe sets up a heartbreaking irony -- as the tribe becomes colonized, the familiar is now strange, the strange now familiar. And instead of feeling distance from a culture that was at first so alienating, you are now among them. Achebe's prose is so carefully crafted that every sentence was, to me, perfect.

The time period isn't specified. Okonkwo thinks in terms of planting seasons, not in terms like '1856 AD' (or whatever).    Okonkwo is a strong man, a respected warrior and athlete and farmer. The first half of the book is a loose collection of vignettes of his life, showing his layabout father, his wives and children, how he makes his living, his village Umoufia, folk stories and mythology, etc. This is interesting stuff. The prose is clear and smooth. (It's detailed too. There's a 2 page glossary at the end of the book explaining Ibo terms.) You get a good feel for the characters, how they live, what their day to day lives are like, how they view the world.    It's interesting, but the first part doesn't move fast. I read it admiringly but coolly. But, about halfway through, things start happening. There is an accident and Okonkwo is, for a time, exiled from Umoufia and has to return to the village of his mother. That's when things start picking up steam. After that the book moves along quicker and quicker, and all the detail that you picked up in the beginning takes on new significance. I read the last pages in the middle of the night, unable to put it down.    One thing I would say is Ibo village life is going to disturb some readers. Okonkwo is a polygamist. He beats women. His tribe has a taboo against twins. He's not a contemporary western protagonist thats for sure.     Another thing I'd note is that some people might find the beginning half somewhat sluggish. To them I'd say hang in there, it's worth the effort.     Highly recommended. I got another of Achebe's books after I got this one. It made me want to read more. 4.5 Stars.	2011-06-23

Okonkwo is one of the leaders in the tribe, admired for his strength and courage. He has many negative characteristics as well, particularly through our twenty-first century eyes: he is prideful, impatient with his son's \\"manliness,\\" and he is violent to his wives. The main story is how the tribe reacts when European missionaries come to the village on their \\"iron horses\\" (bicycles). Okonkwo is faced with either acceptance or violence.<br /><br />One of the most powerful scenes occurs early in the book when a slave boy from a neighboring village is captured and comes to live with Okonkwo and his family. After three years, Ikemefuna is treated as one of the family, even calling Okonkwo \\"father.\\" The Oracle tells that it is time to kill Ikemefuna, so the tribe takes him outside the village. Okonkwo is told not to, as this is his adopted son. After the first blow lands, Ikemefuna cries to Okonkwo for help, and Okonkwo runs to him killing him with a machete, just so others would not think him weak.<br /><br />I taught this novel for the first time recently, and I was pleased at how students seemed to enjoy the story and discussions. There is much to discuss in this book: colonialism, culture differences, gender roles, and religion. Overall, it was a good experience. However, there was a disturbing part of having taught this. During discussions about Okonkwo's beating his wives or killing his son, I heard over and over again, \\"Who are we to judge?\\" and \\"That's their morals\\" and \\"We can't force our morality on others.\\" I was stunned to see relativism so deeply ingrained at such a young age. We are training a generation of young people to think that it is wrong and America-centric to consider some actions as more correct than others. This may be true if we were talking about style of homes or clothing or television shows, but we are talking about something far more important than that. Some students in my classes could not admit that it is universally wrong to treat women like property or to kill your innocent son. They begin their objections with that pseudo-intellectual start, \\"Who are we...\\"<br /><br />You are a human being, that's who you are. As humans, we must address these universally wrongs: killing the innocence, enslaving others, abusing women and children. This is a good list with which to begin.<br /><br />If you don't agree, perhaps Okonkwo can come to your house and try to change your mind. A few minutes with him, I'm sure you'll be quick to say how many universal crimes against humanity he commits.y classes could not admit that it is universally wrong to treat women like property or to kill your innocent son.

However, it did provide a great comparison in ideas and customs of my own culture and what is often generically referred to as \\"African.\\" At moments I blinked and felt a small idea brand itself in my head much like the first time I thought of wild animals having personalities. I've often thought of Africa as a single entity of people that have found a simpler way of living and yet believe in silly gods. My introduction to questions against religion have since sent me down the road that many ideas I've followed or known are silly and unfounded; including the bias against tribesmen.<br /><br />I realize how blatant and racist the above sounds but I don't feel I'm alone or particularly wrong for thinking so. When something has only a passing affect on your life you don't normally devote a lot of time to clearing up the general ideas used to define it.

Whilst I had read many reviews about this book, I did not expect to love it, as I bought it to read for a thesis on African literature for school. I was very suprised then, when I not only devoured the book in a couple of hours, but thoroughly enjoyed reading it. A candid and realistic view on the period of colonialism in Africa, Achebe writes with style and simplicity, which is evidently European influenced, but very much African at its core. Unlike many other African authors of the time, Achebe does not attempt to reify the African past, but accepts that both Africans and White people alike have faults, in a poignant reflection on not only colonial rule, but humanity itself. Beautifully written, this book takes you into the heart of the Igbo society, and more importantly makes you feel; not as a European or an African, but as a human being. You will celebrate and mourn as the Igbo society falls apart, and the stunning conclusion will not only devastate you, but leave you questioning. Beginning with a quote from one of the greatest poets of our time, Yeats, Things Fall Apart is set to challenge your views from the outset, and it does just that, being, not only a beautiful piece of anticolonial writing, but also, a modern literary masterpiece.  I have and would recommend it to anyone, for an enjoyable, but thought-provoking read.	2011-04-21

I shall take this moment to point out that Achebe's use of an Irish poet's work to reflect the breakdown of African culture (by white people, some undoubtedly Irish) is ironic in the extreme, and not very apt.    The subtext of Yeats's poem is World War I, where over 10 million people died in a very short span of years. It is the second-largest catastrophe the world has experienced, and would have been the worst if World War II had not come along. (Ongoing African genocides are also terrible tragedies, but Achebe does not mention those.) Comparing the breakdown of an extremely sexist, superstitious and ignorant group via missionaries to one of the worst events in human history is grandiose at best. Even though I don't agree with what the missionaries did, they saved twins and treated women and children far better than the traditional Igbo people.    (Aside: I was always taught to notice how people treat others who have less power than them. When out at a restaurant, for instance, if your date treats the waiter like less of a human being, then they're probably not worth your time. Treating people who have less power than you as if they are inferior people is a sin of both the Igbo people *and* the missionaries in the novel, but the rampant sexism of the Igbo seems to me toshow more than the way their society functions--I counted over 150 instances of extremely sexist language in this book before the 100th page. Then I gave up counting. That, my friends, is overkill. End aside.)    Yeats condemns \\"passionate intensity,\\" and yet this is what Okonkwo seems to represent for much of the novel, when he isn't wife-beating and killing children. His suicide is a huge breaking point in the novel, but it seems to me almost out of character. One of the only things I really admired about Okonwko was his fighting spirit.    *deep breath* Anyway, I'm glad the novel's done with. It contained pages upon pages of pointless sexism and violence. Even if that represents Igbo society with perfect accuracy (which I doubt), the author did not have to affirm such behavior with his narrative voice. There are ways of writing about victims of oppression without condoning that oppression; Stephen R. Donaldson writes empowering stuff about victims all the time, and he's the son of an orthopedic surgeon who did missionary work. He saw suffering Indians firsthand, and still manages to gift his characters with an aura of dignity that Achebe's characters utterly lack.    \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is far and above the most overtly sexist book I have ever read in my life, bar none. I've read stuff from five--no, *eight*--hundred years ago that gave us female characters with more spine.	2011-04-17

I found it a bit weird reading this for a class I would never think my teacher could give me such a slow developing story (teachers are supposed to keep you engaged in reading, not drive you away from literature (or bore you to death). Nonetheless, it was for my world history class, I HAD TO READ IT.<br />There was no choice of reading something else, it was either that or get an F. Which comes to another point in our education system but it is a point entirely off in a tangent. :)<br /><br />So back to the book review ¬°K.<br />I think it is a solid 2 stars in the writing style. Achebe has an ingenious talent in exposing African culture to readers, but his slow writing structure, poor story development, turned me off from recommending this book to anyone. I consider, that his writing was done on purpose by the author to make you visualized an atmosphere of a world that runs very slow, life is stagnant, things are done in a certain way and ritualistic.<br /><br />I like gratification when I read a story, this one did not do it for me :(. which is then reason for my 2 stars. The book does have a scholarly teaching. As I read it, I did not understand many of the deeper messages that the book was conveying. Then again I can blame the teacher for not going in depth in the book, I had to figure them out the SLOW and PAINFULL WAY.<br /><br />I consider there are better books of African tales; to me this is NOT one of them. The book was solid written and well thought out.<br /><br />The book was not bad, it was actually very interesting, but you really need to like this genre to truthfully enjoy it, I am more of a fantasy reader.	2011-04-04

I felt like I learned a lot, and not in an axe-grinding or brow-beating way. It was really interesting, seeing what at least a small part of Nigeria was like, long before they were best known for e-mail scams.<br /><br />The story is about a man in a Nigerian village, living a traditional village life. We get glimpses into the everyday, festivals, weddings, funerals, religion, hierarchy, and all kinds of facets of village life. Then, just when we think that's all it is, in come the foreigners, marked as different by their white skin, separated by their traditions, religions and laws. And we all know how that ends.<br /><br />I found the story slow in places, and I was afraid it would be over before I got into it. The main character was very unlikeable, and his culture was incredibly dismissive of women, which often annoys me in literature. But, by the end of the book, I sympathized a lot with the domineering, supposedly primitive individual at the heart of the story, and I keenly felt his pain at having everything he'd ever known taken from him by these outsiders who didn't understand anything. I started to question a lot of my own assumptions about colonialism, and whether native cultures really are better off learning how to cope with the white world, rather than keeping their own cultures. Before listening to this audio book, I would've said clothing, modern medicine, abundant food and learning to read is worth it, but now I don't know, and I don't think the ones who integrate quickly are the ones to ask.<br /><br />I thought the story worked very well as an audio book. It's told in a storyteller's style, with repetition reminding us who the characters were and what their roles were. In a written book, that might've annoyed me. Hearing it aloud, it was a relief.<br /><br />I didn't much like the narrator, though. He had this gravelly, \\"manly\\" sort of voice that sounded very American. I think it would be silly to have a native narrator read it, accent and all, but the flow of the language was often stymied by the narrator's pausing right after or before unfamiliar and hard-to-pronounce words.<br /><br />Overall, though, I thought this was an excellent choice for an audio edition, and I'm glad I took it out from the library.

Which is too bad, as it fails to achieve what apparently drove Achebe to write it: the desire to bring to life the ample humanity of tribal Nigerians at the time of British colonization. He did a much better job of it in his 1964 novel Arrow of God.<br /><br />However, I cut Achebe some slack for Things Fall Apart, a training novel, as I see it, his first, when his craft was apparently still underdeveloped. Much of the important action of the novel comes in summary, that is, in his telling the reader what happens instead of developing full-blown scenes that put us there so we can see it, feel it and share in the emotion, as with the crucial accidental killing of a clansman by Okonkwo.<br /><br />Most of the tribal characters remained unrealized and largely undistinguishable, serving as mere foils for Okonkwo, as with his three wives. Further, the novel fails structurally, there being not so much a plot with causality and reflective inevitability as chronological (largely) occurrences, often unrelated. Further, his seriously flawed protagonist Okonkwo is a hard one to love.<br /><br />These weaknesses in craft and concept together undermine Achebe's purpose: to show his Nigerian ancestors as vital human beings deserving of our empathy. I found Okonkwo's ultimate downfall unmoving--less so even than Achebe's essays and lectures collected in The Education of a British-Protected Child (2009).<br /><br />Those essays, albeit uneven, work to effectively remind us of the continuing horrors visited on Africa by slavery, colonialism and their aftermath. That said, Achebe misses the mark on his criticism of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, failing to distinguish the narrator Marlowe's observations from Conrad's, for one. But his overall posit about the distorted European narrative re Africa, which he documents, seems substantially on target.t.	2010-06-25

Let me count the reasons	I picked this for my book group because I had never read it while every high school student I know has. Marooned in the early chapters, one of my book group friends asked, \\"Why is this considered a classic anyway?\\" I could see her point. Especially at first, it does not exactly pull you forward with compelling narrative flow. In fact, as you read about food preparation and the yam harvest, you may think to yourself, \\"Hmm -- do I really need all this detail, and why?\\"<br /><br />But keep reading!<br /><br />Here is why \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is rightly a classic: 1) It is easy to read. (Think Hemingway.) 2) It is really informative about a not well known (to most of us) time and place - turn of the 20th century Nigeria, its ways and customs. 3) It raises fundamental questions that cut across cultures about people. (Among them: How are the sins of the fathers visited upon the sons? What happens when two cultures with widely disparate technological achievements meet? Is technological achievement really the measure of a culture's worth?) 4) It doesn't deliver simple answers. 5) It is politically correct -- fostering appreciation of what we now call diversity, but meaning in this case traditional African culture.<br /><br />Sometimes easy to read books that are assigned in high school end up under-estimated or even resented.

I happen to feel that the pacing of the story was perfect. The first half had to spend a lot of time with the characters to acclimate the reader to this society that Okonkwo lives. The story is titled Things Fall Apart and like in real life tragedy tends to strike quickly. Your idea of day to day life and what is considered normal can drastically change within a short period of time. This is exactly what happens to Okonkwo in this novel. While the novel takes place in pre-colonial Nigeria, a world even most modern day Nigerians may not be familiar with, the characters were very real to me. I can definitely relate to the main character. He is essentially a father who has worked hard all his life to gain what he has. To gain what his current society deems as important. He is someone who simply wants what he feels is best for his son and the rest of his family. Unfortunately, the world he grew up in has changed. What was important is not now, what is best for his son is not necessarily what Okonkwo feels is important. Okonkwo is sometimes a stubborn and violent man, but who hasn't known or met a person like this guy. I have to admit the story does start out slow, but it's just so you can get to know the people before the story begins. In fact without the introduction it would be impossible to understand the tragedy that occurs later on.	2010-03-18

The story begins years before missionaries enter the landscape and begin to change the culture and customs of the land.  The novel tells us of life before and after the missionaries came.    Although the novel is mostly about rituals, beliefs and history around this important period in Africa, it chooses to follow a very strong and unlikable character as its main focus.  His name is Okonkwo.  He came from a lazy father who he hated and is spite of that laziness and hatred of his father, Okonkwo becomes a hard working and ambitious leader in the clan of his village.    Okonkwo is not a good man.  He beats his wife and kids regularly.  He is a beast with a fierce temper but he is also a very respected throughout the village.      On a night of grieving Okonkwo accidentally shoots another clan member and is cast out for seven years with his family to his mother's homeland.  Then the missionaries begin coming into the village during his absence. Okonkwo later disowns his son when he becomes friendly with the missionaries, who Okonkwo despises.    He returns back to his old village to find nothing is the same.  The white man and his religion have changed everything.  This isn't a book about flowery description and at times is very skeletal in its description but it moves along briskly with its story.  There is never any emotional attachment that we develop with any of these characters.  The characters seem to be mere vessels to carry the ideas and themes of the novel which really is about the vast differences between cultures and the connections that can unite or divide us.    I found the novel very good because it made me think about these ideas.  At times I wondered how anyone could believe such things and there are some odd cultural practices, but then I realized that these people might also think my beliefs just as strange as theirs.The book is simple and interesting.    It is no masterpiece though.  I believe the main problem with the book lies with the main character Okonkwo himself.  I felt no pity in his demise even if some understanding remained for his firm beliefs and his fight to hold on to what he felt sacred.    Even with great ideas and cultural beliefs, I can't think a book is great unless I feel some connection to the characters and with Things Fall Apart I just couldn't.  I just couldn't stand Okonkwo.    Don't get me wrong, I still highly recommend the book for the interesting ideas that one can dissect and discuss.  I felt it would have had a stronger main character it could have been much stronger and might even have lifted it to a level of greatness.     Grade : B+	2010-03-04

Chinua Achebe writes a sad and melancholic tale about a man called Okonkwo in a small African tribal village called Umuofia. Okonkwo is a man feared and respected by everyone in his village and beyond. He is a wrestling champion and man who enjoys fame and respect because of his hard work. He is a self made man. His father was considered a looser because he did not work very hard to sustain his crops and did nothing else but play music and laze around. He died as an outcast.<br /><br />The only thing Okonkwo fears is failure and being compared to his father. So he works hard, becomes prosperous and lives comfortably with his 3 wives and children.<br /><br />But life is not fair to him. After working hard in his village to gain a title and a good life, he is exiled from his fatherland because he kills a boy by mistake. When European colonists come to his village and build a church and start converting the villagers into Christians, Okonkwo wants to take action, he wants to fight the Europeans and preserve his culture and religion and his gods. But no one else wants to fight. Okonkwo watches his son join the Europeans and turn into a Christian and he is in utter despair because he cannot do anything about it.<br /><br />This book has a sad and tragic end.<br />What I liked about the book was the simple descriptions of the day to day life of the people in a tribal village. I enjoyed reading about how their lives revolved around the growing and harvesting of Yams, how their beliefs in their gods affected the men and women in the village and their unease and anger when Europeans come and build a church in the village.<br />I enjoyed reading about folk tales passed down from generation to generation.<br /><br />Even though I like the book I would like to mention a few points here as I have heard a lot of criticism and bad reviews for this book.<br /><br />`Things fall apart' has been termed as a literary masterpiece. But if you looking for outstanding language, this book is not for you. The language is as simple as it can get, which I think is the beauty of it. If you want to clear your prejudice that African villages are backward and primitive and you think reading this book will give you an insight into why they what they do, do NOT read this book. I thought the tribal customs and beliefs were down right against humanity and whatever way the author would have put it, I wouldn't have believed otherwise. Would you approve of leaving new born twins in a jungle because twins are considered evil? Mutilating a dead infant's body so that it isn't born again? Out casting a man from his village and his loved ones because he has a disease?<br /><br />If you are looking for a good plot and well rounded and lovable characters, again this book is not for you. I hated Okonkwo. He was a tyrant and he repeatedly beat his wives and kids. I couldn't sympathize with him no matter what.<br /><br />I couldn't take sides with the European colonists either. Though they brought good things in the village, they brought law and order, I hated the fact that they thought their God was the greatest. Trying to undermine any religion is always wrong. Every religion has its good and bad points, what you can do is point out the bad points or the bad interpretations of it. Sorry, but I am against statements like, `There is no God except our God'.

US	21289578	ROPKMVR4D5D8I	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Profound Novel	A novel of great importance that allows the reader to experience life in Africa from an African perspective. The illustrious Chinua Achebe, takes the reader back to a time when the Igbo (Nigeria) first encounter the white man and his civilization. It showed how a African people can be noble with our own laws, instead of depicting Africans as savages. Okonkwo is a character that you can both love and hate. A strict man who follows the rules of his culture, but at the same time alienates his own son and heir.     One of the most profound quotes from the novel is as follows: \\"Does the white man understand our custom about land?\\" \\"How can he when he does not even speak our tongue? But he says that our customs are bad; and our own brothers who have taken up his religion also say that our customs are bad. How do you think we can fight when our own brothers have turned against us? The white man is very clever. He came quietly and peaceably with his religion. We were amused at his foolishness and allowed him to stay. Now he has won our brothers, and our clan can no longer act like one. He has put a knife on the things that held us together and we have fallen apart.\\"	2010-02-17

So many of the negative reviews about this book seem to go something like \\"the story didn't pick up till the end\\", which makes me think that a huge portion of people reading this miss the point entirely. The problem, I feel, is that people feel this book is about white people coming to Africa. It's not. The arrival of white men are just one event in a long line of struggles for the main character Okonkwo. This book is the story of Okonkwo. The reason this story has been compared to Greek tragedy is because like many Greek hero's, Okonkwo is a great man with a personal flaw which ends up consuming him. His hubris eventually destroys his life. The white missionaries and colonial establishment are an interesting side point, but if that's all you think the story is about, of course you're going to hate it.<br /><br />When you really get the book, it is a very good story. I wouldn't call it exceptional. It's not likely something that will stick with me for a long time, but it's insightful and smartly written. It deserves four stars, but I hold off the fifth for books that are truly exceptional, and this is not one of those. (*Changed mind- read comments)	2010-01-09

This is how it feels to read TFA. It gives a very interesting view of an African life. I would not say it can generalize African culture or living at all, but it does give you  a secular view, revolving around the life of one man.     This story, is more about one man in Africa while it simply shows Africa without focusing on it at all, except what is going on in Africa, and affecting the man.    I reccomend it, especially for those who do not tend to read books in the African genre. It's an easy read and interesting. (And you'll have fun pronouncing the names as well). Enjoy!	2009-12-17

I wish that I was blind so i didnt have to suffer reading through this terrible book for my sophomore year at school. I hope one day i will have a few extra dollars to buy this book and then tear the pages out and throw them in my fire pit. And I have read some really boring books, and when i read a boring book i usually finish it, but this book, i give an exception to not finish it was that much torture to read! Okay, the first page you read you will not understand whats even going on. So far in class we're supposed to be at about chapter 8 I stopped reading it it was sooooo boring!! It made me want to tear my eyes out and torture myself! It's like thee worst book you could ever read. If I were you people out there who are thinking of buying this book, i would just go find another book, this will take time out of your day and it's like throwing away your money on a sucky book, and its like being in a torture chamber and your about to die! So take my word for it dont ever ever ever EVER! read this book, once you get to about the 2nd chapter your all gonna wish you never bought it, it's such a waste of money. I mean really, what's the point of supporting such a sucky book by purchasing it, you will regret it! Trust me, dont even look at this book and think \\"oh interesting\\" u will thank me later!

In the beginning of the book, Mr Achebe provides a narrative of the cultural practices and norms in this Nigerian society.  These characters are not necessarily painted with a sympathetic brush and many of their cultural practices seem to be arbitrary, capricious and harmful.  What is amazing about the first part of the book is realizing how variable the fabric of different cultures can be and wondering how certain cultural practices came to be accepted as obvious.  The characters themselves often wonder at the reasons behind these practices but they are seen as being as fixed as the African soil where their feet tread.  Regardless of your sympathies, the reader can't help but get fully absorbed in the communities involved and mourn the loss of a once proud man Okwonko.  Okwonko is a man who is wholly invested in tribal life.  His life's ambition is to be accepted in to the culture as a well-respected man.  He buys in to the rules and thinks he has a lucid path to success.  This is no different than the person who seeks power and prestige in any society.  Rules and customs are laid down and there are many folks who make it their life's goal to be successful in that society.  Tragically Okwonoko is denied his long sought after success two times.  He is first banished from his village by accidentally breaking one of the rigid, somewhat arbitrary, unquestioning rules he has so much faith in.  When he has finally climbed his way back in to the society, he finds that things have changed as white christian missionaries have infiltrated his clan.  The clash of these civilizations is illuminated in the differences between their courts and a humorous discussion of monotheism vs polytheism.  These missionaries are treated sympathetically by the author when they end the practice of abandoning twins and banishing castes of people to the fringe of society.  They are treated less sympathetically in the description oftheir mock courts which ultimately causes the final tragedy to unravel.  It is this final denial of Okwonko's dreams that is the most tragic because he has lost faith in the tribal society he was once so proud of.  He is left a shell of a man whose dreams and vision of the world and his place in it have evaporated.  When his tribemates are unwilling to fight for their way of life in the teeth of encroaching missionaries with a vastly different way of doing things, he has no other choice but to end his life.	2009-10-24

The writing pulled me in and made me forget that I was reading.  That's always the best!<br /><br />As for the story, I was conflicted - I wanted to identify and support the tribal customs and lifestyle unconditionally. As a person born and raised in the U.S. I struggled with some of the tribe's cruel practices. Well, cruel by my sensibilities.  Consequently I found myself a little pleased that some of the characters chose Anglican church beliefs and practices.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />SR	2009-10-18

If you are someone who knows very little about African culture and would like to learn more, this book is for you.  I consider this a \\"light read\\".  It isn't an \\"easy read,\\" because of the African names and words that are in the story.  Keeping track of characters with similar names can slow the reader down at times.  However, the characters in this story come to life and are easy to sympathize with.  This story helps readers to understand some of the current day politics in parts of Africa.  It is a story of Africa from a perspective that is still considered fresh - a point of view from an African.<br /><br />I would argue that this story is really about \\"change\\" and a person's response or lack of response to change.  There are lessons for those who are considered the \\"graying workforce,\\" who are having to adapt to new ways of doing things on the job.  Achebe could easily be talking to Americans today who are struggling to adjust to proposed changes in our laws and policies at the local and federal levels.  The America of last year; and of ten years ago, is history and may be no more.  The message is clear...ready or not, here it comes.  Change.  Either prepare for change or get run over by it.	2009-09-20

The main character is driven by the need to succeed and in their primitive culture it is somewhat interesting to see how things unfold for him. The main point I took away is that in a stone-age culture there is a lot of randomness; maybe one day some one comes and says you must take in a 10 year old boy, then years later they come by and say he must die, or maybe a witchdoctor comes and takes your daughter for a night. The author has some skill and some of the folk stories were interesting, but I found I just did not care about the characters. So I stopped reading.

If you prefer action-packed fast paced story telling, then you will be disappointed and may give this work one star. I was leaning towards the 1-star group.But somewhat admiring the literary aspect of the whole work inclines me to give it a 3. However, other reviewers view this as plot-less and yes, for me it does seem plotless but a better description I think would be \\"weak plot\\". The story revolves around a a tribal leader named Okonkwo who tried his best to shield his tribe with its traditional culture from the influence of \\"change\\". (Reminds us of what we are undergoing in our own century, doesn't it, with everone clamoring for \\"change\\"). But the \\"change\\" in Oknokwo's world is something that appeared to be less violent and more compassionate as taught by the European missionaries. As other members of his tribe begin to accept and adopt the new doctrine, Oknokwo's world and culture had come to an end which eventually led to his inevitable fall from grace with his tribal society. As with other reviewers,I find some of the pages less interesting that I skip them but those belong to Part One.However, as one peruses or examines Parts Two and Three, the pace gains some momentum as the clash of cultures intensifies and as the doctrines of Chrisitanity begin to enlghten and inspire the African mind.	2009-07-18

I feel this is one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking stories I have read. The intricacies Mr. Achebe uses are fine threads that don't seem as though they will be able to hold on their own. However, as part of the bigger tapestry of the story, each thread weaves a richer and more beautiful tale. To this day (probably 10 years later), I still find myself asking questions about this story. What if our main character hadn't killed the young boy he had \\"adopted\\" as his son? Would the father have continued to prosper? Or was his downfall inevitable? We never will know the answer to that question. I guess from my Western mindset, I tend to believe that the killing of the young boy - though tragic and senseless - had no direct causal link to what came after. I think the family's fortunes already were beginning to turn; but, the end just was more evident after the murder. However, that is part of the beauty of this book, because it is very different from the classics we have in Western literature. Mr. Achebe's prose is not as polished perhaps as Dickens. His prose differs even more greatly from the Russian masters like Pushkin and Tolstoy. But what might lack in polish is more than made up for in this story of a family unit - so different from what we see - who sees their prosperity and happiness disappear before their eyes.	2009-07-10

Also shows how missionaries tend to negatively affect the culture and act as a neo-imperialist institution.

The author was born in Nigeria in 1930 and is currently a college professor at Bard College in upstate New York.  This book is required reading in many college courses today and considered a classic.<br /><br />Most of the book deals with Nigerian tribal life both before and after the coming of the missionaries.  We first meet Okonkwo, a well respected tribal member, in his prime.  He has three wives and several children and his plot of land is well tended and produces many yams.  The beliefs in their spirits are very real and I found myself seeing their world through their eyes.  I related to each of the people, especially Okonkwo, whose life was shaped by the shame of his father, and also his wife who bore ten children and had only one child who lived.  Some of the customs were indeed strange, and sometimes they were cruel.  Life was certainly not idyllic.  There was war.  There was murder.  And then, because of an accident, Okonkwo himself was banned from his tribe for seven years.  But there was social cohesion and a worldview that suited the way of life of the people.<br /><br />The first three-quarters of the book were set in this very unique Nigerian community who had never seen a white man.  And then the missionaries came.  Things changed.  And because the author had so fully created the tribal world, I personally felt the impact of the missionaries on the community through the eyes of the people, which was mostly that of confusion as their way of life was turned inside out.<br /><br />This is a fine book.  I loved every page and was sorry to see it end.	2009-04-25

It is true, the book is written in a simplistic style (in fact it even says so right on the back cover). However, this style does not detract from the overall story. The inevitable colonization of Umuofia and other villages by European missionaries is not portrayed in such a way as to criminalize the Europeans. I don't understand how anyone saw it as a attack on a particular group of persons. \\"Things Fall Apart\\" centers around the life & culture of Okonokwo; most of the book is concerned with painting a vivid picture, though short in words, of a great warrior. It is a very good read, though the ending was not as satisfying as I had hoped. All the more reason to purchase the sequel, \\"No Longer At Ease\\". Unfortunately, I'm sure most of the negative reviews come from people are read this novel as a requirement for some educational course. If you can, read this novel with an open mind and on your own leisure (as with all great literature).	2009-04-23

Chinua Achebe's goal is to depict a different side of Igbo culture in contrast to colonial literature, such as the works of Rudyard Kipling.  The novel succeeds in proving that the Igbo were not merely \\"savages\\" but were part of an organized, well structured society that included its own form of religion and government. Throughout the novel, the underlying themes of arrogance, racism and internal conflict are showcased.  The book reads sometimes like an educational text instead of a creative novel.  The messages presented are important, yet I don't feel that I am drawn to it as it lacks a certain type of creativity.  Some authors, for instance Virginia Woolf can write a novel about basically nothing and with her genius, it is captivating and moving.  That is the style of writing that I enjoy.  I feel that this novel is important because of the subject matter, and not the actual style or interest level.  I would recommend this novel to instructors for classroom discussion, but for personal enjoyment, I would skip this novel.	2009-03-21

There are other African writers who are just as brilliant   but their work is more up to date and has moved me a lot  more than is.  Is that because I'm biracial and female?  I don't know.

Not to mention the vaginal cutting and how its effected her  life.  I read her autobiography in one day and then read her  novel \\"Flesh and the Devil\\" and those two modern African books  have changed my life profoundly.

The story chronicles the first encounters between the polytheistic Igbo people and Christian missionaries. Obligations to the gods, cultural taboos regarding twins, the disabled and death, and unanticipated pronouncements from oracular priests and priestesses all govern the tribe's communal decision-making. Strictly delineated roles for men, women and children and tribal titles granting tribe members privileges such as harvesting palm wine govern day-to-day life. Okonkwo, a young Igbo man hoping to better himself despite his shamefully indolent father, feels these pressures acutely but manages for the most part to push ahead in the tribal hierarchy without making waves. The tribe's routines are upset when a priest erects a chapel in the evil forest where twins and outcasts are sent to live apart from the villages. Predictably, things fall apart. As Oberieka, one of the Igbo elders, put it: \\"The white man is very clever. He came quietly and peaceably with his religion. We were amused at his foolishness and allowed him to stay. Now he has won our brothers and our clan can no longer act like one. He has put a knife on the things that held us together and we have fallen apart.\\"    One of the things I enjoyed most about the book was its depiction of Igbo tribal rites and the way the author used conversations between Igbo elders and the Christian missionaries to explain the interrelationships between the pantheon of Igbo gods and the tribe's animistic practices. I feel like I now have at least a concrete examples of how a polytheistic African religion weaves in and out of daily life. That is not to say that the specifics of that religion left me unmoved. At various points in the story, I longed for someone to step forward and put an end to the violence against women, the practice of leaving unwanted infants to die in the forest, and the senseless sacrifice of innocent children, but was disappointed. Another thing I did like about the book was its explosive ending. I felt it resolved all the major plot turns, without tumbling into a predictable, overly tidy end. The bitterly ironic comment that concludes the story was a graceful end note.    I would recommend this book to anyone wanting an interesting introduction to black African literature. In some ways, the book so closely mirrors a Greek tragedy that it's hard to forget you are reading a title common on high school world literature reading lists. On the other hand, it's an excellent read that can be enjoyed in just a few evenings and it's on those reading lists for a reason.	2009-02-19

(yet the prose itself is not its strong point).      It seems that many works of fiction these days are of the former and unfortunately, not enough of the latter. I recently re-read this book along with another classic, JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN, after a discussion I had with a friend about this very subject. As a middle-aged person, I often look back at the books that made a difference in my life and much of the time, it's not about the author's writing style. Achebe's is a plain, straightforward style, but it's what he is conveying that is so striking about this story. (I am a bit miffed at the \\"English\\" teachers and the like who are downing this book!) Bottom line: I was left with a lasting impression that stayed with me. I can't say that many books do this today.    All I can say is pick up this read and decide for yourselves. Bottom line, this story is just as relevant today as it was so many years ago when it first appeared. These issues are universal and the world today is replete with similar conflicts.	2008-08-28

Since I've read a decent amount of African literature (not a vast amount), my first thoughts are that \\"Things Fall Apart\\" isn't superior to some of those novels.  However, it is also important to realize this was a pre-cursor and likely an influence on many if not all of those more recent novels.  One needs to think about the historical context and timeframe that this book was written in, the late 1950s.  There had not been a large acceptance nor critical recognition of African literature in the Western world during that time, especially of literature from Africa.  Achebe's novel had played a critical roled putting African literature on the world map.<br /><br />The novel centers on one of the leaders of a Nigerian tribe, Okonkwo.  Achebe divides the novel into three parts -- setting up tribal life and the Okonkwo's family, his exile to his mother's ancestral tribe and Okonkwo's return to his tribe.  The other important theme underlying the story centers on the impact of colonialism, specifically Christianity, on African tribal life.<br /><br />What \\"Things Fall Apart\\" provides us with is deeper knowledge of African tribal life, the customs and mores of a people and the affect of outside influences, in this case Western culture, on traditional tribal life.  The book has an elegant simplicity to it, matching the picture Achebe paints of tribal life.  While there are a few bits that move slowly, this is a short book and is worthy of a read for both the influence and impact it has had on African literature as well as the the knowledge of a different culture and people that many of us are unlikely to encounter during our life.	2008-07-10

When I taught English 9 Honors, I would ask my students what they thought of the books we read.  _Things Fall Apart_ always won the \\"worst book\\" award.  They were right.  This is one of the most overrated novels of the English language.      If Achebe had a B.S. detector, he might have been able to chisel this text down to an almost-bearable short story.  Alas, he didn't, and this is what we have.     Okonkwo, the protagonist, is supposed to be tragic, but he's not.  He's pathetic.  He's utterly revolting, from beginning to end.  The other characters aren't much better.    The plot starts nowhere and ends in the same place.  Sure, there's an obvious structure to the novel, but it doesn't matter.  Not much happens.  The characters are lifeless, the plot is lifeless, and the prose is lifeless.  I know, Achebe crafted the prose to be what it is-- but that doesn't make it any good.      It amazes me that this book is placed alongside (or above, if you listen to some people) works such as _Moby Dick_, _The Great Gatsby_, _Ulysses_, _The Sun Also Rises_, and _The Sound and the Fury_.

It deals with Nigerian tribal life before and during white colonialism, with particular attention to how tribal culture and white colonial culture come into conflict when white people move in and attempt to convert the natives to Christianity.<br /><br />Things Fall Apart is slow-paced. There is no plot to speak of here beyond antihero Okonkwo's ambitions, and the cultural conflict does not begin until the last quarter of the book. In the meantime, Achebe explores tribal culture in depth, with attention to tradition, religion, ritual, and family structure.<br /><br />Achebe's writing is rather simple (often praised as \\"deceptively simple\\"), and sometimes repetitive. Achebe is a better storyteller than he is a writer, as his protagonist is well-rounded and his supporting characters are sufficiently well-rounded, even though the novel drags at times<br /><br />On the whole, Things Fall Apart is now overrated, but it is still a solid rebuttal to those who glorify white colonialism, as well as an exploration of Nigerian tribal culture.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED	2008-05-13

Achebe's novel broaches the subject of morality, but demonstrates that even the concept of \\"evil\\" is subject to a cultural interpretive context.<br /><br />Okonkwo, the book's tragic hero, is an emblem of tradition, but also represents how tradition can be subject to the inner turmoil of the human soul.  While the Ibo people must face the threat of European missionaries, Okonkwo must confront the threat of his own misplaced hubris.  Achebe is a sympathetic voice, but is unafraid to reveal the flaws of his characters as a commentary upon our own imperfect existence.<br /><br />This is probably one of the best introductions to African fiction, precisely because the story does not limit itself to the African context. The author's  investigation of tragedy is pragmatic, yet emotionally stimulating without being romanticized. It is a book that will help the western reader more easily understand not only Nigerian tribal culture, but the power of ideas and their institutions.	2008-05-13

Things Fall Apart, by noted author Chinua Achebe, is the fictional story of a family living in a small village, weathering and tolerating clan and religious traditions, until the coming of the British, who bring their own set of \\"clan\\" and religious traditions.<br /><br />It's also a misogynistic tale full of anger and violence.<br /><br />Achebe develops a story that has, as its key insult, to be called a woman.  The reader is reminded of this over and over:<br /><br />\\"That was why he had called him a woman.  Okonkwo knew how to kill a man's spirit\\" (p. 26).<br /><br />\\"No matter how prosperous a man was, if he was unable to rule his women and his children (and especially his women) he was not really a man\\" (p. 53).<br /><br />\\"If any one of you prefers to be a woman, let him follow Nwoye now while I am alive so that I can curse him\\" (p. 172).<br /><br />\\"He mourned for the clan, which he saw breaking up and falling apart, and he mourned for the warlike men of Umuofia, who had so unaccountably become soft like women\\" (p. 183).<br /><br />There is an interesting story here, but the stories of the women are not just hidden and untold, but they are ground into kola nut paste.  Frankly, Achebe is either not interested, or not able, to incorporate a female perspective in this tale.  It is an ancient male fantasy of control and dominion.  Beat the wife who is late with dinner.  But she still exists 24/7.  How can she be invisible?<br /><br />The answer, I believe, lies in the location (Africa) and Achebe's creative period for this book (it was first published in 1959).  If written today, it would be a different story.  But the misogyny is still key.  This is a story written by one who didn't understand women, even in 1959.<br /><br />I wonder about its attraction today. Are we to pity the poor, \\"uncivilized\\" Africans?  Are we to accept the deletion of women as significant in a community?<br /><br />So... interesting, but irritating.  Well-written, but brutal enough to lack \\"classic\\" status.  This is not Africa, and even in the past, Africa was a big enough place that this tale didn't \\"speak\\" for all clans, tribes, and nations.<br /><br />On the back cover, the promotional material states \\"Uniquely and richly African, at the same time it reveals Achebe's keen awareness of the human qualities common to men of all times and places.\\"  I don't think so.big enough place that this tale didn't \\"speak\\" for all clans, tribes, and nations.

Achebe has used his own background of an African village to create an interesting story that gives unique perspective of the African life and culture. The book is broken into three parts which describe the main character, Okonkwo, and the lifestyle in his village, the arrival of the missionaries and their actions toward the villagers, and the last year of Okonkwo's life.<br /><br />The first part of \\"Things Fall Apart\\" expresses the lifestyle of the African culture in the village of Umuofia where the main character, Okonkwo, had lived. This first part consists of thirteen chapters that reveal the life in Umuofia, the wives and children of Okonkwo, the life and death of Ikemefuna, and the beginning of Okonkwo's exile. The second part of this book focuses on the life of the exile in Mbanta, the village of Okonkwo's mother. It consists of six chapters which reveal Okonkwo and his family living with his mother's kinsmen in Mbanta, the visits from Obierika, the arrival of the missionaries, the conversion of Okonkwo's son, Nwoye, and the last year of Okonkwo's exile. The final part of the novel expresses the actions of the missionaries, the return of Okonkwo to Umuofia, and the death of Okonkwo. It consists of six chapters that reveal Okonkwo's attempts to urge the villagers to fight against the missionaries after his return, Mr. James' attempt to change the belief of the villagers, and a certain death of the villager.<br /><br />There is great deal of symbolism and meanings being expressed from this unique novel, and it also expresses a fascinating perspective about African life and the impact of cultural imperialism.<br /><br />The novel is quite enjoyable to read and gives one a food for thought.	2007-12-02

I immediately fell in love with the book because I could relate a lot with tribal life in my village and the various forces that were impacting on it. The customs, rituals and beliefs were very similar. The impact of white missionaries on the lives of people in my village was also very powerful and caused a lot of clashes with the local people's way of life. Things all around us were changing, exposing the fragility of our culture, resulting in inevitable conflicts.<br /><br />The main character, Okonkwo, was a respected and powerful village hero. However, as we progress with reading the book, he is struck with tragedies which ultimately consume him because of his inability to cope with change. This book had a profound influence on me and made me appreciate the intellectual talent within the continent.<br /><br />The book is a must read for people on the African continent where strong traditional beliefs still have a firm hold in a time of breathtaking changes wrought about by the unstoppable globalization process. The ability of African people to stop or significantly influence the pace, direction and extend of change is very limited. The tragedies that befell Okonkwo are continuing but in different forms on the continent. This is largely due to the failure to adapt to change and failure to appreciate that, however much we firmly hold and justify some of our beliefs, we cannot force others to agree with us and if we try, we will fail anyway.<br /><br />An important lesson from this book is the echoing of Charles Darwin's conclusion that it is not the strongest of the species or the most intelligent that will survive in a changing environment, but those species that can best adapt to change.	2007-11-01

Talk about transcending time as well as cultures!  Chinua Achebe is a magnificent story teller.  I love authors who have the ability to transport me to worlds that seem so different from my own.    Okonkwo was a man that was obsessed with masculinity and the \\"power\\" of being masculine.  Although I could see how harsh, abusive, and unyielding Okonkwo was towards his family, oddly I felt sympathy for the man.  He was the product of his environment and culture.  Apparently his callousness was worsened because of his fear that he should become like his father ----- a man with no title, in his culture, the equivalent of being a woman.    How many of us struggle to balance the new with the old?  And how often do we question or all out resist changing times.... be it attitudes or ideas, advancements in technology, religion, policies, music, etc.  Most of us reach a certain age where we would prefer our traditions be left alone.  In some instances there should be no room for compromise, but in other instances perhaps there truly is improvement/advancement to be gained.    Okonkwo's struggle is exactly that.  He strives to leave behind a proud legacy.  However, he makes bad decisions along the way.  The more he tries to make things right the more it seems that misfortune comes his way.  He's angered and confused about the changes that come upon his village but that combined with his pigheaded demeanor make for a disastrous result.  It's a good book to take up beyond school required reading.  Achebee gives his readers a great deal to consider.	2007-09-22

I read about three-quarters of the book before I began to appreciate it.     Up to then I'd disliked the main character, Okonkwo, an important person in the village whose major traits were harsh anger, pride and inflexibility, finding him one-sided and uninteresting. I felt the description was plodding and little of importance was happening, and wasn't greatly interested in the village life. Much of the novel was concerned mainly with his point of view, and his interactions with the other, relatively minor characters were unexciting. When a dramatic event occurred, such as his accidental shooting of a villager that led to his exile, it was described in a flat, undramatic tone that seemed inappropriate and puzzled me.     I couldn't help comparing this novel unfavorably with another I happened to be reading, Palace Walk, by Naguib Mahfouz, with its complex, many-sided protagonist, the many other strongly developed people in his family, the dramatic interaction between them, and the rich world around them that was reasonably familiar.     It was only after reading some background material that I could begin to understand how Achebe's novel aimed to recreate a vibrant culture that had existed before colonization on its own terms, with its oral tradition, rituals and taboos, and guardian spirits, and show what had been lost. The focus on a period before colonization and the depiction of the whites as interlopers has been called innovative for its time. Likewise the use of language in the words of the villagers, instead of pidgin.     A scholar of African lit, Bernth Lindfors, has described the book like this: \\"Instead of representing Africa as a barbarous wilderness where savages lived in a permanent state of anarchy until the white man came bringing peace, law, order, religion, and a 'higher' form of civilization, Achebe showed how Africans led decent, moral lives in well-regulated societies that placed strict legal and religious constraints on human behavior. Indeed, according to Achebe, things did not fall apart in Africa until Europe intruded and set everything off balance by introducing alien codes which Africans were then told to live by. Europe did not bring light and peace . . . it brought chaos and confusion\\" (quotation from the preface to the Anchor Book of Modern African Short Stories).     At the same time, Achebe showed how some elements from outside the traditional culture, such as Christianity, weren't merely imposed from above but appealed strongly to some of the Igbo, especially those at the bottom of the society, and those who felt the new religion was more powerful. And he showed that the traditional society had its own internal problems and was ready for change. Achebe himself has been quoted as saying, \\"My sympathies were not entirely with Okonkwo . . . . Life just has to go on and if you refuse to accept changes, then, tragic though it may be, you are swept aside\\" (quotation from Under African Skies: Modern African Stories).     The conventional action came almost entirely in the last quarter of the novel, when the encroaching missionaries, together with the trading culture and the colonizers' threat of force, began to overwhelm the village. Although I can't say I identified with the main character even at the end, by then I could better appreciate the loss of the village culture.	2007-06-19

In this fascinating book, three generations of a Nigerian tribal family are ruthlessly displayed. A feeble father grows old and is replaced by his stronger, wealthy son, Okonkwo. Okonkwo's son follows more after his artistic grandfather, although he has never met him. Eventually Okonkwo and his three wives and all his children are banished from their home. When they return nothing is the same. They've heard rumors of the white demons that have invaded their land, but now the strength of the devotion of their fellow native Nigerians is almost overwhelming. The real story is what follows and how the families and tribes work together in a newly developing Christian world. <br /> <br />\\"Things Fall Apart\\" is an amazing story of trial and triumph. It shows the strength of a people that we don't understand. Chinua Achebe is an amazing man who, through his writing, has given an ignorant nation, and world, insight into something that we don't understand. It shows the folly of white missionaries and how they have hurt the societies that they enter. It is an amazing book which everyone should read again and again. <br />	2007-04-25

The plot, with the seven year exile, was a great element to show change to the village, physically, emotionally and spiritually.  I thought the end was not really in line with Okonkwo' character of being a great warrier ... but I suppose dying the way he did was to show how far things had gone, that even a great warrior had given up.

But, unlike the other books, this twists and turns you through a tangled web of the seemingly simple African natives (and their beliefs) and the white man's interpretation and treatment of the same when confronted by \\"progress.\\"<br /><br />Okonkwo, the main character  --  whose manliness would be a leader in a hunter/gatherer world, or in the world of his farming land for annual survival --  is someone you admire and dislike.  His strength is his weakness.  He physicality conquers all challenges delivered to him.  But, coming with his masculine heroics is a personality which commonly beats his spouse(s) and children.<br /><br />His \\"heathen culture's\\" worshipping of many gods and honoring men with polygamist rewards may appear unforgivable to some - especially conservative Christian moralists.  But, as this book succinctly and proficiently explains in narrative fashion how these people honor and worship their social mores, an anthropological analysis compels us to understand that these people hold the basic Judeo-Christian ethic, and have a strong justiciable system which actually surpasses many of those in our own \\"civilized\\" society.<br /><br />The \\"golden rule\\" is the glue in which the village controls the behavior and morals of the inhabitants. The greatest example is the accidental death of a boy caused by the protagonist. Trial? No need. Blame? Not really. Penalty? Absolutely. Seven years of exile from the tribal clan - even though all understand he was not at fault.  While gone, friends tilled his land and delivered his land's profits to he and tenant farmers.  Amount of time for this application of justice: two days.  And,  we have always been taught that our civilized society depicts justiciable efficiency. In contrast, a British judicial ceremony involves the protagonist being heisted and hoodwinked by surreptitious deceit.<br /><br />This book awakened an understanding of the tribe better than any other novel that I have read. The ending, which I will not covey as to do so would ruin the novel's effect, ties it all together.<br /><br />I loved the style of writing. Short, choppy, and full of prophecies. African prophecy often reminds me of American Indian prophecy. Awkward in syntax, their prophecies poignantly and poetically describe solutions to what we perceive to be new issues.  But, the appropriate application of a tribally carried prophecy for hundreds of years only tells us that the issue is not new and that resolution of the same is well known.<br /><br />I can see why this book is highly regarded and can further understand why many colleges or universities require this novel for reading.dwinked by surreptitious deceit.

Usually a fiction book doesn't paint such a historically vivid picture. I think that's what makes the book so special. Besides the intriguing plot, there's so much one can learn about the African culture just by reading this book. However there's a learning curve. Achebe utilizes the diction of the Igbo people in order to make the story less `fictional'. Things Fall Apart is divided into three parts. The first part sets up the backdrop of the story (the customs, people, main characters, etc). The second part center's around Okonkwo's life outside the tribe. And the Three part deals with the coming of the Christian missionaries (white man), and the `conversion' of the Igbo peoples to Christianity.    This book fills in some of the missing history of the colonization of Africa.	2007-03-16

Even though, the main character, Okonkwo, seems to be a mean and a tough guy from the outside; he still holds his passionate beliefs about his own tribe tradition. One thing he might have done immorally wrong is when he kills his step-son, Ikemefuna. But it is not only his fault because the tribe's leaders are involved in wanting to get rid of the boy. Another immoral example is the abandonment of twins. I believe that there is no culture that is better than others, but in this case, killing the innocents is not a moral thing. I do not agree with the tribe tradition of believing in evil sprits in the twins. I think the story is heart touching. Okonkwo who tries to fight for his beliefs and his tribe's values and traditions.

I've read this book because students in my school are forced to read it and I was curious to find out why teenagers do not like to read. Now I understand. I can barely give this book 2 stars. The book is divided in 3 parts, being the first one the longer and more focused on the life of Okonkwo, the main character of this book. As a document to understand the Igbo culture, this may work. As a piece of fiction, a novel, literature, this does not work at all. Achebe is one of the main opponents of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but what Achebe forgets is that Heart of Darkness is still today a classic, one of the best books written in the English language, despite his controversial depiction of the peoples of Congo. When I read a book I want to be told a good story. And a good story is written with words. One must master the art of writing prior to tell us a story. To me, Achebe lacks of that. On the contrary, Conrad is a masterful writer. I also wanted to say that it is a contradiction to me that Achebe chose to write his book in English. If he is so mad at the English who invaded his home land, he should have the pride, courage and integrity to write the book in his own language. If the book was good, it would have been translated. The best thing in this book are the verses from W.B. Yeats at the beginning of the book, from his poem \\"The Second Coming\\". After these four verses, the book has no interest. If I was an English teacher in High School, I would have my students read Conrad instead of Achebe. Perhaps more teenagers would be hooked with reading.	2007-02-07

The author's portrayal of life's economies of separation of duties, family relations and strong men sharing the invigorating cola nut and the eternal responsibility of the head of the family to be the provider for his house and hearth is a classical masterpiece.   In all pre-modern civilizations a marriage is a bonding between clans and family groups - Achebe handled these subjects with style and insight and finesse.   The funeral scene and clamor and mystique around a person of title are vividly described.   Self-exile in case of breaking a tribal taboo is an age-old cultural \\"right thing to do\\" whether it is a Moses the Jew or the Greek philosopher or Okonkwo.    <br /> <br /> Chinua Achebe is through his storytelling describing the overlapping and socio-spatial configurations of a highly developed cultural tradition and economy of life.  Bophelo is a difficult word to translate directly into English but it means something like \\"abundant and healthy and fulfilling life.\\"  Bophelo is conceived as residing in a series of social organisms that constitute society with encompassing social relationships - the person as embedded in the family hierarchy  and simultaneously in a socially constructed geographic space.  Okonkwo's homestead is located in a specific village as part of a wider kinsmen-group.   The village is sustained by an overriding communal spirituality and beliefs.   Okonkwo's personal identity, his being and his wellbeing is inextricably bound up with a particular social and geographic space.  Chinua Achebe is masterly defining context of Okonkwo's identity and social location.  The machismo Okonkwo's life is dominated by anger and apprehension, especially when his oldest son is intrinsically attracted to poetry and storytelling and he wished his daughter to be a boy.  <br /> <br />In Part 3 of Things Fall Apart we see \\"a clash of civilizations\\".  In the story of Okonkwo his whole world starts crumbling when his eldest son Nwoye is extricated from his father's Bophelo.  It is not the faith of the Christians but the poetry of the new religion that has captivated Nwoye.    Not only his eldest son but also other of his village are proselytes of the new faith and the new order.  And this is where things fell apart. <br /> <br />Things Fall Apart is a master piece in the age-old tradition of story telling in the African lore. <br /> <br /> <br />	2007-02-02

The author does not tell us, so we have to look it up. There are also certain things characters in the book does that we don't know why. So knowing the background of African culture will definitely help you understand this book.

But here are my two cents...<br /><br />Achebe's masterful work operates on so many levels that some may find it a confusing or challenging read.  Stick with it.  At the foundational level, the book offers a window into the very heart of a Nigerian tribe, its people, relationships, beliefs and customs.  Layered above the foundation, the story offers a personal connection, with the reader seeing in the protagonist, Okonkwo, one's own faults, strengths and insecurities.  Higher still is the overarching level of the insidious and arrogant invasion of the 'white man'.<br /><br />Achebe interweaves these and a multitude of other layers together to produce a work that is as relevant today as it was when he wrote it as it would have been in the days of Nigerian tribal life.  The folly of expectations of self, one's children, family and 'tribe' are on display to remind each of us of the importance of real values, real love, and living for 'what is', not, what 'should be'.	2007-01-13
US	15943361	RR8FOZH1CNOID	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Collision of Two Cultures	\\"He has put a knife on the things that held us together and we have fallen apart.\\" <br /> <br />An enthralling novel of European colonialism from an African perspective, \\"Things Fall Apart\\" tells the story of the impending imperialism imposed on African tribes from the perspective of an Igbo warrior, Okonkwo, and his family.  The Nigerian author, Achebe, uses simple yet descriptive language to paint his story of life in an African tribe at the onset of colonialism.  Written as a foil to Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" this novel presents the native tribal people in an entirely different light.  Achebe succeeds in showing the native Igbo tribe, not as bloodthirsty savages, but as a noble people whose ultimate goal is a peaceful and harmonious community.  <br /> <br />The epitome of the noble warrior, Okonkwo clings fiercely to the traditions of his ancestors.  Being the son of an &lt;efulefu> (worthless man), Okonkwo works tirelessly to achieve his high status among his clansmen.  He values hard work and despises all things associated with weakness or laziness, for his biggest fear is to end up as his father.  Yet, his indomitable drive to succeed manifests in a violent temper and a malevolence toward all things feminine, for any weak man he considers an &lt;agbala> (woman).  His chauvinistic and misogynistic nature leads to conflict within his family, especially toward his eldest son, Nwoye. <br /> <br />Achebe succeeds in painting a poignant picture of the tribal people as they come to terms with the new colonialists.  At first, the Europeans arrive as missionaries with a benevolent cause.  Indeed, the Christian missionaries are initially presented in a positive light, as the Reverend Brown practices restraint and respect for the native religions as he implores them to become educated, lest they become objects of oppression by the oncoming onslaught of foreigners.  However, his successors are more radical and their contempt and arrogance toward the natives causes much tension.  The colonialists, too, are presented in a balanced manner, as not all tribesman are aghast at this invasion of foreigners.  However, despite their advances in medicine and their pretext of helping the natives, the new wave of colonialists attempt to impose their European laws and customs upon the natives as they attempt to achieve their goal of \\"pacification of the primitive tribes.\\" <br /> <br />Undoubtedly, the most important thread that ties all various tribes together is the reverence for ancestors and the kinship amongst the peoples.  The relationships between family and the elders is of utmost importance, as the breaking of these bonds is sacrilegious.  Although the missionaries may have good intentions, it is Christianity more than the armed colonial soldiers that inflicts the most damage upon their way of life.  For Christians, the bond between one's self and God, as the Father, is the most important, as believers are \\"brothers in Christ.\\"  Yet, for the Igbo, if one is to become a Christian, then one must break the kinship bonds and reject the beliefs of the ancestors.  Christianity is the \\"knife\\" that cuts these bonds and causes their traditional society to \\"fall apart.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, Achebe succeeds in showing the aspects and beliefs of the Igbo in a sympathetic, yet realistic nature.  Although some traditions are barbaric by any reasonable standard, such as leaving newborn twins in the forest to die, Achebe succeeds in dispelling the common myth of the natives as ruthless savages that must be tamed, like wild animals.  This is an enlightening novel and was a delight to read.	2007-01-08

Okonkwo is the tragic hero or anti-hero of this novel.  He is a man ruled by his fears, especially the fear of looking weak or effeminate.  In response he rules his family with an iron hand, is violent and inpetuous.  Even before the colonizers appeared, Okonkwo had already violated the mores of his community several times, sinning against the earth goddess by beating his wife during Peace week, shedding innocent blood with the slaying of Ikemefuna, who had become somewhat of a foster son, and brother figure to Nwoye, Okonkwo's son whom he views as effeminate and weak.  When Okonkwo tragically commits manslaughter, he and his family are forced into exile.  He loses his prominent place in the clan and has to go to his mother's village for seven years.  While there, he fumes about his lost social position and vows to regain it as a true warrior when he returns to his village.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Okonkwo disdains his eldest son Nwoye who undergoes many beatings and punishments for not meeting up to his father's rigourous standards on manhood.  Nwoye is a gentle soul and was very attached to Ikemefuna, a captive from another tribe who is entrusted to Okonkwo.  When the Christian missionaries arrived, Nwoye is drawn to them, especially because they appeal to the weak, downtrodden, despised and oppressed.  In the Christian community, all are brothers and sisters in Christ, with no regard to rank, clan, caste.  Many titleless outcasts, or worthless men and women were drawn to the missionaries and accepted.  Of course this made Okonkwo despise them even more, as a womanly clan, and he is extremely displeased upon finding out the Nwoye has converted to Christianity, choking him in the neck until Nwoye's uncle intervenes.<br /><br />Okonkwo vows to get revenge on the Christians and waits for an opportunity to prove himself as a strong warrior again.  Tragically for everyone involved, the church is burned down, after one of the zealous converts unmasks an egwugwu (a man portraying an ancestral spirit) during a ceremony.  Now Okonkwo has an opportunity, and puts on his warrior's dress when the messengers come from the court.  Unfortunately for Okonkwo he acts impulsively and slays the first messenger.  Knowing there is no way out, he hangs himself and again commits sin against the traditional Igbo earth goddess.  So even though Okonkwo is fighting against outside influences and trying to preserve his way of life, he constantly transgresses the boundaries of behavior as defined by his own cultural traditional.<br /><br />The only hope that is offered in this sad story is that Nwoye eventually converts all his brothers and sisters and Okonkwo's widows.  This was mentioned parenthetically in the chapter dealing with Nwoye's conversion.  After Okonkwo's death by ultimate sin, the family must have fallen to a very low status, or become outcasts, the very worthless men and women that Okonkwo looked down on.  Ironically, Okonkwo's acts caused his remaining family to gain great hope and promise, no doubt under the gentle loving leadership of Nwoye, the son he never appreciated.elf as a strong warrior again.

It shows how people's belief systems are such, that if a culture is completely unlike our own, we feel that we must change it. This book creates a dramatic example of causing more harm than good when missionaries work to change a civilization.

I read this book for a graduate class and thought it was nothing short of spectacular. What I find interesting is that Achebe's book is taught to freshmen at the high school I work at and the majority of the students I have talked to find it unremarkable. This is what follows when one fails to read into the complexities that are imbedded in (what could be construed as) a simply written text.<br />This novel is not only a cautionary tale on the dangers of hubris, but a reiteration of the devastation brought on to \\"more primitive\\" cultures by the imperial (white) powers. Of course, the context of this novel could easily be superimposed onto current times in its ability to show the need for a more dominant culture to force its value system in a place where a people have gotten along just fine without it.<br />I am very, very glad I read this book and I certainly plan to read more of Achebe's work in the future. I think there are infinite wisdoms to be gained by reading such an obviously insightful author. What's more, this book is a page turner in every sense of the word--it is inherently didactic and wildly entertaining simultaneously. I ask you, what more could a reader want?	2006-11-04

What is unusual is that this book is actually written by an african.  Most fiction that deals with tribal africa is actually written not by africans but by european or american novelists.   <br /> <br />Achebe trys to show the african charecters in a realistic light.  Very flawed but heroic in thier own way.  He does not reduce his africans into victimized but nobel cartoon charecters who embody some mysterious but profound primitive enlightenment that eludes us dense and insensitive westerners.  Instead of showing the christians as some racist and overbearing outsiders he also shows them as flawed but dedicated.   <br /> <br />To be frank I find it a refreshing alternative to all the self-loathing white literature written about Africa.	2006-10-25

This is especially true for those in political leadership positions. Things Fall Apart, by Chinua Achebe, is one such book. <br /> <br />I learned about Things Fall Apart for the first time recently on somebody's blog. I picked it up from the library two days ago and finished it today. <br /> <br />Things Fall Apart is the story of Okonkwo, a leader in the village of Umuofia in Nigeria. The story is told from the point of view that the Ibo culture of Okonkwo's people. This culture is profoundly different from that of 21st Century America. A significant part of this book is spent establishing the culture and society for the reader. <br /> <br />In the first part of the book, the cultural constructs hold the society together, even though things fall apart on occasion on a personal level for Okonkwo and others in the book. But things fall apart for the culture as a whole as a result of the arrival of Christian missionaries and British colonial rulers. The story of how this happens to Okonkwo and his village is told in a simple, accessible, but gripping way. <br /> <br />If you read this book, do NOT use the speed reading technique of reading the end first. Just read it through, and will find that the very last paragraph provides the exclamation point that makes this book's message so important.	2006-10-01

The reader both admires and despises Okonkwo, the main character, who is charismatic and intelligent, but also selfish and unspeakably cruel.  Traditional life in Nigeria seems isolated and timeless, though politically, at the time of the story, Nigeria is a British colony on the verge of independence.<br /><br />The novel is easy to read, and manageably short, but deserves a second reading to reveal its many levels of symbolism and meaning.<br /><br />A great work.	2006-09-28

This is a story about being who you were meant to be, about becoming blind from trying too hard not to be a certain way. Achebe wrote this because there was so much literature representing African people in a misunderstood way, to say the least, so he set out to write a genuine and real tale of the way of life in Africa. It's tough to read at times, there's sad moments. The characters are deep and intriguing. Although they are not perfect, I understand their decisions. It's also about equality, about doing things 100%, and standing up for what you believe in. Aside from being a tale about all these things, there's lots of culture and tradition woven into the lines, and while learning a thing or two about life, you'll also find out interesting facts about the life of the tribe described in the book.	2006-08-20

But I read for enjoyment, and so I opened this book up to see what it had to offer me. I was rewarded with a very thought-provoking story. I should say here that I attend a Christian college associated with the 'missionary' denomination, and books that challenge the missionaries' ethics and purpose are handled very carefully by the faculty. Because I spent three months in Africa and because I have been on missions trips, Achebe's tale spoke directly to me about the way that we as Christians tend to handle the people that we are supposedly 'evangelizing'. I do not call myself a missionary by any definition of the word, but 'Things Fall Apart' was an eye-opener to the way that we treat people who are different regardles of how we may feel about them.	2006-07-12

The story consists of the tribes of lower Nigeria couping with what happens when the white missonaries enter their land.  The story was engrossing in points, in part, because of the rich the culture the tribes bring to the book.  The book is filled with numerous fables, and facts from the tribes of lower Nigeria.

He has little side storeis throughout the book. <br /> <br />For example: Why the turtles shell is cracked. He wanted to go to a feast up in the sky, so each of the birds around him gave him one feather, he flew into the sky and ate all of the good food at a feast. He renamed him self \\"ALl of you\\" so when he asked the cook who the food was for he said \\"All of you\\" The birds were so angry that they took each of their feathers back, and left him in the sky. He told one bird to tell the turtles wife to leave out all of the soft things in the house so that when he jumped out of the sky, he woud land safley. The bird tells the wife to put out all of the hard things, so when he jumps his shell cracks. <br /> <br />He does this throught the book. <br />He shows how the yam, represents power, and wealth. <br /> <br />He shows how much a society can change once religion is introduced.  <br /> <br />There are also many beating in this book, and a few killings.  <br /> <br />This is an amazing book, that everyone should read. <br /> <br />highly reccomended	2006-07-04
US	48135836	R1JPD040KLIVHZ	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Bittersweet	_Things Fall Apart_ is the story of European colonialism from an African's perspective, and as the title implies, there is no happy ending.  Nonetheless, it is a fascinating glimpse into the antithesis of Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_.<br /><br />It is the story of Onknowo, an Ibo warrior who worked hard to be a success within his village, and the gradual, tragic destruction of his world.  Some of this is the result of matters beyond his control; some of this is the result of flaws within his own character; and of course, some of this \\"falling apart\\" is the result of the incursion of Europeans.  Okonkwo's story is a microcosom of the entire continent.  That \\"white people\\" are not exclusively (nor immeadiately) blamed for the wrongs that are done to the main character is indicitive of the larger issues facing modern Africa.  Yes, colonialism is responsible for many of Africa's problems.  But many of Africa's problems are the result of the actions of Africans themselves.<br /><br />For some, the frequent use of Ibo words may be a challenge - I was fortunate enough in my copy to have a glossary included to help with that.  For others, the vivid description of West African culture may be difficult - I found it refreshing and very interesting.<br /><br />It is a short read (my edition was less than 150 pages), but very worthwhile.  Highly recommended.	2006-07-03

The Africans have a reasonably civilized society that has been in place for more years than anyone can remember. It is a very static, subsistent one but there are many traditions and the people seem to live happily. <br /> <br />True, the men rule and the women and children are almost like chatal, but there is also a freedom and respect among the sexes.  Once again colonialism raises its' ugly head.  What makes this story interesting is the view of how Christianization takes place.   <br /> <br />Originally, the man who comes to the village to evangelize the natives (for the Anglican church) is a wise man and understands that people need to have their traditions respected.  Not all are but mostly the change is slow and the leaders of the village are given time to get used to the changes. <br /> <br />As always, the next man is a fire breather and he disrupts everything.  He treats people like animals.  Leaders are disrespected and the most disreputable men are given power as long as they cow-tow to the party line.   <br /> <br />In the end, we all know the ending, the Colonial government will win; because of superior firepower and the use of native traitors, who are worse than their bosses.  But the people are shown to have strength and not just give in as is the case in most Euro-Centric written histories.	2006-06-15

For the first 100 pages, Achebe has given his people (he was born in Nigeria with an Ibo background) back their history, reclaiming the Nigerian identity: far from Joseph Conrad's Africans in 'Heart Of Darkness' (quaint, godless, ignorant black people with long limbs and scary, rolling eyes) Achebe presents a culture of depth, traditions and parables that rival any Christian's in complexity, and people with unique personalities and (sometimes unpredictable) reactions. I almost screamed in disbelief when someone complained Achebe was being \\"biased\\" against white people: when you're describing the subjugation of a race, you don't qualify yourself with an \\"Oh well, I'm sure the white man thought he knew what was best for us,\\" or a \\"Really, we black folks had it coming anyway.\\" <br /> <br />And the final chapter: if such a thing as genius exists, it is here. Throughout Achebe has claimed the English language for himself, infusing it with an African-ness that sets it completely aside from an Englishman's prose. Yet the style of the last chapter is unmistakably English, could even have been lifted from 'Heart of Darkness'. Achebe shows WITHIN THE TEXT how the voice of the white colonisers silences, represses, and denies the voice of the colonised. The greatest evil done to Africa, Achebe argues, is that it was not allowed to tell its own story; that robbing people of their voice is the absolute oppression, and absolute enslavment.	2006-03-15

It had an interesting point, though most certainly a biased one and it presented its underlying theme well. The writing style was a little bit simplistic at times, but that was okay. On the other hand though, the book was clearly hard for me to connect with at times, seeing as it's about the \\"Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger\\" as told not from the colonist's point of view, but from those that are being colonized. <br />The book moved quickly. This was especially nice for me as I came to the sudden realization the day before the book was due that I'd accidentally been reading Things They Carried, my bad. So I was able to sit and read the bulk of it in three hours. This was made possible by its simplicity, both in its not so hidden meaning, easy to understand description, and sentence structure. A simple sentence structure can either speed the book up, as it did in this case, or it can slow the book way down much like it did with Hemmingway in almost all of his works. I think the disparity that exists between the two here relies solely upon underlying complexity. With Achebe in Things Fall Apart, the book can be read once, can be looked back upon, and then understood. No ifs ands or buts about it. On the other hand with Hemmingway, there are many layers within the writing requiring a slow and careful reading and re-reading style. Given the choice between the two, I'd go with Achebe. <br />The content of the book was clearly something that the author could relate too although I have my doubts that this is an unbiased source. In future journals I'll discuss specifics of this but for now I'm going to leave the statement as is. His point comes across, and while I certainly don't think that his novel should have spent equal time examining the colonization from the white man's point of view, in not doing so he does show a bias. <br />Despite the bias, which I didn't necessarily find bad, I found Things Fall Apart tobe an enjoyable quick read that actually had a point to it, a rarity in this day and age.	2006-03-06
US	11488644	R1SDFUVAOCB0Z7	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	5	4	4	N	N	The Right to Change	Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart concentrates on the effects of colonialism. His novel invokes the question of whether it is justified for one culture to impose their beliefs on another culture because they have a different set of morals and values. <br />Achebe's novel illustrates the response of an African tribe to the invasion by white Christian missionaries. The Ibo tribe has many problems deeply rooted in its culture. For one, the tribe is very sexist. The main character and the leader of the tribe, Okonkwo, holds a very high reverence for male dominance and his belief that \\"no matter how prosperous a man was, if he was unable to rule his women and his children (and especially his women) he was not really a man\\" (53). Okonkwo also has several wives in which he rules \\"with a heavy hand\\" (13). For Christians, polygamy is morally wrong. This is where Achebe asks the question of whether the missionaries' intent to change the tribe's culture is justified. It's a very difficult question to answer but in my opinion, Achebe seems to say no. At one point Uchendu says in response to Obierka, \\"the world has no end, and what is good among one people is an abomination with other. We have albinos among us. Do you not think that they have strayed from their way to a land where everybody is like them\\" (141). From this, I interpret that Achebe believes that there is no point in trying to conform every culture to be like your own because the world is so massive and so diverse that it would be impossible to convert everyone to one uniform culture and in attempting to do so, there will only be bloodshed. Although I found the novel to be slow at first, over time my respect for Achebe has increased as I find myself referring back to this question of humanity and where my beliefs side.	2006-03-05

I immediately fell in love with the book because I could relate a lot with tribal life in my village and the various forces that were impacting on it. The customs, rituals and beliefs were very similar. The impact of white missionaries on the lives of people in my village was also very powerful and caused a lot of clashes with the local people's way of life. Things all around us were changing, exposing the fragility of our culture, resulting in inevitable conflicts.<br /><br />The main character, Okonkwo, was a respected and powerful village hero. However, as we progress with reading the book, he is struck with tragedies which ultimately consume him because of his inability to cope with change. This book had a profound influence on me and made me appreciate the intellectual talent within the continent.<br /><br />The book is a must read for people on the African continent where strong traditional beliefs still have a firm hold in a time of breathtaking changes wrought about by the unstoppable globalization process. The ability of African people to stop or significantly influence the pace, direction and extend of change is very limited. The tragedies that befell Okonkwo are continuing but in different forms on the continent. This is largely due to the failure to adapt to change and failure to appreciate that, however much we firmly hold and justify some of our beliefs, we cannot force others to agree with us and if we try, we will fail anyway.<br /><br />An important lesson from this book is the echoing of Charles Darwin's conclusion that it is not the strongest of the species or the most intelligent that will survive in a changing environment, but those species that can best adapt to change.	2006-02-05

This book opens the mind to other cultures. Yes, I don't necessarily agree that drinking palm-wine out of a human head (of the human you killed) is good, but that's because it's a different culture. They would think it's weird for us not to; they would think our customs are strange. But this book really made me think about this man, Okonkwo, and what he would do for his interpretation of his image. I do agree that you don't have sympathy for this character but I don't think you always have to like the characters in the books you are reading. I did have sympathy and felt for his family though. It's not about the character himself, it's about his journey. I enjoyed this book and I read it for the plain fact that I found it on a greatest books of all time list. I cried during this book. Most books can't get me to cry because it's either not descriptive enough or I'm just not emotionally attached in the book; but this book I felt a connection to. I also found it really easy to read. Yes, there are strange names that I still don't know how to pronounce. Mainly, I think I took away something good from this book and that's what I had hoped for. So, if you want to learn about another culture and have a book question you and your emotions and beliefs, then by all means, read this book. It's amazing.	2005-11-11

It is about Okonwkwo, a self made man, who would rather die than bend. I read this book in an English class in college and was surprised to see that many of my non-African colleagues made value judgements about Okonkwo and the tribal belief systems. In my view, Achebe suceeds in presenting a fair account of life in an Ibo village. He did not try to sugarcoat it, told it as it was in the good old days. Any infusion of value judgements completely misses the mark. No one could have told a tale about the clash of cultures better than Achebe did in Things Fall Apart.	2005-10-31

I wondered if I missed the point so decided to check out what others thought about it.  Seems like many experienced this book as a profound and gut wrenching story of the destruction of a way of life.  No doubt it is, but Achebe's ambiguous rendering of it left me with mixed feelings.  I now believe this is his intent, and the genius of the story.   This is not some sob story about the destruction of the noble savage, nor does it show, as some have written, that the imperialists are \\"better\\" than the backward Africans.  (These are the folks that actually missed the point.)  This story is simply about things falling apart, which is what they tend to do.  Achebe leaves the judging and moralizing to the reader, but I think I'll not commit that sin. I wondered why I am so uncomfortable with ambiguity when that is actually the way everything unfolds... or falls apart.  This book is good because it approaches the truth rather than attempting to package it for us.	2005-10-16

I graduated college 2 years ago, but this book is so awful that I felt obligated to come back and review it.  <br /> <br />First I will admit that there are positive points to the book- it has a very coherent structure and manages to go into a lot of detail about african culture without losing the plot on unrelated tangents.  <br /> <br />But there is something so overwhelmingly negative about this book that none of the well done novelistic elements can overcome. Anyone with sense would be rooting for the imperialists by the end of this book. This is what everyone in my high school class did and most of the kids in my college class as well. Okonkwo and his tribe leaders basically believe in santimoniously violating everyone's human rights aside from powerful landowning males. The women are beaten, the children have few choices in how to live their lives, there is a caste of outcasts that is not allowed to better themselves and unwanted children are left to starve to death when there is absolutely nothing defective about them. This story chronicles how a) Okonkwo's gentle and music loving father was considered a failure in the culture while Okonkwo who is brutal and despotic is largely a success. b) Okonkwo's son's conversion to christianity is shown to be a sincere leaning that he develops after years of feeling guilty about what *he himself* sees as tribal barbarism- abandoning of twins etc. It was not something forced on him, it was something that he freely chose out of open minded ethical thought. When the western christians come, the outcasts are allowed to behave as normal respected people, superstitions about evil spirits in the forests are proven to be false and technology such as bicycles are introduced to the people.  <br /> <br />Sorry folks- the imperialists are the good guys in this book. Things fall apart in Okonkwo's culture, but good riddance to such barbarism anyways! All this book shows is a detailed explanation of how imperialists brought progress and humanity to Nigerian savages. <br /> <br />The thing is, it is possible to paint a culture with all its flaws and bigotries and still build sympathy for it. Pearl S Buck really makes one feel for the main character's attachment to his land and his ambitions in the good earth even though he also is a prideful sexist classist man. Achebe does not in any way build sympathy for the main character or his culture and the majority of readers in HS or college will feel that way as well.	2005-10-05

The story of Okonkwo as he endured the trials of colonial changes and the rigors of his own tribal culture is one that has meaning for everyone because we all encounter and are forced to deal with trials and changes that we have no control over.  This book also vividly describes the great injustices that colonialism forced on many primitive cultures.  It does all this with a very even hand:  Okonkwo's village life is not portrayed as an idyllic Eden, but as a harsh and often cruel culture that will appall most readers.  Okonkwo, himself, is not the sympathetic victim we expect him to be.  In fact he would be considered a cruel monster by our standards. Yet, because of his dedication to his culture and tribe, and his complete lack of comprehension of anything foreign to that way of life, we are able to understand and feel what he feels.  His experiences, in certain ways, are metaphors of our own lives as we, with all our imperfections, deal the forces of change that are beyond our control.	2005-08-07

It's a really easy read and it completely sucked me in. I found myself reading ahead and finishing it way ahead of the class. The book is quite fascinating about life in Nigeria. The book centers around a man named Okonkwo who goes from being a highly respected warior to a murderer and an exhiled man. It shows his descent from a powerful and respected man to a sad and tormented man. It also shows the war between the whites and the blacks. The whites bring their religion to impose on the blacks and there is an awful war between them. The story is sad and tragic and shows a downfall of a man as well as a war and how this man must lead his people into victory.  <br />I agree with another reviewer that this book does bring great class discussions that I enjoyed participating in. So, if you have the opportunity to read this gem in class, then enjoy or else get it on your own to read it.	2005-07-22

Yeats as I recognize that you took your title from \\"The Second Coming.\\" A more complete quote: Things fall apart / the center will not hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. Your ending came as a surprise and is perfect offering as it does an alternative title for your work, \\"The pacification of the primitive tribes of the lower Niger.\\" What impact that new title has for a political novel! Let me evaluate your book according to an essay by Wallace Stevens \\"Notes for a Supreme Fiction.\\" Stevens claims fiction should provide three things: pleasure, abstraction, and change. The story and the ease of reading your short sentences provided pleasure. The abstract ideas abound and come to the reader like the snows of winter piling up one on another. Or do the ideas blow across the page the way the harmattan blows across West Africa? Through the eyes of Okonkwo I experience and learn about the human condition as reflected in the culture of the (your?) Ibo tribe. Their money is cowries, their drug the kola nut, their religion spiritism, but the humanity remains clear and strong. In fact, their morality exceeds that of the British although that fact is never stated, just shown. The changes are enormous: The major character dies, the tribe breaks up, and the land falls into the hands of the enemy. By these Wallace Stevens standards, I believe you have written a perfect novel - A+.	2005-06-17

I subsequently found out that it is widely used in highschools, colleges and universitites.  I have to admit that ordering the Cliff Notes along with the book was a wise decision and you can note from my many other reviews on Amazon that I am a sophisticated reader.  THINGS FALL APART is not always easy to follow.  Reading the Cliff Notes along with the book helped me with some of the underlying meanings and also verified that I had to correct understanding of some of the situations.<br /><br />I believe that if there is one major theme in the book, its the clash of cultures. We as westerners always identify with the westerners who make first contact with people of other cultures.  As a result it hard to identify with other cultures. THINGS FALL APART gives you that chance to understand other religions and how other people life.  But it also gives you the opportunity to think about basic concepts of right and wrong.  While the book takes place in Africa, the situations can be compared to other religions and other clashes of culture.<br /><br />At first glance we think it absurd for the tribe to blindly follow the word of the oracles.  But then think of situations in other religions and other times when people blindly followed the directions of a dictator or religious leaders.  The bottom line is that there is much room for discussion in this book.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that a few students wrote reviews of this book panning it.  Apparently they did only did a superficial reading of the book.  Or possibly did not get a good background lecture from their teachers.<br /><br />This would be a great book for discussion in a book club.  It is for the serious reader.  It makes the reader reflect on his or her own life and culture and wonder what decisions you would make if faced with the same situation.  Are there basic concepts of right and wrong that go beyond the demands of culture? Did Okonkwo's failure come about as a result of his going against those basic conflicts?  Read the book and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Although this is a book about early contact between Europeans and primitive African peoples it is not about first contact.  You will note that Okonkwo, has a gun which he obviously got from a European.  That gun contributes significantly to his down fall.  A good topic for discussion is the influence of guns in the story.'s failure come about as a result of his going against those basic conflicts?

His struggles in life lead him to a devistating conclusion.  The genre of this book is postcolonial critique, which basically means this book is a tragedy.  It seems to me that Achebe wrote this novel for audiences between middle school ages to people that are mature of older ages.  This book was written in past tense.  The time was set in the 1890's.  The setting was in the lower Nigerian Villages. <br />The major conflict of this novel is the conflict between the traditional society of Umuofia and the new customs brought by the new white government.  Okonkwo also struggles to be as different from his father as possile.  He feels that his father was a weak human being.  He is afraid of his son following in his fathers foot steps.   <br />The rising action was Okonkwo's murder.  The falling action was when the villagers allow the white government's people to escape also when Okonkwo realizes the weaknesses of the tribe he has tried to establish. <br />This book could very well become a classic.  It strives upon the earlier traditions and the new customs of the white government.  I think this book is very good!  It teaches readers of all ages a lot about the struggles of new beginnings.	2005-04-25

However, I want to thank the reviewer who noted that in high school he or she did not appreciate the book as much as they did in college. I could see someone in high school being turned off by the book, particularly if they were not taught about Achebe's own intentions in creating the book's plot and characters.  <br /> <br />For one thing, some reviewers seem not to understand that Achebe is not endorsing some of Okonkwo's character traits and see Okonkwo as some kind of chauvinistic cultural ideal of the pre-colonial African man. Rather, as Achebe has often said in interviews and essays, Okonkwo, and the entire portrait of his village was evoked to show both the beauty-and the flaws-of pre-colonial African society. As in all human societies, injustices were perpetrated.  <br /> <br />Okonkwo, then, is someone Achebe feels for-and wants us to feel for-but who he feels is tragic due to his rigidity and other problems. He is not intended to be a figure for emulation at all. Indeed, at times Achebe demonstrates the narrowness of Okonkwo's thought and the reality that other cultural models of masculine behavior existed in Ibo society at the time. For instance, Okonkwo is shocked when he hears one of his friends note that a great Ibo village leader has died and that the man would never do anything without first consulting his wife. Confronted with the fact that not everyone took the narrow view of male/female relationships he did, Okonkwo shows incredulity. Achebe shows with carefully crafted, elegant and subtle language that Okonkwo has become so wedded to one vision of Ibo cultural identity that ultimately any change introduced into that society destroys him. He clings to one vision of masculinity in order to feel he has lived a life opposite to that of his father, who had a completely different disposition but died in poverty. <br /> <br />Some readers don't like the book, therefore, because they confuse Achebe's sympathy with Okonkwo for his endorsement of Okonkwo's behavior, which is completely different. That does not allieviate the pain we feel when Okonkwo is defeated by a society that refuses to acknowledge that the Ibo have a great history and society and demands he conform to the Western encroachment. When Okonkwo feels his society is so degraded that it can no longer exist he can no longer exist, either. Achebe knew that a cultural purist could not survive under colonialism, so he treats the case with deliberate ambiguity. We are as upset as Okonkwo's friend when he dies (I cried for days) and furious at the petty and ignorant summary the Englishman expresses at his death, his dispassionate arrogance that mistakes Okonkwo's national pride for some \\"primitive\\" superstition, but at the same time we know he couldn't have survived in a new world and he could not accomodate change, something Achebe thought was dangerous. <br /> <br />Achebe once said that if he could convince his fellow Africans through his novels that their history had not been \\"one long dark night\\" but rather a rich and complex tapestry of sophisticated cultural, religious, and artistic expressions he would have succeeded at his goal. He certainly succeeded-although precolonial Africa had many kingdoms, the Ibo were supposedly without a leader and therefore people assumed it meant that they were a \\"disorganized tribe\\". However Achebe's book demonstrates the meaning, internal organization, poetry, ritual, and traditions that all human societies have and this book, which shows a world of beauty gone forever, fulfills Achebe's noble goal of wanting to demonstrate the validity of African history and does so more than many history books I have read.  Those history books are accurate, of course, but although they demonstrate what Achebe does they often do not pull you in emotionally, which is far more effective and I believe that is why everyone should read this book-perhaps not in high school, however.  I don't know, I didn't have it assigned to me then, so I don't know if I would have appreciated its nuances as a teenager.  But it's not worth alienating people who might otherwise pick it up.  For adults, it's a read you can't put down and a work of singular beauty.  FOR ADULTS IT IS NOT A DIFFICULT READ: I don't want anyone to get turned off by those who said it was, or to assume that it will be dense, hard to get through, or anything like that-its simple but potent language is one of its most amazing qualities. <br /> <br />It is the classic of the African continent, a tragic book that will lead any reader into a deeper understanding of colonialism, the colonial lie about \\"peoples without history\\",and Africa. Its richly rendered scenes are also some of the best written in the English language. <br /> <br />Read this book, it will change your life!  (For the better). <br />  <br />	2005-04-20

Most of the novel sets Okonkwo's issues apart and is focused in how the rites, ceremonies, marriages and feasts of the Umuofia village are being prepared. Anyone looking great Fiction entertainment, great characters and memorable conflicts should be dissapointed. On the other hand, some Historians or Anthropologists might find it resourceful of the lives in Nigeria's thribes before Colonialism.	2005-03-24

I have used this text at the college level, and find that readers of all abilities get something from it.  Because of the rare English dialect of Achebe, lower level readers will need guidance, but they can still get through it.  At the higher levels, the subtle and brilliant symbolism and tragic irony that fills the pages will keep advanced readers pondering beyond whatever class time is devoted to the book.  Naturally, background schema concerning the life lived in West Africa is very helpful regardless of reading level, and so I have put my stills and videos from my travels to the region to great use in presenting this novel.  And yet, the basic human tragedy presented needs no additional preparation.  Achebe's character Okonkwo is not unlike many a Shakespearian figure--an action figure with tragic flaws in character.  These are timeless aspects of personal and interpersonal relations which are cause for discussion in any setting.  To add to this complexity of tribal and timeless character is the dual audience that Achebe addresses.  His satrical style regarding Christian and Animist dogma cuts both ways--attacking both European and West African sensibilities.  As a result, the message is manifold in its classic effect.	2005-03-24

A story about an African village did not seem <br />to fit into our curriculum, or interest me. <br />Nevertheless, I began to read it. At first the book <br />seemed very boring to me. Now that I've read the book <br />I know that you have to read the entire book to <br />comprehend the lesson it was trying to teach. Reading <br />the first 8 chapters and then giving up is a waste of <br />your time. Reading the whole book is reading time well <br />spent.  <br />    The book focuses mainly on the character Okonkwo <br />and his struggles. He feels guilty for his father's <br />laziness and vowes not to be like him. This does not <br />make him the most personable of people however. The <br />plot really only starts in the end. The beginning <br />chapters really all have different things happening. <br />This is really the only fault I found of the book. <br />Some say that the difficult names are a fault but they <br />aren't. The names make the book more authentic.  <br />    The book ties in with my school curriculum due to <br />the Ibo people's dealings with imperialism. I believe <br />imerialism had a devastating effect on the Ibo's. When <br />the white missionaries came to the villages, they <br />disrupted their whole wway of life. They disrespected <br />the faith and customs of the Ibo's, callin their God's <br />fake. Through their preaching, the missionaries got <br />many Ibo's to convert which caused anger between <br />members of the Ibo clan. The imperialists even caused <br />the main character, Okonkwo, to do something that is <br />very 'evil spirited'. Okonkwo had been strong to his <br />faith throughout the book but they forced him into <br />doing the unthinkable.  <br /> <br />'Things Fall Apart' while confusing at times is a <br />great read <br />	2005-03-01

His village worships many gods and has many traditions. During the story Okonkwo comes across many prblems. During one celebration he accidentally kills a young boy and is exiled to his motherland for seven years. When he comes back he realizes that his village is being taken over and being influence by the white men. The white men cause many to convert to their religion and cause problems with the vilage. Eventually Ookonkwo cannot take it anymore and he tries to stop these men from destroying his village. <br /> <br />I think imperialism did hurt the Africans because it caused them to fall apart. The imperialists came to those tribes and destroyed them. When they came many people realized that their beliefs were false and they decided to conert to the Europeans religion. This caused a lot of bad blood between the tribe members which resulted in death or injury. <br /> <br />I gave this book four stars because it was interesting and exciting which i like in a book and it was also an easy read. But it only got four stars because the parts that were not interesting were just plain and boring. Also the ending with Okonkwo doing what he did was dumb in my opinion and it ruined the book in a way. I think the endng should be different. Also the names that were involved in the book were hard to remember and keep track of and they eventually caused the book to be really confusing.	2005-02-28

I think this for many reasons, one being it turned the Ibo people against each other. Anther reason is imperialsim totally destroyed there culture, the Ibo people now lived under worry about there religion and not as they had for many many years. <br />  An exaple is when okwonko was driven so far that he killed himself. Because his people were being ruined he went as far to kill himself.Another example is the fight between the Ibo people who wanted to stay a tribe and the Ibo people we wanted to go along with the imperialism and not fight it.  <br />  All and all imperialism in my mind a very negative spin on the Ibo people and other tribes. Although who knows what africa would be like today without imperialism, it had to happen evenually its just a human instict to improve and to get as much power u can get by taking advantage of others	2005-02-28

The tribe, called Ibo, is harmed the the imperialism more that helped. And i gave this 3 stars because it helped me realize what they went through but it was a sort of difficult read because of the funny names. <br /> <br />In a way the imperialism turned them against themselves. They would be shifted from beliving in their own religion into Christianity. They were violently murdered by settlers and they also were deprived of their Ematation of God.  It also led to one of them commiting suicide. Okonkwo killed himself because a white settler was killed by a member of the Abame tribe. So overall, Imperialism caused people to die and peoples religions to change. <br /> <br />In all, this book made me really start to think about what life was like back then. I never really thought about it until now. I would advise any knid of history buffs to pick this one up. Its a good read. This is Deron, signing off.	2005-02-28

For instance yams are of very high importance in the village, they even have yam festivals.  Some of their beliefs seem strange, such as the belief in digging up a stone to cure an ogbanje, a dead child who returns to the other to be reborn.  Others seem to coincide with our own laws, such as punishment for murder and distinction between murder and manslaughter.  The main character, Okonkwo, accidentally commits murder and so he and his family are banished from the clan for seven years.  After his banishment the \\"white men\\" come to his village.  They are Christians who come with churches to try and convert the \\"heathens\\", but they also come with guns.   <br /> <br /> While the beginning of the book focused mainly on the many rituals of the clan, its was still quite interesting to read.  Many of their ways seemed to coincide with ours.  The way to treat iba, the fever, was to use medicinal steam and today the same idea is used in Vicks humidifiers.  Of course other remedies seem stranger, like digging up a rock to cure constant miscarriage, which surprisingly worked.  It seemed the whole beginning half of the book was to slowly pull you into the story and have you feel you were part of the village.  Around the fifteenth chapter the book begins to talk about the \\"white men\\" and the attempts the early church made to gain followers.  This was the most exciting part of the book, especially the unrest in the villages building up until the people find that they must determine what to do now. <br /> <br /> Outside of the book I would immediately say that imperialism hurt the Africans.  However \\"Things Fall Apart\\" seems to portray other sides of imperealism.  The District Commisioner and his aides seem as mean and horrible as you would expect them to be.  Yet the missionaries seem much more .  For instance Mr. Kiaga accepts osu, or outcasts, into the church and Mr. Brown sat with villagers to learn about their Gods and traditions.  Even when the villagers assaulted some of the converts, the missionaries told them to be patient and not fight back.  Aside from the ultimate suicide of Okonkwo, imperialism overall helped the people of Ibo.	2005-02-28

Imperialism of southern Africa hurt the Ibo people because it changed their ways when they didn't need change.   <br /> Imperialism hurt the Ibo people for three main reasons.  First, when the Ibo people had a strong religion of their own, Christians came and converted some of the tribe.  This then, turned the converted people against the others causing outbreaks.  Next, the white men slaughtered a neighboring village of the Ibo using \\"iron horses.\\"  This brought the Ibo people to fear that wasn't necessary.  Finally, the main character, Okonkwo, was banned from his village after a gun accident.  If the white people had not introduced guns to the Ibos, this wouldn't have happened.     <br /> Overall, when the European people imperialized Africa, the ruined the perfectly good lives of perfectly good people.  They treated the Africans like they weren't people and ruined their lives for sport.  This imperialism shouldn't have happened and many innocent people were hurt or killed because of it. <br />	2005-02-28

It wasn't one of the best books i've ever read nor one of the worst books I ever read. It does have some qualities, themes, and lessons that are important however. One theme is the struggle between tradition and change. This is shown the Okonkwo, the main character, and his village trying to hold onto their traditions in the face of rising conflicts and change with the white men, their government, and the church that is started near their village. Another is the view on masculinity which is shown by Okonkwo and his struggle to be different from his lazy neglectful father. He then tries to teach his son his ideas yet they don't take route. This ends up in beatings from Okonkwo to his children and wives because of his stress. Even though this book was not interesting (to me at least) it does contain many important lessons and themes as mentioned above.	2005-02-28

The book shows  <br /> <br />how the English government along with the English missionaries fracture the Ibo tribe in  <br /> <br />England's quest to bring civilization to Africa. This is depicted in the way that Okonkwo,  <br /> <br />a member of the Ibo tribe, is affected and treated by the English government.  <br />  <br /> Imperialism by definition is the domination by one country of the political,  <br /> <br />economic, or cultural life of another region. Imperialism in the story is harmful to the Ibo  <br /> <br />people. In the story missionaries supported by the English government create a split in  <br /> <br />the foundations of the tribes beliefs. The white missionaries teach the Ibo people that  <br /> <br />there is only one god and that their tribal gods are false. As a result, the people are torn <br /> <br />between Christianity and their old beliefs. This causes a major fallout within the tribe. <br /> <br /> An example of how imperialism has harmed the Ibo people is when Reverend  <br /> <br />Smith is dismayed when the Tribe declares a child to be an evil spirit call ogbanje and  <br /> <br />mutilates the child to ward off the spirit. Reverend Smith unmasks the spirit and  <br /> <br />infuriates and insults the tribe which results in the death of one of Reverend Smith's  <br /> <br />followers.  The English missionary has passed his beliefs onto the Tribe. Another  <br /> <br />example of imperialism is when the English infiltrated the tribe by building churches and  <br /> <br />establishing trading posts throughout on the Ibo's land.  <br />	2005-02-28

At one of the funeral celebrations Okonkwo accidently murders some one, and is exiled for seven years. While Okonkwo was gone his village and other villages in that part of Africa fell into problems with the \\"white men\\". <br /> <br /> I would say that imperialism hurt the Africans because in a waay it split them up. Imperialism hurt the Africans because it split them up. The white men came in and converted some into christians. The ones that didn't convert turned against the ones that did. Another way it affected them in my opinion is when they built the church in the Evil Forrest. The Ibo people let them build the church there because they thought that the gods would dismantle it. When the church went untouched it made some Ibos question their beliefs,and their leaders. <br />  Overall I would give this book five stars, just for the simple fact that it was interesting. I'm the type of person that doesn't like to read anything,but this book kept me coming back evernight to read more. This book is a pretty quick easy read.

This novel talks about the culture, customs, and hardships of the Umuofia people. The plot of the story includes imperialism, religion, and many conflicts of tribal traditions and rituals. I believe that the imperialism in this story is the main theme and topic discussed during this novel. Imperialism is the domination of one nation over a country land or area for a number of years. The imperialism that goes on during Things Fall Apart is most definitely not good for the people of Umuofia.  <br />      When the white missionaries came to the land of the Ibo people they basically tore their world apart. These white men took the Ibo's land, people, and basically took over their lives. The white man's imperialism eventually took over the whole village. Although the imperialism did what it is intended to do, (gain more land) I disagree with the manner of which this particular case of imperialism was taken out. \\"The white man whose power you know too well has ordered this meeting to stop.\\" This quote from Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart shows how these intruders were trying to take over the lives of the Ibo people. Some people may say that these people were just trying to regulate the land without having any trouble. If you ask me they were the trouble. \\"Then they came to the tree from which Okonkwo's body was dangling, and they stopped dead.\\" This quote justly proves my point about the missionaries being the trouble in Umuofia.  <br />      Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe greatly communicates the theme and central message of imperialism and the unfair treatment of the white invaders into the indigenous people of Africa.

The book's first 19 chapters go into great detail about the life of Okonkwo in his village, along with his village's traditions, beliefs, and customs. In chapter 20, the reader first hears about white men, who have invaded a village. The \\"white men\\" are Europeans who have come to colonize Africa and convert any inhabitants to Christianity. Though Okonkwo and his tribe try to stay free and protect their way of life, the Europeans, with their superior weapons, take any means necessary to bring the Africans under their rule. <br /> I found Things Fall Apart to be a very interesting book, and greatly enjoyed reading it. Achebe did an excellent job going in-depth into the lives of African villagers, including in his book many of their traditions and beliefs. The way that he has so much of the book about Okonkwo and his life, and only includes the Europeans for the last five chapters shows how quickly the Europeans drastically changed the African's lives forever. <br /> In this story, the effects of Imperialism greatly harmed the Ibo people. One example of this is the village of Abame. The people of this village killed a single white man because it was predicted that he would be the downfall of their village. Other white men avenged this man's death by killing every man, woman, and child in Abame. Because of the Europeans desire to Imperialize Africa, an entire village disappeared off the face of the earth. Another example of the terrible effects of Imperialism is the death of Okonkwo. The white men wanted to show their total power over the Ibo people, and so they captured Okonkwo and a few other leaders. Okonkwo, who wanted to live free or die, chose death.  <br />	2005-02-27

It proved to be an easy read but one that really drove its opinion into you. An example of this would be how the book demonstrates how the white men tore apart the Africans culture and families with the catholic religion and eventually started slowly wiping out the Ibo religion. This demonstrates Achebe's opinion on the white mans arrival.  <br />I believe Inperialism harmed the Ibo people because Imperialism forever changed the Ibo culture. The Ibo people were surviving fine before the white man came, but after the white man came it tore apart their families and many Ibos died at the hands of the white man for crimes that were allowed in their culture. An example of this is when Okonkwo's son Nwoye joined the Catholics and was disowned by his father for it. Even if some of the Ibos traditions were morally wrong, which is just our opinion anyways, the white men still have no right to go in and destroy their culture and instill theirs. <br />After reading Things Fall Apart I now have a different opinion on Africans and the way Europeans treated them. Now I can better relate to the feelings and opinions of the Africans after reading this book. I have been changed by this book and strongly recommend it.  <br />	2005-02-27

In the story missionaries come and set up a church and eventually imperialism. Imperialism is The policy of extending a nation's authority by territorial acquisition or by the establishment of economic and political domination over other nations. The imperialism that was instilled in the Ibo people had a negative effect on the people of the tribe. There are many reasons why the imperialism was bad for the tribe one example is the resistance that some of the tribe had and the openness that the other half of the tribe had against change. \\"The new religion and government and the trading stores were very much in the peoples minds. There were still many who saw these new institutions as evil...\\"(pg 182-3). Another example is that it tore families apart \\"How could he have begotten a son like Nwoye, degenerate and effeminate? Perhaps he was not his son.\\"(pg 153 ) <br />	2005-02-27

(well at least i found it hard) <br /> <br /> <br />imperialism played a huge part in this story.  the white men came to the tribe with the intent to converting them all to catholics.  while they were there they said that their religon was all wrong and they should all turn their god(s) down and believe the one true god.  another way imperialism played a big part is when one of the abame (i believe) people killed one white man, the white men came back and completely wiped out the whole tribe. <br /> <br /> <br />i still think that you should go out and read it beacause if you like reading about tribes this is the book for you	2005-02-27

The Christians that came tried force the Ibo people to follow their religion and they were very arrogant. In one part of the book the Christians try to tell the Ibo people that their religion was totally wrong and that their own religion was the only right religion and they gave the people no choice of what religion they wanted to follow.  But the Imperialists don't just disrespect their religion they also disrespected the people themselves when they just barged right into there villages and built the own churches and places to stay.  It just seemed like the Ibo people were a lot more peaceful and happy before the imperialists arrived.	2005-02-27

It accurately depicted the white man invading the Africans and taking away their land and stripping away their customs, trying to force their own culture on the Africans.  <br /> Imperialism harmed the ibo people more than it helped them. Imperialism turned the ibo people against themselves, by tearing them apart with religion. They converted many ibo people to Christianity, and tried to convert the polytheism others. They stirred conflict by murdering the ibo's sacred python, the emanation of the god of water, which led to anger between the traditional believers and the new believers. Another downside of imperialism is it led to many deaths. The white settlers murdered all the people of Abame when they killed one of them, many of the new white settlers were killed, and imperialism led to Okonkwo killing himself. Imperialism caused many problems, the two greatest were it tore the villages apart, and it led to many deaths. <br /> Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe is a respectable book because it is accurate in portraying the Africans reaction to the white settlers in the times of imperialism. It is a good read, and if you are curious about the imperialism of Africa, I suggest you pick up a copy of it. <br />	2005-02-26

Things Fall Apart charts the rise and fall of a tragic hero, Okonkwo, including the gradual disintegration of a traditional society, Umuofia, due to the influx of Christianity. In the beginning, Okonkwo appears marked for greatness. At a young age, he gained fame and brought honor to his village when he defeated Amazline, in a wrestling bout. In no time, he rises to become a prosperous farmer with barns full of yams, a well feared warrior with two traditional titles under his belt. His rags to riches saga is all the more remarkable because of his impoverished background. His father, Unoka, was a lazy man, an 'agbala' who did not hold a traditional title, but instead left a pile of debt at his death. Haunted by his father's shameful legacy in a war like society, Okonkwo strives excessively hard to distance himself from his father's failings by advocating hardwork and adopting a persona almost devoid of humanity.<br /><br />During the week of peace, he defies the customs of the land by beating up his youngest wife. At the New Yam Festival, he almost kills his second wife in a gun incident. But his fate is sealed when he kills his foster son, Ikemefuna. Ikemfuna was the sacrificial lamb handed to his village to atone for the murder of the wife of a fellow villager. Due to the enormous respect accorded Okonkwo, Ikemefuna was left under his care. Despite warnings from the oracle, \\"The boy calls you father, dont bear a hand in his death,\\" Okonkwo ignores the warning and instead kills Ikemefuna for fear that he might be considered weak in the group of his fellow villagers. With time, Okonkwo rises to become the greatest warrior in his clan. But his world crumbles when he inadvertently murders a fellow village. As punishment, he is banished for seven years to his motherland, Mbanta, where he leads a life of regrets.<br /><br />In his absence, the missionaries arrive at Umuofia and succeed in converting some of the inhabitants into their fold. By the time Okonkwo returns home, he realizes to his dismay that his dreams of receiving a heroic welcome has been overshadowed by the activities of the Christian missionaries in the village. High ranking men had joined ranks with Christians by renouncing their titles. The last straw occurs when his first son, Nwoye, joines the Christian religion. As he reflects on his sudden fall in the society, he is aghast that his chi had failed him. In the final run, he attempts to wipe out the forces of imperialism but is met with opposition from his fellow villagers. Devastated, Okonkwo chooses an undignified route that tarnishes his legacy.<br /><br />Things Fall Apart is a great African novel that succeeds in showcasing the rise, collision and fall of African tradition against Christianity. It's a great novel!	2005-02-18

However, it wasn't that bad.   <br />      The story is about a man and his relationship with the world around him.  He lives in a tribe in Africa where he is a well respected member.  He has many wives and many children.  His one major flaw is his fear of failure.  He constantly acts on his own pride and does not consider other people's feelings. <br />      The story describes his life when white people come and intervene with their way of life.  He has to see one of his own sons convert to christianity, which he feels is a personal attack on himself.  The book then ends with him giving up and committing suicide, which is also against his culture.  This could mean he was finally giving in to white culture.   <br />      I wasn't totally impressed with it. but it was still a good read.

I've wondered about the relevance, therefore, of a Nigerian story set a century ago, written in a rather formal, faintly Britishised English prose, which for most of the story takes a leisurely, rather episodic pace until sudden eruptions of energy--as in the night pursuing the priestess, or the fate of the foster son of the protagonist (no plot spoilers here).<br /><br />The final third of the narrative, with the arrival of the missionaries--white and black, it is to be noted--starts to compress the action into a quicker, more Westernised pace, whereas the previous native sections were told in the mode of storytelling reflecting not only the author's exposure to and transformation of the English he learned at 8 and studied at university in the 1950s, to play off against the clash with the newer rush of culture and ideas and force brought by Europeanisation.<br /><br />Fair play to Achebe for a balanced look at the pros and cons and the inevitability of imperialism as it sought out and conquered the traditional holdouts and wiped out or at least gravely injured ancient beliefs and practices. This novel, I believe, works more as a case study from the p-o-v of those forced to submit to the foreign ruler, but Achebe does show that Christianity offers the lowest castes a chance at redemption in this life that they could not have found within the prejudices of the native ideology. This fair-mindedness does much to create a provocative, more nuanced perspective, even as from the indirect consciousness of the protagonist, the new arrivals represent accurately the doom of the power and the order once sustained for so long, isolated from the invader's machinations.<br /><br />As a novel, and not a source of understanding this conflict, I think that Achebe gives a literary work less symbolic and multi-layered than, say, Conrad's Heart of Darkness--which I've taught to students who found it nearly beyond their grasp. That Achebe's book is taught to younger readers surprises me (my copy was in the young adult section of the library), since--like Hemingway--a rather transparent prose style may cover lots of complexity between the lines. However, Achebe's style is plainer, and often in the early stages of the work, there is not the depth below what for non-Nigerian readers holds lots to grasp in terms of a different vocabulary, mentality, and folklore. This is not an easy read, but this is due more to our unfamiliarity with the context than the story itself. The clash of mentalities will be able to be understood by my students, but the intricacies of Achebe's native culture will still be beyond our knowledge from what the glossary provides. Sure, any such tale needs to be rooted in a specific time and place to keep its forcefulness, but for readers who must read this novel for a course rather than by choice, there's much here to elude easy answers. So, be forewarned if you are to teach or be told to read this novel, for it's a bigger task than many I bet realize.<br /><br />It took me a while to read this, and the opening half moved often at an extremely languid speed, with little to engage me. The second half, as I stated, picks up, but whether this novel keeps the attention and fully engages students who have been assigned the work--who seem to make up much of its audience judging from the supplementary \\"guides\\" linked to this novel on amazon.com and the comments of many reviewers here--makes me a bit uncertain as to whether the praise for this novel comes more from academia than grassroots enthusiasm.

US	16118973	R19CLSTC38JSL	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A MASTERPIECE	If you're not careful, you will think all Chinua Achebe is doing, in a very simplistic writing style, is giving a flat historical account of the Ibo (or Igbo) culture before and after its initial contact with the British empire.  How wrong.    What Achebe has done so masterfully is bridge a primitive culture with our modern one to say, in essence, we're no different.  I love how when the novel begins there seems to be an ageless, mythological aura to the story, with an earth goddess and with oracles and with the many naturalistic proverbs, and with how simplistic  Achebe keeps his language--just as limited as the Ibo language itself.    What we have to do as readers is piece the many flashbacks and plotlines together.  It's work, but it's wonderfully fun work, like fitting together a puzzle we don't yet know what it is a picture of, and when the picture is ultimately revealed, it's so surprising, how Nigeria slowly becomes the rest of the world, how paganism might as well be Christianity, how ultimately human nature is human nature.    There is criticism of colonialism, but there is more important criticism of \\"home,\\" of the Ibo culture itself, in terms of how it rots from within at its core, due to its declining respect and barbaric treatment of women (which points directly to the declining faith of what the earth goddess herself embodies).  So despite the simple language and seemingly simple plot, the novel is quite a complex metaphor for each and every one of us. Of both the best and worst within each one of us.    Which is a perfect reminder/warning to us on the outside:  \\"Be careful.  Don't judge.  You're guilty, too.  You're guilty of being strong, even too strong, and you're guilty of being weak, even too weak, and that's nothing to be afraid of.  You don't need to feel superior or inferior due to this.  You only need to be aware of this, to keep this about yourself in check.\\"	2004-11-04

The reader feels a sense of unity and family yet at the same time is horrifed by some of their practices. This part of the novel was very informative yet at times it read like a history textbook- I didnt find myself getting that much into it. There should have been more character analysis. The book starts to climax at the time the colonials arrive and bring their teachings of Christianity. I felt around this part Achebe should have focused more on the conversion of Okonkwo's son- Nwoye. I would be interested to know what made him convert and how he felt about the white man's treatment of his tribe. I felt Achebe could have covered the more complicated issues concerning this issue; it is not simply a black and white issue. The book focused too much on soely Okonkwo and ignored many of the other characters with very contrasted personality traits; it would have been interesting to do more of a character cross-anaylsis on the women in the tribe and those that decided to follow Christinaity instead of focusing just on one character. Overall though, a thought-provoking book dealing with a very difficult issue.	2004-10-17

He is a complex and heavy-handed head of his household who is at once sympathetic and cruel.<br /><br />Most of the story is told before the actual appearance of the first white settlers, but their pending arrival hangs over the middle part of the book like a rain cloud. By the time it actually happens in the last 50 or so pages of the book, Okonkwo has been driven into exile, his life a shambles. He has only a slim hope of redemption, and that is shattered by the arrival of the settlers.<br /><br />Okonkwo's story is a relevant one even at a time when cultural and political imperialism has turned away from Africa toward the Middle East, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. But more important than its relevance is its artistry: it is a deceptively simple epic tale somehow packed into just over 200 pages, and one of the most impressive first novels on record.

The writing style of this book may seem flat and dull as you read it, but remember what this book is trying to accomplish. It is telling a different side of the story of one that we are all so familiar with: The \\"freeing\\" and \\"culturing\\" of the world. Appropriatly titled, Things Fall Apart discribes the life of a well respected man in Niger and his tribe and how when the beliefs of the tribe are overturned, the society not only dies, but goes mad as well.  <br /> <br />Okonkwo is a man that had a worthless father, a \\"woman\\" (a man who had acheived no titles). And his entire life Okonkwo has been struggling to be everything that his father was not. <br /> <br />The tribe is so deeply rooted in their beliefs that the society has no evil in their eyes. Okonkwo may beat his children, a hanus crime in our society, but think of what these people believe in. <br /> <br />The most startling aspect of this book is when Okonkwo's gun explodes at a funeral, killing another person. While this is not murder, he does not for an instant plead his case, he packs up and exiles himself for 7 years for the good of the tribe. Now this may not seem like a huge punishment, but now he must crawl up the ladder of society all over again to his near god-like status he had once acheived.  <br />This book was an amazing glimpse of life in Africa and so much more. It is a story of beliefs and religeon and how much the mean to the world.	2004-08-26

It's funny how often I have haphazardly came across books that end up being truly incredible to me. <BR>This book takes place in Africa... a land and people that I know very little about. This book gave me a good deal of insight and was very interesting. At some points it was a bit hard for me to keep up as the timeline in the story is not a straight line. What I enjoyed most about this book is a fascinating look at some African beliefs and cultural practices regarding spirituality. <BR>This book does not contain any fairy-tale ending however it does contain some strong messages. The main character deals with all sorts of issues both external and internal. The latter half of this book describes the invasion by christian missionaries and how they essentially destroyed a once vibrant and unique culture. A good read for anyone who wants to explore other cultures/beliefs.	2004-06-21

It was well composed and deeply compelling.  The story of the Igbo Village and the main character Okonkow and his family presents a sweet yet chilling interpretation of the European Colonization of Africa. The in depth details within the novel of the Igbo beliefs and rituals draws the reader into a world that he or she has never experienced.  The story of the life of this particular ethnic group is presented in the context of the idea of things falling apart.  The title is an omen within the story the keeps the reader reading and helps create a deep sense of loss at the end of the story.  This is a marvelously written novel that evokes joy, tears, and deep contemplation on the apart of the reader.

He then proceeds to introduce the beginning of colonialism, which disrupts the fine balance that had been achieved previously.  Such story is told through the life of Okonkwo.<br />Okonkwo is depicted as a violent man with a strong temper.  However, the readers can help sympathizing with him as we follow his life's story and his deep fear of failure, which he gained from seeing his father fail his entire life.  Okonkwo became a strong leader in his tribe Umuofia (in Ibo, Nigeria).  His fear of failure and weakness extend to his son, who he considers similar to his father.  He begins his undoing when, afraid to seem weak, he is forced to slaughter a boy that lived in his house, Ikemefuna.  He then proceeds, through bad luck, to be banned from the tribe.  As he is returning 7 years later and looking forward to his old life, colonial life appears.<br />The changes that occur between old and new, especially those related to religion, lead to his downfall.  Through his downfall, Achebe represents the downfall of an entire society.  It is a deeply moving work, one that will leave you wanting to read more of Achebe's books.  I recommend following the series with No Longer at Ease next, it is very interesting as well.	2004-04-08

This book, by Chinua Achebe, is all three combined in addition to being a clinical yet sensitive documentation of the social evolution of the Nigerian rural society. With the poet's scalpel he dissects the inevitable Colonisation by the European settlers, causing the havoc in the thousand years old way of living in the heart of Africa. You can smell the air, taste the food, sway to the music, feel the weather, and hear the battle cry of the old simple philosphy of a civilisation locked in a time warp fighting a losing battle against the more powerful and supposedly evolved avatar of itself, transferred from a foreign land. This book exemplifies the notion that all great stories are simple, their complexity and greatness lies in their simplicity, their appeal never becomes stale even after repeated readings, rather new facets, new imagery crop up everytime it's re-read, and the book is discovered anew.    The characterisations are perfect, with the protagonists acting as the chief motifs of the physical, emotional and philosophical framework of the Nigerian social structure, and through their evolution the author narrates the progression of the society through the tumultuous era of the European colonisation. A must read for anyone vagualy interested in the life of the people on this earth, and how we have evolved and are continuously doing so, throughout history, for man, despite the vast geographical differences, is the same in essence, and this timeless fact is epitomized in this piece of literature.	2004-03-11

Okonkwo changes and adapts throughout Things Fall Apart; he becomes a symbol for the entire tribe, as many traits of the Ibo tribe are reflected in the character of Okonkwo. Like Okonkwo, the Ibo tribe is not concerned about prophecies, only actions and strength. Okonkwo many time loses sight of the line drawn by the tribe, and is perpetually breaking its law. Perhaps the greatest difference between Okonkwo and his village is their abilities to forgive.  Okonkwo is exigent and allows little flexibilities when it comes to his rules, whereas the Ibo tribe itself has forgiven Okonkwo time and time again.	2004-02-21

His characters are not, outside of their African names, chiefly black or white, Nigerian or Somalian, or polytheist or missionary, more than they are human beings. Few would argue that characters in a book surrounding events occurring on African soil should or even could be separated on a very real basis from their roles as Africans themselves. Yet Achebe has managed to make readers view Okonkwo as a human being, faults or not, and Mbaino or Umuofia as locations larger than being simply known as towns or villages in Nigeria. <br />The journey of Okonkwo is a journey that most human beings embark upon in their lifetimes. From childhood confidence to adulthood faltering, strength from birth to weakness at death, Okonkwo is more than just a Nigerian; he could be any of us. What makes him transcend the barriers of culture and geography is that he need not be black to be important; his experiences as a human make him important because they are very real experiences capable of being experienced by any person, Nigerian or Norwegian, black or white. <br />The culture surrounding Okonkwo is not necessarily or exclusively Nigerian. We may find that such experiences transpired in Chinese cultures or in Native American or First Nations cultures as well as hundreds of other ancient and not-so-ancient cultures and locales. This is the beauty of Okonkwo and his tale. Achebe brings enough of Nigeria to us to make us realize that there is also some part of us in Nigeria.	2004-02-07

Readers learn of the tribal<br />rituals and traditions of the Ibo tribe through the eyes of the<br />tragic hero Okonkwo. Okonkwo is obsessed with rising above the<br />shameful legacy his father has bestowed upon the family. He  becomes<br />a champion wrestler, prolific farmer and a stern  husband of three<br />wives and many children. In the eyes of the villagers this gives him<br />respect and importance, redeeming him against the deeds of his<br />father. Yet, there is a dark side to our hero, as a result of his<br />pursuit of acceptance.<br />Okonkwo becomes a cruel man to his wife and children, demanding near<br />perfection from them, so that he is never disgraced. Ironically, it<br />is through a tragic chain of events that he disgraces himself. After<br />years of banishment Okonkwo reenters Nigerian society under British<br />rule. No longer are rituals, traditions and the religion of the<br />forefathers honored. Okonkwo must come to terms with reclaiming<br />respect and importance in a land that has left the old ways behind<br />and is slowly spinning into chaos.<br />Achebe gives the reader a rare glimpse into a pre-colonial Nigeria<br />that is both brutal and beautiful;a Nigeria that had respect for its<br />people and their way of life. THINGS FALL APART is slowly paced, and<br />some readers may become frustrated with flipping to the glossary to<br />find the meaning of some Ibo words.

In clean, spare prose he tells the story of Okonkwo and his family and at the same time, he shows that pre-colonial Igbo land (and by extension pre-colonial sub-Saharan Africa) was not a place filled with the jabbering savages that Conrad depicts in 'Heart of Darkness' who seem to have nothing better to do than to appear in scary dark groups and scare white men. <br />Every page of this book is alive with authenticity. The plot is elliptical, going round and round, touching different characters, and in this way Achebe pays tribute to the different cultural norms of the Igbo -- including the not-so-pleasant ones -- while at the same time painting a real portrait of a community that eventually falls apart as a result of British colonialism.	2004-01-05

I did not know about this writer until I heard Toni Morrison in a radio interview recently praising this novel. Since I hold her in high esteem, I would try any writer she recommended. Apparently I'm a little behind the times since according to the information on the front of the book, there are \\"more than 2 million copies in print.\\"<br />The action of the novel begins in Nigeria a few years before white missionaries brought Christianity and accompanying colonialism to that part of Africa. The central character is the very complex Okonkwo, a tribal leader with many strengths and weaknesses. He is therefore not unlike many of us, at least in part. He is ambitious, sometimes cruel to his wives and children, fearful of failure but also at times a very loving father.  For example, he struggles to be better than his own lazy father and worries that his eldest son Nwoye will amount to nothing and turn out to be just like his grandfather. He has no idea, of course, of what Nwoye will eventually become. Okonkwo has great affection for his daughter as well as for Ikemefuna, a young lad who is 16 when he comes to live with Okonkwo's family. One of the central tragedies of the novel has to do with what Okonkwo, according to the Oracle, has to do to Ikemefuna. Mr. Achebe, to his credit, shows Okonkwo with all his warts as well as the good and bad of Nigerian culture before the missionaries came.<br />As one would suspect, the white Christian missionaries don't come off very well.They go about converting the \\"primitive tribes of the lower Niger\\" with little or no regard for their customs and traditions. One has to ask if the Nigerians were better off before or after Christianity and accompanying colonialism?<br />One of the rewards of reading this novel is learning so much African folklore and sayings. In a delightful story, we find out why the turtle does not have a smooth shell, for example. Also, \\"There was a saying in Umuofia that as a man danced so were the drums beaten for him.\\" Finally, \\"Whenever you see a toad jumping in broad daylight, then know that something is after its life.\\"<br />The title for this novel comes from Yeats' \\"The Second Coming. Truly \\"the center cannot hold\\" for the tragic Okonkwo. You will remember him long after you finish this short novel. I guarantee it.r him.\\" Finally, \\"Whenever you see a toad jumping in broad daylight, then know that something is after its life.\\"<br />The title for this novel comes from Yeats' \\"The Second Coming.

Nothing more than a collection of rigid, cardboard figures who can't seem to care about anything but growing yams and beating their wives.

Labelled as 'great literature' by many imbecilic pundits who think calling something 'great literature' will automatically make them connoisseurs of some sort, thus elevating them to the highest levels of society, Things Fall Apart appeared to me as more of a juvenile attempt at a sixth grader's first novel.  The author seems to have some sort of infatuation with yams, because the entire book revolves around idiotic descriptions of yams and characters struggling with their declining yam output.  As for the characters, they are developed poorly and not very likeable, thus, when the tragic downfall of the protagonist happens at the climax of the book, instead of experiencing the catharsis that the author probably intended I would, I felt nothing but sheer joy because the book was over.	2003-11-25

Achebe investigates the Ibo culture along with us, and tries to overcome our American ignorance.<br />Things Fall Apart takes place in a very interesting Nigerian tribe, Umoufia, which clearly holds both good and bad qualities.  The way in which women are treated in the tribe is very interesting, along with a religion which has manipulated the people of the tribe and hurt them, but they still stay loyal to it.  However, united by this common religion and fraternity, the villiages of Umoufia are very tight-knit, and everyone watches out for each other.<br />Achebe demonstrates the manipulation and injustice of the tribe's religion when Okonkwo, a strong self-made man who held many titles in the villiage is exiled for a tragic event, losing everything because the religion which he had contributed to immensely ordered this exile.<br />During Okonkwo's seven years in exile, Christian missionaries slowly begin tearing apart the tribe when they challenge the native's religion.  Okonkwo watches in frustration as Umoufia is hesitant to fight back.<br />Watch as the tribe's religion, the glue holding the people together, is slowly destroyed resulting in a tragic ending.<br />Although Things Fall Apart must be approached with an open and unprejudiced mind to be appreciated, which proves extremely challenging to us conceited Americans, it is an amazing novel that introduces us to what seems to be a strange and unusual culture, and how everything, from tribes in Umoufia to the great world powers of today will eventually fall apart.	2003-11-15

However, I soon realized that Achebe did not write the book to be full of symbolism and thematic elemants with the caliber of a classic novel.  He wrote it to show others about the customs of the Ibo people of West Africa and the effect of Europeans on their society.  It is written from the perspective of Black Africa and gives the reader new insight into religion, government, customs and general culture.  It also gives the reader a new view on the Chrstianization of Africa and the &quot;savages&quot; missionaries went to go save with God.  Of course, no history book is 100% correct because it only has information from one point of view: the authors.  However, this book is a very important supplement that offers the other side of the story we have been hearing for years.	2003-11-14

True, the colonization of the Ibo takes place only in the last third of the book, but that is what makes this book so interesting.  Colonization did not occur in a vaccuum; it was imposed upon already existing and sophisticated cultures.  I think it is Achebe's purpose to show us a portrait of such a culture in order for us to better understand exactly what effect colonization had. <br />Achebe raises several interesting questions.  One of these is the question of an idea of universal rights and wrongs.  In traditional Ibo culture, twins were left to die at birth as they were harbingers of evil spirits.  The colonizers come and vanquish this custom in order to save innocent children.  In doing so, they upset Ibo culture.  In this case, who is right? Achebe also raises questions about the culpability of the colonizers.  In Western education today, colonization is blamed for a great deal of the present-day woes in Africa and Southeast Asia. Achebe's portrait of pre-colonial Africa is neither peaceful nor utopian.  Local tribes war against each other without the artificial divisions later imposed by the colonizers.  In this context, the modern-day conflicts in Nigeria between the Ibo, Hausa-Fulani, and the Yoruba come into clearer focus. <br />Achebe's writing style is simple and aggresive. You will be hard pressed to find a passive sentence, which makes for some choppy and dynamic literature.  I felt like it read more like a translation than a book that was originally written in English. It is a quick read, 3 days at the most should do it.  However, unless one has at least a passing interest in Africa and its cultures and histories, this book may be a bit dull.  <br /> Also recommended:  V.S. Naipaul.	2003-08-05

Both said that it was unitersting because it wasn't deep enough or lacked any substance other than a portrait of the Ibo culture. In my opinion, this could not be further from the truth. Many people believe that &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is a reaction to Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness.&quot; What this means is that Achebe is showing that the &quot;natives&quot; that Conrad writes of dancing on the bank of the river actually are a people and are not just resources for white men. It also means that this book is a protest against imperialism, which is portrayed in the relationship between the Ibo people and the Church representatives.<BR>  Also, Okonkowo's plight to become something in society and his ultimate demise is quite universal. Similar to Ellison's &quot;Invisible Man,&quot; Achebe shows the struggle between trying to find an individuality and following societal expectations.<BR>  Overall, this book is fun, emotional, educational, and just plain great, all in one. I would recommend it to anyone, especially book lovers.	2003-07-10
US	50458451	R1XSOFCJ8YTMVH	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	3	5	9	N	N	Clashing of Cultures: An Individual's Rise and Fall	While this novel is not a \\"page turner\\", the latter part of the book and the significance of the ending are both testaments to the cherished beliefs of cultures. <br />Okonkwo, the book's main protagonist, is determined to stray from the lifestyle and eventual degradation that his fathered suffered in life due to laziness and debt. He is an African tribe man who is hard-hearted and stern towards his family because he wants to become something great in life (although some may view him as a chavanist). The tribe's rituals are followed with grave tradition, and Okonkwo seeks for ways to better his personal status (although not a literal translation, one's fate is referred to as \\"chi\\", meaning \\"personal God.\\")<br />The story is divided into 3 major sections. The first section deals with mainly Okonkwo's family and tribal background; we get a first hand look at their beliefs in marriage and status of tribal leaders. The 2nd part shifts into Okonkwo's removal from his village, and his eventual progression back into his society. Finally, the most compelling part of the tale, the third section  highlights Okonkwo's orientation back into his village as well as  his and other tribes' encounters with the new community which has brought Christianity into the region; subsequently, there is a clash of power between African religion and culture and the Christian believers. <br />Several points may make this book less than appealing. <BR>One of the more exasperating aspects of reading this type of novel is getting acclimated to the Ibo vocabulary and expressions (although in this version, there is a glossary included in the back index). There are relatively trite topics included, such as a chapter on the process of harvesting yams, but my belief is that these chapters are mainly to get the reader accustomed to the values and background of African tribal life. It is necessary to read this book with a certain degree of respect for different cultures and the rituals they share. <br />Although it moved a little too slow at the beginning, the  eventual story of Okonkwo's rise and fall becomes more intriguing as the reader moves on. Not only is Achebe's novel a commentary on the ills of clashing religions and cultures, but the reverence placed on position and status in individual tribal communities. This is an excellent read for those who want to get a sense of tribal life or religion in African cultures. For those who just want a leisurely read, it may take some patience getting into this novel.	2003-07-04

It is up to you to decide on how to interpret or accept this novel. I, myself, found it boring and unmoving. Yes, I am interest in learning about other cultures, but I think this could have been written better. I also believe it needed a deeper meaning, without simple symbolism everyone tends to exhaust.

From some of the reviews I read, they made it seem like the book was going to be a boring waste of my time, but it wasn't.  It is an easy book to read, not long at all, and it helps you learn a lot about the Nigerian culture.  The book is about a man named Okonkwo who is afraid to share his feelings for fear of being thought as weak and he had to protect his reputation.  He is brave, but stands alone a lot with his decision to fight.  He believes everyone in the tribe has turned into women when they do not want to fight, but deep down he is just like them, but afraid of how people will now view him.  When he starts to become violent he accidentally kills a man and is forced to leave his tribe.  When he is allowed to return his society has changed dramatically.  Missionaries have come to teach the different African countries of the right ways, but the people of Okonkwo's tribe have different views on how to live their life.  The missionaries do not understand their way of life and so this book show how communication can be a problem that can lead to the downfall of a once powerful society.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about previous African culture in a well written, interesting, book.	2003-05-17

Okonkwo despises his father because of the shame his lazy ways bring to his family. Okonkwo determines to be nothing like his father. With the exception of the brief time in which he comes to love Ikemefuma, he succeeds. Okonkwo gains fame in Umofia for being everything his father was not: hardworking, a man of stature, and concerned with the business of the community.<br />Okonkwo's rejection of his father, Unoka, is an act of social self-preservation. It also becomes a form of self-hatred. His denial of the parts of his father that exist inside himself makes him famous and revered. It is also his undoing as a human.<br />On the surface all seems well. Under the surface Okonkwo is a boiling mess of bottled emotion and impaired judgment. His determination to not be like Unoka causes him to put public appearance over internal intuition. This leads directly to his slaughtering of Ikemefuma. It also costs Okonkwo whatever humanity he may have had.<br /><br />This incident robs Okonkwo of any ability to deal sanely with the changes taking place in his society. His rage breaks upon the immovable rocks of colonial power. In his final futility, he becomes totally unlike his father--who at least enjoyed life.<br /><br />The things Okonkwo's homeland of Umofia reveres in their \\"great men\\" (and they are all men) are things that lend themselves to the preservation of people. Qualities like strength, the ability to create wealth (yams), and adherence to social and religious norms are all valued.<br /><br />Okonkwo manically lives out these qualities in an attempt to not become a \\"failure\\" like his father. Though Okonkwo's heartlessness manifests itself a few times, and some of his fellow villagers notice it, his greatness is already established in his titles and past actions. The unease of others is set aside in acknowledgement of his actions.<br /><br />This position Okonkwo has achieved falls apart the first time with his accidentally killing another. Yet even here, after he has, so to speak, \\"paid his debt to society\\"--he is allowed to return, his status is intact. This return and the change in society that has taken place in the interim, leads to the second, permanent \\"falling apart.\\"<br /><br />Okonkwo returns to a society being reshaped by the principles and, more importantly, resources of colonialism. In the face of the vast wealth and power of the colonial government the basis for Okonkwo's greatness looks rather silly and pathetic. What are yams in the face of guns?<br /><br />Okonkwo's status dissolves into irrelevance as his society moves on. All that he has accomplished in his life washes away in the face of those who have more. The grass withers, the flower fades and Okonkwo's greatness goes with it.<br /><br />The two white missionaries who come to Umofia, Mr. Brown and Mr. Smith, represent two very different worldviews. One (Brown) is a true-blue, \\"the last shall be first, the greatest is the least among you\\" kind of Christ-Follower. The other (Smith) represents the masses who crucify the true Christ in the name of co-opting the ways and power of those who are in charge of the temporal world.<br /><br />Brown is a missionary with zeal for the lost. Not only that, he evidences a desire to help lift up the down-trodden of Umofia's society. In the face of aggression from the people of Umofia, he attempts to lovingly turn aside their wrath. In all this, Brown shows himself (by his love for others) to be a follower of Christ.<br /><br />Smith on the other hand is a lackey of the state. His concern is not the condition of the souls of the people of Umofia. His concern is that no one \\"rock the boat\\" of colonial society.  He has no inner restraint in dealing with the problems he finds in Umofia. The smallest gnat of a problem is met with the crushing hammer of the colonial power at his disposal.<br /><br />Of course there are more temporal dangers in truly following Christthan in debasing oneself before earthly power. Smith's ways show results, Brown's largely do not. The difference is in the audience they are performing for. I choose Brown's.<br />I give Things Fall Apart my heartfelt recommendation.before earthly power. Smith's ways show results, Brown's largely do not.

US	47226334	R1T3KUCSH6DURB	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	5	6	9	N	N	Deceptively Simple	Things Fall Apart reads so simply. The sentences are so concise and direct, attacking the reader. This novel doesn't seduce you the reader; instead, it forces you to put aside all of your prejudices inherited from your own culture, and the novel compels you to enter Okonkwo's own violent, beautiful culture. Then, once you are in, Achebe pummels you, making you feel a sense of destruction similar to that of a culture being destroyed by colonialism.<br />The novel is simple, and at the same time, it's not. Things Fall Apart is much more than just an indictment of Western Culture. It explores complex questions about the clash of cultures. It explores the meaning of truth, and everything relates to Western culture itself as it is sucked into W.B. Yeats's gyre along with the Igbo. Things Fall Apart is one of the powerful stories of the Twentieth Century, and it is a novel which will stand far past the Postmodern era.	2003-04-10

I learned a lot from this book.  However, I didn't really enjoy reading though.  It was hard to like the book, when I really didn't like the main character, Okonkwo.  Okonkwo was really hateful, but I sort of understood where he was coming from.  He was really tough on everyone because he didn't want to be seen as weak, like his father, unoka, was.  It's an ok book, but not great.	2003-04-07

The name Okonkwo, has been heard on the tip of many tongues throughout the tribe of Ib.   They speak of the main character's reputation as a powerful wrestler, wealthy husband and farmer. Okonkwo's only inspiration is to overshadow his father's mockery and feeble attempts for success.  This book contains exceptional insights into the African culture, before and during the slavery undertaking. Author Chinua Achebe, sheds no expense to guide the reader through various African customs, jargon and economy. Although younger readers may find some situations confusing, it is still interesting to follow the characters described in the book as they are entwined to the African way of life. One interesting aspect is when Chinua narrators the role of women in the tribe. To have more than one woman, signifies a man's wealth and power. Also defining his control over his household and property.  The wives are expected to fulfill every household chore, along with caring for numerous children. This book is a good read for anyone that expresses an interest in history or culture, although the ending won't surprise you.	2003-04-07

The great works are universal because they are so rooted in their time and place and in so being they demonstrate the essential humanity of their characters. Greek tragedies, Shakespeare's plays, the 19th century Russian novelists all appealed to their contemporaries and history as a consequence of such traits. This novel falls into this category and is simply a MUST read for any serious reader. Every couple years when I return to it, I find the depth of wit and wisdom with which Achebe presents the conflict of generations and cultures, an essential sameness those cultures miss in judging by superficial traits, and in that I am assured of the skill that modern literature still demonstrates.	2003-03-29

One of these respected men was Okonkwo. Okonkwo was Unoka's son. Unlike many other sons who respected their fathers in Umofia, Okonkwo hated his father. He hated his lack of strength, his failure, and the fact that he had not taken a title in Umofia during his life. Okonkwo however had taken a title and became a well known and respected man at a very young age. Okonkwo lived in his own farm with his three wives and children. Okonkwo and the elder men of Umofia were called for a meeting. It was concerning the death of a clansman's wife of Umofia, who had been killed by another tribe. As compensation for the loss a young man and a virgin was brought to Umofia. Ikemefuna, the young man, was decided by the elders to stay in Okonkwo's care. Okonkwo and his family soon grew fond of the boy. Nwoye, Okonkwo's son, and Ikemefuna became very close and came to see each others as brothers. As the years passed Okonkwo was able to grow a good harvest. Nwoye was becoming a man in Okonkwo's eyes and this was because of Ikemefuna who had taught him so much. Ikemefuna had spent three years in Okonkwo's household. One morning a group of elders came to Okonkwo's house and called Ikemefuna to be sent back to his homeland. Nwoye cried over this. Okonkwo, Ikemefuna, and the elders set for the journey. After a long walk Ikemefeuna had been killed by the men and by Oknokwo as a sacrifice.When Okonkwo returned home Nwoye knew Ikemefuna had been killed. Nwoye feared his father after that night.<BR>Umofia was at mourning for Ezeudo's death and everyone in the village attended his funeral. During th traditional ceremony a cry of agony was heard it was Ezeudo's son. He layed dead on the floor. Okonkwo's gun had accidentally exploded and a piece of iron had pierced the boy's heart. Okonkwo's only option was to flee with his family to Mbanta, his mother's homeland. He would be able to return to Umofia after sevenyears. He build his own home and settled in Mbanta for seven years. During these seven years a white man had been traveling to every tribe spreading christanity. The white man and his followers built their own churches and schools. Among these followers was Nwoye. He became a christian and Okonkwo disowned him. Okonkwo returned to Umofia, but it was differnt then the way he had left it seven years ago. Okonkwo was angered and saddened by how christianity had changed his homeland. The only answer Okonkwo saw was war.<BR>A masquerader who impersonated one of the ancestors spirits of the village destroyed the church. A couple of days after the destruction of the church the District comissioner of the church sent for the leaders of Umofia to meet in his headquarters. Among the leaders was Okonkwo. They were held captive until they agreed to pay 200 pounds of cowries as a fine. They were held prisoners and were whipped and mistreated. After their release a town meeting was held and Okonkwo feared his tribe's lack of strenth to call a war. The district comissioner's messengers were sent to sop the meeting. Okonkwo drew his machete and killed the man. The comissioner and other clansmen arrived at Okonkwo's home and found him dangling from a tree. He had comitted suicide.	2003-02-18

Determined not to become like his ne'er do well but well-liked father, Okonkwo is a hard worker, ambitious leader, but cruel to his family.

I am an avid reader- it is my favorite thing to do!  I like to read review of books I enjoy, so I read the one on Things Fall Apart.  I am humiliated by the lack of good reviews from young people!  I am absolutely horrified!  As a classmate of 6th, 7th, and 8th graders in my school that have read it (and loved it, mind you!)that I cannot believe it.  One common thing I noticed was the lack of understanding with the bad review.  At my school we always have to do extensive research on a book before we read it; that way we will know what to expect.  I would suggest you do that for all the books you read; it may help you decide what you are prepared for.	2002-12-03

This masterpiece introduces the unique characteristics of  African culture.  It begins with the periodical life of the African people centered around the strong and fearless character Okonkwo.  Through the description of his struggles in life, Achebe defines the many features of African rituals.  Achebe also  introduces the affects of clashing cultures.  Okonkwo, a strong and fearless man, is affected by the European's  domination over their culture, resulting in conflicts.  Okonkwo's life lead by his brave character simply falls apart.  Things Fall Apart is an excellent display of the negative results clashing civilizations have on the unrivaled and colorful rituals of cultures.	2002-12-02

Let me say this: just because you do not understand a book, does not make it bad.  I'm not sure you understand this, since all reviews that said \\"this sucked\\" tended to be accompanied by statements such as \\"I couldn't follow the story\\".  What happened to the days where people were ashamed to reveal their incredible stupidity, rather than reveling in it as a source of pride?<BR> Anyone who is interested in learning about African precolonial society will enjoy this book.  Someone said something about the hero being sexist-if you read the book more carefully you would see that Achebe is not praising those characteristics.  He thinks that his hero has serious character flaws and by no means is he presented as \\"exemplary\\".  That's exactly why he is such a compelling character: he is deeply flawed (like everyone) but is also a tragic hero, like Macbeth and others who, despite their problems, are sympathetic.  Okonkowo is juxtaposed to characters who show that men and women in other African societies do act as equals, something he has trouble understanding.  His own personal pride and flaws lead to his personal tragedies long before the colonists show up.  I shouldn't read these reviews, they are so disheartening.	2002-11-22

Achebe's great style of storytelling really made the life in Umoufia so alive in my imagination, and my sympathy for the in many ways cruel and hard Okonkwo grew throughout this first part of the book.<br />The last third deals with what happens when the Christian missionaries infiltrate the independant village that you by now know so well, and you understand the name of the book, and you understand how Okonkwo's world and proudness literally fall apart. What happens in the end is a very powerful and symbolic representation of colonisation's effect on Africa and it's people - splitting, uproaring and overriding their traditional, proud lifestyle and beliefs. After reading the book I asked myself &quot;why did this happen?&quot;. Why didn't the Europeans have more respect for this people's believes and lifestyle, which you after reading this book understand had been working for them just like our community works for us. I only wish that the last third of the book hadn't been there, and that life in Umoufia had continued undisturbed..	2002-11-08

I've read a few of his essays and they are quite good, but Things Fall Apart is not one of the better book I've read.<BR>Okonkwo is an agressive, sexest and disgustingly manish man, and it's absurd that people can even suggest that he obtained hero status in this story	2002-11-06

Outwardly, he is fierce and aggressive, but his actions show that he is a kind and loving person, though he hides these feelings to preserve his masculinity.  Because Okonkwo's father was a failure and died disgracefully, Okonkwo is constantly trying to prove his manliness and worthiness.  As a result, he becomes prosperous, has several wives and children, and earns the respect of his clan.  <br />After killing his friend's son in an unfortunate accident, Okonkwo is, as the custom requires, banished from his village for seven years.  He and his family move to his deceased mother's village, where he is still successful, but longs for his old way of life in Umofia.  In the meantime, English missionaries have arrived in the area, and are slowly winning over more converts.  As a result of this invasion, the villagers' traditional beliefs about their gods are being challenged and their way of life threatened.  After the seven years is up, he is finally able to return to his old village, but is saddened by how things have changed, and how the missionaries' influence has destroyed years of tradition.  The shocking ending is very emotional, and reveals what kind of man Okonkwo really was.       <br />Achebe does a splendid job in developing Okonkwo's character and by the end of the story he becomes someone whom you sympathise with and care about.  This makes the ending all the more emotional and disturbing.  I cannot remember reading a more gripping book in a long time.  <br />This is a masterpiece, chosen as one of the 100 greatest works of fiction by several of the most prominent writers around the world, with good reason.	2002-10-24
US	49396726	R2CSU0H72FPUH0	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	5	6	12	N	N	A heroic tragedy in an African context	Chinua Achebe's \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is the story of a man who watches helplessly as his community, quite literally, falls apart.  It takes place, presumably, in Nigeria in the nineteenth century, and the community it portrays is an Ibo clan who live in a group of nine villages collectively called Umuofia.  The protagonist is a man named Okonkwo, as noble a figure as any in literature because he is strong, brave, loyal to his family and his community, respectful of the ways of his ancestors, and strictly adheres to a personal code of honor, which in some ways is a corrective response to his own father's lazy, unprincipled lifestyle.<br />Like most in Umuofia, Okonkwo makes his living as a yam farmer, and he has built a large compound in which he lives with his three wives and numerous children, the most prominent of whom are his oldest son Nwoye and his favorite daughter Ezinma.  Since the Ibo clan is, like most societies throughout the world, a cult of masculinity, anything related to strength or honor is considered manly, and anything related to weakness or irresolution is considered womanly; so Okonkwo regrets that Ezinma, whom he loves and respects more than any of his other children, was not born male.<br />The novel is balanced between sketches of daily life in the villages and three major events that shape Okonkwo's character.  The first event is Okonkwo's adoption of a boy named Ikemefuna from a nearby village as part of a retribution for a crime committed by a resident of that village on a resident of Okonkwo's.  After living three years with Okonkwo's family, Ikemefuna becomes a good friend to Nwoye; but the village elders have decreed a sad fate for the boy, and Okonkwo has no choice but to help carry it out.  The second event is when, at a funeral for a village elder, Okonkwo's gun accidentally explodes and kills a boy; according to tribal law, Okonkwo and his family are banished from Umuofia for seven years and relocate to his mother's native village.<br/>The third event is the arrival in Nigeria of white missionaries from the Church of England.  They begin to transform Ibo society by building churches, schools, and hospitals, and establishing an Anglican government and legal system.  Part of their success is due to their ability to convince the Ibos of the sovereignty of the Christian God, and many Ibos convert.  When Okonkwo returns to Umuofia after his exile and learns that this new religion is supplanting the ancestral traditions, he is disgusted by the weak will of his clansmen and especially his own son Nwoye, who has defected to the Church and taken the name Isaac.  This event has a larger, pan-African significance, in which Okonkwo becomes a symbol of resistance to the encroachment of Europeanization.<br />\\"Things Fall Apart\\" is a short and simple novel, but it masterfully contains, within a uniquely African context, its protagonist's whole philosophy towards life and reason for being.  Whether Okonkwo's actions are to be applauded is left for the individual reader to decide, but there is no mystery about why he does them.  He is nothing if not a man of convictions, and he is willing to die for them, even by his own hand.	2002-09-30

The tension about whether change should be privileged over tradition often involves questions of personal status. Okonkwo, for example, resists the new political and religious orders because he feels that they are not manly and that he himself will not be manly if he consents to join or even tolerate them. To some extent, Okonkwo's resistance of cultural change is also due to his fear of losing societal status. His sense of self-worth is dependent upon the traditional standards by which society judges him. This system of evaluating the self inspires many of the clan's outcasts to embrace Christianity. Long scorned, these outcasts find in the Christian value system a refuge from the Igbo cultural values that place them below everyone else. In their new community, these converts enjoy a more elevated status.	2002-09-26

That was my junior year of high school.  Flash forward a few years to college, and it's on the reading list again.  &quot;Why, oh why?&quot; I moan.  Then I read the thing.  And you know what I discover?  It's a masterpiece.<br />Chinua Achebe describes &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; as a response to Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, which is, comparatively, a denser, perhaps less accessible read.  The parallels are there: the ominous drumbeats Marlow describes as mingling with his heartbeat are here given a source and a context.  We, as readers, are invited into the lives of the Ibo clan in Nigeria.  We learn their customs, their beliefs, terms from their language.  Okonkwo, the main character, is the perfect anti-hero.  He is maybe Achebe's ultimate creation: flawed, angry, deeply afraid but outwardly fierce.  To have given us a perfect hero would have been to sell the story of these people drastically short.  Achebe's great achievement is in rendering them as humans, people we can identify with.  So they don't dress like Americans, or share our religious beliefs.  Who's to say which method is correct, or if there has to be a correct and incorrect way.  Achebe provokes thoughtfulness and important questions.  His narrative is easy to read structurally, but the story itself is painful and frustrating.  It is worthy of its subject.<br />&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; provoked some of the best classroom discussions I've ever experienced.  As a reader, it has enriched my life.  My thanks to Achebe for his marvelous contribution to literature.  This book has a permanent place on my shelves.	2002-09-14

I had to read this book for my senior year in high school and it was not on the reading list for teachers as a mandatory book to read so my teacher chose this book for us to read...I wish she hadn't...I found this book to be the most boring book ever! I had to read the first chapter four times to figure out what was going on! This book is beyond college level to understand..I don't even see how high school teachers could understand this book....half of it is written in another language (thank god they had a index with translations) and the other half is just plain boring! I would rate this at one star however I gave it two, because it does give us a good life lesson in that one mistake made can change your life forever to the point where you do something drastic as Okonkwo figured this out. Other than that, the book is terrible and really hard to understand...I felt this book was too challenging to me with the Ibo language and the way everything was worded put me in a loop. If you have to read this book for school, I suggest you get cliff notes for it or go to gradesaver.com and/or sparknotes.com..I wouldn't recommend this book and don't bother reading it if you have to....you probly won't understand about 80% of what is said.	2002-08-15

From the first pages, you are immersed in a beautiful, strange (to me, anyway), fascinating culture that comes through in every description, in the words that come from the character's mouths, in the conflicts between individuals and the clash of cultures, and especially in Achebe's direct, articulate, sparesely beautiful style.  <br />As other reviewers have noted, it's usually not the best when you're being forced to read it for a class.  But look at it this way: most books aren't.  If you're in that situation, try to get past the coercion factor and the problem of grades, and read this book for yourself.  It's a &quot;classic&quot; -- that's why they're making you read it -- and no one hates &quot;classics&quot; more than I, but THINGS FALL APART is much, much more than a &quot;classic&quot; work of fiction. It is a tragedy, deeply felt, that draws an unerring portrait of human nature and especially human conflict. It is a good story, and one beautifully told.  It is an education you owe to yourself.

How many of the horrible things done to him to change who the Ibo were affected him.

Even after earning fame and respect in all of the 9 villages of his homeland, he is still controlled by the fear of becoming weak like his father. This fear often causes him to be cruel to his family or to take strange and thoughtless actions. The story follows Okonkwo as he is faced with a series of troubles: caring for a boy from another village who is doomed by his own father's actions, watching his favorite daughter approaching death, and finally seeing the possibility of the destruction of all his beloved traditions when a group of Christian missionaries comes to the village. This novel introduces you to a culture that is so opposed to American culture that you will be amazed to find yourself appreciating their rituals and superstitions. By the end of the novel, I felt that I understood Okonkwo's way of life so well that I could see the Christian missionaries and their effect on the village from his point of view.	2002-03-29

Things Fall Apart written by Chinua Achebe in 1959 is a lasting study of how one man's strengths and weaknesses are universal qualities.  So many of us vow to lead our lives differently than our parents and in that effort of identity and purpose allow the pendulum to swing too far in the opposite direction. Such is the case of Okonkwo, a proud Nigerian tribesman who is embarrassed by his father Unoka. While Unoka is popular, he is also lazy and fails to adequately provide for his family.<br />Okonkwo is an African Horatio Alger who lifted himself up from the poverty his father left him with to become an influential and successful man in his tribe.  Okonkwo is not without vanities and frailties. As he once lived in shame over his father's laziness and poverty, so now he walks in pride, failing to see his imperfections and need for guidance by others. He is rightly proud of his accomplishments and feels his achievements somehow put him beyond the rules and mores that guide the tribal life. This is a story about how social systems work to control personal behavior and the consequences for ignoring them.<br />Things Fall Apart is and interesting and entertaining look at tribal life in pre and early colonial Nigeria.  It details daily life in a tribe, carefully examining superstitions and laws which guide the day to day living.  Throughout the book tribal myths and stories are interspersed to illustrate how a cultures mythology effects there everyday living.<br />Things Fall Apart works on two levels. In part it is a character study which reveals universal truths for individuals living in any society and secondly it is a study of a society which existed prior to the colonization of Nigeria.  Both levels make this book a valued one.  It is a relatively short novel and a quick read.<br />I recommend the book for anyone who is interested in learning about Africa and learning about human nature.	2002-03-25

Achebe does a superb job of appearing to remain outside the story while infusing it with deep sense of tradition and weaving a rich cultural tapestry. The characters created by Achebe to populate the villages of the Ibo people are so thoroughly well done that it seems he is relating an historical, rather than allegorical, tale. The story is seen through the eyes of Okonkwo, a proud and powerful figure in his village. His life unfolds as a parallel to the life of the Ibo people as a whole. A magnificent novel, beautifully yet simply written. Highly recommended.	2002-02-25

Especially memorable are scenes of a witch(who lives outside the tribe but is seen to be an integral part of it), the yam festival, and the way the tribe deals with imbalance within. The organic structure of the tribe is especially appealing and apparent as its self-regulating laws and beliefs are a built-in way of maintaining continuity with the past and maintaining a balanced way of life .  What the tribe cannot portend is the arrival of the colonist.<br />Achebe said he wrote this, his first, book because he did not recognize his country in the way that white authors like Conrad and Joyce Cary depicted it. In fact in addition to being a novelist Achebe has achieved much notoriety as an essayist and spokesman for postcolonial peoples. One particular essay is often cited as a seminal text in the field,&quot;An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness&quot;.<br />Also by Achebe: Man of the People, Arrow of God(these two, both written in the sixties, complete the trilogy begun with Things Fall Apart,1958). And the excellent, Anthills of the Savannah(1988)about a modern African leader who slowly becomes a despot and his group of friends which include a reporter.	2002-02-08

It explores the traditions and cultural practices of the Ibo people of Nigeria in Western Africa at a moment of dramatic, astounding, horrific  transition.  Achebe provides us with a narrative seen through the perspective of Okonkwo, a man of quality and power in his village.  At the same time, Achebe's deep knowledge of European and American literature and the effects of European cultures on the native culture of Nigeria courses through the novel.  <br />&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; begins with the recounting of Okonkwo's history - his rise from a family with a poor, indolent father to being a wealthy and successful farmer, warrior, and leader.  When a neighbouring village offends his own, Okonkwo represents his villages interests in a conference, in which retribution returns with Okonkwo in the form of Ikemefuna, who is sentenced to death, but forms a vital link in Okonkwo's strictly run household between himself and his own son, Nwoye.  The action of the novel follows the ramifications of the culturally-demanded execution of Ikemefuna on Okonkwo and his family.<br />Achebe's novel shows an astute sense of awareness of the various political structures of Ibo society.  Particularly, gender relations are brought into high relief throughout the novel - the councils led by men; their rank and status signalled in part by the number of wives a man has; and by Okonkwo's insistent, but shielded love for his daughter Ezinma, whom he continually wishes was a man.  Relationships between families are complicated with the coming of European colonists whose Christianity and industry endanger the Ibo way of life.<br />With tightly controlled narrative and emotionally understated elegance, Achebe's novel presents a proud individual, Okonkwo, representing the final undisturbed generation of a long-lived people.  His internal and external struggles are compelling and forthe receptive reader, potentially devastating.  A brilliant novel.	2001-12-28

Instead, I advise the reader to trust the author.

The climax of the novel was when the leader of the clan Okonkwo is murdered. The climax of the story was kind of sad because Okonkwo died. The narrator of the novel is anonymous but shows sympathy for some people. The narration is in the third person by an omniscient figure who is focused on Okonkwo but switch through many different characters. Chinua tone of the book was Ironic, she was sort of mocking the tone, almost fable like. She writes in the past tense. The falling action of the novel was when the villagers let the white governments messengers to escape and Okonkwo felt that is was a weakness the village. One of the themes of the novel was the fight between culture and change. Achebes uses some different symbols one was Fire, which represented Okonkwo's nature, a fierce, wild person just like a fire. She used foreshadowing in the book, it was when the locust arrive which symbolizes the arrival of the white men. Things Fall Apart is very good and I urge you to read this book.	2001-11-09

However, I wasn't really hit until the last chapter. Don't worry I won't give away the ending, but for those of you who have read it, it was the very last sentence that shocked me and really made me realize what the whole book was about, even though it wasn't revealed until the very end.

This book is about a time in Africa right before the white people came and settled in Africa with their christianity,and other beliefs that wasn't coherent with the original inhabinents life style.  this book takes a look at the african life-style and the changes it was forced to go through in its adjustments to white people and their beliefs.  this book makes you look through the eyes of one man, that mans name is Okonkwo.  Okonkwo was an abusive, violent, powerful, and vengeful. Okonkwo never knew love, compassion, and understanding. let's imagine a time when people act like savages and do what they want with no repercussions and you will have the same story line as this book.  This book opened my eyes to what life could be like if we weren't civilized and had didn't have common sense.  In my view and opinion this book is not for people with short attention spans or just have to do it for a class assinment.	2001-10-25

Some become relics of the past, a quasi-documentation used only as references. There are those that are pulled out evey now and then to provide background to current events. And then there are the books that transcend dates and places, names and events. Things Fall Apart is one of those books, worthy to stand next to Tolstoy, Pasternak or Steinbeck; maybe not in scope and structure but much more so in volition. <br />That Achebe focused on an individual and his immediate environment instead on a whole nation or continent only gives these issues more humane dimensions, the personal drama reflecting the political arena. Without resorting to the rethorics of post-colonialist theories or even romantic sentimentality about a disappearing culture, Achebe showed how a community in complete state of equilibrium can be ruined by intrusions of foreign influences - culture, religion, politics -- no matter how &quot;nobly intended&quot;. That there was no explicit finger-pointing at the white men &quot;civilizing&quot; the community in this story even makes a more interesting reading. When is a culture left alone? When does a contact with another culture become an offensive intrusion? Who defines the might of one culture over another?<br />At the dawn of the new millennium, these questions may not be as relevant to Africa's recent struggle to define itself instead of fighting colonialists. But echoes of the issues in the book still resound in other corners of the globe, only that they are in less recognizable forms. One only hopes that the books serves as a constant warning instead being seen as a document that has already fallen apart.	2001-10-18

He does so and the reader is acutely aware of the &quot;civilization&quot; and complexity of tribal life.  His goal of altering Western perception of tribal Africa is realized.  However, it was as if I was reading a history book with someone interjecting with stories of tribal life, African vocabulary, and mined cliches, rather than a novel with strongly developed characters, dialogue, and plot structure.  I teach this book in my 12th grade class and I must admit, I was as bored as the students.  Pick up a documentary on tribal Africa instead.	2001-10-17

No conversation is more interesting than one that opens your eyes to a different culture. So I read this book by Achebe hoping to dissolve any stereotype that I might have regarding tribal african societies. In the forward, it seemed like this was not too much to expect since that was exactly Achebe's purpose, but everything I had ever heard about the primitive nature of tribal society and the backward thinking was reinstated instead of eliminated. Perhaps I am more disappointed to find that these people truly are illogical and backward than I am in the book itself. But if you are reading this hoping to extinguish any prejudices about African tribes, this is not the book you are looking for.	2001-09-26

The plot isboth simple in the read and complicated in its implications. Living in America, we are unaware of the lives of people in other countries. Achebe's work is an eye opening introduction to the effect of colonialism from the eyes of those being colonized. We get to view through the eyes of someone of that culture and see what western society's 'changes' mean to them. Although the work is short (around 200 pages), Achebe was able to evoke a setting of an African tribe that should be unfamiliar to us, something that we can both understnad and place ourselves in. This book is definitely with great merit and makes us hesitate about our position to standby when unjustices are being meted out around the world. Enjoy, ponder, and take a stand!	2001-09-10

I probably never will love it, but I can appreciate and admire it for the fact that Achebe captures something of the essence and non-linear quality of living in an oral/verbal culture rather than one that is more focused on reading and writing. The stories of oral traditions are passed on by word of mouth and therefore change slightly with retelling. The stories essentially embody the same characteristics as the original story, but different twists certainly must come into play depending on the teller because memory and experience can also influence how one tells a story.	2001-09-08

Things Fall Apart deals with colonialism differently. They tend to emphasis trade and look at the whold process in economic terms.

It is not spectacular, nor are its ideas earth-shattering; yet after reading it I felt quite satisfied.  The story follows the life of Okwonkwo, an Ibo tribeman.  A reknowned warrior in his youth, Okwonkwo strives to work his way out from the shadow of his listless father.  Far from a model hero, Okwonkwo is tragically flawed with a quick temper and a rigid mindset.  Okwonko serves as a metaphor for his tribe as a whole.  Both are in some ways beautiful, some awful, and some tragic - and with the coming of the white man, both are doomed.<br />Achebe does an excellent job of portraying the clash of two cultures.  He skillfully avoids politicizing the events and demonizing one side or the other.  Both the tribesmen and the white missionaries primarily consist of honest people.  The conflict between the groups arises not out of evil, but out of ignorance.  The near perfect ending to the story drives this point home with a subtle blow that will leave you thinking for quite some time.<br />While not a perfect book - it was too short to develop the characters to my satisfaction, the language was simple and lacked grace, and the names were often confusing - Achebe's work is well worth the investment of a few hours.	2001-09-01

The characters are very human and complex, who think in terms absolutely identical to humans a hundred years later. The story is about a west african village in the early days of colonialism. Achebe is close enough to his roots to make the mode of thinking of his villagers authentic; and it's a surprisingly modern mode. Humans don't change, circumstances do. Achebe doesnt portray the whites as villains or the blacks as being unjustly oppressed by them. Instead it is simply a meeting of two cultures. The whites are merely folks from a more individualist and technologically advanced culture and the villagers are curious about them. For example, the main character of the book is a senior villager who deplores the damage being done to the local culture. He does not however make the simplistic assumption that everything whites do is bad. He happens to see a white clerk writing something, and from his body language observes that the clerk is not too bright. But the clerk is in a position of relative importance because of his literacy, and therefore the ability to write must be a powerful one. He promptly sends one of his sons to the lcoal mission school as an experiment. This book taught me more about colonialism than a lot of history texts. It has been a perennial item on the reading lists of high school students in various parts of Africa since its first printing. It's very enjoyable; read it if you get the chance.	2001-08-28

Hersey wrote this book to show the strength of the human spirit.  The story is told though the eyes of six survivors that were fortunate enough to escape death.  These six civilians discuss their own story of how they managed to survive and keep on going against all odds. Against illnesses, deformities, the human suffering around them, poverty, unlivable conditions, and also getting through a time of discrimination.  Even though these six people were injured themselves they still helped the more unfortunate ones that were not as luck as they were.  These human beings were willing to live, even after experiencing one of the worst moments in their lives.  The survivors had to carry on their own personal lives through their will to survive overcoming their obstructions.  They had to go through the rest of their lives with the physical and emotional pain brought to them by the bomb. The six characters lived different lives both before and after the bomb, but were all compelled through the tragedy they suffered and their drive to overcome and live.   The morning of August 6, 1945 was one that many people will not forget. Everything was going to plan and people were out doing their normal thing when at 8:15 a bright flash of light covered the whole area.  Few could have anticipated its potential devastation.  The author let the reader meet the survivors and the reader was put into their shoes.  Hersey uses these six characters to show the horror of what really happened when the atomic bomb struck.  Miss Toshiko Sasaki, a young single woman who broke her leg and was left unattended to had the drive to go on after being maimed and abandoned by her fianc to become a nun.  Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura had a courageous struggle to keep herself and her children alive, forced to work laborious jobs earning barely enough for food.  She became very weak due to the exposure to radiation making her rest from work more often than she is use to.  Dr. Terufumi Sasaki was the only doctor to survive in his hospital completely unharmed.  He became aware of his good fortune and provided medical help for thousands of injured victims.  He had worked for days with no rest trying to save the lives of those who had not as been as fortunate as he had.  Years later he died regretting that he had been unable to do more.  Dr. Masakazu Fujii had been injured too greatly to help attend to patients, but later went on to fight for peace and raise funds for a variety of projects in the name of the Hiroshima victims.  Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge was a German priest who was compelled to work beyond his condition in an attempt to rescue his fellow priests and friends.  Kiyoshi Tanimoto, a pastor, helped hundreds by transporting wounded civilians and bringing supplies to and from Asano Park.  John Hersey wrote the book through first hand accounts not only after the bomb was dropped, but almost forty years later to update on the survivors.  Hersey really cares about the story of these six people.  He is fascinated with what they have to say and to hear their life story and visits them forty years later to see how they are doing now.  The way Hersey uses these people to tell the story is a creative way of writing and is very intimate. This book was a very detailed and smooth flowing book.  Since his resources were so direct the book seemed to put the reader in the shoes of these six survivors.  The reader stays with the story as each individual tells his or her own personal interaction.  Hersey takes the reader though every encounter that each individual comes across and how each individual manages to keep on going and not give up no matter how tough the situations might be.  Yet he also manages to keep the reader wanting to know more and go deeper into thistragic, however heroic story.  This book is a good investment in reading; it is educational, but also very emotional.  Hersey takes the reader though the six survivors accounts with pain and agony, but leaves the reader with a greater understanding of human capabilities and the wisdom that the drive to survive cannot be bounded by language or nationality.  This book is without doubt worth reading because it shows the human beings' motivation to live, even after experiencing one's worst time in life.  I highly recommend this story of six of the bravest and courageous people that had to experience one of the worst times of their life and now have to live with the affects brought on to them by it.	2001-08-22

As I began to read, Achebe led my imagination to observe the details of a small society with characters that could have lived almost anywhere on Earth in a simpler time. With no preconceived notion of the book, I was unable to determine whether the characters were African, Asian, or perhaps of a land conceived entirely in the author's mind. With this approach to reading, I found a rich story of a man who, while holding position in his community, is still very much an average man. Achebe endows him with the troubles and joys, strengths and weaknesses--all the human conditions that make the reader recognize him somewhere in their own social sphere. Woven into this man's story is that of his community, and Achebe takes great care to give the reader an understanding of the interactions between characters and the nuance of the culture so that the impact of change can be readily understood. This is a very clearly-written novel that spends most of its time setting the stage for the reader to appreciate the impact of change, particularly forced, abrupt change. While the message may be simple, its development is not. &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is a fine rendering of a human situation so prevalent and obvious as to be easily overlooked.	2001-08-18
US	53041816	R134BRL0CEPK8W	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	5	9	10	N	N	A World Classic	In this compact novel, Chinua Achebe has packed a story on the level of Greek tragedy, of the tipping point in African tribal life when the white man comes, from the perspective of Okonkwo, a man for whom tribal life has worked seamlessly.  Achebe devotes the extended first part of the book to episodic accounts of village life, portraying a very complex agrarian culture with remarkably integrated economic, social, religious and political systems.  Okonkwo is the ambitious son of an unambitious man.  He overcame his inauspicious birthright and lives prosperously with three wives and several children.  Their daily life is rendered vividly in Achebe's rhythmic, economic style.  Misfortune befalls Okonkwo in a moment's accident at the end of part one, but tribal custom has a way of taking care of him, sending him and his family in exile to his mother's village for seven years.  He spends the years anxiously awaiting the time to return to the life he enjoyed, ignoring the harbingers of change that arrive in the person of the first missionary.   When he at last returns to the life he left behind, it is no what he had remembered, understood and cherished.  <br />For this contemporary reader, THINGS FALL APART served as a fine contemplation of character and conflict, of an international historical phenomenon from the individual's experience, of the problems of change and chance.  It also offered a fresh reading of Yeat's poem, &quot;The Second Coming,&quot; from which the title is taken.  I regret this was not assigned in my education; I hope educators are encouraging high school and college students to read it today.  It's the type of book that makes you love literature and reading.	2001-07-30

At other times you find yourself reading about everyday life with no excitement and no problem until halfway through the book. Character development is poor and thus a reader never truly connects with the characters, and the plot was not done justice with Chinua Achebe's slow writing style.

It is a stunning piece of work.  Mr. Achebe tells the story as it is and he makes no apologies.  He simply lets the read form his or her own emotions.<br />I first read this book when I was in junior high school and back then it was simply just a good story.  Now, 15 years later, I am better able to pick out the delicate intricasies of this book.  If you see this an over-simplistic story, you are missing the very essence of this novel.  This novel is not simply about the &quot;evil&quot; colonial powers coming to destroy a community.  It goes much deeper than that.<br />Mr. Achebe sets the stage of this story by showing detail the very culture of Okonkwo and his people.  With this foundation, we can truly appreciate how devastating it was for them when a people (the white people) came over and imposed their culture on them, a group of people who already had their own culture, without any regard to or any desire to even understand their established customs.   It ruined the very fabric of their society.<br />This is truly an excellent piece of literature.	2001-06-05

Okonkwo, the main character, has a tragic flaw, and contrary to common belief, is a hero.  The end of the book proves to the reader this point.  If you read this book only once, you will miss all the great nuances of this book, such as the hypocracy of the 'white men' who come and take of the 'savage' Ibo people.  The father-son conflict, is also very intriging, between Okonkwo and his father, and Okonkwo and Nwoye, his son.  <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone, it allows you the chance to learn about a different culture and your own.  It also shows you how people's minds work. Sharing knowledge and living peacefully with one another is another theme in this great yet short book.  Hopefully leaders of the world will read this book and take lessons from it, &quot;what works for one people is an abomantaion on another&quot; Thank you Achebe for writing such a wonderful book.	2001-06-04

This book is really touching and compelling. If I were to become a super-intendant over school I would make it mandatory that students would have to read this book.

Yes, that was in there...it's surprising you didn't find it after digging that deep.  However, it's certainly understandable since you weren't interested in the book.

True, Achebe can drag out descriptions about the customs of different tribes etc, but lets afford him that because he has the obligation to not only write great prose but also provide a little bit of the African culture to the Western world as an ambassador of African literature. The novel is frighteningly vivid in its descriptions, well thought out in terms of political ideals, and a valuable piece of evidence in the argument about the clash of cultures in Africa.	2001-05-07

After reading Things Fall Apart for my english class, I can't really say that I've learned that much about imperialism.(which is what I think this book is about)<br />The book is extremely simple and easy to understand. It is not like a Skakespearean play or anything. I'd think the most important point in the book was to figure out how &quot;things fell apart.&quot; I'm pretty sure my anchor assessment is on that, and that's what I'm studying most on, and trying to get examples and quotes. For a book in english class, it isn't so bad. But I can't say that the book taught me that much about the British coming to Africa to take over land and stuff. This book's ok if you just use it for a bit of leisure reading or bathroom reading. <br />Don't expect this to be a real educational experience, though.

I read it in college, and filed it away mentally for years.  Beyond the vivid (and interesting) descriptions of West African village life, it hadn't made much of an impression.<br />I'm a college professor now, and last year for the first time I assigned this novel to my students.  Much to my surprise, they LOVED it.  We talked about the book for a week.  The following semester I assigned it again, and had similarly excellent results.<br />I've read it three times now, and keep finding subtleties:  symbols, hidden meanings, shades of things to come.  As a teacher, I think the trick is:  1) save the book until the students are about 20 years old, so they're mature enough to really dig into it,  and 2) don't tell them much about the book - just let them encounter it on their own, fresh and new, and see what happens.	2001-04-10

On the other hand, when someone blandly points out that European influences in Africa destroyed a way of life that perhaps didn't need to be destroyed, you will know from reading this book precisely what that way of life was like.  It's a sort of African \\"Gone With the Wind.\\"  Achebe makes no judgments; he simply tells what happened.  And he leaves it to you, the reader, to supply your own sense of devastation.  I just wish we could have been treated to a little more plot in the first four-fifths of the book.  A lot of kids are assigned this book in high school, and I can see why they go stir-crazy trying to sit still and read it.

The book gives an excellent feel for the life of an Ibo tribesman in the Nigerian bush. The reader learns of customs and taboos; how families relate and power is wielded; and how society deals with taboo violations. The impact of British Colonial rule also makes an appearance in this tale--leading to a conclusion which gasps with intensity. <br />But if this were all the book had to recommend it, one could easily ignore it as a mere window into the bygone lifestyle of a culture most of us can safely pay no attention to. Few of us will ever travel to occupied Biafra to eat yams and see the colorful clothing. The closest most of us will ever come to this environment is the Nigerian taxi driver who whisks us to the airport or hotel.<br />Okonkwo begins his life in shame. His father fails to provide well for the family. For the rest of his life, Okonkwo sets out to demonstrate to the world that he can do better. He works tirelessly, he accumulates degrees and initiation. He affords wives and children. <br />But, he finds little pleasure in this life. Angry, violent, he distances himself from the family who might have succored him. Still, driven by shame, he keeps working hard, trying to show the world that he is a force to be reckoned with. More yams! More wealth! Lead the village to battle! Stand firm &amp; strong.<br />Although his compatriots admire him, he fails to connect with them. Rather than allowing friendships to deepen, to find support and connection, Okonkwo continues to achieve, to compete, trying to surpass those who would have loved to be his allies.<br />This isolation, born out shame, leads to Okonkwo's demise. Achievement never leads to the community, to the connections and sharing, which allows shame to heal. Okonkwo was never able to feel a part of his community, and it cost him his life.<br />Isolation and shame are rampant in twentieth century western culture. The message we experience repeatedlytells us that our achievement will lead us to power and to happiness. The reality, as disclosed in Okonkwo's story, is that achievement does not create connection. Only the willingness to be vulnerable, to let another see into one's private spaces, will build the community and connection which can heal shame.	2001-03-11

After 200 pages, even after spending the whole book trying to develop the main character and make the reader feel for him, unfortunately I didn't feel for him like I was wanting too. Its almost like a good script with bad actors. Which takes us to the storyline- potentially potent stuff, especially considering it is based upon the colonization of Africa, but it could have been much more effective. Instead it sounds to me like an angst-ridden tirade, a thinly veiled emotional attack. Unlike Dee Brown's excellent book on the European invasion of America, &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; where we could really feel the plight of the indigenes as well as see the crimes of the invaders, in &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; we are left with only a fleeting shock that doesn't stick because the story dooesn't stick (which in my opinion is a huge loss of an opportunity to tell the bigger story about the ugly conquest of Africa). <br />While this book is an excellent insight into the daily life of an African tribesman, Chinu's angst, which is easily discerned, seems really juvenile to me. Getting angry at the evildoers is a story as human existence, and its getting really, really trite. People kill people in Yugoslavia too, white people. Am I excited about reading the next book about that? Are you?	2001-03-08

It's opened a lot of western (and indeed, some African) eyes,  to the ancient traditions of Africans, which for political and economic reasons have long been denigrated by the western media. Things Fall Apart shows for all to see that in ancient African societies, there existed Order were the west spoke of Chaos, Poetry were the west spoke of 'disjointed, grunting sounds' eg in Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' , and sophisticated political organization (as seen in the age-grade system,  Umuofia's Council Of Elders and the ancient judicial system of the egwugwu), were the west reported 'savage barbarity of a kind not much higher than that of monkeys'	2001-02-17

This book was long and drawn out to an unnecessary point.  It was kind of like reading the J.R. Tolkien where the Counsel of Elron (sorry, I have forgotten the spelling over time) takes up the first half of the book.  This book takes 20-some chapters to get to the information that is the basis of the book.  Moving on to grammar, the sentences appear short and choppy, or long and winding, kind of like Dickens, but without the literary intelligence.  The lingo (African Words) was well defined, however, the constant switching back and forth between the lingo and English definitions was distracting, and frankly irritating. As previously mentioned, the ending (which was so beyond depressing) seemed to make a better epilogue to me.  It would have been far better organized to have the last chapter or two as an epilogue, and it would have, in my opinion, made a far better ending.  In my way, the story could have ended in a higher note by temporarily defeating the encroaching religion.	2001-01-30

It is a book about [Ogbuefi] Okonkwo, a renowned young elder in the village of Umuofia, just before the brink of British colonialism and export-Christian indoctrination to the &quot;Empire&quot; in the second half of the 19th century. It is a book about an African society for which oral tradition, tribal culture and ritual were very meaningful. A society in which there was no established &quot;chief&quot; and yet with an unwritten order of rank and file among the tribesmen and their women, made to function &quot;smoothly&quot; through a complicated network of elders and fellow tribesmen with &quot;tribal ties&quot; and &quot;ties of tribal  blood&quot; to each other. There were conflicts and inter-tribal war, but so also was there peace. There was ritual murder, contact to the Spirit World and ghosts were alive. Everyone outside the village and who didn't belong to the tribe was a &quot;foreigner&quot; and journeying out of Umuofia was called &quot;going abroad&quot;. Elders met frequently to exercise their oratory powers of Ibo speech and parables and even to &quot;gossip&quot; about the customs of some of their neighbours, villages nearby. I remember an interesting portion of the book where all the elders talk about the weaknesses of their neighbours' traditions and then they all marvel as one of them informs them: <br />&quot;.. and have you heard? In certain cultures, the family's children belong to the wife and not the husband!&quot; ... And then they all laugh as one of them answers:&quot;.. you might as well say that, in those cultures, the woman lies on top of the man when they are making the children!..&quot; [Laughter]<br />The book is full of ibo parables, idiomatic sayings and African fables of spirits and the power of magic and wizardry. There is a fable about one &quot;Nnandi&quot;, alone in the forest who was always &quot;cooking and eating&quot;, with rain falling and the sun shining.  <br />Okonkwo is a big, strong and powerful man. He is also a wrestler and about the only one who ever floored the renowned &quot;Amalinze The Cat&quot;. Okonkwo is an interesting personality who loathes anything to do with weakness and cowardice; for that is why he has no kind memories of his own father, a lazy ne'ver-do-well as he sees him. He is a successful and rich man with 3 wives, whose fields are always ploughed, his barns full and is very respected in the village of Umuofia and &quot;abroad&quot; as a courageous warrior in war. He was the first many times to bring back chopped-off heads of enemies from war! He is one giant of a man and rules his household with a heavy iron hand. His own kids are afraid of him. His wives are afraid of him. He is a domestic dictator who can growl like a lazy lion about anything anytime he chooses, though not always without reason! He actually lives in fear of failure and losing honour and place in his society, that is why he is so hard and really scared. He lives in fear of resembling his weak father.<br />Okonkwo's tragedy begins with his own eldest son, Nwoye, in whom he sees a mirror-image of his lazy father. Perhaps to fill in for this vacuum, he takes a particular liking for Ikemefuna, his &quot;adoptive&quot; son. The tragedy intensifies when the &quot;Oracle Of The Hills And Caves&quot; -- a spirit medium -- decrees that Okonkwo slaughter his son for sacrifice in a religious, tribal ritual. Because he doesn't want to be branded or seen by others as a coward, he does it, though with a heavy heart. Ikemefuna is killed. The consequences of this ritual killing make him banned for, I think, &quot;seven rains and seven harvests&quot; - something like seven years.<br />When Okonkwo returns to Umuofia, he finds that things have drastically changed and that there are white men manning things and attempting to run everything. There are missionaries on the scene proclaiming a new religion, saying there is only one one God,who once sent His son to die for everyone's sins. At this, I remember one in a gathered audience answering back very seriously at the translator and his preaching white man: <br />&quot; Wait a moment! You say God has a son, who is his wife then?&quot;<br />Okonkwo finds many Umuofians - including his own eldest son -- converting to Christianity and this burns him with anger. Nevertheless, he remains &quot;distant&quot; in his approach to these alien influences -- or to those driving them -- until the day of confrontation comes, when a forbidden meeting takes place and all the men of Umuofia meet to discuss the strange culture &quot;invading&quot; their village. A non-Umuofian black messenger of the white man -- sent by the white man to inform the gathered armed men of Umuofia to disperse -- answers Okonkwo, who had jumped forward and asked him with contempt what he wanted there,:<br />&quot; This meeting is illegal. The white man, whose power you know too well, has ordered it to stop!&quot; <br />At that moment, Okonkwo, burning with anger and hatred, drew his machete in a flash and used it and slew the white man's messenger, cut off the messenger's head from its uniformed body. But then Okonkwo -- fearful of the powerful white man's vengeance and revenge -- disappears and soon hangs himself with a rope. As a suicide case, cutting his body down was a traditional taboo, for whoever did it without performing a medicineman's ritual was surely bound to face the wrath of the vengeful tribal spirits. Who was gonna cut him down from that rope now? The other elders and his friends gathered and discussed ...<br />And yet the author sympathetically portrays Okonkwo as a strong and prototypical African tribesman with his own manly problems and excesses of that age -- a heroic warrior who has no war to fight and is more at war with himself. <br />Professor Achebe's books are all very good and I think I've read most of them. They are historical [even a little prophetic, like &quot;A Man Of The People&quot; published just before Nigerian's first military coup -- I think -- in January 1966]. His books chronicle the different stages of change in his Ibo society -- but also in Nigeria and Africa, as a whole -- through the last 100 and more years. In this regard, this story of Okonkwo's tragedy at the time of the European partition of Africa is continued in Professor Achebe's second book, &quot;No Longer At Ease&quot;, which tells the modern-day &quot;good life&quot; and easy survival of Obi Okonkwo, Okonkwo's intelligent, principled, &quot;bourgeois&quot; and well-educated grandson living at the brink of Nigeria's independence as a middle-class, well-paid civil servant. There were very, very few of his kind: black, well-educated, &quot;been-to&quot;, owning a car, etc. But then the sad fall! An intellectual young man's tragedy! It would be helpful to read this book, too.<br />Thumbs up to all of Prof. Achebe's books[!] I have been reading them from the time I was 13 [and that's more than a decade ago now]! Interesting! This is real &quot;African&quot; literature!! I guarantee you!!!	2000-12-17

Achebe says everything how it is, he is very straight forward.  In no sense does he give you any time for imagination or self discovery, everything is there in plain and bold letters.  Nothing is changed from the actual well being in Africa and Achebe portrays Africa in the way it is, not  the way people in America see it.  Achebe's main point is to get out the true Africa, instead of the one people think of it as.  Things Fall Apart is one to read if you are secluded from the rest of the world in any way, shape or form.

US	50491345	RXPDIQQZ7YT8I	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Interesting peek into Ibo culture	One of my top 10 reads of this year (based on which books I've read this year, not what has come out this year), Achebe manages to win the reader over to the side of a pretty unlikeably main character.  He also gives those outside the Ibo culture a chance to understand it so that when the bad colonizing forces of England come and begin to take over, we see that what England (and what, even USA did in other parts of the world) was a Bad Thing (tm).  This book is a complex work of art that all students of contemporary literature should read and will probably like.  I recommend this compelling narrative to anyone interested even vaguely in Nigeria or colonialism or just looking for a new culture to examine.	2000-11-18

I'm not surprised by the response of our friend from Texas who seems to have only noticed the undesireable fractions of Igbo culture (murder of twin newborns as a religious practice, for example) illustrated by Mr. Achebe in this brutally honest work of literature.   Surely white Christian values and pratices are much more civilized and good-natured than those nasty Igbo---oh, wait, weren't these zealots the same people responsible for so much genocide and colonial enslavement waged against Native Americans, Africans, the people of India, China, Australia, the Middle East, and most of Eastern Europe?  Looks like Mr. Achebe's work has no heroes.  Perhaps his message is that nothing ever lasts and no one is ever righteous.	2000-11-10

Achebe brilliantly depicts the life of Okonkwo--a proud man who is held in high respect by fellow villagers in the Nigerian village of Umuofia.  He possesses many positive characteristics, but his rugged, harsh, intolerable disposition ultimately leads to his death.  He refuses to acknowledge the gradual prevalence of Christianity in his village, and, seeing that other villagers have deserted his cause, he realizes he has lost the battle and hangs himself.  This novel definitely corresponds with anyone who is content with things as they are in society and is bothered by change.	2000-11-06

While it gives a very interesting account of an African culture made obsolete after the appearance of Christian missionaries, it is hard to sympathize with Okonkwo, who cannot adjust to a culture that does not involve murdering twin newborns.  Perhaps Achebe's flaw is his truthfulness; his brutal honesty in describing the culture led me to see Christianity's arrival in that land as a blessing.	2000-11-03

I am a high school student that is into thrillers, mysteries, and romances, ect. I had to choose a book to read for independent reading. The first book that interested me was Things Fall Apart, for that title along is catchy. I started to read the book and amazingly I got into it. I read 100 pages in one day and had to call it quits because I needed slip. Things Fall Apart, is about a man's struggle to be a man. He, Okonkwo, tries to uphold all the values that means importance to him life honor, title (which one receives of how much wealth he has), family...ect. His father's achievement haunts him throughout the whole book because his father had no achievement. His biggest fear is to become like his father. He wanted to be a man who has control over anything such as his wives, his children, and his property. One who does not have control over these things is called an agbala, a man who hasn't taken a title (i.e. a woman). Okonkwo tries to encourage his children to become fierce and bold instead of wasting their life to go out and play. He is disappointed in his children because they themselves are not as eager of making something of their life, like he once was. This can be compared to how things are in this generation. Children hear stories of how their parents struggled so hard to be where they are at in life, and the reason they do this is either because they wish their child to follow in their footsteps, or because they are disappointed in them for not doing so. <br />This can be compared to Okonkwo's son, Nwoye, who is the &quot;different&quot; one in his family. He does not see his father's point of his reasoning and behavior. Nwoye becomes Christian towards the end of the book, because he believes in it and does not want to follow his father's rules which he believes covers who is really wants to be. Okonkwo only wants best for his son, and if his son becomes Christian, then his son is breakingall the traditional values that Okonkwo and his people have hold deep within them. Okonkwo does not understand Nwoye, and basically disowns him. This is similar to the present because in some family situations, the father and the son do not understand each other because they have totally different views. Who is wrong? Not either one when it comes down to it, yet they feel the need to blame each other. <br />There are many family situations. The love between mother and daughter is explained through Ezinma, the daughter, and Ekwefi, the mother. Ekwefi struggles through many hurtful and devastating emotions because every child she bears dies within a few months. Ekwefi losses hope and became bitter until Ezinma is born. Ezinma lasted for more than a few months, and this sign of hope brought down Ekwefi's bitterness. Ezinma and Ekwefi are very close, like best friends, for they talk about anything, call each other by their first name, and do many other things. There are some mother's who want that kind of relationship with their child presently. They want that kind of trust and friendship with their children that last forever. <br />There are many different kinds of relationships and advice in this novel. Another kind is a binding friendship like that between Okonkwo and Obierika. Okonkwo and Obierika have fun with their jokes, think deep of each other's insightful thoughts, and are there for each other until the end. Some binding friendships are sacred and hard to have. Many people in life try so hard to find that kind of friendship. <br />Sadly, much of these binding rituals, traditions, clans of different tribal people, friendships, families, and more became overthrown as &quot;things fall apart&quot; when the white men came.	2000-11-02

I just finished reading this book straight through during the course of last night, and I wholly object to the reviewer who said that it couldn't hold an avid reader's attention....<br />This book presents a portrait of Ibo culture that is sympathetic yet realistic, and a portrait of a man that is portrayed in much the same fashion. The back cover of the book compares this story to one of the classical Greek plays: perhaps this is because of the spartanness of the narrative shared by both; perhaps it is because in both that genre and this work, the main character has a tragic flaw that in the end brings their downfall. Aside from that, they aren't that similar..... excluding the fact that in both a world is portrayed that is very much NOT like our own....<br />I have a feeling that this work is often pigeonholed with other works about Africa written by predominantly black authors (either in Africa or amongst its diaspora). This is a better work than that: one can take more from it than something surmised as 'alternate' narrative. It is a well-written and constructed work that should earn its place in a human canon not just one of a particular substratum....<br />Who should read this book? Everyone who likes to read. It is a pretty, well-written story ASIDE from being about Africa in tribal times. Another book that is kind of contact literature-- when white folks come into common with other folks-- is Shisaku Endo's 'Silence': detailing missionary work and prosletizing of Christian missionaries in Japan. Hope someone reads it....	2000-10-02

The deadpan style of writing was a little too simple if you can say that about someone's writing. That plus the difficulty of sounding the African words made me a little irritated when I read it.  I wondered what simpleton had written this text.  But then I read a critcism of \\"Heart of Darkness\\" written by Chinua Achebe.  (In it he says that Europeans have often used Africa as a \\"foil\\" to make their own accomplishments seem grander.)  Anyway, this essay was obviously the work of a learned scholar.  Why would such a sophisticated writer parody the Ernest Hemingway style with far-too-simple declarative sentences?<br />I will admit that this book is a good work of literature but I question whether it is a Great Book.  How many of it's 100,000 U.S. sales annually arise because students are compelled by their teachers to read it.  Is the real reason this book is widely read that it attacks European culture, colonialism, and church missionaries?  After all, attacks on the majority by the minority, such as \\"Why the Caged Bird Sings\\", have elevated writers of mediocre talent, write: \\"Alice Walker\\", to international acclaim.  (Toni Morrison is not a mediocre talent so say the critics with which I usually agree.  I have yet to read her work but look forward to doing so.)<br />As the review posted at Amazon.com says, Achebe does not get carried away and gloss over the brutal nature of African village culure.  He describes the warfare between tribes and implicitly attacks the pride that the villagers have in being great warriors.  He describes how twins are thrown away at birth.  (It was not clear to me if they killed them and then buried them in the Evil Forest.)<br />But Chinua Achebe himself is a product of the colonial, meaning British, culture that he attacks.  Brought up on English literature and short-listed for the Booker prize he owes much to the Victorian Era.  Had there been no colonials there would be no \\"Things Fall Apart\\".<br />Not all books that kids in school have read for many years are great books.  For example, Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a good book.  But why do so many schools assign it as if it was a great book?  And I think that \\"Things Fall Apart\\" would probably be good to assign to highschoolers.  But let's not call a work of literature great simply because it attacks western civilization.re been no colonials there would be no \\"Things Fall Apart\\".<br />Not all books that kids in school have read for many years are great books.

Achebe writes with a simplicity and clarity  not found in many popular novels. He describes a life, while different on  the surface to western culture, contains many things for which all people  live: success, power, and community.<br />The thing I found to be so  interesting in this book, is that for the firat half there is not  &quot;time period&quot; to which many books adhere. This part of the novel  could take place last week or 450 years ago. It tells of a man's struggle  to not be like his father. He wants to have a prominent place in society,  and have things that will provide for his family. This is what the  &quot;rat race&quot; is all about.<br />Aside from Okonkwo's desire to  acheive, there are many other things that pertain to many lives today. The  youthful rebellion of Nyowe, the many meetings of council members, and  trials that hope to determine the outcomes of crimes and domestic disputes  without bias. The people of the Umuofia also have their own religion based  on faith. These, I believe, are the things that the missionaries and the  colonist government do not see, because they only see the surface  differences between themselves and the people of Umuofia.<br />And it is  because these people are not &quot;brutal savages&quot; that the colonists  are able to manipulate their way into the lives of the villagers. The  villagers respect the practicing of religion of one's  &quot;fatherland&quot;. This is a view that not only shows their tolerance,  but their open mindedness as well.<br />This is a great book that everyone  should read! It not only expands one's outlook, but is entertaining,  accessible, suspenseful, and surprising as well. Whether Achebe wrote in  this style in order to make the reader able to see everything he wanted to  say, or to show us who the real &quot;savages&quot; were, I don't know, but  I cannot help but feel a stranger to civilized world after reading it.	2000-08-20

Yet, unlike Joyce's dizzying array of literary tactics, Achebe's  raw simplicity is refreshing and powerful, rich and resonant. His story of  the rise and eventual fall of a man, Okonkwo, and a tribe, Umuofia, is  executed with great craft that arises from a deep understanding of Nigerian  culture and a great insight into the nature of humanity. The reading of  this novel cannot be separated from a parallel study of Yeats's  &quot;Second Coming&quot;:  <br />&quot;TURNING and turning in the widening  gyre/ The falcon cannot hear the falconer;/ Things fall apart; the centre  cannot hold;/ Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,/ The blood-dimmed tide  is loosed, and everywhere/ The ceremony of innocence is drowned;/ The best  lack all conviction, while the worst/ Are full of passionate  intensity...&quot;	2000-08-15

I had discovered what book  on the list I had to read a week before the exam, and I read it ravenously,  not because I had to, but because it grabbed me from the first paragraph.   Achebe writes like a classic playwright, in Homeric fashion.  He exposes us  to a culture that few know about and goes into detail the customs.  It's a  fascinating read.  It tells the story of a man and the transition he is  forced to make from old to new.  It's excellent, one of the best books I've  ever read.	2000-08-03

And they're probably  right.<br /><br />Thankfully, I'm a year or so too old to have been assigned  this in school, and I picked up a copy vaguely remembering classmates below  me had had to read it. Perhaps my lack of memory about much of my high  school and college days is a good thing, because I went into this novel  without any preconceptions. I also went into it having read a few books  from Heinemann's African Writers Series over the past few months, so I have  something of a grasp on what African novelists were doing in the late  fifties. (Not a bad idea, actually, since the &quot;storytelling&quot;  nature of such tales can be jarring to someone who's used to modern  American lit-- for example, your typical high school student.) All this  being the case, Things Fall Apart, considered by many western critics to be  the premier work of African literature of this century, may be quite  deserving of its laurels.<br /><br />Okonkwo is a tribal elder in Umuofia, a  large village in southern Nigeria. He's the very essence of a self-made  man, having inherited nothing from his father. Of course, events can't just  go on day to day as we want them to, and a series of stumbling blocks face  Okonkwo after he is given the care of a teenager the village has taken as a  spoil of war.<br /><br />The book is compared to classical Greek tragedy, and  there are certainly elements of it here. However (remembering recent  reading in Abel), to cast this as a true Greek tragedy would force a  reading that says the tribal gods sent Christian missionaries to Umuofia in  order to punish Okonkwo for various transgressions. I'm about halfway to  accepting that this is what Achebe was after, actually. Otherwise, one is  forced to read this in kind of the same way as the old joke whose punchine  is &quot;Job, something about you just sporks me off.&quot;<br /><br />One way  or the other, the writing is fluid, easy, and captivating, and the  storytelling style is one I've always been drawn to (as opposed to the  missionaries-- one white person, at the very end of the book, thinks to  himself that one of the most annoying things about the tribe is their  &quot;superfluity&quot;). I liked this one, surely more than my schoolmates  who were assigned it. Those of you who were, and hated it, might want to  try cleansing your palates with something by, say, Cyprian Ekwensi, or a  different, lesser-known book by Achebe (A Man of the People would be a good  start).

US	51409451	R2SBVOPK3TZ02A	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	5	3	5	N	N	A Masterpiece	While collecting works concerning the nature of man, I stumbled upon Chinua Acebe's THINGS FALL APART.  This work, in one word, is a masterpiece.<br />THINGS FALL APART incorporates several elements.  First, the  setting, rural Nigeria, reveals a sense of the traditional, dynamic  cultures of this region.  One would expect that these native peoples are  simple in respect to government, economics, social customs, and savage in  religion.  However, Mr. Achebe presents the truth of these peoples.  Their  cultures are actually very complex and rival the operations of Western  Civilizations.  The author goes so far as to demonstrate Africa's   superiority over the Western habits of missionaries and colonists.  <br />The  story also operates upon another premise that every intellectual will  appreciate.  Many who claim to have resolved the question concerning the  nature of man cite examples and then make their conclusions from these  situations.  However, Chinua Achebe indirectly resolves the debate over  human nature by describing the behavior of the main character, Okonkwo,  during moments of sadness, anger, vengence, loss, and joy.  From this he  leave the reader to make their own conclusion.  Essentially, Mr. Achebe's  tale can be manipulated such that the story itself is the proof to any  astute conclusion about the nature of man that the reader  ascertains.<br />From the perspective of literary value, I can see why the  College Board often uses this work in their AP English (Literature) tests.   It is apparent that Mr. Achebe's style conveys every emotion with such  energy that it is uncommon not to understand the character's feelings.  The  writing style makes the reader comfortable while emersing himself in a  foreign situation--I doubt many people identify with a tale from Africa  before they read this book.  The book teaches a lesson: troubles to the  Queen of England are the same in magnitude and emotion as to a native of  Africa.     <br />I was merely disappointed with the multitude of characters  whose names, being foreign and difficult to pronounce, were often easy to  confuse and forget after each chapter.  This, however, does not at all  diminish the essence and message of the story.  <br />For this book to operate  on so many levels compells me to rate THINGS FALL APART as a five-star  masterpiece that is certainly an asset to literature and a window to our  own human nature.	2000-06-11

Because it's easy to read but hard to interpret, Achebe's masterwork has become a fixture thoughout secondary and higher education.  Unfortunately, its current status as a &quot;classic text&quot; as well as a multicultural icon threatens to make it merely another institutional artifact rather than  the genuinely provocative text it is capable of being.  Achebe does not  gloss over the apparently savage, cruel, sexist practices of the Ibo people  before the arrival of the white missionaries.  Yet students are quick to  overlook these tensions in the narrative, preferring to go for the  &quot;platitudes&quot; about imperialism that they know are expected of  them in the classroom devoted to assuring &quot;diversity&quot; is in the  curriculum.  The other &quot;tension&quot; that is often overlooked is one  outside the text: respecting the autonomy and identity of an African  country by staying out of its affairs vs. intervening to bring an end to  mass genocide (Rwanda), starvation (Ethiopia), and  enslavement of children  (Sudan).  Why is it a &quot;moral imperative&quot; for the West to  interfere in Kosovo but not in Rwanda?  If these tensions are not  confronted, the novel is a well-crafted folk tale about a tragic hero, and  also another occasion for student apathy.  Achebe himself has invited  strong moral judgements about his text by applying the same to Conrad's  &quot;Heart of Darkness.&quot;	2000-04-27

Well everyone, from a socio-cultural standpoint, the book is quite worth reading. It is by no means a book that I would choose to read on a recreational basis. The diction is dignified yet simple and the book can be  read in a day. The novel is a critical account of British colonialism  inflicted upon an African tribe. It is fascinating and evokes solemn  emotion. Things Fall Apart is used to broaden knowledge, an extremely  important component of modern African Literature. Perhaps it is profound,  read to find out.	2000-04-20

The customs and religion of the Ibo village are described with sympathy and  simplicity, creating a sense of nostalgia for a way of life completely  exotic to Western sensibilities, but making the reader feel the force and  logic of a traditional culture seen from within. This idyllic description  is clouded by the reader's awareness of the culture's fragility, a  foreboding sense of pity and of looming disaster. Disaster comes, of  course, in the shape of white missionaries. In the last part of the story,  evangelizing Christians and English colonial administrators establish  themselves in the Ibo village, and act to corrode and unravel the  traditional life of the Ibo people. An escalating series of  misunderstandings and conflicts between the whites and natives lead to the  inevitable tragic ending. In the last paragraph of the novel, the  perspective shifts suddenly to that of the English colonial adminstrator,  and ends with one of the most powerful and affecting last lines of any  novel I've read.<br />This book was thoroughly enjoyable, and I recommend it  unreservedly.	2000-04-16

Achebe encapsulates the culture of a man in ruin and identifies the logical iconoclasts, whereby culture  and the people within it are defeated.  <br />The novel was written from a  west-African third person perspective of a community of Igbo people and  their own local legend, a man named Okonkwo.  We explore the way life is  for Okonkwo and his traditional people and how Okonkwo has grown proud and  strong to overcome the memory of his weak father.  Gradually, life changes  for Okonkwo, starting with the accidental killing of a child and an exile  to the land of his mother.  Life gets progressively worse with the  introduction of western culture--Okonkwo refuses to adapt to the changing  culture and loss of personal security and pride.  In the end, both internal  and external forces of the character's demise are profoundly understood.	2000-03-24

High	I enjoyed Chinua Achebe's, Things Fall Apart, and would recommend it to anyone. Chinua Achebe is a great author and shows it in his books. I think when he was writing this book he wanted people to learn about other  cultures in the world. The way that these people live and react to their  problems is much different than what I see in my life. He writes about a  man named Okonkwo, who faces fear and anger when missionaries come to his  homeland, in Nigeria. In one part of the book, Okonkwo is forced out of his  home and sent to live in his motherland because he accidentally shoots and  kills another man. Later he comes home and tries to win back his old  neighbors and friends who are now followers of the Christian faith. Also,  the men in the clan are to raise strong boys into men. This may be a  problem for Okonkwo as his son withdraws into the Christians. One of the  most exciting parts of the book is when the tribe gathers together to have  wrestling matches. The men, women, and children go against each other like  wild animals and it is very exciting. Next, Okonkwo faces one of his  hardest tasks when he must kill a young man he has been caring for. Okonkwo  could never forgive himself but it was something that the tribe leaders  ordered. Okonkwo finally loses control of himself and makes the ultimate  sacrifice fearing that the missionaries from Britain would gain too much  control. I liked this book because in my life I don't get to see or hear  about how people such as Okonkwo had to face their troubles. This book  teaches a valuable lesson about Western imperialism and shows how the  Western countries influenced the African tribes.	2000-03-09
US	49953332	R1HW5YISQOS6GW	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Things Fall Apart Review	Throughout China Achebe's book, Things Fall Apart, there is one main theme that all events foreshadow. This theme is that the tribes of Africa and their settlements, such as Umuofia, were already civilized and orderly  before Western influence. The main point of this book was to eliminate  stereotypes about African culture being prehistoric and barbaric. Okonkwo,  the main character, shows the pride of a noble race. He is defeated, just  as African culture was, by surprise and stealth. Nwoye represents tribesmen  who believe in the Western missionaries. He was converted to Christianity,  as were many other Africans at that period. This book shows the chaos of  the situation when a foriegn culture interferes with years of tradition.  <br />  The wrestling events were the most exciting time in the village.  The people worked themselves into a frenzy. They became so excited for  their tribesmen, fighting for honor. The drummers became possessed with the  spirit of the drums, playing the beat wildly. The crowd became extremely  excited, with the men dancing around striving to throw each other to the  ground. The men who kept order had to run around with palm fronds and beat  the ground or the legs and feet of the crowd to keep them back. The crowd  would burst into a thunderous roar at the conclusion of a match. These  matches were so exciting that even the stoic elders had trouble hiding  their excitement.   The murder of Ikemefuna was a tense scene that  ended in a fury of confusion and excitement. The men of Umuofia had  deceived Ikemefuna into thinking that they were taking him to his native  land, and were leading him through the woods. As they were walking,  Ikemefuna became suspicious of the men, after a man growled at him to keep  going, sending cold fear down his spine. He wondered why his adoptive  father, Okonkwo, had fallen towards the back of the procession. Finally, a  man drew his machete and struck him, as Okonkwo looked away. Ikemefuna  cried out \\"My father, they have killed me!\\" as Okonkwo ran to him. Then,  for fear of  being weak, Okonkwo cut him down with his machete.  The  death of the white messenger happens very fast, with Okonkwo reacting  instinctively. As soon as Okonkwo hears, \\"The white man...has ordered this  meeting to stop\\", he draws his machete. He then chops twice at the  messenger, decapitating him. He then wipes his machete in the sand and  walks away, disappointed in his tribe, knowing they will not fight the  white men as he would. <br />   I believe that this book was a good  example of how imperialism can destroy cultures and traditions. This book  showed that Western imperialists' impression of African natives was totally  wrong. I feel that this book taught a valuable lesson by describing the  village of Umuofia and the prud tribesman Okonkwo before and after the  imperialists influenced their culture. This was not particularly  interesting to me, but on an educational level, it did provide another  point of view to the common stereotype of the African natives before they  were \\"enlightened\\" by Western culture. My recommendation for this book  would be: choose another book if you want easy, enjoyable reading, but if  you would like to learn the truth about a noble culture	2000-03-06
US	49953316	RQDA6MZQALBPX	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Things Fall Apart	The book Things Fall Apart is about the clash between the European and  the culture of the Igbo people. It also portrays what the Igbo culture was  like before it came into contact with the European. And that when the   cultures are not willing to communicate, beliefs about superiority and   inferiority are enevitable. <br />    I really enjoyed this book. There were a  few really good parts that I  found considerably interesting. The first was  Ekwefi and the ogbanje. I liked  that segment of the book because it gave a  detailed look upon a part of the  Igbo culture that I did not expect to see  in the book. Also the part of the  book when Ezeudu's sixteen-year-old son  is killed. This intrigued me because  it was clearly an accident and  Okonkwo's punishment was so severe. He was  exiled for seven years and all  his posessions were burned or killed. The  difference between Mr. Brown and  Reverend James Smith tactics when handling  the Igbo was an interesting  part of the book. Mr. Brown was understanding and  talked more with the  Igbo trying to learn they're religion not just change  it. Reverend James  Smith was more drastic and wanted things to change right  away and everyone  had to be strictly catholic and all remains of the old  religion had to be  gone.	2000-03-03

He captured how life really was before the intrusion into the  tribes with thenew strange faith of Cristianity. Lastly it shows how the  tribes in Afric were not savages like the white settlers made them out to  be. They were civilized people who ha tough morals to live by. Three  scintillating events to me that hapened in the book would first be when the  gun explodedin Okonkwo's hands and killed the boy. A second event was when  Okonkwo and his fellow tribes men were face to face with the messengers and  he chopped one of their heads off. The last event would be when Obierika  showed the comisioner Okonkwo's body hanging behimd his hut. I feel that  the quality of the book was excellant, because it was captivating reading  which stirred you and made you want to read more. Another reason why I like  the book was it showed the real things that went on in tribes and the  social ways through the eyes of a great man like Okonkwo.	2000-03-03

In being Nigerian, Achebe was able to capture to truth  about how the country reacted in a fictional story.  By including a  historical truth in a story that gave one a sense of what really occurred  sets what Achebe can do out from everyone else.       The book was  well-written and stressed a strong point.  Achebe seemed to see a need for  those who don't understand the truth of the concept to grasp it better and  see what Achebe sees.  He was able to combine his writing talent and  ability with his knowledge and will to stress a point when he desires.        However, this book wasn't perfect.  If it was, I would've given it five  stars.  Achebe in this book used possibly too many names that were uncommon  and hard to remember.  I often found myself flipping back pages to remember  who he or she was and what significance they had to the story.  Also, when  it was translated to English, some Nigerian facts or understandings were  not completely cleared in English.  This sometimes made it hard to relate  and perplexed me.         But if those are the only flaws noticeable to a  reader like myself, I believe this book is noteworthy of a solid review.	2000-03-03

It was all based on the main character of the book, Okonkwo. He lived in Umuofia with his family and all his fellow clansmen. He was a great man and  respected by many people. Okonkwo wanted to achieve lots of fame and  wealth, which he has, so that he doesn't turn out like his father Unoka.  During the book Okonkwo and his family prepare like they always do every  year for the time of rains and for the harvesting of the yams. But these  next few years were filled with many changes. For one thing a new member  was added to Okonkwos household, this young man was called Ikemefuna. At  first Ikemefuna was just another person filled with work by Okonkwo. He  later was admired by Okonkwos children and even became Okonkwos  &quot;adopted son.&quot; But due to the order of the High Priestess he was  sent to his death. Even with this tragic moment the story goes on. The  harvesting came and went as the time went by. One day Okonkwo broke the  rules of the Clan and was exiled along with his family! It was a bad time  for Okonkwo because it destroyed most of his plans for gaining more titles.  Okonkwo and his family left Umuofia to their &quot;motherland&quot; Mbanta.  Here they began their lives again. With the help of Okonkwos family they  built a compound and planted yams.  Time went by and Okonkwo and his family  couldn't go back to their &quot;fatherland&quot; until the time of seven  years have passed. During those times in Mbanta the whitemen came to  Africa. The Catholic Missionaries went from city to city spreading their  faith and preaching of God. The clan was being split in two, converts went  with the whitemen and their way of life and faith, and the other half made  up of the still standing clansmen from this &quot;invasion&quot;.  Laws  were made to support the life of the newcomers and the clan's couldn't do  much else. This is the type of land Okonkwo and his family returned to, the  once greatUmuofia feared by other clans, was now becoming just like  &quot;women&quot;. Okonkwo was a man of war and only wanted to rid his land  by force! But his clan didn't support him, so enraged with anger Okonkwo  killed an official and then it lead to his own suicide. <br /> I  personally enjoyed this book! It was interesting to read of African Culture  and their way of life before it was changed. It was an in depth book and  was something I couldn't stop reading until I reached the end! It's a must  read!	2000-03-03
US	49953346	R2JRLNMOZAF8L3	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	5	2	2	N	N	it's all good	March 2, 2000<br /> The overall summary of, &quot; Things Fall Apart&quot;, by Chinua Achebe, is that it's focused on imperialism and the reforms of Africa by European settlers, particularly concerning the Igbo  people. European settlers had come to Africa to make it a modern society,  but the Igbo's were far from the stereotypical view of them as being  savages that had no morals or laws. This was because they are in a land,  which the Europeans thought was a place to expand Calvinist ideas, survival  of the fittest. The Igbo people were not like this, they had ways of  dealting with their problems, they had a justice system, a currency system,  and also having an economy that relied on agriculture.  Another problem  arose from the problem with religion. The reformers, besides wanting to  make Africa modern, wanted to spread their religion to the Igbo,  Christianity, but the Igbo already had their own faith. These reasons would  then cause disputes and ultimately war between the two societies. Some  exciting points in the book were when the Feast of the New Yam had arrived.  This feast meant that there were going to be many festivities and exciting  events that were going to take place. All the people in the village,  besides Okonkwo, were invigorated by this event. One of the events that  were going to take place was wrestling matches. The Wrestling matches are  somewhat important because that was how Okon- kwo met his second wife,  Ekwefi. Ekwefi fell in love with Okonkwo when he defeated Amalinze, also  called &quot;Cat&quot;, in a wrestling match.  Another exciting point  in the book was when Okonkwo and his family had to go to Mbata for 7 years  because Okonkwo had accidentally killed Ezeudes' son. During that time,  Okonkwo's village was burned and someone had sold all of his yams. This  book, in my opinion, is an excellent book because it describes what was  taking place in Africa during its reformation by European settlers. The  story is first person narrative of what the Umouifio tribe and certain main  characters were going through. These kind of stories are usually about how  the settlers came and modernized Africa and very little was said of how it  affected the people. &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is a perfect book  because it describes the customs of the people and how they were affected  by the changes that were going around them and also, how were they were  handled.	2000-03-03

The main character Okonkwo is a traditional  man who is opposed to change. He adheres to the old ways of going about  daily activities, fighting wars, to practicing faith. Throughout the book,  Okonkwo experiences many tragic losses such as losing  the child,  Ikemefuna, and being banished from his home, Umuofia.This book not only  shows the positive aspects but it reveals the hardships of life and  eventually ends with Okonkwo committing suicide. I believe that Chinua  Achebe wrote this book to share his knowlege about Nigerian life, that not  many people know about or are familiar with. I think Achebe felt it was  important for everybody to learn about African cultureand foreign customs  before they can begin to appreciate them. <br />EXCITING EVENTS:<br />1.) I  thought that the time when Okonkwo was removed from Umuofia was an exciting  event. I looked forward to find out how he would react to this problem and  the change in his surroundings.<br />2.) I also thought that the part when  Ikemefuna was sent to live with Okokwo was exciting and interesting. I  enjoyed reading about how Ikemefuna and Okonkwo's family bonded, matured,  and developed relationships and how the family was affected when Ikemefuna  had to be killed.<br />3.) The wrestling matches and festivals around it  also caught my attention. It was interesting to learn what cultures do for  fun and what they take pride in. In Okonkwo's culture, wrestling is one way  to put yourself on the map and make a decent name for  yourself.<br />EVALUATION:<br />  Things Fall Apart was a decent book,  but especially if you are interested in African culture It should be  recommended for this purpose. The book used a few too many foreign words  that became hard to understand. There could have been a little more action,  tension, or war scenes involved, but life isn't always dramatic and  exciting. I did like it because I find it helpful and useful to read  different kinds of literature coming from different view points and  perspectives. A little change once and a while can really open up the mind.  Overall Things Fall Apart wasn't my favorite book but I appreciated what it  had to say. I give it 7 out of 10 stars.	2000-03-03

Chinua shows how people, like Okonkwo, can \\"fall apart\\" through the pressure of change, especially by force. Okonkwo a native African tries to defeat white  settlers from changing his nation's cultures and religion, which was deemed  inferior to the white settlers. It is an eye opening book with a sense of  what reality really is.<br />There are many struggles, conflicts, and  mini-plots as well. This made the story interesting. The wrestling match  with Okafo and Ikezue was exciting and the image of the fight was clear and  graphic. Or times of sadness and a point of disgust, when many of Okonkwo's  children had died and the medicine man accused the children as evil. He  then mutliated one of the dead children and took him away, something that  would seem cruel and stupid today, a very serious crime. Or when Okonkwo  commits suicide through despair because he was unable to drive his  opponents away and to bring back his religion to his people.<br />A story that  can be so powerful that can bring both moods of excitement and joy to  disgust and despair is a very rare one indeed. It brings a sense of reality  while being entertaining at the same time. A very well-written book.	2000-03-03

Basically the story was about an African tribe that lived in an African village called Umuofia.  They had their own beliefs.  It was  another normal day in the village of Umuofia until the white missionaries  came to African villages with their own beliefs, that the Africans didn't  necessarily believe in.  An African man named Okonkwo lived in Umuofia and  dissented strongly with the white missionaries.  Okonkwo was a great  warrior that had much respect from the people who he lived with because of  his religious beliefs.  White missionaries came and disproved the African  religion along with Okonkwo's beliefs as well.  Okonkwo said that this  \\"new\\" religion had taken away all the dignity the people had in the African  villages, and Okonkwo began to call the men in the villages women.  Really  what I think Achebe was trying to say was that Okonkwo's self-dignity had  been taken away and Okonkwo also knew that he wouldn't be so powerful once  people went along with the new religion because the missionaries didn't  believe that anybody was better than anybody else.  Okonkwo's life and  beliefs had been falling apart, and Okonkwo knew that things wouldn't stay  the way they were for long, and people wouldn't think of him as much as  they may have before.  Eventually, Okonkwo hangs himself, and the story  ends.<br />       There were some exciting events that happen in this story.   One of the events was the time when Okonkwo was at a funeral and shot a  16-year-old boy and killed him.  As a result of that, Okonkwo was exiled to  his motherland of Mbata for seven years.  During Okonkwo's exile, the  missionaries had come in and started to convert Africans to Christianity.   Also, I liked the time when the missionaries built their church in the evil  forests of Africa.  All the Africans thought that the missionaries would  die in a few days, which was supposed to happen according to their  religion.  Then when the missionaries were in the veil forest for a couple  weeks, nothing happened to them and the Africans were proved wrong.  One  other exciting event I like in this book was the conflict between Okonkwo  and his son, Nwoke.  Nwoke decided to follow the ways of the Christians,  even though he knew his father Okonkwo would not concur with that decision.   Nwoke did go with the missionaries and left his father, which was  upsetting to Okonkwo, who was appalled when Nwoke left his father.  Those  are some of the exciting events in the story Things Fall Apart.<br />        Overall, I like the book Things Fall Apart.  I think it is an interesting  tale.  I think that because it told a lot about how Africans live and what  they believe, which I personally thought were false beliefs.  The story  tells a lot about how Africans live without getting too boring, and uses a  lot of description about everything.  Then when the missionaries came to  Africa and started to preach their OWN beliefs that went against most of  the African beliefs.  That is my favorite part of the book Things Fall  Apart.  I never came across a part in this story that was not addicting.  I  always wanted to keep reading this.  Chinua Achebe made a strong point that  everything has the potential to \\"fall apart\\".  If you like something in  your life it may not last forever even if you won't admire the change to  come.  Even those who are powerful at a certain time, may eventually lose  power to new changes that happen.  That wraps up my review on Things Fall  Apart by Chinua Achebe.	2000-03-03

He is a strong warrior whose life is dominated by fear and anger.  As the story develops, the author gives a clear picture of the everyday  life of Okonkwo's tribe, the Ibo.  The author deals explicitly with the  family life and the religion of the Ibo people.  Many of the aspects of  this primitive life seem savage and uncivilized to many readers, such as  the ritual killing of children and polygamy.  About half-way through the  book, the local tribes come into contact with British missionaries who  settle around them in the hopes of spreading the Christian Faith.   This is  the point where things begin to fall apart for Okonkwo and his fellow  tribesmen as the European missionaries for the most part wish not only to  &quot;Christianize&quot; the tribes of Umuofia, but to completely wipe out  their African heritage and customs, and to turn the land into a sort of  British colony.  Sadly, this method of completely wiping out one's culture  and replacing it with the culture of one's homeland has been used by many  of the mission efforts of Western Christendom throughout the centuries.   The author is very descriptive about the tragic effects this form of  mission work can have on a culture. Christian missionaries may find this  book offensive.  However, I believe that it should be read by anyone  considering Christian missionary work.  The cultural insensitivity  exhibited by the missionaries in this book is a pitfall into which all  missionaries are in danger of falling in their attempts at spreading the  Gospel.  For a more Orthodox approach to mission work, I recommend MONKS,  MISSIONARIES, &amp; MARTYRS:  MAKING DISCIPLES OF ALL NATIONS by Fr. Luke  Alexander Veronis (Light &amp; Life Publishing).	2000-02-29

Last Thursday I decided I should probably start looking for a book to read. Since &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; was readily available, free, and short I decided to go for it.       Starting out I thought it was pretty drab and boring. Talking about  customs and rituals in some African tribe. &quot;Who cares?&quot; I  thought. Slowly as I got deeper into the novel I was beginning to realize  something. Achebe put all the tribal information in the beginning to prove  something. He proved that we as WASPs aren't always right. The fact that we  went into a foriegn country and automatically decided that what we knew was  right and everything else is wrong emits the strongest sense of ego  possible. Achebe tries to prove that Europeans destroyed much of this  planets culture with Onkonkwo and his struggle with life. Okonkwo tried and  tried to become the best by achieving  all four of his lands titles only to  be squashed in the end by a bunch of hypocritical Christians.          Americans view themselves as knowing what's right for everyone. None of  them see the other point of view. A person knows what's right for them; so  let them make their own decision	2000-02-24

His choice for using the English language instead of the traditional language that would have been found  within the culture at that time, is a wise yet disappointing choice.  In  order for the general reader to understand the basic situations that where  happening within that culture, the choice of using regular English was  appropriate.  I think by using the language of the culture, all  understanding of actual events would have been lost and overpowered.  Achebe's novel also broke down the basic understanding of the culture  itself, by using the storytelling techniques that he so enjoys, he is  explaining to the reader the simplicity that that the society has for their  culture.  Everthing is broken down into simplicist forms and can be  explained by a story.  I think Achebe's novel gives insight to a culture  that most people have forgotten even exists.	2000-02-22

I sat down and read the book straight through.  The plot was excellent, but the really strong point of this is how the characters develop.  I did get the  feel from this of the destruction of African culture by the Europeans,yet  there is a much subtler theme that is very strong.  This is the theme of  how customs, religions, and society in general is really only 'right' from  you're own point of view.  That is, what one considers acceptable is really  just a reflection of the learned values of the culture one is raised in.  There is no 'inferior' culture.  The writing in general is excellent, and  Achebe pulls this one off using an omniscient narrarator--something very  difficult to do.  I would say read this not because you are forced to for  some school class but because it is such a totally unique and fulfilling  novel.	2000-02-22

I just read it for the class, and I thought it had some good points, but the story wasn't that amazing.  I understand all the points of it, because I have to analyze it so much and write this huge report from many different  angles: review the book, write Achebe's life story, write Nigerian history  story, etc.  I believe, the main point of the novel is explained in the  title: &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, where Okonkwo was famous, strong, and  wealthy (he had 3 wives!), but by the end, he becomes just a regular, even  lower than that.  I've read better books, but since I had to do it for the  class, it wasn't that bad. By the way, we're relating this to &quot;Oedipus  The King&quot; by Sophocles, in a way of ancient Greek tragic heroes, and  how Okonkwo compares to Oedipus.  Another book you can relate to is  &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; by Franz Kafka, where Gregor sacrifices himself  for others for truly no reason whatsover (Kafka was actually explaining the  sacrifice to God metaphorically).  Those are the books that we deeply  analyzed this semester, and now it all comes together in this report.  My  teacher -- Mrs. Richter at MEHS.	2000-01-05

As far as content goes, however, Things Fall Apart leaves much to be desired.  It very well may be that  critics compare Achebe's masterpiece to the great Greek epics, but the  distinguishing scholar would hardly equate them with Things Fall Apart.   The Iliad and The Odyssey are eloquent and powerful, while Things Fall  Apart is contrived and lacks any lasting impact.  You will notice that the  majority of reviews rating Things Fall Apart as 4 or 5 stars are written by  high school students; one has to wonder about their credentials.  There is  a disturbing trend in the academic world to praise the virtues of a  particular work simply because it is &quot;black&quot; or &quot;gay&quot;  or &quot;alternative&quot; in some way.  Do great works have universal  applications, or are they simply limited in relevance to one social group?   A truly great work is not concerned with outward appearences, it is  concerned with Truth.  And Truth, unlike Things Fall Apart, knows that  color is irrelevant.	2000-01-01

US	50593616	R1CP99OWNDRASM	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Things Fall Apart	Things Fall Apart is about a man named Okonko, who is struggling to cope with the changes in his society. This is the story of a man during the begining of British colonization of Africa. The British come to Nigeria and  begin to disrupt the age-old patterns of African village, culture. Although  the British are dominating towards the small Nigeria village, they  cultivate Western civilization. Okonko is a character depicted as a  greatest man. However, he is an angry, inflexible man. Okonko allowed fear  to rule his life and this eventually lead to his sad demise. This book was  very interesting and formative it expressed the tradition and long held  beliefs of African culture, but also reflected the differences of Western  culture.	1999-12-07

It flows very well and I truly enjoyed every reference to tribal culture and customs that were made.  Achebe is able to make the reader understand  why certain customs come about and how they are not any more absurd than  any Judeo-Christian ones that we are so familiar with.  Although Okonkwo is  not necessarily a character that people will fall in love with, he is  definitely one that anyone can identify with in some way, and his story is  very moving.  Overall I thouroughly enjoyed this book and I would recomend  it to anyone looking for a light, quick, read with an entertaining and  thought provoking plot.	1999-12-07

Without judging anyone (and there are few characters in this book one would judge sympathetically) this tells the story of a man before and during the beginning of British colonization.

I could never feel pity for such  a weak creature. I have heard people refer to Okonkwo as a  &quot;brave&quot; hero. This is the same man who broke under the slightest  threat of change.

The tribe is taken over by colonial rule, and has to face the  problems that come with the white men.  The book is very interesting and  the events that happpen to the characters through out the story can be  related to every day life almost every where in the world.

The setting is very unique and the  time period tells about the hardships of people whose feelings are usually  taken for granite.  The point of view that Achebe tells the story through  makes you think twice about who you are and who your ancestors were.  The  book is great to see what happens when things fall apart and don't go  exactly as planned.  I love the inability to predict future events of the  book.  This adds loads of suspense.

The main character, though certainly flawed even in the eyes  of his own tribe, carries his pride and hubris at a breathtaking pace.  Though some may not care for such character development, I appreciated the  author's style in illuminating even the secondary characters as each piece  fell into place when the diffusion of colonialism took place. Fiction such  as this is even more powerful when one takes time to get background  knowledge about the Ibo of south Nigeria and their aspirations for  preserving their identity - not only in the face of Christian missionary  zeal, but also in the face of conflict and tragedy with the central  government of Nigeria as seen in the Biafra civil war of the 1970's.	1999-04-25

I really enjoyed reading the book &quot;things fall apart&quot;, but it was really sad when Okonkwo killed himself. i think that the missionaries should have stayed out of Nigeria and minded their own buisness.

US	51406482	RQLDEQXCMPXUI	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Original and unique	The historical fiction novel, Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, is a story about life within one of Africa's many tribal groups.  Achebe writes of his culture's rich heritage, and how it was affected by the coming of  the Europeans imperialists.  The title of the book sums up the theme very  well, about how the African way of life was disrupted by European conquest,  and eventually fell apart.  His simple writing style makes the book easy to  read, but his use of Ibo language and phrases makes it interesting and  unique.<br />Although Chinua Achebe's method of writing may have been very  simple and bland at times, it was generally very effective.  His knowledge  of both Ibo and English language and literature is very apparent, and he  manages to mix both very well into a wonderful story.  His strong feelings  against the imperialization of his home are widely expressed, but he  manages to remain passive, with little real anger ever becoming  obvious.<br />Achebe uses a very simple and `matter-of-fact' style of writing,  which proves very effective in describing people, places, and objects.  He  is able to create vivid scenes in the reader's mind with few, if any,  adjectives.  Often, more time is spent on explaining someone's or  something's importance in society, rather than what it looks, sounds, or  feels like.  Personal achievements also seemed to be held in regard, rather  than personality depth of character.  Okonkwo, the main character in the  novel, is first introduced among his famous feats, such as his skill at  wrestling, rather than with his appearance.<br />Throughout the novel, Achebe  includes short phrases and words in his native language of Ibo.  This adds  an interesting cultural flavor to the story, and serves to create a more  realistic setting.  For example, contempt for weak males in the society was  shown by their being called agbala, or woman.  Also, words which have no  English translation are written in Ibo, and then described to their roughly  English equivalent.  An obi, which was a circular hut, was one such  word.<br />According to scholars who have read and studied Achebe's work, the  novel is -- culturally and historically --very accurate.  His explanation  of social status are very thorough, and include everyone and everything:  from the highest village elders to the the locusts that fly in only once  every several years.  The roles of men and women are made very clear:  nothing in such an African society was ever out of its place.   Unfortunately for all of us, European empires sought out the lands and  riches of Africa, and the culture has been declining ever since.	1999-03-21

One is that so many high school and college students hated what is a seductively charming and moving novel because they were forced to read it.  Educators  should be thinking of techniques to get around this - perhaps allowing kids  to select their own reading from a list of titles, rather than assigning  them a particular title.<br />A second problem is that none of the reviewers  seems to even be aware that Chinua Achebe won the Nobel Prize for  literature for this novel. The Nobel Prize doesn't make it a great novel -  it recognizes that it is.  Why didn't their teachers mention that to the  reviewers?<br />Last, none of the reviewers seem aware of the powerful irony  of the subsequent history of the Ibo people.  The new Ibo society that was  beginning to emerge in &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; attempted to secede  from Nigeria in the 1970's, as Biafra.<br />More people were killed in the  resulting Nigerian civil war than in any war since World War 2, most of  them Ibos.  It was perhaps the most horrible war of recent history.  The  irony is that the Ibo people were massacred en masse, and Ibo society  destroyed, not by European Christian colonialists, but by their fellow  Nigerians, Muslims from the North.  <br />How could the teachers not have  taught their students about this, preparatory to assigning them  &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;?  Perhaps because they themselves didn't  know?	1999-02-11

Achebe concentrates more on theme and characterization rather than elaborate plot scheme and language.  What this does is it makes the book  easy to read for anyone, college lit student or third grader.  Colonialism  is a dangerous entity, we know this, but Achebe lets us see this by  developing characters like Okonkwo and contrasting them to Okonkwo's  deadbeat father.  We must feel sympathy for these Ibo people no matter how  simple they seem in comparrison to Americans because, in essance, their  culture was destroyed by propaganda, which is also what led to the Nazi  party, and political powerhouses such as Huey Long.  Don't take this book  as immature because it's simply writen and manifestly unAmerican, because  like any powerful weapon, like a stealth bomber, it's in disguise.  A  lesson we all need to learn lies within this book, and we can't overlook it  simply because we have the &quot;opportunity&quot; of living under a  democratic regime.	1999-01-07

The story is very moving, with complex characters and plot elements.  What I most appreciate about this novel is that it is so well balanced.  It is not a diatribe against English colonialism like it could have been.  Achebe doesn't romantacize Ibo life before the English came, nor does he condemn the changes which were wrought after.  He objectively descibes the transition of a society when elements of another culture are introduced to it.  For some like Okwonkwo the effect is devastating, others such as Okwonko's son welcome the change. He leaves it up to the reader to decide what is good or bad.	1998-07-26

Chinua Achebe, in &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, shows the exotic lives and ways of the Ibo people of pre-colonial Nigeria. The ways of the people are so appealing and so well-explained to Western readers, that we feel as though we are gathering yams from the farm, and offering agricultural sacrifice to our long-dead ancestors.    Achebe uses beautiful imagery to show how simplistic life before colonization was. The old-ways of the Ibo tribe are shown to be dogmatic to the main character, Okonkwo, who plays out to be more like a Greek tragic hero than an African farmer. Throughout the novel, are several Ibo words, adding to the strength of the imagery of the Ibo lifestyle.    &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is a great read for anyone interested in African culture and/or the colonization effects of Western society.	1997-04-14

The story takes place in the 1980‚Äôs, during a time when treatment, for drug addiction, was less than ideal.<br /><br />Desperate and at her wits-end, thirty-five-year-old single parent, Mandy, and her well-intentioned neighbor, Maureen, decide to take matters into their own hands. However, they chose a method of treatment that was shocking for even the 1980‚Äôs. In this day in age, such an intense measure would never even be considered, because of the serious potential for violence and severe injury to anyone nearby, including family members.<br /><br />Drug addiction touches just about every family in one way or another. Unfortunately, for some, addiction stabs at the family‚Äôs very core, making it a hellish existence for everyone in that circle.<br /><br />What I liked most about this book, was that it illustrated, just how fast drugs can devastate a family and what exactly a parent should look for. Recognizing the early signs of substance abuse or experimentation of them, is paramount. Once addiction has taken hold of a person, treatment is usually only successful after the addict has hit their bottom.<br /><br />Parents who have children trapped in the world of drugs will be able to identify with Mandy‚Äôs feeling of helplessness and remorse. The truth of the matter is, addiction is a cunning and insidious disease, and one that parents, especially those who are not street-wise, never see coming. If you know of a parent who is suffering, support them. Al-anon is their best help and tough love, unfortunately, their only answer.	2015-08-31

Highly recommend.<br />An incredibly moving story of one family's battle with drug addiction. In the late 198os in towns such as Edinburgh the level of drug addiction amongst the young was unprecedented. Medical and social services were ill-equipped to cope with the situation. This is one mother's story of her determination to prevent her teenage children becoming another statistic.<br />Through fantastic writing I feel like I've been on an emotional journey with Mandy and her family. From the first few chapters Mandy became more than a character with traits I recognised, I genuinely believed her to be a real person I'd come to know. The story is harrowing and brutal at times but always infused with the powerful love a mother has for her children.<br />Overall an emotionally charged book I highly recommend.	2015-08-26

An abused wife who had the guts to retaliate when Mike McCabe punched her once too often, she has no doubts that she‚Äôs coping well with her three children, teenage twins Mark and Jenny, and 11-year-old Jakey. Her life falls apart in June 1986, when the police take her to hospital where Jenny is ill. Maureen, Mandy‚Äôs neighbour, who has been down the drugs road with her two eldest sons, tries to warn her she mustn‚Äôt bury her head I the sand. Even when two men arrive demanding money Mark owes, and punch her in an attempt to get it, she refuses to face the truth. The atmosphere of the nineteen-eighties, before the dangers of shared needles was widely understood, is brilliantly captured, and the action Maddy takes to protect her children from themselves makes this novel a compelling read.	2015-08-03
US	49563288	R3026WYSHK22QP	B00XWCC66Y	955788147	Things Fall Apart	Digital_Ebook_Purchase	5	1	1	N	N	Brutal, unflinching drama about a drug induced hell for a family in 1980s Scotland	Things Fall Apart is a brutal and unflinching portrayal of life in Scotland in the 1980s. As I look back to my teenage years, it's easy to see that decade in anything other than a nostalgic haze. This is not helpful as we must look at things as they are.<br /><br />Well. The first thing to say is that it is a family drama of the highest standard. The MC is Mandy McCabe, a mother who does her best to keep her family together, but as they descend into a vicious cocktail of drugs and alcohol (though the latter seems gentle in comparision as a method of abuse), things really do fall apart.<br /><br />Part of the main issue I felt was the mother's often blanket denial that nothing was wrong, yet knowing it was. I am not a parent, but I can imagine protecting my kids from the outside world, yet might end up scolding them in private if they went off the rails.<br /><br />It's hard not to think of one of the most famous portrayals of life - Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting. The book and the film gave us a flavour of Scotland, and it is far from the national pride displayed in the recent referendum. Scots are a proud people - as they should be,but drugs is not about pride - in fact it will take your pride and leave you with nothing.<br /><br />As I read the book, I wondered why the author had given us such a hard read. Well, life is certainly not all sunshine, rabbits and rainbows. It's hard, and for some readers, the realism on offer amongst its pages may be a little too much to take. Having said that, if you do read this book, it's not likely to leave your mind for a while.<br /><br />This is one of those books that hits you so hard, I think it is best to read once, take your time over it and absorb it all. I mean, Schindler's List is a very hard film for me to watch, and to date I have only seen it twice. Once in the cinema, once at home. Its dark, uncompromising tone meant that I only had to view it a few times to take it in.<br /><br />After reading this book, I promise that you will do whatever you can to protect your kids and those around you from drugs.<br /><br />The first third of the book has a lot of police involvement, the middle third a descent into madness and depravity caused by drug abuse, and yet, by the third segment, I began to feel that maybe this dark story could have a good ending. That doesn't mean I wasn't put through the ringer, because I was.<br /><br />Ultimately I think this story is about hope - that through a terrible set of tragedies there is a possible sunrise that one can aim for. But I was genuinely shocked that the falls were not the final humiliation for some of the characters. Some of them just kept on falling.<br /><br />As I was reading I was thinking 'come on, get a grip.' But they can't. How can they? Drugs offer a different reality. No wonder the outer effects are so hideous.<br /><br />So why should you read this? I suppose because not every story needs a zombie, vampire, mermaid, or billionaire boss. Sometimes a book needs to bring us back to Earth. This one does, and whilst you will find it hard to read (not because of the writing style - which is excellent) but because it examines so clearly the brutal truth about drug abuse. When it is happening under your nose as a parent, I cannot think of anything worse.<br /><br />Read this unflinching drama. It will make you think that your next day, your next moment is one to treasure. When you are drowning in drugs, or those around you are, you really can't see the rainbow - not the real one anyway. But the fight is worth it.	2015-07-30

The book was a realistic and powerful story, full of emotional turmoil and denial, which at times, left me highly frustrated. It was also written in such an engaging way, that the main character Mandy felt like someone I was having a cup of tea with across the kitchen table, instead of being a book's protagonist.<br /><br />In the 1980's drug abuse was not as widely recognised. I believe many mothers and fathers found it difficult to believe that their little darling/s could get involved with such a nasty destructive business. I can say this because I am reminded of one of my family members at the same age and same situation as Mandy's twins. Denial and anger at the mere suggestion that a loving child could be so foolish was how my parents reacted, and it is exactly how Tracy Black wrote her character,Mandy to react.<br /><br />The realism, Edinburgh atmosphere, natural dialogue, and intense emotion, kept me reading this little gem way into the night. I can't say I admire Mandy, or the way she handled things with her three children, but I can say that she was true to real life, and very believable.	2015-07-27

Not only is she a single mother to three, she's also facing a parent's worst nightmare: drug addiction. Her first reaction is denial when told that her son is an addict. Not only is her son a drug addict, but her daughter too.  Her youngest has trouble of his own - a cry for attention. Mandy tries to be a good mother to all - but it's a bit overwhelming at times. How does she help her children beat the life of a junkie?<br /><br />I found this book gripping. It's a well-written tale that is very emotional. The author makes the characters feel real. There's a few times where I wanted to step into the book and give Mandy advice. Then, I reminded myself this was just a book!

Realism meets naivety head on in this story set in Edinburgh, Scotland in the last century. Drugs were only just beginning to reach public awareness in major proportions and it was easy for Mandy to assume her own darlings were blameless. Signs that are easy to spot now were not in the public domain so much then. The attack on her for money should have started ringing bells, but she doesn‚Äôt clue in, maybe because the alternative to normal is too frightening. Mandy must go through many trials and heartbreaks to accept what has happened and to attempt to make things right. This is a harrowing story of great intensity and, in the end hope.	2015-07-16

It is the story of a mother whose children get out of line with drugs. It is terrifying to read how quickly single mother Mandy needs to face the harsh facts of her life. The book starts well with a scene where she is attacked by kids for her handbag but soon after petty theft seems to be the least of her worries. The book shows with great honesty and without compromise the heartache for this woman, her thoughts and her emotional journey. Despite the bitter reality it delivers hope and understanding, coming to terms and learning. Very powerful	2015-07-14

This book brought back many memories for me as I moved to Edinburgh in 1991, just a few years after the year the story is set in. Edinburgh at that time was the drug capital of Europe and it was a rude awakening for me to discover that the beautiful city I had moved to had such a seedy underbelly. I quickly learned to recognise a junky. Working in the jewellery trade, a runny nose, glassy eyes and an unkempt appearance made us extra alert. It should have made Mandy, the mother in the book alert too, but she didn‚Äôt realise her two eldest were using drugs until one ended up in hospital to have her stomach pumped. Her son was by this time a frequent Heroine user. A lot of people might be baffled by her naivity, but I think Edinburgh‚Äôs drug and AIDS problem got so out of hand because people in 1986 were not as knowledgeable as we are today. What I found harder to believe was the fact that Mandy couldn‚Äôt see that her youngest son was having problems of a different kind. Her neglect of him, led him to act out by shoplifting. She should have realised that he needed her too and that his problem was easier to fix than the drug use of the other two. I thought the book was well written, and even though the subject matter was harrowing at times I had no hesitation in reading on. I can‚Äôt say that stories like this don‚Äôt happen anymore in Edinburgh, but a lot of the areas in the book have improved, especially The Shore. In the book it is an area where street walkers ply their trade. These days it‚Äôs full of trendy bars and expensive restaurants. Read Train Spotting and this book as it will give you a good insight into Edinburgh of the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs, but don‚Äôt let it put you off visiting this beautiful town.	2015-06-28

Hold onto your hats because you are about to go on a rollercoaster of emotions. Similar to what I did while reading this book.<br />First thing I should say is that I finished this book in less than a day. It‚Äôs an average size book, so that‚Äôs the first sign that marks this as a great read.<br /><br />Having said that (get ready, hope you‚Äôre holding on, because I‚Äôm about to get my rant on up in here), holy crap did the main character annoy the *explicit* out of me. Ask my neighbours, I‚Äôm sure they could tell you how much I was yelling at the super na√Øve mother who was repeatedly told her kids were addicts, only to have her turn around and say‚Ä¶ ‚Äúnot my kids!‚Äù Maybe they heard me yelling when she would slap her kids, then immediately say she never hits her children. Perhaps they even heard me yelling when she started shutting out the only child she did have who WASN‚ÄôT doing drugs, because the elder two needed more of her attention being junkies and all.<br /><br />Mandy McCabe was in extreme denial, to say the least. I had to keep reminding myself that this book is set in the 80‚Äôs so they didn‚Äôt have access to the information we do now on such things as drug addiction. They didn‚Äôt have the resources and help available we do now.<br />There were times where I put the book down, so annoyed at Mandy that I thought I couldn‚Äôt continue, only to pick the book up again less than a minute later because I had to know. I had to know Mandy‚Äôs kids would be safe and pull through their addiction.<br /><br />My husband repeatedly asked me why I was getting so upset. I started telling him about the book, about Mandy and her dilemmas. He turned to me and said‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs a good book then.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was being serious or sarcastic. ‚ÄúClearly the author wants you to be this pissed off.‚Äù<br /><br />It was at that moment that a light bulb dinged.<br /><br />The book is hard-hitting, and shows the ugly side of drug addiction. It shows the struggle of a single mother of three teenagers, all going through issues of their own.

She wasn't a victim when she recruited women to act as incubators for the babies with no parents so she could sell the little newborns to the highest bidders. She stripped away a large chunk of the positive reputation of surrogacy by fraudulently attaching the label to this unthinkable racket. Yes, Ms. Neiman, things do indeed fall apart. For people finding out that they bought their child unwittingly, and that their precious little one was treated as a commodity, their sense of security, trust and faith in other people was stolen from them. The children who will someday ask to hear their birth story, and be met with humiliated tears as their parents reveal how they were farmed for market by a callous greedy excuse for a woman, their sense of self worth, their human dignity, their very humanity was abused. These aren't things they will be able to reassemble. So when you say 'Things fall apart' you should take into consideration that they would be much less catastrophic if you weren't seeding the situation with dynamite before lighting a fuse then playing victim when the whole charade blows up in your smug face. I hope you never recieve a single penny from this publication of lies and slight of hand. Your feeble attempt to portray yourself as a martyr is a thin veil indeed.	2014-04-29
