From that time on, Kosinski became a favorite author.  Having read many of &#34;his&#34; (and as I found out recently - perhaps many of &#34;his ghost writers&#34;) books....I recently bought 2 copies of TPB sending one to a friend and re-reading the other.  Having just finish reading TPB I feel compelled to write a short review. Upon completion of this, I feel even more compelled to send an e-mail to my friend - to apologize for recommending TPB and pushing a copy into his lap.  TPB is a terrible book.  The story line follows the main character, a 6 year old boy til the age of 12.  And for not having any formal education but having witnessed the atrocities that should have made him a blithering idiot before he turned 7....he somehow survived and figured out, at every twist and turn, the things an adult man of 50 would have had trouble with.  Ingenious? For the author I suppose.  But stupid for the reader.  I can't wrap my head around TBP...this time.  I still recommend &#34;his&#34; other books.	2015-07-10

I could probably research more about it and find out how much of it was based on fact and how much was fiction, but that doesn't matter to me. I like the image Jerzy has put in my head and I'm sticking with that. I've read very few books that are equally as funny as they are horrible. Charles Bukowski can sometimes write like that and Louis Ferdinand Celine. Every WWII book you read, such as &#34;Night&#34; focuses on the war itself. I like that in this book, the war is always in the background. The troops stir up trouble in the towns, but most of the book is the horrors all the peasants inflict on each other in the meantime.<br /><br />Loved the writing. Loved everything about it. If you have a low tolerance for sexual things and people felating goats, go for &#34;Night&#34; by Ellie Weisel instead.	2015-07-06

It's the type of book I generally enjoy, but taken a bit further.... Too far, even.<br /><br />My favorite books are dark, strange, and unpredictable. This book was all of that, but instead of the happy ending to create some cathartic conclusion to the madness, it just sort of... Ended. You realize that this lad is completely, irrevocably, altered from the person he was before the war. There's no going back. Considering the rape, mutilation, murder, torcher, abuse, and unhappiness the central character experiences throughout the story, the end doesn't really balance much of that out.<br /><br />It's kind of hard to describe this book, but for the most part, each chapter finds the character in a new hell. He's an orphaned boy whose parents tried to shield him from the horrors of the war by handing him off to someone at the beginning of it. He is separated from the guardian,and goes to guardian to guardian for almost every new chapter. But I really do think this is a book many people should read, despite the horrors. It's important to read about what could have happened. I'm not sure if every single one of the things he experiences is a viable thing during that period, but considering the madness and cruelty of man, I wouldn't be surprised if many of these events did occur in some shape or form to someone during the war.<br /><br />It's a pretty ambitious work, full of so much darkness and sadness. If you're charmed by the title of the story, you should be warned that even that basis is not happy. It refers to a story the character sees in the book, about one of his &#34;guardians&#34; who &#34;watches&#34; after birds in a small village. It's sad, it's bleak, and it's depressing, essentially from start to finish, but I believe that it is still an important book to read to recognize what many people were capable of doing back then, and how some people in today could be capable of doing similar things.<br /><br />This book is not for the faint of heart, nor for the kind of person looking for a quick, beachside novel while they bask in the sun. It takes the life force out of you, in a way.erson looking for a quick, beachside novel while they bask in the sun. It takes the life force out of you, in a way.	2015-05-17

I'm not sure at exactly which point Jerzy Kosinski started losing me in his first novel, The Painted Bird (1965), but by the point I stopped reading (at the episode describing the Kalmuck vigilantes attacking the village) I knew I had had more than enough. Maybe it was the peasant digging out the eyes of his wife's young admirer with a spoon. Maybe it was the brutal murder of a local crazy woman by the village wives for enticing their husbands (who only get a scolding…after all, you know how men are…), which included such additional touches as shoving a bottle filled with manure up her vagina and then shattering it.  I knew I was already mentally done with this book after doggedly slogging through the extended chapter where the unnamed central character, a young boy who ages from 6 to around 11 during the course of the book, is repeatedly forced to hang by his arms from the ceiling in a locked room with the hope he will get tired and fall into the clutches of a vicious dog. Then it was on to the incestous/beastestous family and their midnight romps with the family goat, followed by the Kalmuck gang rapes. Oh, before that, there was the kid getting tossed into a pit of manure by a gang of villagers for dropping the missal during mass. So many enormities to keep in mind…  Horrors devoid of context quickly lose their bite. By themselves, the many episodes of cruelty and savagery Kosinski retails in The Painted Bird would be very effective, especially as they are written in a fine, terse, visceral style (which may not have all been Kosinski's doing, some allege). However, by essentially lining them up one after another in a kind of batting order of inhumanity, they become first dulled, then annoying and finally laughable. As you keep reading you start to ponder, okay, so how does he top the goat? Oh yeah, the manure...  I can't believe anyone ever thought this book was autobiographical except in the most superficial sense. Clearly, what Kosinski did was cherry pick the most outrageous folk horror tales he had come across, adapt them to his narrative and add some of his scattered knowledge of the culture of Eastern Europe (the &#34;comet&#34; for example) and paste them together into what is in effect sado-masochistic pornography.  The Painted Bird follows the travels and adventures of the little boy who at the start of the Second World War is sent away by his Jewish parents to live with an old Polish woman in a remote village to keep him safe from the Nazis. The woman rather addled but basically harmless. Unfortunately, she eventually dies, and that sets the boy on his picaresque adventures through the boonies of Eastern Poland over the next six years. Along the way he mostly encounters backwoods villagers who make the hillbillies in Deliverance look like the Roosevelts. They are cruel, superstitious and utterly intolerant of anyone who smacks of being an outsider.  This is strike one against Kosinski's claim to realism. Given that the German occupiers have no trouble reaching these supposedly remote outposts (in other words, there are roads), it's pretty unrealistic to believe they haven't been touched by outside civilization as Kosinski's narrative implies. We are, after all, talking about the 1940s, not the 1840s.  There is also his central character's age. Kosinski was stuck making him six at the start of his ordeal in order to preserve the (unstated but strongly implied and not exactly discouraged) impression that this was an autobiographical narrative, but my BS meter was ringing off the hook. I challenge anyone to show how a six year old could survive what this kid survives.   Finally, the book implies that the boy's dark hair and skin coloring gives him away as a gypsy or Jew. In Eastern Europe after its centuries of Mongol, Tartar, Hun, etc., invasions? Gimme a break!  For some reason, there are readers who like this book, thinking it as a meditation on man's inhumanity to man (and animals, as with the title allusion). I ended up looking at it as an exploitation of a horrible historical period to retail cheap thrills while gilding it with pretensions of profundity.	2015-05-08

The painted bird is any one of us who is different yet the same, part of the same flock but gay, physically disabled, of color, fat, whatever.  Some in the flock will turn on us, even destroy us.  The myth is realized through the wanderings of a young boy who is separated from his parents during World War II and wanders the countryside alone, left to survive by his wits.  Is he a gypsy?  A Jewish stray?  What he is, is different.

I here set aside all issues with authorship or biography. Equally, I set aside the history of this book's reception and the discourse that arose around this book after publication, a discourse that first defined the book as one of the great texts of Holocaust literature and then castigated the book as a fraud of Holocaust literature. Both those receptions are false to the book itself and speak only of what others would have had of the book.<br /><br />While the book takes place in occupied Poland during WWII, this book is not about WWII. It is not a book about the Holocaust: indeed, &#34;Jewishness&#34; plays at best a trivial role in the book, and the camps but a minor role. Nor is this book an indictment of Nazi Germany: if it were it seems rather odd that an SS officer is one of the kinder people toward the boy (the unnamed, main character of the book). But then it is entirely false to the book itself to try to read it as an historical narrative.<br /><br />_The Painted Bird_ is, rather, a mythic tale, in many ways told in the nature of a European fairy tale. It is the story of a mythic hero cast by circumstances outside his control into a symbolic &#34;journey through hell&#34;: beginning in what to all purposes are medieval peasant villages, then moving loosely through time into the larger &#34;village&#34; that is the communism of the Russian liberators. (But not moving &#34;historically&#34; through time; in this strange world there is no past or present; just the mythic now.) The question here is not whether the boy will survive the journey or be killed: the question is whether he will emerge the mythic hero on the other side of the journey, or fail and become lost, permanently, in the dark otherworld. To that end, there are two, primary, greatly inter-related energies within the book. The first is that which goes to painting the Bosch-like (not my phrase, but a good one) vision of hell. The second lies in the philosophies of being that the boy encounters, that he learns directly or indirectly through those individuals he meets on his journey. It is through these philosophies of being that the boy seeks not only the means to endure the physical difficulties of his journey, but more importantly -- and here we get to the central conflict of the book -- the means to maintain his individuality against the cruelties of cultural groups that at its core cannot tolerate individuality. It is a book about painted birds, yes, birds that are destroyed by the flock because they are different. But it is also a book about how the birds get painted in the first place. Most importantly, it is a book about psychical individuality.<br /><br />The book is wholly a literary work: well conceived and designed and very well crafted. Yes, the violence is to the extreme, but it is well used to the end of pulling the book out of an historical world and into a mythic world. (Even within the violence and sex one can find mythic, fairy tale, and old-world-religious thematics.) If you can enter this work removing it from the discourse of Holocaust literature that tried to claim the book as its own, you will discover quite an aesthetic, literary experience. _The Painted Bird_ is literature of a higher caliber, and it deserves to be preserved and praised as such.<br /><br />To note: I use the idea of the mythic hero with the intention of the connection being made to such works as Jospeh Campbell's _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_. The more I think about _The Painted Bird_, the more resonance I find between the journey of Kosinki's boy and the mythic journey as described by Campbell. Those energies go all the more to the symbolic and literary value of the work.<br /><br />Also to note, it is worth getting the second edition of the book (the current edition) so as to have the Afterward, written a decade after the original publication. In my edition the Afterward comes first in the text. I would recommend not reading it until after you have finished thebook. In truth, the afterward is mostly about the reception of the book, not the book itself. As such, it may create false ideas that might be brought into the book. However, once you have read the book, the Afterward easily slips into its rightful context.	2014-12-12

Overworked, beaten, the boy often runs away only to find his next home is basically identical to the one he just escaped. Author Jerzy Kosinski, who survived German savagery in Eastern Europe, made his tale fictional because it &#34;forces the reader to contribute: he does not simply compare [as in autobiography]; he actually enters a fictional role, expanding it in terms of his own experience, his own creative and imaginative powers.&#34;<br /><br />That said, the story was indeed relentless in its violent depictions, highlighted by a ruthless German attack on a village and the stomach-turning barbarities inflicted on a helpless populace. But after a time, you're almost numbed to the horrors because they're always there. In the aftermath of the war, we see Warsaw become Lord of the Flies at night as parentless children, used to living on their wits, run in gangs, taking what they will.<br /><br />A raw look at a slice of the Second World War unknown to most Western readers. And while well-written, with a note of hope at the end, it batters you with humanities' dark side.	2014-12-08

Attracted by the praise to the author, a receiver of multiple awards, I picked up an audio edition of the book from the library shelf. I will mention only the responses published in Harper’s (!). “Extraordinary . . . literally staggering . . . one of the most powerful books I have ever read.” And one more: “Of all the remarkable fiction that emerged from WWII, nothing stands higher than J. Kosinski’s “The Painted Bird.” Immediately feeling myself educationally disadvantaged, I checked the book out. From the very beginning, it sounded strange to me. The farther, the worse. So I was able to tolerate only two CDs. Then, instead of continuing my education, I went to the internet and found out my suspicions were correct . . .<br />From the beginning of the book, I could not make up my mind where the described events took place; what the nationality were those barbarian peasants around the boy of undefined age, abandoned by his parents at the beginning of the WWII? Then the name Olga popped up, and I thought of Russia. Olga it seems had bought the boy to help her with her witchcraft. Weird. I failed to make any association between the atmosphere of sadism and pornography described by the author, the brutality the boy was subjected to by the local peasants and the WWII. As the matter of fact, those were monsters and chimeras depicted in Bosh’s art in Medieval Europe. If Kosinski was telling a story about Poland and Polish peasants, then he probably meant to justify Hitler’s invasion to erase those monsters from the face of the Earth. A question arose: Could the peasants in the Eastern Poland be so superstitious, brutal, and ignorant in the middle of the twentieth century? I got the impression that Kosinski had adopted somebody’s writing about Medieval Europe and superimposed a few phrases here and there about the WWII. Indeed, we see no military activity, no damage from the war, nothing. We only see the wicked peasants who not only torture the boy, but also women, birds, and animals. We all know about the atrocities of the WWII (I hope), and we have numerous testimonies. Among them the Diary of Anna Frank who, as Kosinski himself, was hiding in the attic during the war. Obviously, the content of the book has nothing in common with the war.<br />But what struck me the most was that the known writers and respected literally magazines praised this book. I was deceived, I was insulted, I was misled. Why? I have no clues. I only know that a reasonably healthy mind could not accept this surrogate for publication.

So why shouldn't Poles feel the same way? Note that anti-Polish fiction is still anti-Polish, just as anti-Semitic fiction (e. g., THE PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION) is still anti-Semitism. The popularity of the book makes it especially harmful. So is the fact that 99% of English-speaking readers know virtually nothing about the actual situation in German-occupied Poland.<br /><br />Faithful Catholics are portrayed as ogres who would eagerly drown a child in excrement for accidentally dropping a missal. Misconceptions about indulgences are furthered, portrayed as they are as some sort of \\"Brownie points\\" with God, designed to bring fortune and avert misfortune. Negative Christian teachings about Jews are mentioned, but not the equally negative Judaic teachings about Christ and Christianity.<br /><br />This work also aggravates blame-the-poor attitudes towards the peasantry. While peasants indeed were backward, this backwardness was primarily technological in nature. Most peasants were people of upright character, sophisticated in their own way. They owned no monopoly on prejudice, cruelty, or superstition. Unlike their comfortable detractors, they had to work very hard for a living.<br /><br />However, this book also has indirect long-term value.

In choosing a child he recreates a self experience completely different from an adult’s. The novel builds on Aristophanes’ “...depiction of the citizens of ancient Athens where they are made anonymous in an idyllic material realm,” (Pg. xiii) where Kosinski uses the new language of brutality made immortal through the tatooed numbers that robbed human beings of their self identity. (Pg. xii)<br /><br />The boy is sent off by his parents to a foster parent in an eastern European village. After she prematurely dies, there is a succession of caretakers, who, either because of circumstance or convenience appear in his life. Some are maternal and benign, but he sometimes falls into the hands of others who are bent on using him for their own ends, especially because they see him as vermin,  a vampire or  filthy Jew.  Then unfolds a harrowing tale of his German capture where he is assigned to walk with a “bespectacled soldier” whom the boy knows is supposed to shoot him, but, who just as suddenly,  lets him walk away into the forest.<br /><br />Next comes a deadly, gripping winter which he is able to survive by finding various grains and other crop reserves hidden away by the farmers. The sight of people  packed in cattle cars moving along the tracks to the crematories. A child’s body is broken by the fall after being pushed through the opening between the cars by parents, or relatives, in a desperate act to keep them alive.<br /><br />As the boy becomes more exposed to discovery by other Germans, a crowd of frenzied peasants shout in their presence, “Beat the Jew, Shoot the Bastard,” when they spy him hiding behind a covering of bushes. A Priest rescues him by pushing the crowd’s leaders away with the handle of a hay fork.<br /><br />The boy takes pride in learning the prayers of the church withthe Priest’s help, especially in earning the extra indulgences earned by the memorization of the lengthier ones. He brings special opprobrium on himself, however, when during the high, holy celebration of the Corpus Christa, he falls backward on the altar under a tray that holds the gigantic weight of the misal. Grabbed by  a hoard of peasants, who lifted him up in a surge of movement out of the church, to the stench of a manure pit twelve feet square into which he was pitched.<br /><br />Descending through the accumulated layers of feces near asphyxiation and death, he manages to push through to an opening to gasp fresh air. He discovers upon his feverish and fanatical effort to get free of his entanglement in the pit that he had lost his voice. He remembers the last cry he had uttered was as he fell under the weight of the misal at the altar in the church.<br /><br />As the book nears its end, the boy experiences the retreat of the Germans as they faced defeat. He senses the sweeping change from their brand of terror to a kind of hope he had never experienced before the coming of the Russian soldiers in their invasion of eastern Europe. He meets Gavirla, a political officer of the regiment, who teaches him how to read. This Russian shows the boy an order of the world that has nothing to do with God with the counsel he is to remember that “...only the collective could determine a man’s worth and importance.” (Pg 192) The other Russian, Mikta, the Cuckoo, a fabled sharp shooter, tells the boy, “a person worked for a better world, not by praying prayers, but be excelling in his aim.” (Pg. 200)<br /><br />But the world changes drastically for the boy when, after being reunited with his parents, they take him away from the city to the country because he was “too thin and not growing.” He then lives alone with his ski instructor.<br /><br />After enduring an accident where he is recuperating in bed, “...his phone rings and somewhere at the other end of the wire...there was someone who wanted to talk to me...I felt an overpowering desire to speak.” His description of this need to speak opened his mouth. “Sound crawled up my throat. Tense and concentrated I started to arrange them into syllables and words. I distinctly heard them like peas from a split pod. The voice lost in a faraway village church has found me again and filled the whole room.” (Page 234)<br /><br />Kosinski tells us he did not write this novel “...as a chronicler of the disaster that befell my people and my generation, but purely as a story teller.” Then he quotes a Jewish concentration camp inmate shortly before his death in the gas chamber, “...the truth is the only thing which people do not differ. Everyone is subconciously mastered by the spiritual will to live, by the aspiration to live at any cost; one wants to live because one lives, because the whole world lives...

The horrors of World War II have an extremely powerful impact on any reader, however this book suffers two flaws so deep they undermine much of that power.<br /><br />First and foremost, this is a book told from the first person perspective of a child who starts off being 6 years old.  Yet the vocabulary, flowing prose, and literary metaphors,  from page 1 on, are that of an adult, which no child could ever possess. So immediately the reader is faced with an intellectual dissonance which is a huge mental struggle to overcome.<br /><br />The less obvious flaw is that this book is fiction. Are we reading the horrors of war, or the horrors that one man's mind was able to make up?  Both are disturbing, but for very different reasons, and can leave the reader questioning the value of what he's just subjected himself to, and for what purpose.	2014-02-21

The narrator is a young boy (only six years old when the novel opens) who has become separated from his parents and who spends most of the next six years wandering from one village to the next, either being sheltered by the local peasant population or surviving by living on his wits.<br /><br />As a boy Jerzy Kosiński did indeed live through the German occupation of his native Poland. The book, however, is not autobiographical, although the author did at one time give the impression that it was. The experiences of his narrator were not his own. It may be an exaggeration to describe the family (as one reviewer does) as “living in middle-class comfort”- comfort, for all social classes, was in short supply in Nazi-occupied Poland- but the young Jozef Lewinkopf was never separated from his parents and the family spent the war living together under the assumed name of “Kosinski”.<br /><br />The title refers to what the narrator describes as a folk-custom in the area, that of capturing a bird and painting it in bright colours. When the bird attempts to rejoin its own kind they see it as an outsider and violently peck it to death. This image has some relevance to the narrator’s own situation. The inhabitants of the area are predominantly blond and blue-eyed, and are suspicious of the dark-haired, dark-eyed narrator who because of his appearance is considered an outsider. (It is implied that the boy is Jewish, although this is never directly stated).<br /><br />The title is also relevant to one of the book’s major theme, that of cruelty. Yet despite the setting in Nazi-occupied Europe, virtually none of the many acts of cruelty witnessed by the young narrator are actually committed by the Germans themselves, although towards the end there is a mass rape and pogrom carried out by the Germans’ Kalmuck allies. The narrator hears dark stories about the concentration camps to which Jews and Gypsies are being taken, but we never see inside such places. Indeed, one of the novel’s few acts of compassion comes when a German soldier spares the life of the boy, whom he has been ordered to kill.<br /><br />In fact, apart from the Kalmuck pogrom and an incident in which a Soviet sniper takes revenge for the deaths of some of his comrades by picking off several villagers at random, most of the barbarism described has no connection with the war at all. Instead, Kosinski relates numerous instances of extreme violence perpetrated by the peasants against one another. A farmer blinds his wife’s lover by gouging out his eyes with a spoon. A simple-minded girl is battered to death by a mob of local women who accuse her of seducing their husbands and lovers. A guest is stabbed to death at a wedding without anyone- including the bride and groom- turning a hair. Murder, rape and incest are commonplace. The boy himself is frequently beaten and becomes dumb after being flung into a pit of manure.<br /><br />There is an interesting contrast between Kosinski’s language in this book and that of Joseph Conrad, another Polish-born novelist writing in English. In Conrad, at least in his early work, one occasionally comes across a faulty construction or foreign-sounding usage which reminds us that he was not a native English speaker, but in general he writes a classic, formal English prose. In Kosinski one is less likely to come across such reminders of his foreign origins, and yet it nevertheless seems clear that he is not a native-born Anglo-Saxon. He writes in a deliberately simple prose, in relatively short sentences with fewer dependent clauses than most British or American writers would use. Although his vocabulary and grammar are those of an adult rather than a child, this deliberate simplicity seems appropriate to a book about childhood. It also gives his writing a stark power appropriate to the horrors which form his subject-matter.<br/><br />&#34;The Painted Bird&#34; was a highly controversial book when first published in 1965. It was immediately banned by the authorities in Communist-ruled Poland, always suspicious of anything emanating from the pen of an &eacute;migr&eacute;. (Kosinski had left Poland for the United States in 1957). It was also unpopular in anti-Communist &eacute;migr&eacute; circles, who felt that Kosinski had drawn an over-sympathetic picture of the Red Army. Poles of all political persuasions disliked what they saw as a slanderous portrayal of their countrymen. (Although the country in which the events take place is ostensibly nameless, there can be little doubt that it is supposed to be Poland). Others disliked what they saw as an excessive concentration on sexual violence. Many critics, however, praised the power of Kosinski’s writing.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Kosinski gave the impression that the book was autobiographical. In order to strengthen this impression he made his hero only six years old when the war began, which would have been his own age in 1939, and I felt that this was a mistake as it detracted from the book’s realism. I could more easily accept a similar story about an older boy- a teenager, say- surviving in this manner, but the idea of a six-year-old managing to survive on his own without any real help from adults seemed less than credible. A real six-year-old would doubtless quickly have succumbed to cold or hunger, even if he managed to avoid being murdered.<br /><br />The story is unrealistic in another way, too. No doubt incidents like the ones described all took place somewhere in the world during the period in which the book is set; it strains credulity to believe that they all could have happened to, or been witnessed by, the same person in the space of six years. I also found it difficult to believe that rural people in Poland, or indeed anywhere in Eastern Europe, were quite as mediaeval during the 1940s as Kosinski portrays them. Thisatmosphere of mediaevalism was particularly strong in the first half of the book; only the occasional mention of a modern invention like tin cans, guns or concrete reminds us that the action is taking place in 1940 rather than, say, 1340.  Not only are the peasants cruel and violent but they are also dirty, squalid, unhygienic, sexually perverted, stupid, ignorant, uneducated, illiterate, superstitious, bigoted and every bit as anti-Semitic and racist as their German enemies. Kosinski implies that the belief that blue eyes and fair hair are the mark of those favoured by God was not a Nazi aberration but a commonplace in Eastern Europe.<br /><br />Kosiński's prose is certainly eloquent and powerful, but I have my reservations about “The Painted Bird”. Although it is set in wartime, in an area under Nazi control, it is less an anti-war book, or an anti-Nazi book, than the expression of a fundamentally misanthropic philosophy. The message is less “war is hell” or “dictatorship is hell” than “life is hell, and it is our fellow-men who make it so”. There is something depressing about the implication that, war or no war, Nazis or no Nazis, the characters in this book would have been just as nasty and bestial.	2013-11-20
US	52825207	R1O9SG7KMFUAC6	B000F9Q3H0	640122618	The Painted Bird	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Meaning and Belonging Against the Odds	There are few books that have changed my worldview and indelibly inscribed my mind with images that will last as long as I do.  Jerzy Kosinki's The Painted Bird is one of the few.  Until I read The Painted Bird I was convinced that Cormac McCarthy, especially in his novel Blood Meridian, was far better than any other writer of fiction at showing us that human experience could always become more painful, terrifying, and brutally ugly than anything that had gone before.  McCarthy did this, moreover, with a prose style that was a product of a mastery of English so complete and innovative that it read like a distinctively superior form of language.  The Painted Bird, however, surpasses Blood Meridian with regard to both its intensely horrific metaphors and the simple but richly detailed elegance of its prose style.<br /><br />I can't be sure that Jerzy Kosinski wanted to show us that life on earth, as he had known it, was inexpressibly hellish and could always become more painful and terrifying, but that is what he did.  Much of his account of everyday events is embedded in deeply disturbing images, gross corruptions of commonplace practices that are almost too alarming to read.  Once read, moreover, they are never forgotten.  In Kosinski's rendering, the good, kind, peaceful, and warmly communal are routinely and sickeningly crowded out by mundane cruelty and indifference, suspicion and brutality, xenophobia and superstition, insularity and vengeance ,,, the list of sources of suffering might as well be endless.<br /><br />With crushing irony, moreover, it's evident throughout The Painted Bird that the world is not inherently brutal and brutalizing or inherently anything else.  Even when the physical conditions of existence are impoverished and harsh, human beings, unselfconsciously and guided by cultural norms and values, filtered and refined from their fore-bearers, create the circumstances of life as we live it.<br /><br />Cruelty and socially engendered suffering have many proximate causes.  They include misguided religious rules and practices, born and developed over centuries in a miserably failed effort to make sense of a senseless world.  Elaborate patterns of superstition aimed at warding off the innumerable forces of evil and rooted in the same forlorn search for meaning and security as their established religious analogues.  Rules governing economic relationships that serve the interests of the few in the guise of practices meant to meet the needs of the community and all its members.  Political, ethnic, racial, linguistic, national, and other inherently inconsequential traits, as contrived and pointless as the color of one's hair and eyes, are invoked to tell us what it all means.  As such, these institutions and innocuous markers are the social tools used to distinguish members from aliens in fundamentally arbitrary terms that circumscribe the boundaries of innumerable, endlessly lethal conflicts.<br /><br />At the most fundamental level, Kosinski's novel bespeaks an effort across millennia to find a solid basis for answering the most basic questions:  Who are we?  Where do we belong?  How can we find timeless meaning in life?  Differences among us are troubling because they are social sources of doubt, rendering uncertain our best answers to these questions.  So we seek, by whatever means, to eliminate any and all things that intimate alternatives to what we have settled on.<br /><br />The character Stupid Ludmilla wasn't always stupid and psychotic.  Nor was she always slatternly, indifferent to others' interpretations of her failure to suitably cover her still voluptuous body.  She became Stupid Ludmilla with her socially proscribed lack of awareness only after she was gang-raped by men from her village.<br /><br />The women of her village, chronically uncertain of their husband's fidelity, later conveniently blamed ill-clad Stupid Ludmilla for their anxiety and killed her by forcing a homemade grenade into her vagina and exploding it.  At last, everyone could relax knowing that husbands were faithful, provocative sexual manifestations had been eliminated, families were whole, villages were orderly and secure, and the harvest would not be tainted by God's collective punishment for carnal sin.<br /><br />The Painted Bird itself was just a bird of a specific species that had been captured, painted garish colors, and set free to join a passing flock.  None of The Painted Bird's other species-specific traits could persuade the members of the flock that it was one of them.  The paint was functionally inconsequential, but The Painted Bird was rejected and attacked by the other birds, and it fell to its death.  This cruel trick was something that rural folk played regularly.  In the presence of an intimation of difference, the birds behaved like men, and the converse was also true, as we have seen.<br /><br />It bears testimony to Kozinski's mastery of language and the novel form the he was able to tell his brilliant but pain-filled story using a pre-adolescent boy, a social casualty of World War II, as its protagonist and sole narrator.  The displaced boy's survival from ages seven to twelve in the most isolated, insular, and brutishly difficult confines of Eastern Europe does, indeed, seem unlikely, though Kosinski's masterfully detailed account makes it seem almost plausible.  The boy's youthful naivete' and outsider's openness enabled him to experience conventional sources of meaning and belonging, one after the other, until it became clear that each was fiction.<br /><br />The boy's reverence for Stalin, however, was not remedied by experience.  Perhaps because those who taught him about the Soviet Union and its heroes treated the boy well, as one of them, with his own uniform, and they trusted him with secrets worth keeping.  It wasn't Stalin he revered, but the members of the Red Army who made him one of them and gave him purpose.<br /><br />Oddly, the novel ends very abruptly, with a two-page last chapter.  Whether or not the outcome is satisfying depends on the readers' interpretation and worldview.  For me, the ending is sadly under-developed, an ambiguous afterthought, and inconsistent with the rest of the novel as I understand it.  In spite of this disappointment, however, I'm convinced The Painted Bird is a masterpiece of prose fiction, a brilliant book that will leave those who read it with a better-informed, more sober and insightful outlook.<br /><br />As an addendum, in the early 1980's Jerzy Kosinski became caught up in a heated controversy involving charges of plagiarism, holocaust profiteering, and misrepresentation of life in Poland during World War II.  In failing health and wounded by his critics, Kosinski committed suicide at age fifty-eight.  I do not know if the charges against Kosinski have merit; if they do, he was despicable.

You have to read into his biography to really understand this book. He, most evidently, on the road to commercial and literary success, preyed on ignorance of the American reader about Eastern European IIWW history.<br /><br />The book alone can not and should not be read without understanding his life story which, by the way, is readily available on wikipedia.  It has to be understood that at the moment of publication Kosinski announced the book was autobiographical.  That, given the unusually harrowing circumstances of the main character's life, greatly contributed to the book's success in the US market, as it quickly became a bestseller.  The news about this success trickled into his homeland, Poland.  It was in Poland where it became evident the book wasn't autobiographical at all !  It was all a creation of his imagination.  In reality he did not spend the war as a boy wondering around the countryside.  What truly happened was that he and his family was SAVED and HARBORED by a Polish peasant family, which risked their lives every day in order to protect them from the Nazis.  Upon his visit back to Poland circa 1990, and confronted by his saviors about the book, he withdrew, avoided them, and failed to provide a good explanation for his book, which, indirectly, slandered these and other couragous people in Poland.<br /><br />The book's plot was evidently fueled by his vivid sexual and sadomachistic imagination as Kosinski was known to have been an avid participant of sadomachictic activities and SM New York scene.  It seems that in the book he used liberally IIWW Poland as an outlet for his sexual and sadomachistic fantasies rather than described life under occupation accurately.  He was also a known contributor to pornographic magazines; Playboy and Penthouse.<br /><br />During his late life, Kosinski was accused by many of plagiarism. Among others, his hit book \\"Being There\\" seems to have been based on a Polish pre-war bestseller by Dolega-Mostowicz \\"The Nicodemus Dyzma's Career\\".  The accusations made that he was no longer welcome in American literary salons but rather started being shunned.<br /><br />This fall from grace, from a best selling author to an accused plagiarist, seems to have contributed to his depression which later led him to suicide.<br /><br />In my humble opinion the American reader who is not knowledgeable about Eastern Europe during IIWW (very few Americans are)is an easy prey for skilled literary manipulators such as Kosinski.  The book has its value as an abstract, dark, harrowing and sexual tale. However, one must be aware that the book is not fact, it's fiction, and it can take place pretty much anywhere.  To me Kosinski is a master manipulator, a literary Bernard Madoff of sorts.	2013-05-12
US	49719772	RNWTWXWRQQVIP	080213422X	640122618	The Painted Bird	Books	5	10	13	N	N	Unforgettable tale of terror	The cover of the Mass Market Paperback edition from the 1970s of The Painted Bird features a small section of Heironomous Bosch hell-landscape -- dressed in sickly green and wearing a white hood, a creature with a man's body and head of a long-beaked bird walks on crutches carrying a large wicker basket on its back, and in the basket a small black devil with spiky fingers touches the shoulder of a wary young boy as he whispers into the boy's ear.  This is an apt cover for Jerzy Kosinski's fictionalized autobiographical novel set in Poland during the reign of Nazi terror in World War 11.<br /><br />I first read this harrowing tale 35 years ago.  I have read many dark, disturbing novels filled with brutality of every stripe, including such works as Malamud's The Fixer, Dostoyevsky's House of the Dead, and Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago, but, in my view, perhaps because the narrator is a 10 year old boy, no novel has its main character live through a more painful hell than in The Painted Bird.  Several months after reading this novel, the author himself made a visit to a large bookstore in Philadelphia for a book-signing, so I had an opportunity to actually meet him -- a small man with a thin, high pitched voice and sharp, chiseled fine features, a man who struck me as being both sensitive and friendly.  He appreciated my words of thanks and told me, when asked, that he was heading to New Orleans and expected to have some exciting times.<br /><br />Anyway, that was then.  Several days ago I saw my local library had a copy of The Painted Bird audiobook and immediately checked it out.  I started also rereading the printed book as I listened to the CDs.  The reader, Fred Berman, did his homework -- his accent and inflection and manner of speaking is spot-on Jerzy Kosinski.  If you are unfamiliar, this story is of an orphan boy with black eyes and sharp nose, labeled gypsy-Jew, forced to wander from village to village, subjected physically to beatings, rape, tortures, as well as murder attempts, while subjected psychologically to being treated as a messenger of the devil and an evil spirit who casts spells with a glance from his black eyes.  The boy is so traumatized from unrelenting abuse, he completely losses his capacity to speak for many months.

At first, it gives the impression that it is violence for violence's sake; however, it does culminate into a very deep insight into human nature. Society, under normal circumstances, limits the acceptable level of interpersonal violence. When the normal order is altered, anything becomes possible and the inner demons come out. The brutal acts described in the book seem fantastical, but really are not much different than anything seen on the evening news.<br /><br />As someone who has never \\"fit in\\" and has always been an outsider, I related to the unnamed narrator on a personal level.<br /><br />As to the question of whether the book is autobiographical, I do not think there is much of a question about it.

As a younger adult I saw this book listed in a bibliography of materials for trauma survivors.  Thinking that it was a survivor's tale, I read it.  It is the story of a young boy separated from his parents during World War II, wandering alone around Eastern Europe through wilderness and isolated villages. The story begins soon after his parents have dropped him off at the rural cottage of an ancient peasant woman and leave him there for his own safety.  Within a few pages the horrors begin: he makes friends with a pet squirrel, then some boys come and burn the squirrel to death.  The old woman dies and he has to leave to try to survive on his own.<br /><br />After this beginning, the story immerses the reader in scene after scene of horrible violence that the boy witnesses as he comes into contact with the uneducated peasants of the region; some of this violence is carried out against animals, some against humans.  The pet squirrel incident is nowhere near the worse tale the author has to tell, which should give you a clue as to the book's grim content. While reading it I never thought that it was fiction, since I had come at it believing it was a survivor's tale, and also because I did not believe anyone could make up stories like these. I continued reading, thinking that the end might bring some resolution, some sense of hope, or some perspective which could somehow put all the book's nightmares into a broader spiritual context.  That ending never came.<br /><br />Instead, at the end of the book, the author writes an afterword saying that no matter how bad things were during those years described in the story, they weren't nearly as bad as what came after, i.e., Communism.  Those words did not ring true.  I felt that anyone who had been through such trauma as a child would not compare it so facilely to a political system, even one as problematic as Communism can so often be. (I say this knowing full well the relationship between repressive political systems and smaller scale systems of abuse, a relationship which has been explored in depth by author Derrek Jensen.) The author's afterword made more sense once I found out (months later) that the story was not autobiographical, and therefore he couldn't really say that those experiences were less devastating than Communism. He had not truly lived them. He had simply told a horrible tale and capped it with a political statement.<br /><br />It has been over twenty years since I read the book, and some of the scenes still come back to haunt me.  The fact that the experience of reading it has stayed with me does indicate that it is a powerfully told story.  However, I see no reason to make up stories such as those contained in this book, when we are surrounded by ugly truths suffered by real people -- people, who in bearing witness to what they have experienced, can also sometimes teach us what meaning is to be found in human suffering.  The problem with The Painted Bird, for me, is that the author drew no meaning from the loathsome facts, other than to say that those (false) events were not as bad as Communism.aller scale systems of abuse, a relationship which has been explored in depth by author Derrek Jensen.)

I am giving this two stars because I did enjoy and was gripped by the first half of the book, and regardless of the apparent fradulent actions on the part of the author, I thought that the pain, torture, and punishments that the \\"unnamed boy\\" endured were meant to be allegorical of the experiences that the Jews went through in the concentration camps. In fact, I did not know about the author and the claims of fraud until after I finished reading the book and looked everything up on wiki. But fraud or no fraud and allegories aside, I became pretty bored with the second half of the book, mostly because I got tired of just going from one torture scene to the next.

US	44581654	RZLTYXZQT01AX	080213422X	640122618	The Painted Bird	Books	5	2	3	N	N	An unforgettable horror story	This is an allegedly semi-autobiographical novel of a young Jewish boy, abandoned, at age six, by his mother and father to fend for himself in the villages and country sides of German occupied eastern Europe just before and during the second world war.  The novel stresses that the boy has dark hair and black eyes, the complete opposite of the villagers and country people described in the book.  It was the time of Hitler's reign of terror, where the only people considered safe  were those with blond hair, light skin, and blue eyes.  The boy was left to wander in this environment amidst Christians who, if they took the boy in or attempted to hide him, would face grave, incalculable dangers.  Many believed the boy to be a Gypsy.  To the boy, who became mute early during his abandonment, he seemingly had no background at all.  The boy found work as a laborer for a farmer, Garbos, who for several years, continually punished him by physically abusing the youngster in horrible and unimaginable ways.  The boy necessarily becomes steeped in Christianity, and constantly recites certain prayers to himself that will enable to hoard indulgences that will eventually earn him a place in heaven when the time came. In six years, the boy grew up learning superstitions that would enable him to survive.  The boy also learns a lot about vengence against his enemies.    One of the turning points in the book, is when the boy meets Gavrila, a kindly soldier in a Soviet army regiment.  Gavrila imbues the boy with a sense of caring and self-respect, and promises to raise the boy if, at the end of the war, his parents do not or cannot return to reunite with him.   This is a powerful and highly disturbing novel, obviously not for every one, especially those who frighten easily.  I would certainly recommend the book to young people who might identify with the main character.	2011-10-07
US	11630747	RI1U67G7CC0XY	080213422X	640122618	The Painted Bird	Books	1	9	17	N	N	All in all a really stupid book	Yes, as other reviewers have indicated, the book details the utterly horrific acts of almost unimaginable cruelty by Germans against Eastern European villagers in WWII, but the author does nothing with these details.  Chapter after chapter of detailed violence causes the novel to become an exploration of depravity similar to Marquis De Sade's Justine.  It becomes violence for the sake of violence.  About halfway through the book, I had the feeling I was watching a bad violent porn movie: scene after scene after scene of contrived pretext in order to describe acts of violence for their own sake.  It's Stalag porn, titillating us with scenes of nearly unthinkable but largely pointless violence and very early in the novel the violence stops advancing the storyline.  It becomes predictable, and unlike truly great works that explore evil (like Conrad's Heart of Darkness) this book offers no insight or complexity.  Lots of human depravity--literally, virtually every form of aberrant human behavior gets time in this novel--but the end result is a kind of caricature of human beings.  The young boy is stupidly naive and innocent; the villagers unnredeemably evil.  Ironically, the portrait Eastern European rural villagers Kosinki creates is a portrait similar to the one Hitler created of the Jews: they are nothing but merciless, blood-thirsty, paragons of evil bent on destroying all that is good in the world.  So all in all, a very, very stupid book because it offers nothing that a reader has to struggle with or think about beyond, perhaps, becoming aware of German cruelty and the potential depravity of human beings--and if you're so ignorant of these things that this book somehow \\"enlightens\\" you to them, then, well.....  Just because a person is ignorant of something a book portrays doesn't mean the book is somehow \\"valuable\\" or \\"enlightening.\\"  It just means you didn't know about these things.  Faces of Death films and slaughter house video footage may be shocking and theymay make us aware of horrific things taking place, but that doesn't mean these are artistic masterpieces.  Neither is this novel.	2011-08-18

He observes horrific scenes and events. Seeing the unimaginable events through the eyes of such a young person, who accepts it as the way life is, is almost shattering at times.    Jerzy Kosinski presented this book as autobiography.  However, decades later it was proven that he had someone else write it for him.  In fact, it's believed Kosinski didn't even know English well enough at the time of its publication to have written it.  Basically, he took a type of story that was popular in early 20th century Eastern European literature and had someone translate it into English prose for him.  'Kariera Nikodema Dyzmy,' a 1932 Polish best seller, is what has been claimed he stole it from.  The controversy surrounding him led to his suicide in the early '90's.    Still, whether it's his or not, it's a stirring, difficult read, because of the horrors it details, but a very fine work indeed.	2011-03-29

Personally, I am a fan of stories, tales, and movies that beat you over the head and send you spiraling down into a horrible black hole or straight to hell - but there has to be more to it than that. I got a kick out of a lot of the brutally violent or \\"disturbing\\" parts - only the best of them - but often felt unaffected and felt that Kosinski's descriptions were often too subtle and quick to really make the scenarios very effective. Most of it brushed by me as pulp to be pulp, and in such a boring, repetitive setting - it leaves me wanting something more.<br /><br />I didn't sense much progression, or in this case, decomposition. Only the same thing over and over: go to the next village, learn of a new religion, belief system, or way of life - get used to it, then get abused. Then when you can't stand it anymore, leave and run to the next village - and repeat cycle. Sure, there was a subtle sense of his hope disintegrating eventually, but it was very much in the shadows. Towards the beginning of the 2nd half of the book, I started to see hints of what could take the story in a brilliant direction - but found that by the next chapter, he had abandoned the ideas and fallen back into the repetitive cycle.<br /><br />Basically, there wasn't much memorable besides some of the pulpiest moments, picturing a helpless little boy running through the woods with nowhere to go, and maybe the depressing idealism/reality behind the ending. It kept me entertained. The pace wasn't horrible. But for some reason I can't fathom sitting down to write such a repetitive story in the first place. If it were effective in making you feel more claustrophobic and depressed as you read on, then it would make sense - but unfortunately it doesn't have that effect. It just feels...flatlined. Still worth reading, but by no means a masterpiece of any kind.	2011-02-28

The description of the plot is generally available and so I won't repeat it here. The blurbs and descriptions in the book made it seem as if its autobiographical or at the very least based on a true story, with comparisons to The Diary of Anne Frank. When I started the book and began to get a sense of its remorseless and graphic depravity, I made allowances because of the fact that \\"these things happened\\" When I discovered that this was all completely fictionalized, I was not inclined to continue, since it is very graphic and I'm a squeamish guy and those are not my literary tastes. As I continued reading though, the accelerating orgies of senseless violence actually desensitized me in the way that mirrored the boy's quest. You become hardened and shell shocked by the depravity and also grateful for the small reliefs, brief chapters that don't climax in incest or bestial violence. You feel assaulted and end up cheering on violence done to those who first perpetrated it and ready to side with anyone with most rudimentary social codes which in this book is the Red Army heading to Berlin. Anyone familiar with the conduct of the Red Army during that time appreciates the low standards you would have to have to look upon them as saviours, yet the events in this book are so harrowing and filled with nearly prehistoric codes of interaction that the reader searches for relief in any vestige of \\"modern\\" concepts of decency and civilization. In that it is a brutal subject, brutally handled it is hard to recommend that someone go through the experience; I can say however that when you are done you feel like you have gained an insight and just a tinge of the terrifying dread that is part of this perpetual human condition.	2010-09-23

It is a fictional account of the personal experiences of a boy aged six who could be Jewish or might be a Gypsy taking refuge in Eastern Europe during World War II.  It is a fictional account filled with hate for Polish peasantry and packed with excruciating, horrifying detail of rape, murder, bestiality and torture.<br /><br />'The Painted Bird' depicts a journey through a very brutal and brutalising hell.  There are no safe places, really, for this boy.  He may have escaped with his life but he can never escape his experiences.<br /><br />There are good reasons to not like this book: it is not, as has been thought, an autobiographical account of Kosi&ntilde;ski's own experiences.  Additionally it relies on the proximity of the Holocaust to intensify its own horror; it demonises Polish peasantry as both cruel and backward; and it wallows in violence.  But for all of that, it has its own haunting power.<br /><br />I've first read this novel at least 20 years ago and recently revisited it.  I do not like the graphic, seemingly unending violence.  The point is made and reiterated: man's inhumanity to man takes many forms and vulnerability is often relative rather than absolute.  Did Kosi&ntilde;ski really regard the world as being beyond redemption?  Is that the question he was posing in this novel? Is that why he committed suicide in 1991?  Did he write this novel to give voice to his own despair as a consequence of the events of World War II?  For me this novel raises far more questions than it answers.  And some of those questions about the author and his intent colour the way I read this novel.  I cannot `hate' it: it is far too well written for that.  I cannot `love' it: it is far too ugly and there are far too many questions unanswered.  Instead, I `like' it in an uneasy sort of way because it makes me wonder about the world.<br /><br />I won't need to read it again.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith	2010-09-03

Among my main subjects of interest, which dominate my reading, are the horrible European history of the 20th century, and the literature by and about emigrants.<br />One of the best known, but controversial authors of the small group of writers who moved to the US or UK as adults and then were successful writers in English, is the Jewish Pole who adopted the name Jerzy Kosinski.<br /><br />He published this novel, The Painted Bird, in 1965, and produced some of the most heated controversies in literary history. I am not sure if it is at all clear by now whether he actually wrote the book himself and whether he really wrote it in English. The book was received as a semi-autobiographical narration of the wanderings of an abandoned 6 to 10 years old boy in the wilderness, actual and social, somewhere in an unnamed East Europe during WW2. We meet incredible superstition and brutality, not just war related.<br /><br />The boy is dark haired and has dark eyes and speaks upper class Polish. For the people in the flat country, he is like a painted bird: the metaphor relates to the sadistic act of catching birds, painting their feathers, and releasing them to the rejection and aggression by their flocks.<br /><br />In his foreword to the 1976 edition, Kosinski denies autobiographical content and declares his tale as fiction. In the meantime it had been established that his own real life experience had been much different, that Polish farmers had actually saved him and his parents by hiding them and giving them a fake Catholic identity. With this background, I must say I can understand the accusations that the book is anti-Polish. During Communist times, the book was banned in Poland and Kosinski was attacked as traitor and American influence agent. I am not sure if that hits the truth, but there is something very fishy here.<br /><br />Let's put it in a nutshell: I expected something somewhere between Imre Kertesz and Primo Levy, but what I get is more like Tarantino or Rodriguez without the tongue in cheek.<br />The novel gives us one scene of sensationalist brutality after the other. It is a picaresque hell ride, and the puzzling aspect is: the violence is not war related. It is practiced by the rural population on a peace time basis: sadism, rape, mutilation, lynching, blinding, whipping, you name it. I am disgusted.<br />Kosinski's 76 foreword refers to accusations of uncalled for violence, and he justifies it by saying that all war witnesses say that the reality was even worse. Maybe that is so, but the real problem is the violence level in the scenes which are not war related.<br /><br />Another aspect that condemns the book is this: the narration is supposed to be that of a little boy of 6 and later. Kosinski failed completely to give the story a plausible childlike voice. On the other hand, the events have too much immediacy to be taken for the recollection of an adult who remembers his childhood. This is all very wrong.<br />I really wanted to like this book, but I can't.The novel gives us one scene of sensationalist brutality after the other.

The nameless child narrator of \\"The Painted Bird\\" is one unlucky person, and so are you while reading this inane exercise in page-turning masochism.<br /><br />The thin, episodic storyline follows a young homeless boy, of possible Jewish or Gypsy extraction, who wanders across the swampy, war-blasted ruins of Eastern Europe during the early 1940s. One step ahead of the Nazis, who he knows will send him to an extermination camp, the boy must contend with the inhumanity of local villagers who seem to have become morally distended by the carnage around them.<br /><br />That Jerzy Kosinski didn't really live the life of his character in this story shouldn't be held against him. Charles Dickens wasn't Oliver Twist, either, and no one calls him a fraud for that. Kosinski negatively portrays the people around the boy, by implication Poles though he doesn't say so directly in my edition, but no one in this book comes off well except the Soviets, oddly enough considering Kosinski was not a fan of theirs, either. Such a profusion of terrible things happen to the child that it beggars belief, but Kosinski may have written this, like his later novel I enjoyed, \\"Being There\\", as a pseudo-fable, so he gets a pass on that from me, too.<br /><br />What annoyed and angered me about \\"The Painted Bird\\" was that it managed to be both cruel and dull. Cruel, in the way it continually assaulted you from chapter to chapter with assorted horrors inflicted on animals and people alike, all reasonless and unmotivated. Dull, in how it never manages to be about anything more than this awfulness, not offering a shred of sympathy, to the point where you just don't care.<br /><br />The kid, to start with, is a cipher. Very early on, we see him play with a friendly squirrel. Then some mean children capture the squirrel and burn it. Later, the woman who has adopted the boy is also burned, though she was apparently dead already. That's all the back story we get before the boy goes on his journey, to be relentlessly abused and attacked everywhere he goes because his dark hair and features make him stick out. (Is this Poland or Sweden?) People die suddenly, violently, and rather spectacularly, so it's good Kosinski doesn't bother making you care about them.<br /><br />Every chapter introduces a new group of awful people, with Kosinski apparently striving to outdo himself every time in terms of brutality. Eventually he introduces sex to the equation, featuring farm animals and an incestuous family. For me the most outlandish part had to be the man who ties the boy in a room with a killer dog nearly every day for a period of months, in hopes the boy will relax and be torn apart.<br /><br />Here, and at other times, \\"The Painted Bird\\" crosses the line from tragic to comic until it becomes like Robert Stack in \\"Airplane!\\": \\"Have you ever been face down in the mud, kicked in the head with an iron boot? Of course you haven't! No one has! It's a dumb question! Skip it!\\"<br /><br />People in Eastern Europe did suffer, and die, in ways like those experienced in \\"The Painted Bird\\". But it's unlikely any endured their horrors in the assembly-line fashion presented here. Tragedy can seem much less to an outsider who sees just the darkness and no light, to the point it's not clear what if anything is being lost.<br /><br />Kosinski may have lived through the war in comfort, but \\"The Painted Bird\\" seems a product of authentic if misplaced feelings that could have been survivor's guilt. This might explain the novel's insane popularity after its 1965 publication - a lot of readers felt the same guilt. Also, Kosinski's book was a bracing challenge of societal norms and a celebration of the persecuted outsider - \\"the painted bird\\" of the title sent out by a cruel master (society? God? parents?) to be pecked to death by its own kind. Any other decade but the 1960s, and you would never have heard of it. Instead it was taught at my boarding school.<br/><br />Great literature has the license to make you feel pain. But making you feel pain does not make a book great. \\"The Painted Bird\\" is an exercise in cruelty no one should have to endure.ing you feel pain does not make a book great. \\"The Painted Bird\\" is an exercise in cruelty no one should have to endure.	2009-12-14

I read it as a teenager for a required English project for a very progressive English teacher's class.   I was very impressed with the truth of the book, the horror that people endure at the hands of their fellow man in every civilization.  It spoke to me, as a child of a very dysfunctional family who had witnessed violence in my own home.  My father was a WWII veteran and I believe that this experience ruined his psyche and did not allow him to maintain a decent, loving relationship throughout his life. It is not for the weak of mind, those easily impressed, or for someone seeking thrills.  For them, stick to the horror movies and the monsters under the bed.

I note that, like most of my students, very few reviewers here understand the allegorical nature of the work, nor are they interested in the structure, language, and literary merits.  So let me share with you the handout I give to the students (university level)    Some Questions for Directed Reading and Class Discussion:    This book has become a classic in the literature of the Holocaust, which does  not mean, of course, that is beyond critique.  It has a certain contested pedigree (as you will read in the epilogue to the book by the author, now deceased)    1.  It is representative to some extent of many survivor memoirs in which individuals (and even families) hide out on the other side, in both urban and rural settings, including those who were children at the time, alone and on their own.      2.  Yet the book is also the most \\"allegorical,\\" the most \\"symbolic\\" of the works we read  in that it is meant to focus questions of the Holocaust on what it means to be \\"other\\" in society and it plumbs the imaginative depths of evil in new and memorable ways.  Note that the boy is never named.      3.  It also takes up the theme of childhood and the child as victim to explore more radically and with greater shock the effect of the Holocaust on our notions of the foundations of society and the nature and range of human behavior.  You might compare some aspects of the book with Burned Child Seeks the Fire.      Some questions to consider while you are reading.    1.  What is the nature of the child? What is the role of education, learning, moral values, and making sense of the world?  The nature of perception?  The desire for survival?      2.  How and in what ways does the work treat the relationship between nature and culture?  What do you make of the role of plants, animals, natural elements, seasonal changes, etc?  What are the uses of landscape as an essential conveyor of meaning(s)?  Are these relationships stable or do they shift back and forth throughout?  Note especially  the uses of the four primal elements: earth, air, fire, and water,       3.  How does the book work as a whole?  As a narrative of \\"coming of age,\\" what can you say about the organization of episodes?  Do they make any kind of progression?  Can you look back after reading (or as you go) to see whether you can make sense out of the structure of the book and its sequence of events?  How, for example is the \\"dialogue\\" between Christian and Jew conducted in the book?  More pervasive still is the issue of gender, of male and female relationships, and of parental figures (both maternal and paternal).  Do his role models evolve?  What in your opinion are the decisive turning points in the child's evolution and where might these lead in your understanding of the work?      4.  How does the author approach the problem of representing atrocity?  What are some of the techniques he uses to bring us into that \\"other\\" zone of unspeakable experience?  For example, What are some of the repetitive themes?  What role does metaphor(s) play in the work and what are some of the leading images? How do you read the questions of of silence and speech?  And what are the relationships between sex and violence?      5.  What episode (or at most, two episodes) seem to you to be the most powerful in the narrative and why.    6.  What do you make of the ending?	2009-06-02

None of these things ever happened! Want to know what actually did? See the detailed English-language Peczkis review of [[ASIN:8385458042 Czarny ptasior]] (THE BLACK BIRD-MONSTROSITY).<br /><br />Jews would rightfully be displeased if a popular fiction-masquerading-as-fact defamed them, especially if it was read in schools by impressionable children and teens. So why shouldn't Poles feel the same way? Note that anti-Polish fiction is still anti-Polish, just as anti-Semitic fiction (e. g., THE PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION) is still anti-Semitism. The popularity of the book makes it especially harmful. So is the fact that 99% of English-speaking readers know virtually nothing about the actual situation in German-occupied Poland.<br /><br />Faithful Catholics are portrayed as ogres who would eagerly drown a child in excrement for accidentally dropping a missal. Misconceptions about indulgences are furthered, portrayed as they are as some sort of \\"Brownie points\\" with God, designed to bring fortune and avert misfortune. Negative Christian teachings about Jews are mentioned, but not the equally negative Judaic teachings about Christ and Christianity.<br /><br />This work also aggravates blame-the-poor attitudes towards the peasantry. While peasants indeed were backward, this backwardness was primarily technological in nature. Most peasants were people of upright character, sophisticated in their own way. They owned no monopoly on prejudice, cruelty, or superstition. Unlike their detractors, they had to work very hard for a living.<br /><br />However, this book also has indirect long-term value. It reminds us of the ingratitude of many Polish Jews (not only Kosinski!) to the Poles who saved them. It advertises how the press is willing to publicize anything dramatic about the Holocaust, without first checking out its authenticity (and thereby causing more eventual damage to Holocaust memory than the tiny band of Holocaust deniers ever could). Finally, it serves as a sobering wake-up call not to believe uncritically Jewish accounts of Polish atrocities (most recently compiled in Gross' FEAR). Bearing in mind that the vast majority of these accounts lack corroboration, one can only wonder how many of them are Kosinski-style fabrications that tell us more about Jewish prejudices against Poles than about real events.<br /><br />THE PAINTED BIRD is best understood in the light of more recent works of the same genre.

A powerful, brutally dark novel, *The Painted Bird* is a masterpiece of 20th century literature whatever the prevailing critical/personal opinions regarding Kosinski and the many controversies that surround him may be. I'm not exactly sure how it gets the reputation as a Holocaust novel because the adolescent main character is neither Jewish nor sent to a concentration camp. He is, however, suspected of being a Jew, or, just as \\"bad,\\" a Gypsy, and under constant threat of being turned over to the Nazis as he roams, homeless, across a war-ravaged countryside populated by folks straight out of the Inferno.<br /><br />One can't read *The Painted Bird* as a realistic chronicle--that so many bad things could possibly happen to one person, even the unluckiest, is absurd. But as a \\"mythic\\" morality tale, as a kind of picaresque \\"everyvictim's\\" experience of man's inhumanity to man as specifically manifested during the Nazi Occupation of Europe, it is a profound and uncompromising and perhaps unparalleled tale of the suffering of the outcast and persecuted individual wherever, whenever, and whoever he happens to be in history.<br /><br />Kosinski spares us nothing as his young narrator passes from one horrendous scene of degradation to another. Perversion, superstition, ignorance, poverty, violence, disease, and death are everywhere among the peasantry through which Kosinski describes--and their counterbalance, ironically and appallingly, is in the godlike supremacy of the figure of the ultra \\"civilized\\" SS officer. This is a world in which Evil--both high and low--has the upper hand and the only safe place tobe is on the side that's strongest. It's a grim picture of life but one hard to argue against given the events of the 20th century and what we've seen modern man capable of doing. Those who like to point to the eventual triumph of good over evil at the end of WW2 are conveniently forgetting the horrors of Hiroshima and Stalin's Soviet dictatorship.<br /><br />*The Painted Bird* has the timeless, parable-like simplicity of the great Nobel prize-winning novels of yesteryear--when the prize generally was awarded for literary merit rather than to recognize ethnic and sexual diversity or to reward political agendas. A spare, slender novel but as serious as a stiletto in the fist of an assassin and packing a wallop that will follow you for the remainder of your reading days, *The Painted Bird* truly is one of those books you'll never forget.ess, parable-like simplicity of the great Nobel prize-winning novels of yesteryear--when the prize generally was awarded for literary merit rather than to recognize ethnic and sexual diversity or to reward political agendas.

This tale of a childhood adventure has dainty fable-like highlights intermingled with horrific accounts of the savagery of war.<br /><br />Like Grimm, this tale is not light on death. People are killed the old fashioned way: axes, knives and bludgeoning. Throughout this book, you occasionally have to wince as Kosinski describes such events with incredible detail.<br /><br />And, the senselessness of many of the deaths grow wider as the book proceeds.  Single murders in the early chapter evolve to mass murders in the last chapters. Some of the later murderous events include: bandit raids of villages before the Soviet Reds take over, train wrecks for revenge of a beating and the war's blowing away of villages.<br /><br />This story revolves around the orphaned protagonist (from ages 6 to 12) who wanders during the horrors of World War II. He witnesses a grotesque overdose of human indecency arising within the Russian citizenry.  Just after entering one town, the boy is forced to move to another. Each foster home is a worse nightmare than the prior. One foster parent has children commit incest upon one another. Another has the child hang on hooks all day. Another conceives different ways to beat the child.<br /><br />By the end, the 12-year old child is a young man with little concern of others' emotions or feelings.  Like  Cormac McCarthy's protagonist in \\"Blood Meridian\\" - he is child transformed into the devil incarnate.  Adults tarnish a child's innocence in life. No one but the adults can be held accountable for the child's demise.<br /><br />But, unlike McCarthy, Kosinski is optimistic. Maybe his personal survival and revival from Holocaust events lead the author to allow the young man to survive his purgatory called childhood. That is good news.<br /><br />Written in a choppy fashion, similar to a journal kept by a scientist, the reading is stilted and constrained.  But, after acclimating to this unique style of writing, it moves well and such writing style accomplishes giving the book a fictional feel to events which probably are oh-too-nonfictional.  I believe the horrors are derived more from  memories  than from literary license.<br /><br />To those with a weak stomach, stay away from this book. For those who like Grimm, or would like Grimm on steroids, this is your book. And, for those interested in Russian literature or history, this is a must read.giving the book a fictional feel to events which probably are oh-too-nonfictional.

The novel follows a young boy in his roamings through the Balkans during the second world war after he has been separated from his parents during a razzia. His dark skin complexion immediately stigmatizes him as a gypsy and this biases his journey that takes him to the lowest of human behaviour, which Kosinsky describes with great detail, but also with an intruiging air as if all of this is all very normal. The reader is continuously fighting against the urge to throw the book aside in disgust and the desire to know how the unfateful journey of the main character unfolds.

I have taken the time to read several reviews of this book.

The answer; more than I care to count. )     Face it people. Life is violent. War is NOT pretty, nor are the effects of it. I do not much care if Kosinksi made up every scene in the book from his imagination and/or studies of the effects of war, or if he did live some of it. This sort of horror happens EVERY DAY in the real world to those caught in a country ravaged by violence. Don't believe me? Watch the world news. Go do some research. Even if he did \\"make this up\\" he didn't \\"make it up\\".

In this particular edition (1976), Kosinski added a fine afterward which is a must read. Though fiction, this work is fact-based. Also, though Kosinski never names the country of his setting, one can guess it must be Poland. Apparently, the Polish government recognized it also since they banned the book in that country, citing it as a serious insult to the humanity of the Polish peasant society. After reading the afterward and the story, I can only conclude if the shoe fits...<br /><br />Still, there were a few things I thought to be unrealistic. Kosinski's ten-year-old protagonist is made to undergo some unspeakable tortures, tortures that would have reduced an ordinary kid to a psychological bowl of mush. Yet somehow this kid always pulls through, packing up his comet only at the last minute and heading into the Polish hinterland to rough it until he can hook up with his next tormentor. It got so bad that I began to look for parallels with Dante's Inferno. It seemed that each new torture was worse than the last, designed to atone for some imaginary sin that this innocent boy had committed. Dante borrowed from Greek mythology to formulate his keepers of hell--I wonder where Kosinski drafted his?<br /><br />The damage to the boy only became apparent at war's end when he was placed in an orphanage. There he found himself in a community of similar victims his own age. The war was over, the peasants were safely locked outside the city, yet the cruelty went on, and on, and on. The gang-rape scene of the teacher was particularly poignant. Somehow the protagonist regained his humanity--at least I believe that was what Kosinski signaled his reader when the boy regained his faculty--though I never was sure how. Maybe his message was that immersed in evil a good child can be made to mimic evil--if for no other reason than survival--but when that need becomes obsolete, eventually his true nature will reemerge.<br /><br />--Ejner Fulsang, author of \\"A Knavish Piece of Work\\" Aarhus Publishing 2006ow.

It really explains why some people in this area, and Russia, see the Red Army as great liberators.    It also, and I almost hate to add this, gives great insight into the anti-Semitism that the \\"Borat\\" film satirized.

It's also unbelievable that he put up with so many beatings just to have a warm place to sleep and whatever food they threw his way.This book made me think of Cold Mountain because there are so many similarities.Like all the fear, rape, substance abuse, lack of food, and anarchy that goes on in times of war. It really makes you appreciate life in the U.S.Most of us will never experience even a portion of what this boy went through. And he is introduced to sex by a woman who lives with her brother and father who the townsfolk think are strange and mixed up in some questionable antics with their goats.His worst nightmares come true when he see's the woman he's been intimate with engaged in bestiality.Conveniently,though, there's always a crack in the wall or floor where he's sees everything horrible that goes on around him.There is just so much random killing and violence.The only ones these townsfolk are afraid of are the rebel soldiers who converge on their small villages and proceed to rape,kill,pillage and take whatever food and supplies they want.You almost hope the Soviet soldier that the boy bonds with and goes on a revenge mission will kill the dog because of how cruel the dog was made to be to him.At the end the boy loses any consciencehe started out with and his innocence which was viciously taken from him. And all because he had dark hair and eyes.	2006-12-28

In 1982, Kosinski was completely discredited by the Village Voice for fabricating his auto-biographical, The Painted Bird, and for plagarism found in his most of his other books. He slandered an entire nation (Poland) in The Painted Bird even though he was actually saved by Polish Catholics and lived in safety during the duration of the war. Instead of writing what was a true war experience he decided that shock and brutality would give him more notariety. He became rich and won countless awards and accolades for his damaging lies.  <br />Before he committed suicide in 1991 he tried to make amends for the damage he caused to the Poles but it was too late. The Painted Bird has been deemed a \\"truth\\" and has been included on the reading lists of many Holocaust Study Courses.  I feel sorry for the Poles -- that this work produced by a sick, deviant and demented pathalogical liar could be taken as a true experience --it's like spitting on the graves of all those, Jews and Poles alike,that died in the hands of the Nazis during WWII.  It is a terrible injustice.	2006-02-01

Like the other novels, it is gruesome and portrays a life most of us would like to imagine didn't exist. Ignorance and brutality are part of the main aspects of this novel, as it portrays a young boy experiencing the horrors of ignorance and resulting brutality against him. Yes, there are sexual situations depicted; however, there is a difference between a sexual situation shown for its base nature as a foreboding element within the story and a pornographic description. (I'd noticed a lot of the reviewers couldn't tell the difference and snubbed the book because it made them feel uncomfortable.)  <br />Part of the point of this book is to make one think, and sometimes that requires making the audience uncomfortable. There are realities that we may not have experienced that exist despite our having not experienced it ourselves. Shying away from literature that shows the baser nature of individuals and a struggle of morals does not make for anything more than a sheltered view of the world. Take a risk and try the book. If it makes you uncomfortable, keep reading. A little thought about what makes us as humans uncomfortable isn't a bad thing.	2005-12-18

This doesn't make him a \\"pervert\\" or a liar by any means. I personally disagree with the reviewers that perceive him like this because of two reasons: (a) his viciousness reveals a side of the human being that exists and it's ok to write about it and (b) \\"Painted Bird\\" is not or was never intended to be a true story.  This is a Kosinski novel in which events unfold in an imaginative crude way: the way of Kosinski's imagination. <br /> <br />The reader is submerged and swollen into a way of life that is hell to the reader's eye.  However, this life is the only thing that this little kid has.  This kid was practically born in hell but when you are so young you don't know better; you don't know the alternatives so hell becomes normal and its unusual events become intriguing but not disturbing.   <br /> <br />The kid doesn't live in total agony.  He is surprised by the world as he admires and appreciates natural medicine, birds, trees, fire, and summers.  He is also surprised by people as he constantly attempts to interpret what is behind the extreme and sometimes appalling behavior of the human being.   <br /> <br />Konsisky aims at the reader becoming the kid.  He wants the reader to familiarize with the perversity of the human being.    This is not a story about degradation, racism, or war; it is a story about living in an atrocious but natural world where you are the observer mostly (a rejected observer) and not the participant.  And as the rejected observer, you make your own realizations about things, people, and circumstances using your imagination... and a child's imagination can be extremely creative. <br />	2005-09-26

A child goes from one unrealistic situation to the next in circumstances so bizarre they're actually laughable. Being a Black female I have always been interested in history and different cultures. I have never read a book this atrocious before and I hope I never do again. I do not think it is even close to a true portrayal of anything Mr Kosinski lived through. I find it VERY hard to believe this is a \\"semiautobiographical\\" novel or that it paralleled anything in his life. I think he is a storyteller with a very vivid, disturbing imagination. Maybe he has some realism issues and can't tell the difference between fantasy and the actual life that he lived. If I met him in real life I would definitely stay far, far away from him.	2005-05-07
US	31461686	R3VCZ7VQ1TCJB6	080213422X	640122618	The Painted Bird	Books	5	9	19	N	N	Graphic Excellence	I found this book to be the most in-touch treatment of WWII Europe I've ever read from a fictional standpoint.  I'm quite well schooled on the era, and this book speaks to the history in a way that is both detahced, but also frighteningly real.  It tells another side of the story...a side that is not simply \\"Jews vs. Germans.\\"  I, for one, appreciated hearing another spin on the war...horrifying as it may have been at times. <br /> <br />In the war, there were horrible crimes of hatred and cruelty performed.  Kosinski's novel discusses some of them in graphic detail (including some that had nothing at all to do with the war itself, but were just low-lifes being horrible to one another).  It is not for the weak stomached.  However, if one has heard the TRUE tales of what happened to millions of people in the time of the war, the stories in this book are almost tame--especially if you've seen actual pictures of the human-abuse that took place in real life. <br /> <br />Kosinski captures a different form of Europe during World War II.  It is not the Europe we have all come to accept as having been in place.  It is a Europe shaped by a child's perspective.  The horror and brutality seems almost bearable seen through the eyes of the child telling the story--a child trying to sort out right from wrong in a time where wrong was all that seemed to prevail.  The choices the child makes--though not always the most agreeable to rational thinking adults--seem almost logical, and his own numbness to the suffering he sees makes the reader uncomfortable, but able to cope with what is happening--what REALLY happened in Europe. <br /> <br />Read this book.  You will be streached far beyond your comfort zone, but you will likely benefit.  But, please, do not read this if you are easily haunted by the images that WWII has to offer.  You may see them for many nights in your dreams.  I'd say you need to be over 18...maybe 21...maybe 50...  It is hard to deal with in places...but it is absolute brilliance. <br /> <br />As for the claim that Kosinski may not have written this or other of his works...hogwash.  I've only heard this theory from one lone internet-would-be-critic who seems to have a vindetta against Kosinski, yet can't seem to stop reading his work.  Perhaps Kosinski's mind is not the only \\"twisted\\" one out there.	2005-04-23

The book opens in the fall of 1939. An unnamed, black-haired, dark-eyed 6-year-old boy is separated from his parents at the beginning of World War II. Wandering the countryside alone, the boy is mistaken for a Gypsy or a Jew by the fair-haired, blue-eyed rural villagers, and accordingly shunned. Even those who do shelter and feed him usually treat him with cruelty. But, even more disturbing, the boy's eyes are opened to the superstition-driven brutality with which these country folk treat their own neighbors, and even their own family members.<br /><br />This is not an uplifting read. The cruelty the boy witnesses and experiences often defies the imagination. Kosinski makes no attempt to censor his gruesome descriptions, nor should he. To gloss over the atrocities of World War II would be an injustice to those who suffered through it. Though the book is not, as some would argue, autobiographical, events like those depicted here did indeed happen during the war. It is probably safe to assume that the story takes place in Poland, though Kosinski has deliberately left out place names in order to keep the narrative separate from his own life. As he says in the author's note at the beginning, he intended the book to stand alone.<br /><br />The story actually spans the entire war, taking the boy from age six to age twelve. Over the course of the book, we witness his gradual loss of innocence. He tries repeatedly to make sense of a senseless world. For a while he throws himself fully into church, hoping that endless prayers will deliver him. When this fails, he decides that the only way to escape suffering is to make a pact with the devil. And when this, too, fails to relive his misery, he becomes entirely disillusioned with humanity. We see him begin, bit by bit, to embrace the very violence that has caused him so much pain. It is the only way to survive in the war-torn world around him.<br /><br />\\"The Painted Bird\\" is tragically disillusioning, yet weaves a brilliant picture of the boy's psychological transformation. It will leave you feeling empty, but raises crucial issues to the reader's attention. Kosinski has deliberately used a very young, innocent child as the protagonist in order to emphasize the destructive, corrupting nature of war. At a time when war is a distant thing, taking place on other continents, it is easy to glorify it and to forget what a hell it is for those experiencing it first-hand. For this reason, books like \\"The Painted Bird\\" are especially necessary, forcing us to look at the physical and emotional havoc war can wreak on a person. Though I would highly recommend the book to anyone, it is not for the weak of stomach. Be prepared for a dark and disturbing journey.ce that has caused him so much pain.

I have never enjoyed manditory reading. Then again, maybe not. This book had no plot. Almot every chapter had the young boy in a different situation, the author seems to have wanted to show as many horrible situations as possible. The violence, even if it was true to the time period, was incredibly graphic and drawn out. I get nauseous whenever my thoughts accidently flip to the eyeball scene. Besides, every young boy I know would have fainted dead away if he saw what the boy saw. I don't know, nor do I much care, if Kosinski made up every single word (it's a novel: historical FICTION).

This book takes place during an era which is morally irresponsible to candycoat.  How else do you get across the horrors that truly took place in most of Europe throughout WWII without seriously insulting and compromising not only truth, history, and reality, but also the memories of those who perished as well as the aging members of that generation who can never forget what they saw and experienced?  The awful things in this book, such as when the young plowboy literally loses his eyes, the scene the unnamed boy witnesses between Quail, Ewka, Makar, and the goat, Rainbow raping the beautiful young Jewish woman, or the pillage and rape-spree the Kalmuks go on, aren't in here to be titilating, but rather because things like that really did happen!  And what kind of disturbed person would feel aroused by any of the brutal sex and violence that take place through the book?<br />Some people dismiss books about WWII and the Holocaust because there are so many of them and they feel that after awhile, it's just repeating the same story over and over again, only with different names and locations.  But this book is rather unique in the genre, in that there isn't one single scene in a death train, death march, ghetto, camp, not even the front lines.  It's told by an unnamed young boy, only six years old when the Nazis invade his native Poland, who is shuttled from caretaker to caretaker.  We don't even know if he's Jewish, a Gypsy, or neither.  From hostile village to hostile village he goes, usually because he's been chased out by either the villagers themselves or the often cruel people he's been staying with.  He learns early on to survive by his wits, in a superstitious world gone even madder with war.  As an innocent, he cannot understand what is truly going on all around him, so there is none of the inner emotional and psychological turmoil we often see in other books about this time period.  He finally comes to discover that being nice, staying out of the way, even constantly praying, didn't help him one iota.  When he witnesses the scene between Ewka, Makar, Quail, and the goat in the barn, he realises what it means to be in league with the Devil and what evil is.  The boy now knows that being nice didn't get him anywhere, and the only people he's been around who got things accomplished were evil, so he decides he must become evil too, become like one of his oppressors in order to succeed.  It's understandable, given that he can barely remember anything but evil and suffering.  And already he's become so traumatised by all he's gone through that he has just shut down and become a mute, though of course he's far too young to realise the reasons why that happened to him.  And when the war finally ends, he has become so used to being evil and on the run that he doesn't know how to adjust to a normal life again, one of the great tragedies of any war.<br />I don't know enough about the man to know whether or not Jerzy Kosinski was indeed guilty of plagiarism or lying about his life history, and if so, how much or how little, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a work of fiction, perhaps loosely based on his experiences as a young boy during the war.  I'd see where critics get off had this been billed as a memoir, or a work of fiction said to be strongly based on his own life, but it remains a novel.  If this is a fraud, then every fictional account of a historical event that really happened is a fraud too, as well as novels loosely based on something that may have happened in the author's own life.

Kozinski's perceptions of humanity are poignant, surgical, honest and brutal.

As Kosinski shows us, cruelty is intrinsic, and any moral or lesson drawn by historians pales when compared with the incomprehensible reality of an event. The Polish villagers misreat the protagonist viciously while a Nazi soldier actually takes pity on him; rather than finding relief on his return to society, he is disgusted and coddled by it. The only largely good characters in the novel, the Russians, constantly harp on the goodness of Stalin (and we know the truth). World War Two may be more complex than anyone can ever show, but Kosinski admits that complexity as not many people have attempted to. I was surprised, also, by the sympathy that Kosinski develops for the protagonist. The kid is _tough_, simply, and there's something very endearing about it; also, the way he constantly tries to figure out the world, throwing in his lot with God, and then with the Devil, and then with the communists, is extremely relatable; it's the sort of conflict any child goes through. Viewed from a certain angle, it's just an incredibly twisted coming-of-age story.	2004-03-17

In fact, I stopped at about chapter 6 or 7. I'm an avid reader, and usually don't mind long I.E. five hundred plus paged books. Perhaps I have no imagination, but the main reason I forebore to read the rest of this, is that there were too many unanswered questions for me, most importantly, how does this boy (we never learn his name) escape from each of his cruel caretakers? The author never shows him actually running away from the villages, except for the first one, and it's never made clear how he spends his days, or why certain people take him in, and others couldn't be bothered. I don't despise this book, but I'm definitely not a fan of spare writing, and this thing's certainly full of that. The violence and hints of deviant sexual behaviors weren't extremely off-putting either, although that long description of the gouging out and disposing of a youth's eye was more than a little nauseating.	2004-02-18

It's been several years since reading this novel,but what I can say is that for the most part it was the title that helped define the book for me.Yes,it's a story about a young parentless  Jewish  boy that roams Eastern Europe during the second World War and does contain graphic depictions of somewhat gory scenes,but all to a purpose.The young boy is speechless and all throughout the story is encountering a variety of situations that is incomprehensible for someone his age,but still he struggles to define what surrounds him.The title in itself is very important for it is represented in the story.The youth encounters a bird catcher that uses the ploy of painting a bird of one species to capture that of a different species,which after discovering it's a painted bird pecks it to death.To me it was a metaphor for how the jewish population attempted to adapt to the harsh surroundings of the time period,but inevitably were sacrificed.Kosinski presents a complex portrayal of cruelty which unfortunately must be admitted as being a portion of the modern world where a holocaust has numbed us to the nuances of man's inhumanity.Kosinski's novel works on a variety of levels,but to me it is mainly addressing the question of identity and how one becomes defined by experiences.The novel is as complex as is the personality of Kosinski,who has written under several pseudonyms.The &quot;Painted Bird&quot; is a novel with very vivid descriptions that has a psychological hue to it that is unforgettable after reading!It can only help to broaden one's mental horizon and get a glimpse into another man's soul,be it ever so dark and brooding!	2003-10-17

It was either this or Agony and the Ecstasy that I wanted, and this was shorter, so I picked this one.  No one else did out of the hundreds of other titles they could choose.  I read The Painted Bird from start to finish, apalled yet enthralled by all this young boy went through.  You are pulled into this morbid odyssey and share his travels with him.  You experience the depravity and debauchery of humanity's darker side that cannot be ignored nor disproved.  We all know it's there.  This book does not allow us to hide from this theme, nor spares us from it by the tale's end.  The aftermath is at an orphanage, a microcosm of children no longer innocent after witnessing the atrocities of adults, suddenly placed into an ordered society and expected to assume a happy-go-lucky niche again.  It doesn't happen, it won't happen, and though by the tale's end, our protagonist seems to have a hopeful future, his past has been forever sullied with the smarmy truth that will always cast a dark shadow on all of his future, no matter how bright it may shine at times.<br />Anybody who likes to read should pick up this book and experience this.  It is seven years later, and I have since bought the book.  It has inspired me in my own writing style.  This is a true literary gem, a classic beauty despite the brutality it depicts.	2003-06-29

And i was surprised - maybe the Polish version was different somehow from English one? First of all, in book i've read, the child is not Gypsy or Jewish. The peasants consider it Gypsy or Jewish, but we don't know anything about it, in fact, we can be quite sure (from the poems it knows) that it is child from Polish intelligentsia. <br />I've read this is anti-Polish book. It is not. <br />Peasants are not Poles (Just see the names: Makar, Anton, Olga - these are not Polish names). They are peasants from, i think, somewhere from Polesie considering description of landscape. They are not Catholic, they are both Catholic and Orthodox. <br />It is too cruel, i was tired by the end of the book by endless horrors, but it does show how evil can be as virus, as young kid became as cruel as those who were bullying it before. <br />Anyway, i just couldn't stop reading it - even when shrugging sometimes with description of Germans or Russians (only positive characters in the book). Just can't understand other people reviews. I guess they read different book.	2003-01-02

Jerzy Kozinski's Painted Bird is a stunning & frank portrayal of the odyssey of a young boy, mistaken for gypsy or Jew, learning to survive on his own wits in Eastern Europe in WWII.<BR>It is often shocking & frequently raw, but above all of that, there is a shining glory because it aims to get the reader to examine their moral compass. You can't do that with a candied over book when you're talking about holocaust. This book will change you for the better if you let it & ignore criticisms from people who think that morality is only about painting a rosy picture. Kozinski wants to get a rise out of you with this tale, but for righteous anger, not titillation.<br />   This book and its author are frequently maligned for the most idiotic reasons. Whether it's the alleged \\"historical inaccuracy\\" charges, or the brainless snipes about it being sensationalistic exhibitionism and violence, none of the charges seem to get to the heart of Painted Bird, Kozinski's masterpiece.<br />   First off, the atrocities in the book that happen to the little boy are voyeuristicly described because Kosinski wants to place you up front as if a real war is going on, and you have to make moral choices. It's naked and it's brutal. Most people are expecting The Diary Of Anne Frank when they read this, and they want to be coddled & sheltered in an attic like that book, awaiting the atrocities in the company of family not knowing what's going on outside*. Kozinski doesn't do that. He puts you in a frame of reference of being in the war with immediate threat to life & dignity, all shown through the psyche of a little boy who represents the future of the world & what will happen to it from the conflict.<br />    Secondly, charges have been levelled against this book for it portraying the WWII peasants too cruelly. This misses the point of the book, of course. The author was trying to encapsulate the essence of ALL purges, ALL \\"ethnic cleansing\\", therefore it is about ALL holocausts from world history from the mongol hordes to Stalin to Bosnia & Hussein. People who nitpick over the book's \\"historical correctness\\" miss its MORAL correctness.<br />    The joy in reading this book has nothing to do with any of the lurid situations, but in seeing the boy learn to fight for his innocence & survive. Of course he doesn't come out unscathed and I think many people are angry with the author for not having a tidy finish. They shouldn't be; this isn't a whitewash job done as a lullaby Hollywood script, but an opinion about inhumanity. The holocaust wasn't a damn amusement park history recreation that we should observe from the safety of our cars. It was and IS possible. In this book, Kozinski is trying to make you highly aware of the ease with which it could happen to you, and he wants to shred your denial & complacency away. Some people don't like that because they've held on to their security blanket of ego too hard.<br />   For those of you unfamiliar with this book, read it. Yes, it may shock your conscience, but that is a GOOD thing. It may inspire you to bring some more humanity & compassion into the world for your fellow human beings. This book is NOT about despair & corruption & the wickedness of mankind, but about the fact that we can cope with almost ANYTHING if we try.<br />  And that's beautiful.	2002-12-06

He was never seperated from his family, in fact the very peasants/villagers he slanders and makes to appear bad saved not only his life, but the rest of his family. Why the big stink over Kosinski now (for the past ten years actually) is because the guy always insisted that this stuff was all true and that he had lived through it. The man &quot;borrowed&quot; passages from other writers' works and reworked them as his own and made them part of his books. Another example is Being There--&quot;borrowed&quot; from The Career of Nikodem Dyzma, etc. Kosinski, it seems, was a decent idea man, but the writing was done by others. None would begrudge a writer using proofers, they all do it, Hemingway, Thomas Wolf, all of them (nothing wrong with that. A writer can be a fine storyteller, but lousy at spelling, as well as unable to see his own mistakes, errors, etc. So this is acceptable...) but this guy Kosinski sems to have gone way beyond that. Read James Park Sloan's biography if you need more facts--although Sloan is not a great writer himself (the book is flat) but entails plenty of facts). Kosinsky, no doubt, was a troubled guy, a mess, scarred--and his primary goal once he got to New York was to become a success--at any cost. And in the end, it cost him his life. Perhaps if he had taken the time to learn the craft of storytelling...it may have worked out better for him...but even there raw talent is required and the ability to beat the language (not your own) one has chosen to write in. Quite a task--and Kosinski knew he was not up to the task. His way of getting over that obstacle was to employ others to do the actual writing. Are we saying here that the guy was totally worthless as a human being? No, we're not. Are we saying that the man hadn't suffered and been put through plenty psychologically during WWII? Of course not. All we're saying here is that hisfacade of the great writer was just that: a facade. A con job, that made him famous and paid him plenty--but also helped destroy him when his luck ran out in the end. In a perfect and fair world the Oscar for Being There would have gone  (if posthumously) to the author of The Career of Nikodem Dyzma for having created the original book the movie was based on, etc. <BR>Kosinski hungered for the brass ring at any price...  James M. Cain in his Double Indemnity gave us fair warning about that:  Careful  what you wish for.	2002-10-30

Kosinski experienced some of these savage torments as a boy following WWII.  The book is broad enough to not just capture the ugliness of war and hatred, but the true meaning of being different, being discriminated against and being alienated in the worst way because of the color of your skin (hair, and eyes).  The happy moments experienced in the book are basic and essential pieces of everyday life that we all take for granted.  Historically, based on Jerzy Kosinsky's own life, the events of his own childhood couldn't be overcome--dying with his own demons banging on the door.	2002-10-22

There was only one decent book in it - The Painted Bird. It really put the world in perspective for me; I read it many times over during the next few weeks, and I have kept it close at hand in the 12 years since.<br />It explains human nature and society with a clarity that no other book can achieve; only Gulliver's Travels and Macbeth come close. As pretygrrl said, the images &quot;are absolutely unforgettable&quot; &quot;and yet, this book is impossible to put down&quot;. It is a pity that some readers think the book is defamatory to the human race, or to Polish peasants; quit fooling yourself...this is what human beings are like!<br />The title image derives fro a bird-catcher and -seller who in a moment of drunkenness takes one of his birds, paints his feathers in strange, gaudy colours, then releases him. The bird flies back to his flock...which tears him to pieces as an unrecognizable outsider. This is almost what happens to the young boy on the run in wartime Poland, as his skin-colour is slightly darker, and the peasants torture and beat him.<br />I have lived in different parts of the world and I feel like a stranger everywhere I go. But I regard Kosinski as a fellow spirit, along with Kafka and Genet, so my country is the&quot;Republic of Letters.<br />This book is written in simple language that small children can understand; I would like to know what elementary school students think of this book.	2002-08-28

Sure, it's got a plot; sure, it's got a theme; sure, it illustrates without sugar-coating the violence and mental effects of World War II; but aside from that, it's like porn, except with killing instead of sex. I didn't think I could be any further desensitized to violence after Blade II and an extensive series of concentration-camp documentaries, but I guess I was wrong! The trouble with this book is that the shock and horror of rape, murder, torture, animal abuse, etc. ad infinitum paralyzes your thinking processes, masking the theme. This book is a failure of advertising: nice themes, but it can't connect to the reader at ALL.

He grows up on the streets and learns about life firsthand and sees how terrible it can be.  Kozinski, using brilliant prose, also instructs the reader on exactly how awful life is for some people.  This book does contain images that may shock or offend people, but for the person who can put all the brutal violence and sex aside, there is a story that is powerful because of the truth it contains.  Kozinski obviously thought a lot about how he would teach the readers about the cruel reality that they live in, and he found it appropriate to choose scenes that not all readers will enjoy.  Kozinski discovered that the only way to give the reader a sense of how harsh life is, he had to write an \\"in your face\\" provocative novel with many scenes which test the limits of    censorship.  <br />      As the main character grows older, he experiences more.  Since he has no parents to teach him any values, he takes in <BR>what he sees and creates his own set of values.  The boy discovers that the most important asset in life is power.  He believes that power is the key to surviving in the world.  He makes many attempts to gain power, but multiple times must bear witness to his own powerlessness.  A culmination of all this results in the loss of a source of inumerable power, his words.  Kozinski portrays very well and very accurately the struggle between the boy and the rest of the world and the hardships he must deal with.  He has no parents to turn to, most other adults he meets beat him, and children of his own age cruelly killed the boy's best friend in front of his eyes.  With nobody to turn to, he learns to live by himself and for himself.<br />      Overall the Painted Bird is an amazing book.  Kozinski is a brilliant author who does not \\"sugar coat\\" any of the aspects of life he describes.  There will definitely be people who can not handle this book or do not want to handle it.  This book is recommended to any avid reader.  This easily ranks among the best books ever written and is one that the reader will never forget.<br />      I apologize for not properly using italics for the title of the book as demonstrated in the Harbrace College Handbook.	2002-05-01

I agree to a limited extent. While the subject matter is unwaveringly wretched, the story is compelling in an horrific way, and the prose outstanding, considering English is not the author's native tongue. I did, however, regret reading The Painted Bird for, as it turns out, it is a sham.<br />Having widely suggested that it was semi-autobiographical, Mr. Kosinski recounts horror after horror experienced by a six-year old boy sent away to escape the Holocaust. It seems, however, that the story is not at all autobiographical, but rather a product of his imagination.<br />Now, I have nothing against an author's dark imagination, and in fact, enjoy reading tales of misery and maltreatment. I do, however, object to being misled, for then one must reevaluate the misery depicted (and the appreciation thereof) in context of its believability; in this case negating the fact that this story really took place, and therefore having to negate the outrageous behaviors as believable. If the story is indeed made out of whole cloth, then one sees The Painted Bird merely as a series of unrelated ugly scenes pieced together, endlessly, with no redeeming value. It turns out the Polish peasants were not the aberations depicted; the violence not founded; and the sexual monstrosities exaggerated for the maximum effect. In which case, the story becomes little more than a violent piece of sadism and pornography, not a realistic portrayal of the savageness of WWII, and therefore unbelievable even as a work of fiction.<br />I strongly suggest you read James Park Sloan's biography of Jerzy Kosinski before you read The Painted Bird. You will see a picture of the author that will make you think twice about whether this book is the masterpiece some think it is. I wish I had read it first.	2002-03-24

I really didn't care too much for reading the assigned books, but once I picked this book up, I just couldn't put it down.  I was a teenager at the time experiencing what every teenager experiences...the hard times of growing up...the why me's...the my life can't get any worse, but then I saw that a child of only 6 years old could experience such cruelty in the world.  It brought tears to my eyes and gave me more appreciation for my own life.  I am very happy that my teacher made us read this book because it would have never reached my hands and changed my life if he didn't.  I say that Kosinski did a great job portraying what the world was like in that time period.  If it is not assigned reading to my child when she is a senior, then I shall share the book with her myself.  I would love to see this book as a movie.

It is the closest thing to a tour of hell that the 20C could provide.<br />The story centers around a sensitive and intelligent child, who was left in the hands of a caretaker in the countryside during WWII.  When the caretaker dies suddenly, the child is left to fend for himself in the Polish countryside, where the population is superstitious and poverty stricken.  He lived through a succession of horrors, including beatings, exposure to sex, and threats to his life.  He survives, of course, and makes extremely interesting observations with the clarity - and peculiar warp - of a child.  He also becomes as cruel as his tormentors, but still reachable and able to grow.  It is a glimpse of what that war was like.<br />This makes Painted Bird a brilliant novel, undoubtedly Kozinski's best though also his first.  It is a tradegy that Kosinski lied about his past, perhaps to market the book and also to create a myth about himself, saying that this was autobiographical when in fact he had spent the war in relative comfort with his parents.  When the truth became known, he committed suicide.  But that does not diminish the magnitude of his acheivement here.	2002-02-05

I love the book simply because he doesn't  sugarcoat anything.  Kosinski experienced a lot as a child and I believe he chose to display parts of his life as a fiction.   I've known a few people to find the book offensive as fiction, I could not imagine if he wrote it as nonfiction.   People don't want to hear about the harsh realities of life and when they do, they call it fictious and offensive.  Is a female being raped offensive.  Sure for the female that was raped and all those that can empathize her pain. But surely retelling the truth, cannot be offensive!  Anyone who calls Kosinski's book offensive is in denial of harsh realities of life.  I'm happy that Kosinski decided to share his life with those that are willing to believe.  Even if parts of the books were elaborated or made up, the book should be used to give an example of the life someone can experience.  It makes me feel priveldged to never have experienced a life even close to the book.  I have yet to find another book so vivid, interesting and sad  all at the same time.  I read  this book when I was 18 and will buy my children a copy when they turn 18.  I'd love to see this book as a movie, but I wonder if the movie would do the book justice?	2001-12-08

At the time, I read that he did it because he was despondent over not being able to ski anymore due to a medical condition.  The public personna his \\"work\\" had established seemed almost to elevate that explanation from ridiculously trivial to something perfectly consonant with the sensibility of someone who had lived a horrifying experience as a child during World War II (experience he claimed formed the basis for this book), and later felt the oppression of totalitarian communism so keenly that he was willing to engineer a complex and risky plot to successfully escape it.    A man who valued his freedom so much that when denied it's expression in downhill skiing, he could make a choice that others would never embrace, and kill himself.    In all probability, though, that's nothing but romantic crap that he somehow managed to circulate posthumously.    Because since his death it's emerged that Jerzy Kosinski was essentially a fraud.  He waited out the war in relative comfort, raised by loving parents, posing as Gentiles.    So the portrayal of the orphan in The Painted BirdKosinski, who suffers so much abuse and torture at the hands of others while he wanders through the German countryside that he loses the faculty of speech, is not all autobiographical, as Kosinski claimed.  In fact, as with several of Kosinski's books, another author has come forward to claim that the book is substantially his work.    Still, it was a good con while he ran it, and whoever wrote it The Painted Bird    is a powerful and realistic memoir of the horror suffered by a child during the war. Prospective readers should understand that the book achieves it's effect with the use of imagery and themes that may offend some    However, I'd argue that the human savagery and hopelessness the book portrays are precisely what recommend it.  The experience of the war, like the experience of the Great Depression that preceded it, have receded to such a distance in the public memory that they are only dimly perceived now in photographs and black and white film clips of people who live in a world so different from ours that their experience could never become our experience.    It looks now as though we ignored Santayana's warning at our peril; we do seem doomed to repeat parts of that history. Perhaps it's wishful thinking, but maybe reminders of the real terror in our past will awaken those who would suffer most if the more aggressive elements in our political leadership continue to follow what looks disturbingly like the script from that era.	2001-08-13

I am a high school freshman and this book was more or less referred to me from my english teacher. The book tells a story of a boy that has to endure tremendous hardships as a gypsy. Parts of the book are quite gruesome and often I had to skim ahead to avoid a particularly disgusting passage. The book is well-written but I do have some qualms about it. I would like to ask, &quot;At what point does a book stop being literature and become a recollection of a person's nightmare?&quot; Does Mr. Kosinski have the ethical right to write a piece that exposes readers to the horrors of war to the point of terror? If it hadn't been for my love of reading, honestly I wouldn't have finished the book. At times I was so throughly disgusted I had to read something else to lighten my mind. <br />Like I said before, the book was very good although the ending is somewhat unclear. I would recommend this book to any experienced reader due to the graphic scenes. I think that you will be glad for reading it although you may not think so right after you finish.	2001-05-05

It is unfortunate that Kosinski invents events which never happened. For instance, his claim that Jews hiding in swampy areas were attacked by local Poles is flatly contradicted by eyewitnesses, and there are other non-factualities in this text as well. Considering especially the fact that Kosinski owes his very life to Poles who sheltered him from the Germans, it is thus particularly sad that he would write such ugly untruths about the Polish people. The Holocaust was cruel enough without the embellishments which Kosinski depicts in his book.	2001-04-25
US	47493255	R1HMH8WT2C4LIM	080213422X	640122618	The Painted Bird	Books	5	80	96	N	N	In defense of Kozinski	OK, I admit, I should have been older than 14 years old when I first read this novel... it is more graphic than your average WWII book or movie.  This novel is an unusual perspective on the holocaust.  There are no factories full of jewish labor slaves, no ghettoes, no concentration camps.  Instead, there is a small child, seperated from his parents in time of war, lost in the countryside of rural central Europe.  In the course of the novel, we discover how the social chaos brought about by WWII plays itself out among common peasants in the countryside as they are reduced to the lowest behaviors imaginable in the absence of peace, stability, clear governance, and a socially agreed-upon sense of right and wrong.  And the victim (or victims) is the child who witnesses (and lives with) this state of violence.  <br />In response to the review title &quot;More lies about Jerzy&quot;, I find it shallow and naive of the reviewer to call this book gratuitous violence invented for entertainment simply because the events depicted are not truly autobiographical.  It is a novel.  Last time I checked, novelists seem to make stories up on a regular basis.  No need to discount the value of the narrative because of its condition as fictional.  As for the suggestion that Jerzy did not write this book, I wouldn't be surprised if he had help smoothing his prose into readable English.  Kozinski is not a native speaker of English.  In fact, he learned the language as an adult.  So he needed help with the language... who cares?  The plot, characterization, and overall design of the book bear the creative mark that no proof reader or ghost writer could put on a narrative.  I don't doubt that this is Jerzy Kozinski telling this story, and the spirit of the narrative, the pain the child feels (he is so traumatized by his experiences that he becomes mute and needs to undergo therapy as an adult to recover his ability to speak) is an expression of WWII as Kozinski experienced it.  We don't need to know if Kozinski is the boy in the narrative.  The knowledge that Kozinski could identify and describe this violence in a way that actually upsets you and makes you angry is enough for me.  Kozinski has written an excellent novel about WWII and its aftermath, which, unlike Schindler's List, doesn't make you feel warm and cozy about how all the good people triumphed in the end... this novel will leave you with the lasting impression that there is no end-of-story resolution/redemption for those affected by war.	2001-03-21

I could take it.<br />No, I couldn't.<br />&quot;Man's inhumanity to man&quot; doesn't even begin to cover it.  Just nowhere close.  It's not even because of war, it's because these miserable peasants don't know anything else, can't act like anything more than animals.  More than anything else, this book is about just how evil ignorance and intolerance can be.<br />Even worse, the main character, an eight year old child, doesn't have the mental or physical equipment to deal with this enviroment or the complete hell he suffers through.  He just doesn't understand.  It'll gouge at your heart, the way he tries to deal with the cruelty visited on him for no good reason.<br />This is a powerful book, an important book, and one that shows just how awful life can get in an unjust, uneducated world.	2001-02-14

The boy, six years old,  becomes the object of brutality and prejudice, all of which stems from a combination of peasant  superstition and Nazi hatred.  The peasants have no limit to their  heartlessness: they beat the boy, molest him, and they nearly succeed in  killing him-all for the color of his skin (just like Lekh's painted bird).   In their minds the boy is nothing more than an ethnic curse to their  village, one who could potentially incite the Germans to slaughter everyone  within earshot. Just when the boy senses that the peasants will destroy  him, he flees to the next village, and the whole process starts anew. In  his wanderings he learns judgment and the ability to discern crescendos of  violence.    <br />The book is replete with gruesome images: bunkers  filled with hungry rats that devour a living body with the efficiency of a  school of piranhas; broken Jewish bodies moaning beside the train tracks; a  dead woman melting under the heat of her burning shack.  Death.  The book  is replete with it.  In the midst of such desolation, the boy longs for  stability and friendship and the confidence of trust.  But he is  disillusioned and betrayed each step of his journey, and the lessons of  evil change him in ways he does not know.     <br />The Painted Bird has  torn me away from my cozy world and has shown me another sphere where  people treat human life as though it is not human. The book is certainly  gripping and a little disturbing; it has left in me an uncomfortable  feeling that I cannot shake.  I guess one hallmark of the successful book  is its ability to do this.	2000-07-25

Though it will make you sick to your stomach and callenge you to question man's treatment of man,  the things you will gain from the expierence will stay with you for a  lifetime. I recomend all teenagers who have every question who they are or  why they are here to read this book. Any adults who wander why the world is  the way it is or who have never wander before should this book, because  after reading it you'll never stop wandering. This book answers many  question about the human soul and is a great experiment with the human  phsyche. But for as many question it may answer, twice as many will be  asked of the reader. It is a piece art the requires input as well as  output. You become that little boy, you experienec horror, saddness, pain,  loss of faith in God and in you own family.

Nothing very good happens to our 6 year old narrator as he goes from gypsy village to gypsy village and witnesses one thing more horrible than the next.  There are some  absolutely horrifyingly graphic, disgusting shows of man's brutality but  you almost becomed numbed by reading it.  By the time you hit the seen with  the invaders at the end who rape and torture the women, it doesn't even  seem as bad as half of the other stuff.  More importantly, you can see how  the boy cannot go back to living with his family now that his childhood is  lost.  An important book although don't expect any fun here.<br />For my  taste, I prefer the gut renching agony of Primo Levi's Holocaust memoirs  and novels.  At times you forget you are reading about humans since the  behavior borders on primate like.  I'm not sure mankind has improved that  much in the intervening time between the close of WW II and the present.

Kozinski's tale of a young boy's wanderings through backwater Eastern Europe during WWII is a painstakingly beautiful foray into the intricacies of horror.  And I mean real horror.  I  thank the Gods above that no one has made a movie of this one.  If it were,  and I went, which I might not, I would probably have my eyes closed for  half of it.  The book is really about how low the human race can sink.  And  folks, it's pretty damn low.  There are no heroes and no excuses here.  The  technique of having the whole thing told, quite believably, from the point  of view of a child reinforces the growing sense throughout the book of the  futility, the self-perpetualting void, of violence.  I would touch on  scenes of note, but I had egg salad for lunch, and I'm feeling a little  queasy just thinking about it.  Actually, more than making me feel queasy,  reading it and thinking about The Painted Bird make me want to weep.

There are also similarities in Marlowe's journey into the darkness of the Congo and Kosinski's young narrators' voyage through the surreal landscape of wartime Eastern Europe. Both  investigate the darker regions of the human psyche. Both are the antithesis  of a &quot;picaresque&quot; novel. Both are told from the point-of-view of  a relatively innocent narrator, whose original naivete is transformed by  the scenes he witnesses into an understanding of the &quot;horror&quot; and  a comprehension of man's capacity for evil.  I read The Painted Bird over  30 years ago and many of its images still remain vivid in my imagination. I  will never forget the couple caught copulating (you'll have to read  Kosinski's description yourself - I'm not going to go there) and the  boy-narrator's harrowing account of being thrown into a pit of excrement.  I'm a bit surprised, having taught high school English myself, that this  would be recommended to a young reader, even though I read it when I was  about sixteen. It definitely wasn't on my school's list of recommended  reading. I don't agree with some reviewers here that the book is  pornographic. Far from it. The sex depicted is hardly meant to arouse.  Kosinski's later work might have fallen into that category (he did a lot of  short-story writing for Playboy and Penthouse), but this is far too brutal  a work to be anywhere near titillating.  If you would like to take a  harrowing walk into the heart of darkness, and are equipped to handle  visions of one of the most depraved landscapes you are likely to encounter  in literature, then this book's for you.	2000-05-02

As others have stated, this book is extremely harrowing in its depictions of brutality and violation.  However, the atrocities we are forced to witness are never gratuitous.  One crucial element which none of the other  reviewers here have mentioned is the book's searing indictment of the  desire for retribution, which is exposed as futile and senseless.  So many  of the abuses perpetrated therein are motivated by sheer vengefulness,  including two actions by the narrator and his friends which result in the  killing of innocent people (at least, to the extent that *anyone* in such a  dynamic is innocent).  Even when revenge is carried out against those who  committed the original offense, we see that it accomplishes little or  nothing and is ultimately hollow.  Through all the inhumanity we are shown,  this book succeeds in giving us one of the strongest affirmations of  humanity I have ever read, and in doing this it is a masterpiece.	1999-05-26
