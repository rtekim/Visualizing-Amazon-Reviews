The ultimate story of the fluid Southwest and its equally fluid border, impossible to find and enforce -- told as a story from a century ago. McCarthy's least well-known and in my opinion, best work.  Living as I now do, in Tucson, Arizona, just an hour away from the travesty of our border with Sonora, Mexico -- the storm-trooper Border Patrol on one side, a socio-political autarchy on the other side -- it's clear to me that the Blood Meridian has never gone away.  It may be here to stay.  McCarthy got it.	2015-07-08

Not for everyone (due to all the violence and inhumanity) but getting through this masterpiece is well worth the effort.  I set the book aside three or for times over the years but I never gave up on it.  My limitations as a reader.  Did the same with The Sound and the Fury.  It is clear that McCarthy's politically incorrect American western was influenced by Moby Dick, Paradise Lost and Shakespeare (King Lear and Macbeth).  McCarthy's attention to detail with the U.S and Mexico southwest desert setting of 1849, the natives (Comanche, Apache, Yuma etc.), the physical environment, the language, the weapons etc is right on the money.  It seems to be a book that was written and rewritten with great care.  I personally think that &#34;Judge Holden&#34; is the devil on earth.  As evil as they get.  In this book it seems that God has &#34;taken leave&#34; of the world, at least the world where the characters of this book exist.  The book was first published in 1985 and it might be worth while to fast forward 30 yrs to today.  Compare the setting of 1849 TX/MX to the state of today's world and the state of American culture. It makes me think that Cormac McCarthy might be a living American prophet.  While reading this book I could not get Marlon Brando's Col Kurtz's character out of mind.  Elongate &#34;Kurtz&#34; and take away all body hair and you have my image of &#34;Judge Holden.&#34;  I will read this book again.  Obviously, I highly recommend.	2015-02-22

More important than the Bible multiplied by the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, it's like a heaping tablespoon of Faulkner drizzled over The Killer Angels.<br /><br />[These assertions were tested using: a 1st edition; a centrifuge; gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer; a fingernail from the writing hand of a literary critic from the New York Times Book Review; the blood of the world's most erudite chicken -- whom I had personally educated using the standard method involving audiobooks and telepathy; Satanic Death Rituals, although my attempts to resurrect Cormac McCarthy ran aground when I discovered he was still alive; a homemade voodoo curse I assembled using spare parts from the Necronomicon and Cat Fancy magazine; and most importantly, frozen yogurt. In the end, I found that actually reading the book worked almost as well.]	2015-01-14

I read it when it first came out and loved it. I read it again about 10 years ago and hated it. I just read it again, and I'm in the middle now.<br />First the positives: 1. No one can describe a Western landscape like McCarthy, or link it to the themes of the book and the depravity of the characters. I think McCarthy used the hallucinatory descriptions of landscapes, weather and environment (hot arid deserts full of dead men and animals, volcanoes, salt flats, beautiful harsh mountains and night skies) to depict hell. 2. The action is nonstop and propels the story forward. 3. No one can describe fight and battle scenes like McCarthy - e.g., when the first gang that the kid falls in with is ambushed by Comanches, or the scene near the end when the Yumas attack the Glanton gang. 3. McCarthy has created one of the all time evil geniuses in the Judge, a 7' tall hairless man who appears out of nowhere, knows every thing and every language, and is totally amoral when he's not immoral (sexual predator/serial killer). Think of a giant Hannibal Lector.<br /><br />Now the negatives - 1. Unrelenting violence, depicted in the most lurid detail - skulls caved in, eyes gouged out, dogs thrown onto lives on fires, etc. 2. There's not one decent human being in the whole book. The Glanton gang is a bunch of cold blooded serial killers. Think of the worst scenes in the Wild Bunch movie, and the entire book is pretty much like that. 3. There's no hope at all. The few people who may be innocents, like children or travelers are skewered, starved, driven mad by thirst and the sun, when they're not being murdered by savage Indians or the Glanton gang. 4. Much of the writing is very labored and pretentious, with long, long sentences and complicated syntax and so many big, fancy words you need a dictionary for every page.<br />As I said, I have mixed feelings about this book. I wonder if it will stand the test of time and still be considered a classic in 50 years.	2013-12-05

Ther	This is one of the densest but also the most rewarding books I have read. The tone is very dark and the story is sometimes plodding, but the imagery and descriptions of the landscapes that the hellish characters traverse in their bloody journey is amazing. There are a lot of dark themes and a lot of very violent parts that are not for the faint of heart. It was very complex and hard to get through at points but the deep characterisation and the character of Judge Holden made up for it. I don't rate this as good as The Road or No Country For Old Men as an entertaining read but it is definitely McCarthy's literary masterpiece.	2015-08-11

I really enjoyed this story and this book is a nice follow up to the writer's first book Aurora. If you're a fan of True Blood, Buffy, or any of the vampire shows or series this book won't disappoint. The story moves quickly and I especially found the character Prime very interesting and intriguing. His relationship with the main character is very interesting indeed and it left me wanting more. Looking forward to the next part in this series! I want to know what happens next.	2015-02-13

A disturbing &#34;cowboys 'n indians&#34; novel in which there no heroes, just horrible villains on both sides.  (Mexicans aren't very nice either :-)  ) In my humble opinion, this is not revisionist history of the old west: all sides are equally bad; CM has no PC axe to grind.  There is just bands of vicious guys killing each other, and their many helpless victims, being children, women, animals and even men who do not carry a heavy enough calibre firearm.<br />CM's use of English in describing the arid beauty of the Mexican border country is a constant relief from the relentless violence of the characters.<br />Most memorable character is Judge Holden, an intellectual psychopath, jovial but deadly, who is fascinated by the nature around him but abhors what can't be classified according to his world view.  A Hannibal Lechter without a sensitive side.<br />This is a must-read.	2013-11-23

Seemingly without regard for anything but dogged, dreadful survival by being more dreadful than the rest. Except for perhaps one who manages to emerge both alive and more substantial and likable than at first introduction.

Perhaps this is just an American thing, this obsession with the unremitting violence of life. Perhaps that's why the NRA has such traction in a society so steeped in and convinced of the righteous nature of its own paranoid fantasies. Based on a &#34;true&#34; story apparently. Well, maybe it was - but that doesn't mean you have to write about it. And so opaquely! I get the nature of the prose and the sentence construction and the parallels with biblical literature etc etc. What is difficult to stomach is to continue to read when I do not give two hoots what happens to anyone in this blasted miserable brick of a book.<br /><br />E M Forster said his motivation in writing was to make you see. In Blood Meridian I fail to see anything. Pity really, because I thought No Country for Old Men was rather brilliant. I simply do not see the world like Cormac McCarthy. I sincerely hope he doesn't see the world like this either.	2013-01-09
