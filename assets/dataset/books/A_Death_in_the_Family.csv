You never have to guess what a sentence is conveying, it is so literate yet to the point.

In a nearly perfect treatise on how a family reacts to the death of a family member, Agee in beautiful, transparent prose as good as anything  Christopher Isherwood or Truman Capote ever wrote, has given the world a novel that remains timeless. The story of course has universal appeal and touches everyone who reads it as all of us have lost or will lose a family member. It ultimately is about everything that matters.<br /><br />In 1915, Jay Follet at the age of 36 is killed in a freak automobile accident near Knoxville, Tennessee. Agee lets us see inside the minds of his wife, his children, his parents, his brother-in-law et al. as each character grapples with this new hole in his or her life, trying to grasp the loss and make sense of it. Jay's wife Mary and her Christian faith are contrasted with the indifference of the organized church in the character of Father Jackson who refuses to read the complete burial service over Jay because he had not been baptised. In a beautiful passage near the end of the novel Andrew, Mary's brother, describes the burial to the six-year-old Rufus (based on Agee) when a \\""perfectly magnicent butterfly\\"" settled on the coffin. Andrew believes that \\""that butterfly has got more of God in him than Jackson [the priest] will ever see for the rest of eternity.\\"" Mary's father, perhaps as only a loving parent can,  gives her hard but honest advice: \\""It's bad enough right now, but it's going to take a while to sink in. . . It'll be so much worse you'll think it's more than you can bear. Or any other human being. And worse than that, you'll have to go through it alone, because there isn't a thing on earth any of us can do to help, beyond blind animal sympathy.\\""<br /><br />The novel opens with a prose poem \\""Knoxville: Summer 1915\\"", later set to music by Samuel Barber. There are additional, similar lyrical prose pieces, usually seen through the eyes of Rufus, interspersed between the three divisions of the novel.

Imagine James Joyce, in Portrait of an Artist, going on and on detailing every nuance of young Stephen Dedalus's early memories, his repetitious conversations, his exhaustive introspections on this action and that word. The book is just not a good fit for our culture of 24 hour cable news, Ipods, and desire for instant gratification. Not that that stuff is bad, but it's not the place where this book comes from. <br /> <br />I nearly gave up on it twice. One spot was the section on the desperate self loathing of alcoholic Uncle Ralph. Agee so carefully, and at such great length, spins out this man's pain it's hard to take. The other was the pre-dawn foreshadowing Rufus's father and mother engage in as his father prepares to leave his family - this nearly went beyond the pale with \\""...he would finish the pancakes if it was the last thing he did...\\"" <br /> <br />But I stuck with it and the book turns out to be wonderful. The payoff comes after the death in the family occurs. By this time you know, in particular, Rufus and his sister and his mother and his aunt, so well that when Agee turns their faculties from the minutia of ordinary life to coping with wrenching tragedy - just to see how they're going to manage it - he is able to build the kind of mighty suspense that carves deep valleys out of rock. <br /> <br />A few notes: The real turning point for me was the section in which Rufus meets his great great grandmother; that was a wonderful self-contained piece of writing. Though I've loved Samuel Barber's setting of \\""Knoxville: Summer of 1915\\"" for many years, I wouldn't say it's the best part of the book. It's more of an overture, introducing themes that will be fully explored in the rest of the work. Finally, I didn't read the print (I'm not sure I could have finished it).

For all that time it seems as if the death alluded to by the book's title will be the death of the man's father.  Instead, the man himself dies in a car accident on the way back home from his sick father's.  The book flashes back to the childhood of the dead man's son, and hovers around many of the book's characters, seeming almost indecisive as to who it's going to be about, seeming nebulous and atemporal.  The wife.  The kids.  A preacher.  A neighbor.  A sibling.  At times the story feels scattered and unfocused, but the writing is always so beautiful that it the story almost doesn't seem to matter, and the vagueness seems to match the confusion that comes after the sudden death of a close loved one.<br />The book deals well with the themes of death and loss and family relations and grieving and God and religion, and James Agee writes masterfully about the way children think.

The rest of the story seems to be quite simply about how the survivors cope and interact following such a sudden death.     But even if the plot scheme is indeed simple, the story itself is rich in the culture, sociology, and religious aspects of 1920s Knoxville, Tennessee.

I did find that the book lacked some editing--but in the preface it is freely admitted that because the book was published posthumously, the choice was made to respect Agee's original work (with a few exceptions), and some texts were simply inserted (in italics) as best as the editors could guess because the order was not clear. And in places, the descriptions given from the little boy's point of view became tiresome, particularly of the funeral, because he went into great physical detail of the things he witnessed, describing them with his limited, childlike vocabulary, and at some point it almost makes you want to say, \\""Yes, that's called a BURIAL.\\"" Certainly a forgiveable fault, however--if even a fault at all or simply just a question of preference.

For those who enjoy the tender, glowing realism of authors such as William Maxwell, Marilynne Robinson or even Willa Cather, this novel will truly resonate. But A Death in the Family is more than just impressive writing - it is also the truly well crafted story of grief and loss told through the eyes of a series of family members. I read this in college and recall liking it, but the addition of the new pages brings the work into its own. From my understanding there are three distinct added sections - including the prelude. Admittedly, these added sections do not fit seamlessly into the narrative structure, but they each fit in arguably well with the tone and spirit of the work. It was quite obvious, at least to me, that Agee intended these incorporate these pages in the novel, but was unable to do so. (He died before the novel's completion.) <br />  <br />The plot, itself, is simple: the naked reactions of a family to the unexpected death of a loved one. But the amazing aspect of this is Agee's grasp of voice and perspective as the narrative moves from one voice to the other. We hear from the spiritually questioning wife, the pathetic, alcoholic brother, the bewildered near-infant daughter and Rufus, the infinitely interesting five-year-old son. Anyone who has actually experienced a death in the family will identify freely with at least one of the characters. Rufus is particularly fascinating in his struggle to understand the situation. He experiences the very real, yet rarely discussed, emotions such as pride for being the center of attention, boredom at not being allowed to go anywhere, and exasperation at his little sister. He is endearingly human - as are all the characters, really.   <br />  <br />Since this is hardly a \\""new\\"" novel, I will devote the most time to discussing this particular edition. It begins with the stunning addition of \\""Knoxville, Summer 1915\\"" which just may be one of the most beautiful and effective prose poems in the English language (By the way, if you're as taken with Agee's prose poem as I was you might want to listen to the fabulous Barber setting of it for soprano and orchestra. I highly recommend the EMI Michael Tilson Thomas conducting and Barbara Hendricks, Soprano although the Eleanor Steber version is beautiful as well.) The next is a darker, more surreal passage telling the story of a boy (Rufus, son of Jay) and the quasi-anthropomorphized darkness. It is at once touching, chilling, endearing and unquestionably effective. But the final added section is, by far, the strongest in terms of narrative. It is essentially two stories of Rufus: one, in which he suffers at the mercy of grammar-school bullies and one in which he meets his great-great-grandmother. Like the other added passages, Rufus' stories by no means move the action forward, but the section does add depth and insight into his character.  <br />  <br />A Death in the Family is a beautiful novel that is not merely a good read, but an experience to savor. On the \\""downside\\"", the novel is placid and gracefully paced - honestly not much happens - but it is also heart-wrenchingly beautiful. If you're looking for a thriller this is certainly not it. Nor is it exactly comforting. Instead it contains a delicate spirituality of its own. It's a work of depth and beauty that is easy to enjoy.",2005-06-29

The time and setting certainly fit with Agee's own upbringing. In any event, he poignantly captures the conflicting emotions of a wife who is trying to cope with the loss of her partner and mate in his prime, and how to reconcile that loss with her strong, self-effacing religious beliefs. The church, or religion in general, is not given a good face in this work, particularly in the guise of the Catholic Father, and in the struggle that Mary undergoes in trying to be strong and suppressing her emotional grief, in the name of that religion. I was appalled by the stern and unforgiving body language and words conveyed by the priest towards the young children who had just been given news of their father's death. His actions and attitudes may be a sign of those times, but the reactions of the children towards the priest, of guilt, shame and conflictedness, when all they should have felt was comfort and consolation, demonstrates the type of stern and unyielding religious arrogance that is at the heart of this story. Obviously, religious conflict had a long and divisive, in some senses unspoken, history in the family profiled here. Those differences exploded after the tragedy occurred. Also, the reactions and feelings of Rufus in particular, and also his younger sister, and his sense of pride and accomplishment in telling of his father's death to his schoolmates, is shocking, yet real. A child cannot adequately come to terms with the finality of death, and perhaps the saddest line in the book is Rufus pondering whether news of his father's death might prompt some of his schoolmates (who he obviously feels intimidated by and fearful of) to share their lunches with him. His reactions are bewildered, and his mother is unable to console him or help him cope with the devastation of his father's death, with she herself struggling with whether to grieve or praise God. This is a very profound work and while parts of it were difficult to access - some of the large parts in italics - the emotion was raw and real. It is a story I will remember for a long time.",2004-10-07

I disagree with people believing it is boring, I find it to be beautiful and intriguing. It made me think because it has so many layers.

The circular motion of the characters' thinking is suprisingly on target. The characters dont seem overplayed and seem very real; I cared about them. The only thing I did not enjoy about the book was the complete turn around of styles of writing from section to section.

It's about a man, Jay Follett, a father of two, who dies one night in a car crash. Through the eyes of Jay's wife, his son, and his brother, Agee paints an incredibly moving picture of a family struggling under the weight of Jay's death. By switching views, he blends innocence, anger, tenderness, and love in a way that, somehow, conveys all these emotions at once. I feel like I lived this story two months ago, and everything about it rang true to me.

Apparently also a renowned film critic, journalist, and poet, Agee applies a technique that finds modes and moods associated with other famous Southern writers, showing shades of Faulkner's descriptive flair and Eudora Welty's sensitivity to emotions and domestic despair, without overdoing any single aspect of his style.<br />The story takes place in 1915 in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Jay Follet, an ordinary man approaching middle age, lives with his wife Mary and their two small children, Rufus, who is about six, and Catherine, who is almost four.  One night he gets an anxious telephone call from his brother Ralph beckoning him to the bedside of their ailing father, who appears to be at death's door.  Jay agrees to go, and in an excellent scene in which Mary makes breakfast for him before his departure, the reader gets a clear view of the kind of relationship they have.  The alarm turns out to be a false one, but death is still in the cards:  Returning home, Jay is killed in a car accident.<br />The rest of the novel demonstrates the sudden impact on Mary and her well-meaning family.  Her aunt Hannah is the most helpful and the most sympathetic to her piety; her father is an agnostic who takes a practical view of things while her partially deaf mother listens through an ear trumpet; her brother Andrew tries to console her by explaining the relatively merciful circumstances of Jay's death with an interesting forensic reconstruction of the accident.  Andrew is a cynic who seems to derive his personality from his father; he is quick to detect sanctimoniousness and sourly decries the priest who refuses to give the unbaptized Jay full burial rites.  And, in regard to a difficult telephone conversation with Jay's inarticulate brother, he delivers the novel's best line: \\""Talking to that fool is like trying to put socks on an octopus.\\"" <br />The text of the novel is interspersed with sections relating the young Rufus's memories of growing up and perspective on his father's death, the seriousness and finality of which he is not quite old enough to understand.  There are nostalgic scenes depicting days and nights on the Knoxville streets, his expectations of a \\""surprise\\"" which turns out to be the birth of his younger sister, an epiphanous lesson on race relations from his black nurse Victoria, the torment and ridicule he suffers from older, bigger boys when he starts school, and, most piquant of all, a Charlie Chaplin film to which his father takes him.    <br />Although religion plays a role, the novel is not filled with uplifting, hyperreligious cliches that try to find some higher purpose in the tragedy.  Agee explores trauma and grief with the hard eye of a playwright, rendering his novel warm but not sentimental, melancholy but not depressing or humorless, melodramatic but not hysterical.  \\""A Death in the Family\\"" is as pure an elegy on the American family as any the previous century could conceive.",2004-04-05

You often feel as if you moving through a dream - or, perhaps, a world running in slow motion where you can anticipate what will happen but you can't do anything to stop it.<br />As the book starts off, a boy is making a trip to town with his dad.  The boy worries about making his dad proud.  The dad worries about his boy's perception of him.  The dad is also incredibly lonely...and you begin to get attached to him, but you don't want to get too attached because you know he won't be around too much longer.  (My apologies if this ruins the story, but I'm pretty sure this is well known.)<br />As you become introduced to the rest of the characters, you realize that everyone is honorable (for the most part) and that their internal concerns &amp; worries just comes out of their being human.  For example, though the father is lonely, it's not because he has a horrible wife.  In fact, he has a wonderful wife...but he is trying to wade through the complexity of relationships, internal peace and life in general.  And so are all the characters.<br />The story progresses slowly, predictably, and you watch as the characters all act &amp; react in various ways.  Agee allows you to see the world through each character's eyes, and then how the world perceives that character.  This narrative style leaves you feeling compassionate for each member of the family whereas it would normally be easy to be annoyed with or dismissive of many of the characters.<br />It is also worth mentioning how honest and thoughtful Agee is in showing his characters' motivations and flaws.  When the little boy learns that his father has died, the loss completely goes over his head.  Instead, he tries to leverage this event for popularity from the schoolchildren.  &quot;Surely they will be nice to me today,&quot; he thinks.  <br />Later, when the mother kneels to pray, her aunt has amazing insight that the mother is praying not from her heart but rather from pride - praying what she thinks a holy woman would pray in such a circumstance.  Such commentary on our actions and motivations can hit a little close to home...but I believe it must have come from his own experience.  He never condemns his characters...he just lets them be fully human.<br />As I said in the beginning, I believe this work to be a true masterpiece.  Though I was often horrified by the true despairing picture he portrayed, my mind was also deeply impressed by the truth he conveyed.  And he does give hope, after his own fashion.",2004-01-16

In fact, I found it dreadfully dull when I was reading it for a class deadline. It dragged on while I impatiently pushed further to see if anything else happened (nothing else happened). This novel is definitely not the remedy for boredom, as it will bore you even more. However, on a rainy Sunday afternoon, A Death in the Family is the perfect book. When the reader can take their time and enjoy every single detail in the book, you really get a good sense about what Agee had noticed as a child robbed as his father. It's not about the fights, or the actual death of his father, but about the subtleties humans use in communication and how people deal with pain. For about half an hour of reading, Rufus' mother is talking with Aunt Hannah about what she needs to do before she goes to bed. They address each other politely, becoming nauseatingly repetitive if you are in a hurry, but displaying realistic human shock and unspoken communication. His mother also hangs onto her rosary beads, crosses herself and prays non-stop through out the novel, but Agee did not put all of the prayers in so we knew which ones she was saying. It was clear that she was looking for confidence in her religion, but was not sure if her God had actually betrayed her. Perhaps she should abandon religion? The atheists in the book are jilted as the dead father is not allowed a proper funeral ceremony since he was never baptized. Perhaps they should adopt religion? Why is it exclusive? These are all questions of human interaction that Agee's novel provokes. Ideally, Agee arouses introspective analysis in the reader. That is, if you have the patience.<br /> Perhaps the book would have flowed better had Agee had a chance to edit it himself, but what the reader gets is the raw writing. Life with the family prior to the accident is exposed in two inserts of corresponding literature Agee wrote but did not originally put in the book.

As one critic pointed out, in his criticism, Agee takes the reader into the film, and not to concerns extraneous to the film, like so many reviewers (such as Pauline Kael, who writes beautifully, but whose comments sometimes seem to have very little to do with the film in question).<br />After reading his film criticism, I have to confess that I was somewhat disappointed by this novel.  It was good, but it did not stand out in any way.  So, if all this volume had to offer was the novel itself, I would be able to recommend it, but without too much enthusiasm.<br />But thankfully, that is not the case.

Also, the piece is so amazing that I am certain that they also wanted to include it so that it would not so easily get lost.<br />I read A DEATH IN THE FAMILY once.  I have probably read &quot;Knoxville:  Summer of 1915&quot; a good dozen times.

The descriptions are so precise and tactile, that the reader almost feels as if his or her own impressions are being recorded.

Maybe he wouldn't have put them in after all...I just felt like I wanted to see more of what his original plan was.  It's a good book and for some (as apparent from the many positive reviews) it will speak volumes and touch souls.  It just didn't do it for me.  But, it's in no way something that's unreadable or bad.  It's most interesting, surely.",2000-09-30

I read this book in the Tenth grade and garnered no sense of its  raw literary power at that time since my teacher was more interested in  using it to bash Catholicism than to explore its wonderful prose.<br />Many  years later I read the book again while living abroad. Since I was not in  an English speaking environment the language and mood of the novel were  even more evocative.<br />I was astounded when I reread the essay called  &quot;Knoxville Summer of 1915&quot; that precedes the rest of the novel.  This is one of the most beautiful and most effective pieces of English I  have ever come across. Agee describes a child's observation of his  neighbors evening activities in their back yard in a subtle sequence of  events. The essay mixes dreamy metaphor with detailed observation in a  slow, rhythmic description. The child observes the rolled up shirt sleeves  of fathers watering their lawn after dinner and then tells himself that now  the night is a &quot;blue dew&quot;. The genius behind this is how the  child makes the transition for detailed observation to poetic descriptions  of the entire experience. <br />The rest of the novel is wonderful in parts  but hardly equals the opening essay. Agee is very talented at conveying  character, dialog, and mood. We sense the warmth of family life before the  father's death and the absolute confusion and bewilderment that follow. It  is very painful to read about how the narrator, as an awkward child, is  momentarily accepted by his classmates because his father's death is a new  and interesting topic for them. It is a terrible thing that in a roundabout  way, the callousness of the boy's classmates converts his father's death  into a moment of joy. But it is also one of life's realistic irony.<br />The  subject matter of this book is tragic and even in its most poetic parts its  mood is very grim. You may want to keep this in mind before reading it.",2000-07-17

Erica Coleman has st","A good “whodunit” should leave you ruminating about murder suspects until the book’s end is in sight, and if it meanders here and there, adding several possible leads and misleads, along with a host of worthy suspects, then all the better.<br /><br />And so it is with the second book in author Marlene Bateman’s new Erica Coleman murder mystery series, A Death in The Family. Bateman leads her readers along a variety of tantalizing plot twists, while dishing up a complex cadre of possible suspects and motives which builds until very near the end, and when the murderer is finally revealed, Bateman throws in another twist that keeps the reader flipping pages until the fat lady finally sings.<br />From the book’s back cover:<br /><br />In her debut mystery, Motive for Murder, gutsy private investigator Erica Coleman proved that when it comes to sleuthing, she takes the cake. Now, the fast-talking, food-loving heroine is back, and she's sure her next assignment will be as easy as pie...<br />Erica and her family happily anticipate Grandma Blanche's eighty-first birthday celebration in the picturesque town of Florence, Oregon. But when the feisty matriarch, a savvy businesswoman, enlists Erica's help in an investigation of her company, things quickly get sticky. Before the investigation can begin, Blanche's unexpected death leaves Erica with more questions than answers—and it soon becomes clear that Grandma's passing was anything but natural: she was murdered. When Aunt Martha, Blanche's reclusive sister, becomes the next victim of someone with a taste for homicide, Erica uses her flair for cooking to butter up local law enforcement and gather clues. As she narrowly escapes becoming the third victim, Erica is more determined than ever to solve the case—before she bites off more than she can chew. (There is one error in the back cover synopsis. Aunt Martha is Blanche’s daughter, not sister.)<br /><br />On the night of her eighty-first birthday party, Grandma Blanche makes a passing comment to Erica about hiring her to investigate problems in the family business. When she is found dead the next morning, seemingly of natural causes, Erica enlists herself to fulfill Grandma’s last request, and to make sure no foul play is involved. She butts heads with local law enforcement and every family member, most of whom also work in the family business where greed and power grabs add to the list of possible motives.<br /><br />When the majority of your suspects are members of your own a family, a murder investigation becomes particularly sticky, no matter how justified, as Erica soon discovers. Since most of the Coleman family members are also members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, religion comes up from time to time. In most places it is worked into conversations seamlessly, although such conversations felt a bit inserted in a few places.<br /><br />The pace of the book feels a bit slow in the beginning, as the complex relationships of the large family are explained, but pay close attention as clues begin dropping, like chocolate drops, along the way.<br /><br />A successful series requires a strong, extremely connectable main character readers can bond with and trust to guide them on these adventures. Marlene Bateman has achieved that in private eye Erica Coleman and her husband, David, a cop. Their repartee is sweet and loving, and their conversations are smart and savvy. David provides an able muse and sounding board for Erica, and their marriage and family life round out Erica’s characterization, giving her dogged professionalism that’s grounded in a strong marriage and family life.<br /><br />Bateman further intrigues readers by providing glimpses into the couple’s humor and deep friendship. Their conversations are sprinkled with quotations that somehow relate to the current topic they are discussing.

Erica is one of my very favorite characters, her OCD makes things crazy and she's super smart. I really like that I can see a bit of myself in her. The plot of this one was fun, I liked that there were so many possibilities of suspects and you could see just how it could have been whichever person.

All of these simple things, however, are intensified by the novel's key action--a car accident that kills the father of a small Knoxville family.  Interested readers will also find the same poetic insights in non-fiction journalism of Agee's investigation of the Depression Era South in Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.

It's Maybelle Clark-Merriweather's turn to make Thanksgiving dinner for her husband's side of the family in addition to her own. At sixty years old, she never had children and she's married to an obese alcoholic who hasn't fulfilled his husbandly duties in years. Unbeknownst to Maybelle, her brother, sister-in-law, and husband have similar but self-contained intentions to get rid of her.<br /><br />Faced with having to include vegetarian dishes for the Clarks as well as traditional meat dishes for herself and her husband Lowell's family, Maybelle fulfills the challenging undertaking. Unfortunately, she's unable to partake in the Thanksgiving festivities because she dies at the dinner table after drinking tainted blackberry wine. With all three plotters satisfied that they were the one successful in killing Maybelle, the only thing left is for each to read the autopsy results to make sure the authorities don't suspect it was murder.<br /><br />A Death in the Family is a short story with an ironic twist. Author George Seaton allows the reader to delve into the motives of three different people with murder on their minds. It's interesting to note the opening paragraph of the story is a clue to the ending. Will all three family members be able to get away with murder, or will they meet the same fate as poor Maybelle?",2013-01-27

The author is wonderful and the novel is extremely well-written.  There are entire scenes and paragraphs where you can feel every emotion simply by the way the narrator describes his surroundings.  I recommend the book itself to anyone that enjoys novels where the language and descriptions take center stage.  That is not to say that the character and plot are lacking, but if you are looking for the fast-paced style of a Palahniuk, this would not be for you.  Agee takes his time introducing you to this world.<br /><br />That said, I bought this on the Kindle.  I prefer to go digital whenever possible to avoid the manufacturing/shipping/printing costs to the environment of traditional books.  I LOVE to hold a good book and curl up with it, but with my appetite for them I find digital to be a more responsible option for the planet.  This book was significantly more as a digital edition than the paperback edition.  I wrote to Amazon and Penguin to register my complaints.  I understand that they are still working out how to price these, but let's no pretend that a digital book is less of a value to the consumer than a paper book in the long run.<br /><br />I cannot loan the digital copy to a friend.  I cannot sell it to a secondhand bookstore when I am done with it.  I can read it on my device or other devices that can handle that format but that is all.  Yes, it is convenient but not several dollars more convenient.  As an Amazon Prime customer I would receive the book in two days with no shipping charges if I ordered the printed version.  The paperback was $10.88 (same at other retailers) and the Kindle edition was [...].  This is not a major price difference but we should not be forced to pay more for something that provides us with less.  I hope Amazon and the book publishers will begin to price books more fairly for consumers.  At the very least the prices should be consistent with the lowest price version still in print.",2010-11-30
