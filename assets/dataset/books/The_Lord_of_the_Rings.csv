I'll keep it brief, this is not a review of the actual story but of this specific edition. I have attached many pictures that I hope help you decide if this is an edition you want to buy.  Pros: - The font is big and easy to read. - 65 beautiful illustrations by Alan Lee that bring the story to life.  Cons: - Slipcover is an opaque plastic, whit a modern look that I think doesn't complement the book. - One or two blank pages before and/or after each illustration.

That was my first experiences with J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth epics. To open this book up and see the sheer level of detail and artistry that was put into the making of this edition of the Lord of the Rings truly shows a high level of dedication and love for the source material. This is the best edition of The Lord of the Rings that exists. From the gorgeous cover lined with golden script to the giant size of the book making you truly feel as though you are opening up a tome that is the chronicling of the third age of men and their fight to stop the evils of Mordor.<br /><br />Pros:<br />~The illustrations are phenomenal, Alan Lee gives us a painted rendition of what Middle Earth was like. Years later Peter Jackson would use these as templates for creating his award winning movies.<br />~This is the corrected edition which makes it readable to anyone from the most novice of readers to the most seasoned of die hard fans.<br />~This is the edition that Tolkien dreamed of making back in World War 2 but could never get a publishing company to actually invest that much money into a single book.<br /><br />Cons:<br />~This thing is so big.<br /><br />Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.",2015-06-11

I did a ton of research and decided upon this version (ISBN 116-1749849-2513827), illustrated by Alan Lee and published by Harper Collins in June 2014  (I am adding these details because the Amazon.com site does not make it clear what this version is).  Please note that this particular printing is NOT available in the US but any Tolkien or LotR devotee should not be deterred (Frodo wouldn't have been!).  I must say that this is the finest published one-volume version of the LotR that I have ever laid eyes upon, and is well worth every penny.  It includes approximately 50 high-quality color illustrations by Alan Lee, which even for a 30-something like me makes the reading experience exceptional.  The front and back covers are made of durable, high-quality cloth (as shown), with a strong and handsome turquoise binding.  The pages -- not just the illustrations but the entire book -- are glossy and made of &#34;whiter&#34; paper than you generally find, the margins large, and the typeset easy on the eyes.<br /><br />For those who care about such things, the printing is based on the 2004 corrected text, with even further corrections.  There are updated introductions/forwards by Wayne G. Hammond  & Christina Scull, authors of the authoritative &#34;LOTR Readers Companion,&#34; as well as by Douglas A. Anderson, who provides a detailed publication history of the Lord of the Rings.  The full appendices are included.<br /><br />Two-page red and black maps of Middle Earth and of Gondor/Rohan/Mordor adorn the front and back covers, with a map of the Shire before the first chapter.  Also present are other essentials such as the Doors of Moria and the Tomb of Balin.  The only drawback is that the facsimile pages of the Book of Mazarbul was not included, which I found to be surprising and a bit disappointing Also, the ring inscription and the Gandalf &#34;rune&#34; are printed in black rather than silver and red.  Probably the main issue is the clear plastic slipcover, which is barely bigger than the book itself, and it is difficult to slip the book back inside it after taking it out.  You are more likely to scuff the corners of the book.  That being said, these are far from dealbreakers, and the joy to be received from owning this edition far outweighs these issues.inscription and the Gandalf &#34;rune&#34; are printed in black rather than silver and red.

I am 45 and have never given much thought to reading LOTR even after the movies came out and were wildly successful.  I would pass through a store (be it Barnes Noble, Target, Stop & Shop) and see this book and be tempted to buy it but the price ($20) would always make me change my mind.<br /><br />As you can see from all my reviews, I have a very diverse taste in what I read and deep down I felt that one day I would have to read LOTR, if only to say that I read it.  I am very precise in that if a book has a prequel, I have to read it and if the movie is out, I have to read the books before seeing the movie.  Finally I broke down and purchased both books (one on my Kindle and one paperback-no matter how much I love my Kindle there is something about holding a new book and turning the pages).  I first started reading LOTR and because the first pages are sort of a prologue (a summary of The Hobbit) it wasn't all that exciting.<br /><br />I was about to stop reading LOTR but went back to the reviews (if ever you are in doubt about a product read the reviews-as many as you can).  I would say that 95% of the reviews were positive about this being one of the greatest novels to date.  Another thing said about this book is that once you start reading it, you can't stop.  Once I finished the prologue which wasn't boring but wasn't that exciting either, I started to read the first chapter.  I find that many fantasy books start off with something happening in a world that I do not know so I get confused until I get immersed in the book.  Quite the opposite of LOTR.  It started off simple, understandable with a bang (I mean party).  I started to read it but kept thinking that I should stop and read The Hobbit first but I have to say that the reviewers are right, once you start this book, you will keep coming back to it.  That's what is happening to me.  I read more than 2 or 3 books at a time but I keep stopping the other books which are quite good and coming back to LOTR.<br /><br />I won't bother telling you what this book is all about since everyone but me (LOL) knows but I will continue to read it.  My plan is to read LOTR, then The Hobbit and then see the movies on DVD.<br /><br />I am so glad I took a chance because I love books that completely absorb me and I can't seem to stop reading or going back to them.

I am not going to say that I hated the book just that there are books that I enjoyed much more than this.

It often seemed as if he just created a single personalty for each race and everyone that fits was that race had that the same personality. Whenever a character was introduced that was a Elf, It would not take too long to figure out that he had the same personalty as other elves. In the book, I found only a few characters that anything that resembled a distinctive personality. Even these characters came across as being somewhat underdeveloped. I had a hard time caring about any of the characters. For me, it's hard to enjoy a novel when there are no charterers that I care about. Maybe I am missing something that I everyone else saw.

I never even try to look at maps or illustrations on my first generation Kindle screen and believe that readers to whom these are important should purchase the physical book for maximum legibility and enjoyment.<br /><br />As to the literary merit and entertainment value of LOTR:<br /><br />Tolkien breaks every modern rule of good writing. Weak verbs, nominalizations and the passive voice abound. He calls the same characters by multiple names, and uses similar names for different characters, confusing the reader who wants to keep track without making LOTR and its supplemental materials a life study. For example, Aragorn, a major character, also goes by Strider and some other name I don't remember. It took me a while to get bad guys Sauron and Saruman straight in my mind, even having seen the movies first. Of Eomer and Eowyn, which is the man and which is the woman? Not only does Tolkien disregard Orwell's maxim, \\""Write in English,\\"" but he liberally sprinkles the text with words in unintelligible languages he made up himself, Elfish and Dwarfish. I know of his scholarship in philology and linguistics and imagine he and hard-core fans may enjoy it, but to the casual reader, it smacks of showing off. Step by footsore, hungry step, the reader follows the protagonists as they climb up the side of the mountain, they climb down the side of a mountain, they climb up the side of a mountain, rinse, repeat, with a battle or an encounter with fantastical beings thrown in here and there.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I enjoyed reading LOTR enormously. No doubt it helps me to envision Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn (he would captivate me if he played a mailbox) and the other wonderful performers and film craftspeople who brought Peter Jackson's vision of the inhabitants and landscapes of Middle Earth to such compelling life. I also loved for their own sake the musicality of Tolkien's old-fashioned narrative voice, his pastoral descriptions, and the vividness and completeness of his richly imagined universe. The hobbits bring delightful humor and humanity (hobbitity?) to what might have, absent Tolkien's gifts as a storyteller, affection for the natural world and leavening wit, been a dreary tale of a struggle for freedom against corrupt power.<br /><br />LOTR can at times tax the reader's patience. If your taste runs to John Grisham thrillers, you may want to avoid it. I am glad to have acquired the serenity to roll along with it at its own pace, not stress about keeping every character and kingdom straight, appreciate Tolkien's highly personal artistry, and enjoy the adventure.ut to the casual reader, it smacks of showing off.

The brilliance lies in the fact that Tolkien, through his authoritative command of the English language, manages to fool the masses into believing that The LOTR is a literary masterpiece.  In fact, the plot is thin and the story is, unfortunately, choppy and no better than average.<br /><br />Tolkien deserves credit for creating a detailed imaginary world complete with original launguages and ancestries--then again, my 4 year old nephew also creates his own imaginary worlds, characters, languages, and creatures.  Furthermore, Tolkien is often mistakenly given credit for creating literary fantansy.  This couldn't be further from the truth--Lewis Carroll wrote Alice's Adventures in Wonderland almost 100 years prior to The LOTR and, while Carroll's book is only a little over 100 pages long, any literature buff knows that it contains far more depth than The LOTR.  So this leaves us scratching our heads and wondering if The LOTR was written for the reader or simply as an outlet for Tolkien's child-like imagination.<br /><br />If Tolkien had placed as much effort into the story itself as he did in describing every boring detail of the non-existent world in which the story takes place, The LOTR would undoubtedly deserve the acclaim it's so often given.<br /><br />In short, there are 100s, if not 1,000s, of books that are far more well worth your time.",2013-03-24

I have been wanting to get this edition for a while to go along with my illustrated edition of The Hobbit. Alan Lee is a wonderful artist. His drawings have a realistic look to them which is why I would prefer this edition above all the other ones. I see a lot of people try to compare the 50th anniversary edition and the illustrated edition but I can't really say the same as I don't own the 50th anniversary edition. Maybe in the future I'll purchase that one. I've read that one has a map of Middle Earth that folds out in the back of it. But I don't think it has illustrations. Nonetheless I'm still happy with this illustrated edition. It's the nicest copy of Lord of the Rings I've owned so far. My only complaint about it is that the one I bought didn't have the blue ribbon bookmark attached to it. Which is curious because I bought it brand new straight from Amazon and the ones I've seen on store shelves in the past had the blue ribbon bookmark. I didn't even see any sign of one that could have been ripped off or something. I don't know if there were some made without it or what because any reviews I read about it before described the blue ribbon bookmark as well. It's not really that big of a deal if mine doesn't have one. But at the same time I was just a little disappointed because I was expecting it to have it on there.

Also included is an abandoned review I wrote for \\""[[ASIN:0007149212 The Fellowship of the Ring]]\\"" all the way back in early 2000 but was never posted on Amazon, explaining how Tolkien's life work of \\""The Lord of the Rings\\"" is NOT a trilogy but rather three parts of one work divided up for publishing purposes]<br /><br />Over the past several decades, THE LORD OF THE RINGS has sold millions of copies and is commonly regarded as one of the most influential fantasy novels ever published. Many first time readers have began their trek into Middle-earth with Frodo and the Company of the Ring in recent years. What they will encounter there has been loved by millions of readers before them, and if they allow themselves to respond to Tolkien and his Myth will doubtless become a loyal and ardent fan of Tolkien and those furry-footed hobbits. What's also notable about THE LORD OF THE RINGS is, for a book as long as it is, many of its readers reread the novel many times over. Yet despite its enduring popularity, Tolkien is often held in complete disregard by the literary establishment.<br /><br />The real question is why? In the literary climate that is characterized by modernism and post-modernism where the twentieth and twenty first century is a wasteland why does a \\""series\\"" of fantasy novels become one of the most beloved works in modern times?<br /><br />It's because the power of myth over the human imagination works wonders, creating a longing and a hunger that, Tolkien argues, is met by the Christian religion. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis are the flip-sides of the same coin, with Lewis giving us accounts of the longing and Tolkien providing the books that would create that longing. And what about the longing? It's that longing for Myth, that love for those beauties which Tolkien shows us in THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It's that longing that sets man apart from all other creatures in the universe: a craving for beauty and for joy. The German word for this longing is \\""senhsucht\\"". In a time characterized by fast-food, cell-phones, materialism, superficiality, the account of a Hobbit working against all odds in a mythic landscape so captures the human imagination (and this is NOT hype) that an entire genre is created. It is because of how Tolkien so masterfully handles Myth that he has been so highly treasured by such a large fan base.<br /><br />Still, there are a few things to consider when reading Tolkien nowadays. Looking over the reviews, it proved rather shocking to me that people have been complaining that, although it was original when it was published, much of what Tolkien has done has become cliche and that other writers are much better working with these cliches and making them more exciting than Tolkien. They complain about his \\""endless descriptions\\"" of the natural world, very detailed accounts of geography and not enough \\""characterization.\\"" The characters are unrealistic: the \\""human drama\\"" required by the book's very nature is beyond Tolkien's scope as a writer. THE FELLOWSHIP is both uneven and very weak in pacing, with so much invested in the world and its history Tolkien forgets to make us care about the characters themselves. Another fault oft cited against Tolkien is the lack of \\""female characters,\\"" and there have been accusations that Tolkien is racist; one of my favorite misconceptions is that Frodo and Sam are homosexuals.<br /><br />Academia has no time for Tolkien, and many of our key critics have denounced Tolkien as ill-written or escapist (Harold Bloom said that THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a period piece which will simply not die but just keeps lingering on long after its relevance. This is the stance taken by a lot of professional critics with a grudge against Tolkien, and wonderfully have been proven wrong). To this day, while not nearly as openly hostile as previous decades, academia in general harbors resentment against Tolkien and everything he's done. As far as they're concerned, he's done something that is actually popular and therefore unworthy of study. It's one of those \\""high-brow vs. low-brow\\"" situations, and instead of producing \\""worthwhile\\"" academic research, Tolkien instead writes a \\""series\\"" of novels which become one of the most established authors of this century. In recent years, academic support has grown tremendously for Tolkien, but he is still a very hotly contested modern writer, unlike some other \\""academically undeniable\\"" classics such as James Joyce. Unlike the academic favorites, Tolkien highly polarizes the professional literary establishment. Fortunately he has gained some ground here though.<br /><br />Much of the complaints voiced against THE LORD OF THE RINGS are both unimportant and irrelevant. Tolkien is working with literary traditions not in-tune with the modern mind, but is instead handling narrative threads of Myth. Tolkien gives us solid archetypes to work with, bringing out the very qualities of masculinity and the beauties and stark wonders of femininty, but all expressed in mythological terminology. The idea of Sam and Frodo as homosexual is both ridiculous and totally unfounded. In Myth, good is characterized and seen as \\""White,\\"" and the evil is dark and perverted. Those who say Tolkien is racist approach him from the wrong standpoint.<br /><br />As for the modern fantasy reader, those who complain about Tolkien's originality (while acknowledging it, but that later writers do a much better job with it) is like saying Shakespeare, while a good dramatist, is not that good because other people take his principals and make them more exciting, etc. I heard a story once about a person who went to see a Shakespeare play and went away complaining there were too many quotes in the play to make it any good. Shakespeare is the source of these quotes and he did not even realise it.<br /><br />Most people know that Tolkien founded modern fantasy. Tolkien laid down the template for the fantasy genre in general, and anyone who reads fantasy has been touched, directly or indirectly, by Tolkien's work. Almost all of the major fantasy authors have acknowledge their debt to Tolkien, and the shadow Tolkien casts over fantasy literature is very long indeed. Because there is fifty years separating us from the original publication, it is much harder to approach THE LORD OF THE RINGS as those first reviewers, for those who have grown up reading fantasy literature are now accustomed to Dwarves and Elves and Dark Lords and Epic Quests, but when it was issued THE LORD OF THE RINGS transformed and invented an entire new genre. It is not Tolkien's fault that his vision of a mythology was so successful that everyone else decided they would try their hand at fantasy and work within Tolkien's templates. The main problem with fantasy authors in general are they are more interested in emulation than they are in true \\""myth-making.\\"" Much like early rock and roll, which, because rock was not an established form of music, the early musicians relied on other forms to create a new genre, Tolkien did not have this tradition to fall back on so instead he used various literatures and epic poems to create his own vision of myth. A lot of fantasy writers do not work in the context of myth any more, but rather rely on genre stereotypes which are generally found in Tolkien. Many readers who are interested in \\""pulp\\"" fantasy get bogged down in Tolkien because he takes the time to fully explain his world and its cultures, because his goal is different. There is plenty of action in LORD OF THE RINGS, but those raised on the pulp fantasy will not care for it.<br /><br />Ultimately, THE LORD OF THE RINGS's criticism has shown itself to be of little important on its durability as a major text. Ever since its publication in 1954, 1955, and 1956, LOTR has become one of the most important literary works our era has produced, highly regarded and passionately loved by an enormous amount of people. Despite the very vocal minority who despise Tolkien and his work, THE LORD OF THE RINGS has consistently topped the polls for the best book of the last one hundred years. Whatever the critics say, THE LORD OF THE RINGS is here to stay because popular imagination has grabbed hold of Tolkien's vision and ran with it. Tolkien and Lewis have been wonderfully vindicated in their belief that there is an enormous adult appetite for Myth and fantasy literature.<br /><br />For many, it's more than a mere novel.  It's a glimpse of the divine.<br /><br />It is like water in a dry place.<br />.<br />.<br />-----<br />THE LORD OF THE RINGS is NOT a trilogy<br /><br />I have been looking over the reviews THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  There is one consistent problem that keeps jumping to my attention: the reviewers keep talking as if each volume in \\""the trilogy\\"" is a self-contained novel.  They are not actual novels.  THE LORD OF THE RINGS is not a trilogy - it's a single novel divided into three parts for publication purposes.  That's why they're published Part I, Part II, and Part III instead of Book I, etc.<br /><br />When Tolkien wrote it and had it published by Allen & Unwin, Sir Stanley Unwin had doubts about its size and the market (remember, this was back in the 50s, and THE HOBBIT had been a book for children - now they have this book that has all the hall marks of a publishing nightmare).  Instead of publishing it as a whole, they decided to divide the novel* into three parts.  Because there were six subdivisions therein (although I might be mistaken, and these Books I-VI might also be publication impositions), they chose to publish THE LORD OF THE RINGS in three books.  One purpose for this was to hide the sheer size of the book.  The second reason for doing so was to get three reviews instead of one.  Tolkien himself, however, always made it a point to tell people that it is not a trilogy but a single, unified work.<br /><br />Although THE LORD OF THE RINGS basically invented the fantasy genre, from a publisher's standpoint, it was a dangerous gamble.  It had to be sold at a high cost (21 shillings) to the reader, but Rayner Unwin (Sir Stanley's son) thought it a `work of genius', so they published it.  Instead of usual royalty payments, Tolkien got half of all profits, which meant that if the book flopped (most probable) he wouldn't get anything, because the book had to pay for itself before either the author OR the publisher got profits.  Obviously Tolkien came out far ahead on that deal than had he gone with a more traditional publishing arrangement with Stanley Unwin.",2012-12-14

In a very real sense I stepped out that door with Bilbo and found adventures and terrors that have rarely been matched and never been outdone.<br /><br />I have been a regular reader of the trilogy ever since, coming back time and again and never failing to come away with some new enjoyment. At first it was simply the fascination with the sheer fantasy: The characters, The settings, The battles. Then the depth of his world pulled me in. I often found myself reading the glossary and studying the various languages and histories of the races for hours before re-reading the story. And then again after because I didn't want to say good-bye so soon.  Finally, well past my own innocence I began to see new complexities and allegories that have only served to deepen my appreciation for this modern myth that Tolkien created.<br /><br />But always and above all else, it was simply the story.

As C.S. Lewis said, &#34;here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron. Here is a book which will break your heart.&#34;<br /><br />Just the thought of it is enough to scare anyone off the job. Yet, reading over the other customer reviews, I felt I needed to step up to the challenge and write a long review, one that contained an honest opinion and a factual analysis. This review is long, but is logical, informational, and spoiler-free, I encourage you to read it all, thoroughly.<br />This is that review:<br /><br />LOTR [abbreviation: Lord of the Rings] is the magnum opus of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien: an Oxford professor and author. It is actually a trilogy of three books: --The Fellowship of the Ring --The Two Towers --and The Return of the King. JRRT spent over 12 yrs writing the LOTR trilogy, which was released in 1954. It has since gone on to become one of the most loved, respected, and greatest novels ever written. After a wildly successful and brilliant film adaptation from New Zealander Peter Jackson, the LOTR now has an immense fan base, a slew of parodies, paintings, and music left in its wake, and a legacy greater than any single work of fantasy in the history of writing.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The first thing I must write about is the land LOTR takes place in: Arda, also known as Middle Earth. Middle Earth is the greatest fictional world ever created. Period. I DEFY anyone to prove otherwise. Take it up with me in the comments. The main works of Tolkien, from the Silmarillion to the Lord of the Rings take place in Middle Earth, and cover everything from its creation at the hands of Illuvatar, to the beginning of the Fourth Age. Tolkien meticulously planned, invented, and imagined EVERY detail of Middle Earth. Middle Earth is so full, so rich and detailed, that many say that Tolkien was more interested in the land his characters were in than the characters themselves.<br />I beg to differ!--Tolkien was certainly interested in his maps and landscapes but his characters are the real stars.<br /><br />But there are not enough adjectives in my vocabulary to describe how mind-bogglingly detailed Middle Earth is. Tolkien named and placed over a thousand mountains, rivers, towns, cities, fortresses, islands, and forests, so many, in fact, that encyclopedias and dictionaries have been filled with them. In addition, Tolkien invented over a dozen languages, the most complete of them is Quenya--the Elven language. Tolkien wrote over 1,000 names, words, and phrases for the Elven languages. Tolkien is not the only author to make up a fantasy language, but he is the best. Young Christopher Paolini's attempts at constructing a language are downright laughable.<br /><br />I am in no way detracting from other great fantasy worlds such as Westeros, Narnia, Randland, and Gormenghast, but here Middle Earth far surpasses all other fantasy worlds. The detail adds to the LOTR by adding a sense of realism and a distinct Middle Earth-type feel. For the most part, the more detailed your world is, the more your audiences will relate to the characters.<br /><br />Enough about the real world, I'll turn to the book.<br />--Lord of the Rings is long, over 1,000 pages. But this is not long at all compared to Eragon, Game of Thrones, Eye of the World, and the Way of Kings.<br />-- Plot: Thanks, to Peter Jackson, you probably already know the plot. But the movies are not the book, and here is the plot again.<br /><br />It is the third age of the world, and darkness is looming over Middle Earth. The Dark Lord Sauron has gathered to him the 20 Rings of Power, the means by which he will enslave Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Only one thing is missing - the One Ring, which has fallen into the hands of...a hobbit. Deep in the peaceful Shire, young Frodo Baggins is entrusted withan immense task - to take the Ring and destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom, deep within the Enemy's territory. So, with a Fellowship of 9 valiant members - 4 hobbits, 1 wizard, 2 men, and elf, and a dwarf, Frodo must embark on an impossible journey. One from which he may not return...<br /><br />My favorite member of the Fellowship is Samwise. Yeah, laugh all you want and post your little comments about &#34;Fat old Sam&#34;. But until you've read The Choices of Master Samwise, or the Tower of Cirith Ungol, or Mount Doom...you haven't seen ANYTHING yet. Samwise Gamgee is easily the greatest, most courageous character in the Fellowship.<br /><br />Next would be Gandalf. Read this passage from The White Rider, and tell me...<br />&#34;And this also I say: you are our captain and our banner. The Dark Lord has Nine. But we have One, mightier than they: the White Rider. He has passed through fire and the abyss, and they shall fear him. We will go where he leads.&#34;<br />...that doesn't give you shivers!<br /><br />...<br /><br />Many people like to say Tolkien's characters are &#34;black-and-white&#34;. This means that all his characters are easily divided into Good and Evil. That's not true. Today, fantasy authors like to paint their characters Grey. Look at G.R.R.M.'s writings: Characters like Tyrion, Jaime, Theon, the Hound, and Daenerys. Are they good or evil...Whose side are they on...What are their true intentions...?<br /><br />Whereas in Tolkien's writings: Aragorn - Good, Sauron - Bad, Gandalf - Good, Saruman - Bad, Elves - Good, Orcs - Bad. It's simple, Right? Wrong.<br /><br />Look at Boromir - he's fought against Sauron, yet he tried to take the Ring from Frodo. He wanted to defeat Sauron, but he opposed destroying the Ring. And Sm&eacute;agol - he was Frodo and Sam's guide, yet he wanted the Ring for himself. He led them into Mordor, yet he ------------------- (Spoiler). Those are grey characters.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The legacy of Tolkien's works, especially LOTR, CANNOT be overstated.<br /><br />LOTR has been voted &#34;The Greatest Book of the Millennium&#34;, by Amazon.com and appears on almost EVERY list of greatest books ever written. It is the bestselling book of all time, selling over 150,000,000 copies. The Peter Jackson Trilogy alone has grossed over $2,947,978,376, and has been voted the greatest Motion Picture Trilogy of all time by Empire Magazine.<br />The three films are some of the most famous, iconic, and greatest adaptations of a fantasy novels ever made, appearing on Wikipedia's List of Highest Grossing Films, Empire Magazine's 500 Greatest Movies List, AFI's 100 Greatest Films List, IMDb's 250 Best Films list, and Metacritc's Best Movies of This Decade.<br /><br />LOTR's impact on high, epic, heroic, and quest fantasy, is enormous. It revitalized the genre. No, it REWROTE the genre.<br />LOTR is the father of modern fantasy. Believe it or not, even today's fantasy (A Song of Ice and Fire, The Inheritance Cycle, etc) is influenced by Tolkien. Tolkien's character's Frodo, Gandalf, Gollum and others have entered popular culture.<br /><br />While Tolkien may not have invented Elves, Dragons, Dwarves, or Orcs, his vision of those creatures shaped the characters into what we recognize them as today. Science Fiction authors such as Arthur C. Clarke (2001: A Space Odyssey) and Frank Herbert (Dune) and George Lucas (Star Wars) have been influenced by Tolkien. It is easy to see how fantasy authors are influenced by Tolkien. Terry Brooks, Stephen R. Donaldson, David Eddings, and, yes, Christopher Paolini all ripped LOTR off. George R.R. Martin has been called &#34;The American Tolkien&#34;, and claims JRRT as a huge influence.<br />J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, is truly, a Masterpiece!<br /><br />...<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />As the Sunday Times famously said:<br />&#34;The English speaking world is divided into those who have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and those who are going to read them.&#34;<br /><br />Which camp are you? If you have not read the Lord of the Rings - The Greatest Book of the Millennium, The Most Influential Work of Fantasy - do so immediately.<br /><br />I'm not joking. If I haven't given you enough incentive already, how about some more:<br />Do you like fantasy? Do you like good, no, great books?

It is the bestselling book of all time, selling over 150,000,000 copies. The Peter Jackson Trilogy alone has grossed over $2,947,978,376, and has been voted the greatest Motion Picture Trilogy of all time by Empire Magazine.<br />The three films are some of the most famous, iconic, and greatest adaptations of a fantasy novels ever made, appearing on Wikipedia's List of Highest Grossing Films, Empire Magazine's 500 Greatest Movies List, AFI's 100 Greatest Films List, IMDb's 250 Best Films list, and Metacritc's Best Movies of This Decade.<br /><br />LOTR's impact on high, epic, heroic, and quest fantasy, is enormous. It revitalized the genre. No, it REWROTE the genre.<br />LOTR is the father of modern fantasy. Believe it or not, even today's fantasy (A Song of Ice and Fire, The Inheritance Cycle, etc) is influenced by Tolkien. Tolkien's character's Frodo, Gandalf, Gollum and others have entered popular culture.<br /><br />While Tolkien may not have invented Elves, Dragons, Dwarves, or Orcs, his vision of those creatures shaped the characters into what we recognize them as today. Science Fiction authors such as Arthur C. Clarke (2001: A Space Odyssey) and Frank Herbert (Dune) and George Lucas (Star Wars) have been influenced by Tolkien. It is easy to see how fantasy authors are influenced by Tolkien. Terry Brooks, Stephen R. Donaldson, David Eddings, and, yes, Christopher Paolini all ripped LOTR off. George R.R.

I Wonder How Many Have Actually Read The Lord of the Rings In Its Entirety?","Generally I am not a big fantasy fan, but I can't believe I waited all these years to read the complete Lord of the Rings. I finished The Hobbit immediately prior and it definitely is a must-read before starting LOTR. The Hobbit serves as a prologue and eases you into the world of Middle Earth, leaving you wanting more.<br /><br />It seemed as if almost everyone I knew said they had read The Lord of the Rings. Finally reading it myself, however, I began to wonder how many people had ever actually read the entire work. Tolkien's world of Middle Earth is so rich with such complex history and meaning that it takes a good bit of time and thinking to absorb it all. I finally came to wonder if many \\""readers\\"" had actually taken shortcuts by skimming the text, or had simply watched the films and said they had read it. I did not watch the films until I completed the entirety of The Lord of the Rings, and I enjoyed the extended version of each film when I was done. They are terrific adaptations, but the material here is so deep and rich that no film, no matter how well done, can possibly do it full justice.<br /><br />The Lord of the Rings was always treated by Tolkien as being one book and not a trilogy. Having everything in one volume to me was the best way to go. Do not be put off by the size of the volume. A good writer (and Tolkien is one of the very best) will draw you into the story and will keep you engaged throughout. I began by reading 10-20 pages a night, gradually letting Tolkien build his world around me piece by piece until I was entirely consumed with the world of Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Aragorn, and the evil Sauron, who secretly created \\""one ring to rule them all\\"" to control all of the other rings of power in Middle Earth. The One Ring contains such absolute power that it corrupts and changes all those who come in contact with it, and must be destroyed for the good of all in Middle Earth.<br /><br />One of my big problems with fantasy writing in the past has been that of omnipotence. Since fantasy usually involves a new world with new rules and the catch-all of magic, an author literally can do anything in the story and get away with it. This absolute creative power, the author's own One Ring if you will, never corrupts Tolkien. Everything in LOTR makes sense and everything in the story \\""works\\"" because Tolkien himself never succumbs to the power of this figurative \\""ring\\"" by cheating the way some other authors seem to do. What's more, he ties everything in to a vast historical background so we as readers can see the logical changes and flow of history throughout the ages and the vast saga that is the world of Middle Earth.<br /><br />Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is an amazing work of the imagination and a triumph of the human mind. In writing it Tolkien did not cheat as an author, and neither should you as a reader. If you only skimmed Lord of the Rings in the past or have only watched the films, you owe it to yourself to make the time to go back and read it cover-to-cover. Take your time, read slowly, and fully realize the lush, vibrant, and unequaled world of J.R.R. Tolkien. Very highly recommended.that of omnipotence.

Ever since I was read The Hobbit when I was young, I have loved Tolkien. The Lord of the Rings gives beautiful descriptions of a well-thought out world peopled by diverse races of beings. The story itself is about the struggle of good against evil and saving all that is fair in the world. Some of the characters in this novel are among my favorites in all of literature.<br /><br />About this edition: I love that it is a one-volume edition, as I can read it as a single novel if I choose, like Tolkien originally intended. The appendices are easy to reference in a one-volume book. Since it is quite hefty, I don't recommend it if you are looking for an easily portable book. What I do recommend this volume for are the illustrations by Alan Lee. His paintings to a wonderful job of capturing the atmosphere of Middle Earth, and I love coming across them in my reading. The book comes with a ribbon page marker and is bound in a satisfactory manner for such a large book. If you are a fan of Tolkien and want an edition to treasure for a long time, this is, in my opinion, well worth the price.<br /><br />That being said, there is one con (other than the bulkiness factor) that I must mention. The maps, unlike in some editions, are not pull out. Rather, they have separated one map over multiple places so that it is rather difficult to figure out where places are in relation to each other. I don't know why the publisher decided to do it this way, since it renders the map ineffective. Other than this problem, it is a great edition.",2012-01-03

Its boards are bound in red faux leather, in imitation of the original at Undertowers. Stylized trees and stars, in gold and blue and green foil, adorn the covers and spine. It has some heft but feels good and lies open in the hand.<br /><br />2. The Shire map is drawn in a finer hand than that of my paperback reading copy. It seems less cluttered; everything is there, but the finer lines give the appearance of more space.<br /><br />3. The book is printed in red and black.

My reading copy (a 1990s paperback) is missing a line of the Ring verse, but it is present here.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />1. The fold-out map of Middle-earth is the only map of Middle-earth. It is very large, and it is not convenient to unfold it while reading. I would have included the quadrant maps prepared for the paperback editions in addition to the fold-out, for easier reference while reading. There are more than enough blank endpapers.<br /><br />2. The large scale map of Rohan, Gondor, and Mordor is missing. They didn't print it on a fold-out and paste it into the book, they didn't reduce it and print it in the text block, it's just not there. This is an integral part of Return of the King, having been published in the first edition and (as far as I know) every edition thereafter. Its absence is very regrettable. The Houghton Mifflin catalog says this edition includes fold-out maps, plural; so do I have a defective book, or is the catalog text wrong? (Further research suggests all copies of the book are missing the map; the catalog is wrong.)<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />1.

The illustrations by Alan Lee enhance the whole story and are very well done. The books are very easy to read since the font is big enough and it doesn't tire your eyes if you are reading for an extended period of time.

The first book starts with foreword to second edition and some notes and the third book have a very detailed Appendix (for those who want to learn more) in the end that shows the family trees, ruling lines, elvish letters, hobbit's calendar and other fun and interesting stuff that will enhance your story.<br /><br />Bottom line.

Not wanting to wait the year long release date to know the story, I decided to read the books in their place, but being so young I was unable to adequately understand the significance of the story as a whole. I wanted to read of the action parts and the continuation of the story line, not the \\""boring\\"" descriptive paragraphs on the setting. Since the age of fourteen I hadn't picked the books up until recently when I attended a community college class covering The Lord of the Rings. We covered the three books as well as The Hobbit, with watching the three movies in a compare and contrast aspect. This review is actually part of the final project for this given class, and how much easier can you get for a final, right? But in watching the movies compared to reading the books at an adult age, I realized how much I really missed when I was a child. There is so much of the books that seem new to me in this second reading, and so much more than what is presented in the three films. I truly did love the movies, a fan that went to see them a minimum of 5 times each in theatres, but re-reading the books gave me so much more of what Tolkien wanted to tell. The \\""boring\\"" descriptive parts became another world in which I could engulf myself in, almost to the point of escape from the troubles that blare across our news lines. But the books aren't for us to lose ourselves in, to escape the problems of our lives; it gives us a sense of what is required for them. A common theme of the book is courage in the face of imminent danger, which I sure a lot of us can relate to. Tomorrow is not guaranteed, and no one knows what troubles are in store for us, but we must have courage to go out our front door and face them head-on. This I feel is what the underlining theme that these books give us, and in them we can find strength, for if Frodo and Sam can travel to Mount Doom, then I surely can finish my schooling and become a Professor to help the next generation along its path.

I am in an English class that is focusing on Tolkien and his works, and our final project is to write a online review for either the books or the movies. Throughout the semester we read the Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings and watched the movies. I entered the class having only watched the movies. I already loved it from that, and finally reading all the books only made my love for the story grow. There's so much more detail and story in the books that the movie doesn't have. I'm not saying that the movies left anything really important out, but that the books give you a more in-depth look into world of Middle Earth.<br /> This is one of the greatest stories ever written. Frodo's journey is very inspiring. A gentle hobbit takes on this impossible quest, going against ruthless monsters, traitors and a terribly, evil creature, named Sauron, with the ability to control the world, all to save his the world from Sauron's evil clutches. Then there is the other story of Aragorn's own struggle from a creepy unknown ranger in a bar to a King trying to prove himself honorable. You don't just read the Lord of the Rings, you experience it. Tolkien's wonderful writing and descriptions transport you to Middle Earth and have you experience each battle and each journey. Tolkien was a genius and put some serious thought into this. He created a whole other world filled with it's own creatures, people, history and problems. The stories make you happy, sad, excited and nervous, and with every page turn you will be wondering what is going to happen next.<br /> Each character you meet along the way has their own personality and story that is just as interesting as the next. They each play their own part to the story, and the friendships created are simply amazing. It can be a little tedious to get through at certain points, and the intense descriptions can lose you, but in the end it is worth it. It's very easy to skip over certain parts or put it down for a few months, but fight that urge, and don't skip anything!<br /> After reading The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite stories. It will be remembered for hundred and thousands of years to come, or at least it should be. I suggest this book to anyone who can read. It's a great story for all ages.or put it down for a few months, but fight that urge, and don't skip anything!<br /> After reading The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite stories.

But more on that in a moment, first a note about this three-book hardcover version (with the off-white covers). It was impossible for me to choose which edition I wanted, and I settled on this one. I was very disappointed when--despite Amazon's description--it is not illustrated by Alan Lee. There are no illustrations except Tolkien's from the original text. Otherwise, though, this is a good, durable, convient for reading, individual hardcover set. The hardcovers are a good size for reading.<br /><br />First time reading this since I saw the movie, second time reading.<br />A classic of the genre that started too many clich&eacute;s of that genre. The characters are pretty flat and much of it is simplistic and silly and incredibly tedious and often confusing (hence where the films succeed with loving care). And yet, it's still wonderful. Clever and imaginative, and frankly, just stunningly beautiful in the richness of the language and the (epic) poetry of the descriptions, details, moods, and feelings. The idea of the littlest, humblest creature being in possession of great, tempting evil and his epic journey to carry the burden through a falling world in order to destroy it. Just simply fantastic storytelling with a loving appreciation for the power of words.<br /><br />The books get darker and richer as they move on, reflecting a deep appreciation for the reality under the fantasy--the reality of the burdens within heroism, of the darkness and oppression of evil, the grim emotions of loss and longing, a understanding of the bonds of friendship. Tolkien's epic is filled with beautiful imagery (Faramir's dreams, the dead marshes, the old forests, and most importantly, the weight of the Ring) that bring together simple (and therefore more powerful) magical fantasy with empirical reality.<br /><br />The last book is the best of the trilogy, rich in poetic feelings of bittersweet triumph, the sorrow and ever-lasting suffering of heroism, the renew of beauty and life in a world almost destroyed by ash and shadow, but a world that will never forget the darkness, the sadness of innocence lost and pastoral paradise that can never be returned to, and the deep bonds and devotion of friendship. Ultimately, the theme of these beautifully written epic books is that the smallest, unlikeliest person can be the grandest hero, as long as he does the best he can when fate deals him a difficult hand. And fate will deal us monstrous duties, but we must become the hero. Also, evil is evil, as is power, and it cannot be used for good. It will corrupt and destroy everything.

And fate will deal us monstrous duties, but we must become the hero. Also, evil is evil, as is power, and it cannot be used for good. It will corrupt and destroy everything.

The genius who wrote these books was so thorough that he even made a whole alphabet and language with vividly descriptive maps to describe all the creatures and areas of Middle Earth. This trilogy is so great in description that it will change how you judge other epic series such as the \\""Chronicles of Narnia\\"". If you think that you might not be ready to read a long trilogy such as this, I would recommend another one of J.R.R Tolkien's books - The Hobbit, another book about a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who is Frodo's uncle.<br /><br />  This story starts out in the Shire, a small part of Middle Earth where lazy, fat hobbits live and love to eat work and sleep. They also love parties. Hobbits' regularly eat 2 breakfasts, one brunch, three lunches, dinner, and finally, supper.  Two of the main characters are Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee who are both Hobbits from the Shire.<br /><br />In early Middle Earth, Saroun the Dark Lord made 19 rings. Three for the elves, six for the dwarves, nine for men, and one to bind them together. Saroun gave away all of the rings except for the final one. When the creatures of Middle Earth saw the power that Saroun had, they came together to destroy him, but when they finally defeated Saroun the greedy men kept the Ring instead of destroying the Ring by throwing it into Mordor. The temptation of the ring was too much and they never fully destroyed Saroun. On the way home however, the men with the Ring were ambushed by the remaining orcs and the man holding the Ring jumped into a nearby lake and put on the ring, which gives you the power to become invisible.  As he was swimming, the ring fell off and he was visible again and the orcs shot him with arrows and killed him and the ring was lost in the water.<br /><br />  A few generations later the Ring was found by two Hobbits, one known by the name of Golom or Smeagol. Smeagol and his friend fought over the Ring until Smeagol finally strangled his friend and takes the ring for himself. Then Smeagol has the Ring taken away from him in a dark troll cave by a clever Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who is on an journey (which is very unlike Hobbits) with the wizard Gandalf the Grey.  Bilbo brings the Ring back to the Shire and passes it down to Frodo.<br /><br />When the great wizard Gandalf sees that Frodo Baggins has the Ring of power  he gives him a mission to travel with a small band of heroes, including himself, to Mt.Mordor so they can destroy the Ring (and Saroun) once and for all.  These heroes go through the forests of the fine elves, the mines of the hard working dwarves, and the great palaces of men to get to Mordor before Saroun destroys them all. In the many battles that follow, it is back and forth with good vs. evil. While the good warriors fight Saroun and his army, Frodo and his helper, Sam Gamgee, travel with their guide Smeagol to Mt.Mordor. During the journey to Mordor, Smeagol is planning to reclaim his ring by killing the Hobbits.<br /><br /> The problem is that the ring Frodo carries is very powerful and tempting to anyone that gets near it. This was a big problem because the creatures that are most tempted by the ring are the ones that have power but still want more . The problem is only solved at the end when Frodo finally throws the ring into the flames of Mount Mordor and both the ring and Saroun are destroyed.<br /><br />Another problem before the ring was destroy was Saroun's army.  To overcome this difficulty all the good creatures of Middle Earth came together and fight in many battles until the final one when the men, elves, dwarves, eagles, and ents destroyed all of the orcs.<br /><br />I would give these books a 10 out of 10 ratting especially for the 3rd book, The Return of the King, my favorite book.nown by the name of Golom or Smeagol.

When we read through the pages of these books, we discover a living world of wonder. We follow the fate of the Ring of Power, filled with evil, and one which could lead to the rule of darkness if it ever returns to its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron. Now some few people who really think they are so 'intellectually superior', or 'have more demanding taste', or whatever title of arrogance they try to give themselves, often dismiss this fascinating myth as 'children's stories', and that if one was to read a real novel, they would never return to such 'rubbish'. Well, I pity them, for they (like the Cynic in Hawthorne's 'The Great Carbuncle')must look at everything through dark spectacles, not allowing themselves to experience the beauty of this tale. Their preferences are theirs, and I am glad there is variety in this world. But when they mock those of different taste, it often displays their own ignorance. The Lord of the Rings is not just a story of magic and imaginary creatures. It is a tale of good and evil, and not just a 'Guy in White vs. Guy in Black' kind of story. It shows the subtlety of evil, how it can worm its way into even the hearts of the most honest person. It shows how good can strengthen a person, and how love can allow one to bear a multitude of burdens. I have read many novels ([[ASIN:0141439602 A Tale of Two Cities (Penguin Classics)]], [[ASIN:0399529209 Lord of the Flies (50th Anniversary Edition)]], [[ASIN:1438241577 The Scarlet Letter]], and [[ASIN:B000G961S0 On His Own]] being some of the finer examples), and although good ones are compelling, none that I have read would make me turn away from Middle-Earth. It is not just a 'children's story' (though most children enjoy it), but an enthralling study in the nature of mankind, and the forces that shape him.<br />  Now, on to this particular presentation of these books!

Without Tolkien, we don't have Terry Pratchett, JK Rowling, Jim Butcher, Mercedes Lackey -- the list is long. Tolkien took fantasy from the province of children and created a new genre of literature that was the proper playground for adults.  He made a place for the myths and legends of the past to come and be welcome in the modern world.<br /><br />THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a grand epic story set in the world that Tolkien created called Middle-Earth, astonishingly peopled and rich in lore, languages and cultures. (The different languages caused publication errors and inconsistencies in many early editions.)  It is fabulous entertainment on so vast a scale that no movie to date has completely captured all the diverse themes and characters. (Yes, Peter Jackson made a great try, but where's Saruman, eh?) It is difficult for a short review to do this great work justice. But part of the impact and fascination of the work can be explained by examining Tolkien's three main heroes.<br /><br />Gandalf the Wizard is an attractive figure, mysterious and powerful. With his long beard, homespun robes and long staff, he has some of the characteristics of a Biblical prophet, and he is indeed a messenger of the gods, sent to struggle against the evil of the Enemy.  He's kind to hobbits and children, good with fireworks and special effects at parties, but he's also capable of chasing away Nazgul and healing King Theoden. He's likable, compelling, magical and not without touches of humor. He can't even die -- he gets sent back to assure that his job gets done.<br /><br />Aragon is a figure out of legend--the king in exile who will defeat the Great Enemy and restore the kingdom to peace and glory.  Spurring him on in his ambition is the great love of his life, Arwen Evenstar, who will chose a mortal life to be his wife and Queen. Aragon changes in the eyes of the reader from the suspicious Strider to the noble king being crowned at Minas Tirith but this is a case of his nature being gradually revealed to us.<br /><br />Wizard and warrior king are stock characters in traditional fantasy.  Tolkien gives us great examples in Gandalf and Aragon, but the compelling edge of his great epic comes from the character of Frodo.  Whereas Gandalf has a job to do and is given great powers to help accomplish it, Frodo has only dogged perseverance. While Aragon wins his kingdom and his elven princess, Frodo hazards all he has, and loses it. He sacrifices everything for the Shire, but returns so damaged in spirit that he can not live there.<br /><br />When I first read this book as a teeny-bopper, I thought Gandalf was cool--galloping around on a fabulous horse and zapping bad guys on winged monsters.  Later, I thought Aragon was a heartthrob--so handsome and noble, all the girls are crazy about him.  But as I get older, the character of Frodo speaks to me: the little guy, putting one foot after another on a hopeless quest, bearing a treasure that must be destroyed, knowing in his heart that he will fail before the end, and at the last, accomplishing his quest only because he showed mercy to an enemy. Is this fantasy? Or wisdom to armor one in the quest for a life well-lived?<br /><br />More than 40 years after I first read this, I bowed to the inevitable and replaced my tattered paperback edition with a boxed hardback set.  I love having the red and black ink maps of Middle Earth in full fold-out glory.from the suspicious Strider to the noble king being crowned at Minas Tirith but this is a case of his nature being gradually revealed to us.<br /><br />Wizard and warrior king are stock characters in traditional fantasy.

If you have ever had the pleasure of examining first editions of The Lord of the Rings books (and I have), its the same font that was used on the first printing. Thirdly, there were complaints about the fold out maps being hard to get out. The maps are FOLD OUT and ARE NOT meant to be taken out!

It played a huge role in the creation of the modern fantasy genre-every writer of fantasy today owes something to Tolkein. And it is simply excellent.<br />Tolkein begins the book with the lighthearted story of Bilbo's last birthday in the Shire, and then draws the reader slowly into something darker-the final confrontation, in this age, between good and utmost evil. Tolkein writes wonderfully-he uses many old, archaic words and poetic descriptions, and his characters often burst out into song or poetry, but, unlike some less skilled writers, Tolkein makes this add to his story, rather than take away from it. Indeed, the thing that comes through most is the shear wonder and majesty in which he describes his world-a world he created and fleshed out in exacting detail, in a way few authors have managed to do since. Tolkein's descriptions of the journey his characters must take are excellent too-we feel Frodo's shock at finding the ring, determination to do what he must, wonder at the world he encounters, and, as he walks through Mordor, despair combined with a determination to, if nothing else, complete the task that fate has, for reasons of its own, dropped into his lap. The other storylines Tolkein introduces are treated just as well-the urgency of the battles, and the final decision of Aragorn to sacrifice everything, in the one, final hope of letting Frodo live to destroy the ring.<br />Indeed, if Lord of the Rings has a central theme, it is hope. There is an old quote, I believe by a Mr. Chesterson: \\""Fairy tales are real not because they tell us dragons exist, but because they tell us dragons can be beaten.\\"" In an uncertain world, where it is impossible to tell how things will settle, and where the books esteamed as \\""literature\\"" all seem to compete to see which can contain the most unhappiness and despair, it is reassuring to have a book with a resounding message-the dragons of the world can, indeed, be beaten.an, indeed, be beaten.",2008-03-08

Tolkien, [[ASIN:0395595118 The Lord of the Rings (Illustrated Edition)]].  This is probably only for the (at least) semi-fanatical Tolkien fan.<br /><br />I had owned a set of soft cover individual books (all four:  Hobbit, Fellowship, Two Towers, Return) that were published in 1964 (before I was born), and they had, unfortunately, deteriorated, both from age and rough use (read in the bathtub, at the park just before a rain shower, jammed in a briefcase to be read at lunch, etc.)  I thought about simply buying the new individual paperbacks, but researched and found this illustrated version, published in 1991, on the 100th anniversary of Tolkien's birth.<br /><br />The bad news:  this thing is massive!  Holding one giant volume and actually reading it presents some problems.<br /><br />That being said, this is THE version of the story, presented as Tolkien intended it:  \\""One book to rule them all\\"" to paraphrase the master.  The size of the book emphasizes that this is the definitive work of twentieth-century fantasy.  The red sash bookmark is classy.  The illustrations are nice, and add an excellent counter-point to the words.  To again paraphrase Tolkien's critique of his own work, \\""I only wish there were more [illustrations].\\""  (Of course, there are plenty of books out there with a great deal of artwork, enough to satisfy just about everyone.)<br /><br />In the end, this is like buying your mixed drinks in a bar, and insisting on top shelf alcohol.  A real devotee can appreciate the difference, but to the average person is it really worth the extra money?  As a bit of a Tolkien fanatic (I have read the story about fifteen times in the last thirty years), the $40+ bucks was worth it, even though I could have purchased a whole new set of the four in paperback for at least $10 less.<br /><br />For each potential buyer, take the advice of Galadriel and look inside yourself.

On a personal note, special attention was obviously paid to this edition, as compared to some of the other poorly printed editions.  The cover boards are in brown cloth with a simple gilded imprint of the professor's trademark signature.  Nothing very fancy, but elegant nonetheless.<br /><br />What should be great news to many readers, this edition is CONTINUOUS from page one to the end.  The table of contents lists the SIX books, as Prof. Tolkien intended!  Page numbering does not start over after each book:<br />Books 1-2 (Fellowship) = pp.  33 -  428<br />Books 3-4 (Two Towers) = pp. 429 -  772<br />Books 5-6 (Return)  = pp. 773 - 1069<br />Appendix A-F  = pp.1070 - 1172<br /><br />Six maps of middle-earth are bound in at the end of the book.

The \\""centennial\\"" edition won't be published until 2054, which will be the 100th anniversary of the original publication of Lord of the Rings. This is a very well designed and well printed/bound edition, built to last and beatufil. Its only fault is the absence of fold-out maps (it has the black and white maps printed in sections, often seen in paperback editions).<br /><br />2) The reason for the broken type in the 1974 red leatherette \\""Collector's Edition\\"" (and the occurrences of this number on the order of 1 or 2 characters on every 50th page or so) is more likely that the source text from which the negatives/plates were made and this edition printed was itself flawed and originally was some form of letterpress metal type, probably Monotype [a more 'modern' version of the old LinoType system], though depending on the date of that setting [up to mid-'60s, or even later] it may have been hand-composed. All metal type gets re-used, and becomes worn and some of it cracked/chipped over time. There were many books reprinted in this way through the early '80s (and a few publishers, such as Lindsay Books, of long out-of-print, mostly public-domain or 'gray rights' titles, still do this).<br /><br />The problem is unlikely to have been caused by faults in photo-typesetting strips or process-camera negs in 1973 or so (when this LOTR Collector's Edition was first printed) since that process was a fully mature, climax technology by then, and quality control was simply outstanding (this was due to that extinct beast, the unionized master-printer, especially at Houghton Mifflin, a publisher with a very large academic textbook list, and an industry reputation for quality production; just look at any ten trade hardbacks circa 1973 and earlier, and compare any element of quality to any ten current titles and it's clear the the technology and practice of printing and book binding peaked long ago, and nothing of newer technology, especially computer technology has served the interest of producing better made books, quite the opposite. 2007 tech only makes it faster and cheaper, nothing else.<br /><br />Remember also that it was the Allen & Unwin type-compositors who introduced virtually all the spelling and diction errors in both the 1st and 2nd editions, some of which have only finally been fixed in the 2004-05 50th Anniversary edition; and these were errors mostly such as 'dwarves' being \\""corrected\\"" to 'dwarfs', 'elven' to 'elfin', and many others, primarily linguistic, along those lines; these would have been proper corrections with any author other than Tolkien, of course.)<br /><br />As for the notion that photo-reproduction is at all like printing a Word document on a laser printer, then scanning it back into a computer as a JPEG or GIF image file, and finally printing it again, that is a facile and plainly inaccurate comparison. In short, unless one starts with a bitmap or similar low quality computer 'font', prints on low-brightness (&lt;70) recycled paper via a cheap ink-jet printer, scans using a 75-by-75 dpi setting via low-end scanning hardware and software, and repeats printing as above, the result will certainly be nothing so poor as Jeff Sun describes in his review. Photo-reproduction via PC and peripherals or via process-camera, strips, and offset printing, can easily and does commonly achieve excellent results, provided the equipment is of first quality and the operator is skilled.<br /><br />If anyone is obsessed enough to try this (as I clearly am), one fairly reliable way to tell whether a book is printed (at some stage) from some form of metal type is to use at least a 20x loupe and examine the vertical straight edges (particularly of upper N's, T's, L's, and E's) for irregularity. Metal type degrades in miniscule degrees after the first few hundred impressions, and will show this by cracking/splitting/chipping/warbling/bending and otherwise appearing NOT straight, sharp, and crisp (especially machine-set monotype/linotype which was all lead/tin, since it was melted down repeatedly; hand-set type has antimony and sometimes manganese in it, which makes it much harder to start and also casts more sharply; parts of letters break off but usually don't deform). It's a challenge to tell these apart, since photo-reproduction of letterpress can be hard to distinguish from original letterpress printing, if the latter is done by a highly skilled compositor and press operator. Some letterpress books show the impression of the type on the page, like a light embossing, from the force of the type striking the stock. Really good printing avoids this. So, if you have a book without this feature that does show feathering, breaks, waviness, etc. it may be either letterpress or photo-repro of LP, but if these traits are present it is almost certain metal type was used at some point in the life of the typesetting.<br /><br />Two caveats to even to this: feathering alone does not definitely mean deformed metal type. Feathering,, or little veins and stream-like projects away from the character is often caused by excessive inking and watery ink, and also by cheap papers that are unsized (meaning a starch like substance is added during the paper's manufacture to prevent feathering and bleedthrough; newsprint is unsized and you can see how feathering works buy lightly touching a fountain pen to a piece of it for a minute or so). The other caveat is that some computer fonts, especially some high end ones for MAC typesetting systems, have been photographically captured/reproduced from books printed mostly before 1800, and their designers often deliberately retain some of the source type's imperfections (which are due mostly to the more primitive metallurgy of that era) to achieve a particular design effect. You might be surprised how much theory and psychology underlies type-design and typography; there is a lot. Need a dissertation topic?<br /><br />This has become, I see now, a rant, and a really long one. First as a reader, then as a writer, then as apprentice in a letterpress print shop and bindery, I've always held the book as art-object or craft-work in very nearly as high esteem as the words contained within. I do think these issues are worth some ink, and I expect (or hope) that those interested in fine editions such as this so-called \\""Collector's \\"" (Ugh!

Tolkien was not the first or most critically-acclaimed fantasy writer, he remains the most beloved and influential, even though \\""Lord of the Rings\\"" is decades old.<br /><br />Now with the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\""Lord of the Rings.\\"" Tolkien's classic is a timeless tale of good and evil, written in a detailed, powerful style, set in a fictional world of staggering detail and haunting beauty.<br /><br />Following up on events in \\""The Hobbit,\\"" \\""The Fellowship of the Ring\\"" opens with the hobbit Bilbo Baggins departing from the Shire, after many years of living as the town eccentric. He reluctantly leaves his treasured ring of invisibility to his adventurous nephew Frodo, and vanishes into the wild with some dwarves.<br /><br />But Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a powerful item that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.<br /><br />\\""The Two Towers\\"" begins directly after \\""Fellowship,\\"" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.<br /><br />\\""Return of the King\\"" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br /><br />\\""Lord of the Rings\\"" is indeed a powerful book, and its timeless messages and quests have shaped the fantasy genre, and crossed the boundaries of literary fiction. At its core it's about the fight of good versus evil, and how \\""little people\\"" can have a strength and willpower that the great and mighty can't even begin to understand.<br /><br />And Middle-Earth is a pretty astounding universe -- not just because Tolkien created a rich back-history for it, but because of the feeling of mystery that hangs around its corners, whether it's dead soldiers or slumbering tree-men. And of course rich cultures of Men, ancient wizards, the stately melancholy elves, and the tough dwarves -- as well as the idyllic Shire, a sort of ancient British countryside which is threatened by corruption.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; an elf rider is simple described as shining like a light behind a veil. The story is wrapped in a wide range of dialogue -- from Sam's folksy chat to the Elves' ethereal, formal songs -- and the pacing is slow and gradual, but kept alive by sudden twists of the plot. The first several chapters are kind of slow-moving, but by the time our heroes get to Bree, the pace picks up.<br /><br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. The equally vibrant cast also includes Gandalf the crabby grandfatherly wizard, Sam Gamgee the loyal gardener, and a variety of kings, elves, dwarves, and more lovable little hobbits.<br /><br />Even after all the years, J.R.R.

Having read \\""The Hobbit\\"" before, I think this book will please you way more than its predecessor.<br /><br />Since I already gave it 5 stars and that pretty much everything has been said about \\""The Lord of the Rings\\"", I'll indulge in some negative criticism, not because I dislike the book but most because I don't feel like stating the obvious, especially when it has been said countless times before. So here is my (slightly) negative criticism.<br /><br />Having seen the movies, my reading was necessarily influenced. For instance, had I not seen the movies, I'm not at all sure that I would have actually understood that there was something between Aragorn and Arwen; I also seem to have missed their wedding, though I can't be sure why that is. Perhaps I was dozing as I read, or perhaps Tolkien didn't spend much time on that. I honestly don't know.<br /><br />I read somewhere that the book was criticised for its \\""simplistic character psychology\\"" which didn't seem especially relevant to me, or actually accurate, but I couldn't describe my impressions of Faramir falling in love with Eowen in any other way. This is but a trivial detail in the whole story, but when you read that bit, it does seem a but hard to swallow. From the moment they meet to the moment they marry there's not an awful lot of time (and pages) and so it seems a bit incredible. But then again, that's just a detail.<br /><br />Another thing I must admit I wasn't crazy about was all the singing and poetry reciting. I'm quite glad they didn't take on that in the movies because it would have easily become a musical. Again, it won't spoil the book's pleasure for you or anything, but I can't say that I read those bits with much delight.<br /><br />I'll stop here for the negative criticism because it's really not much.<br /><br />A word about the illustrations: they're gorgeous.

The answer to those who would so question is what I have always said, even before the films were made. This book is, I believe, unsurpassed by any other work in human history aside from the Bible. It is impossible to really do the work credit with any sort of brevity, however, for the sake of the reader's patience I will comment on what I believe to be the most important points.<br /><br />Firstly, if it is of any interest to anyone, in a world full of writers who become immensely popular despite very poor writing, here is a genius. Tolkien's masterpiece is written in somewhat antiquated language, which tends to add to it's mistique and prowess rather than to distract the reader. With a mixture of glowing description, intelligently crafted dialogue, and a combination of genres from narrative, to poetry, to prophecy, The Lord of the Rings will not leave you bored if you are intelligent enough to appreciate the style. When I first read the book I found the descriptions to be somewhat tedious, cutting off the story as they did (I was 15), however, having now read the books four times I have an appetite for good writing, not just an urge to find out what happens next. The dialogue can be rather long as well, as in the chapter, \\""The Council of Elrond,\\"" where upwards of 20 characters speak, the majority of whom you have heard little or nothing about. However, I have come to enjoy that chapter much more as I have grown older because of its hinting at a much greater world than the one we are exposed to.<br /><br />Secondly, the tale is captivating. It is a story of increasing intensity as the reader progresses and he is drawn in so easily and so fully that he may come out of it half believing that this quest actually happened. You feel Sam's joy and being sent with Frodo; you feel the Hobbit's terror at the Barrow Downs; your hurts are healed with the Fellowship at Lothlorien; you are captivated by the mustering of the Rohirrim; you are petrified by Shelob; you are laughing at Merry and Pippin the whole way. The genius of Tolkien creates a complete empathy on the part of the reader for the characters. I would be interested to know how many other people are actually in tears at any point in the reading of this book. I am at several, I will admit.<br /><br />Lastly, and I believe, most importantly, it is necessary to uncover some of the timeless thematic elements of this masterpiece. Books like, Finding God in the Lord of the Rings, have failed to do this book justice in their exploration of such themes, unfortunately. I do not wish to comment on all such themes b/c to do so would take far too long. However, I will make bold to say that I believe the overarching theme of the book to be self-sacrifice. Ultimately, self-sacrifice amounts to love, as far as I can see it, b/c it is a giving of one's self in the interest of others w/o expecting any good for one's self to come out of it. Just think, Frodo had no hope of ever making it back from Mordor, but it didn't matter. He had a task to complete  for the saving of the rest of the world. Sam, Merry and Pippin went with Frodo, having no idea what they were going into, and not caring. It did not matter to them; all that mattered was that they could give of themselves to him. And finally, when Aragorn, Gandalf and Prince Imrahil marched with their armies to the black gates and had no hope whatsoever of victory, it was only with the hope that they might provide a lengthy enough distraction to enable two small Hobbits to make it to the Cracks of Doom without being discovered by the Enemy. I wish to comment on one other point before being finished b/c I believe that to those of the Christian Faith it should be encouraging. When Sam and Frodo are going with Gollum through Ithilien they come to the Cross-Roads and there is a statue of a king seated, however his head has been thrown down and there is a big ugly eye, the symbol of Sauron, where his head should be. As they walk there is suddenly a beam of light where the sun manages to search through the darkness, that blazes out upon the head of the king which is lying by the road. A vine of flowers has grown around his head and Sam says, \\""Look! The King has got a crown again.\\"" Such hope have we as well.<br /><br />I would make a passing remark about this edition. Though the size may make it somewhat difficult to read it lays open nicely so reading it in bed is quite nice if one likes to lay on one's stomach to read. The illustrations are very true to Tolkien's own vision as can be seen in, \\""Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator.\\""s-Roads and there is a statue of a king seated, however his head has been thrown down and there is a big ugly eye, the symbol of Sauron, where his head should be.

The font is larger than some paperback editions, making it easier to read.<br /><br />Finally, it is important to note that without a map of not only Middle Earth in its entirety, but also of the Shire, it is difficult for the readers to picture the geography of the world, and thus hinders their understanding of the work. This edition includes not only a fold-out map of Middle Earth, but a detailed map of the Shire before the beginning of Book One.<br /><br />This edition fufills all of my requirements for what is needed in every copy of Tolkien's text, and is an overall beautiful addition to any library.

Tolkien took a bit (okay, a lot) of Norse mythology, and added his ardent hatred of fascism, war, and industrialization, and shaped it into one of the greatest books of all time. I say \\""one\\"" because, while the Lord of the Rings is technically split into three parts, the truth is it was intended to be a single-volume epic spanning, not including appendices, just over 1,000 pages. I assume most people know of the plot and characters, but for those who don't, protagonist Frodo Baggins (a Hobbit, which is a race of short people with furry feet) comes across a ring given to him by his uncle Bilbo (star of The Hobbit, Tolkien's second most famous project). The Ring turns out to have been previously possessed by Sauron, an ancient evil figure. Frodo, with help of fellow Hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Samwise; Gandalf the Wizard; Borimir and Aragorn, both men of royal blood; Legolas the elf; and Gimli the dwarf, set off to destroy the Ring.<br />The thing that really makes this such an enduring series is the vast world Tolkien has woven. You know all those maps found at the end of each book? Those weren't just sketched idly. Rather, they're just a small part of Middle-Earth, a fictional world of massive scope. Tolkien even created individual languages for Orcs, Elves, Dwarves, Ents (the famous tree-beings) and humans of different races. He also has created history, mythology, and customs for these characters, and manages to weave them into the stories - the lengthy songs found in Fellowship of the Ring, while off-putting to some, actually add plenty of depth.<br />Secondly, the numerous themes Tolkien works into this book are enough for some writers' entire lives. I'm especially intrigued by the concept of duality here. Most characters have parallels here - the most obvious being the nine Fellowship members (the book's heroes) vs. the nine Nazgul (Sauron's servants). There are countless other examples, but I find that the most interesting of them is one found in an individual character: Gollum (yeah, the \\""My preeeecious...\\"" guy). Thanks to years of owning the ring, he has been driven insane, and now exists in two minds: the benevolent (to a degree) Smeagol, and the murderous Gollum.<br />And then there are all the classic characters: Sam, Gandalf, the evil wizard Sauruman, Gollum, nature lord Tom Bombadil (who wasn't in the movie, unfortunately), kingly heir Aragorn, steward Denethor, princess Eowyn (the unofficial tenth Fellowship member), Borimir (the most intriguing character in the bunch), and so on. I actually like the versions of Borimir, King Theoden, and Denethor more here than in the books.<br />My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that there's a bit of a lull in Return of the King, a couple transitional chapters that don't really offer much. But that's just one or two chapters out of around sixty, so there you go.

Perhaps the reader's intellect and imagination, that Tolkien relied on heavily to fill in gaps and speculate about the \\""uneplained vistas\\"" and character development have been stifled by the spoon-feeding that movies and videogames offer.

I don't know.  The book is fantastic, inspiring, sad, glorious, and absolutely worth the time it takes to patiently read it.  I had heard much talk of the book(s) over the years, but nothing prepared me for the intense, personal nature of so much of it.  It is an epic in the classic sense, and Tolkien's character development is quite incredible.  While the fantastic, dark, secretive, stealthy, and wondrous sweep of the tale rightly commands much praise, the subtle exploration on the nature of human corruption and it's proclivity to seek power is very arresting.  The painstaking character work of Tolkien is, perhaps, what makes this possible, but the draw and pull of the ring on each character, great or small, noble or commoner, is what I found most engaging.  It deserves serious, honest reflection from each reader.  It's a shame it had to end, and I had a lump in my throat for the last 50 pages, knowing that each word brought me closer to the unfortunate conclusion.  I found myself sad as characters passed on or parted ways - the characterization is that intense.  Curiously, the archenemy of the story never actually appears IN the story.  While he never speaks directly, never acts directly, and is never seen directly, his existence and presence looms dark and ominous over nearly every page - and that, is fantastic, brilliant storytelling.

J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br /><br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue can range from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two.

But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.<br /><br />\\""The Two Towers\\"" begins directly after \\""Fellowship,\\"" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.<br /><br />\\""Return of the King\\"" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br /><br />\\""Lord of the Rings\\"" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br /><br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue can range from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary -- readers with short attention spans won't be able to handle this story. If they can handle sprawling, epic tales, then probably they can.<br /><br />Even after all the years, J.R.R.

At first I found it a little hard going, as I had a pre-engraved picture of everything that happened in the LOTR from the movie.  It was a little hard casting that aside and accepting that the movie was in fact a portrayal of these wonderful books.  So if you're struggling to get into the first installment - The Fellowship of the Ring - have no fear, you're not alone, but once you accept that things in the movie weren't exactly how the book was written, you discover a whole world in which you never knew existed in the movies.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the movies were amazing (the Oscars show that) but these books are in a league of their own.

Nice poems, cool chase through Mordor and Saruman, Gollum and the Ents were pretty nifty.<br /><br />Look, all you writers out there: All fantasy books don't have to be set in some pseudo-medieval European setting where everyone is remarkably clean, healthy and odor-free despite a distinct lack of basic sanitation devices.<br /><br />I acknowledge that this book was revolutionary forty years ago, but the world has changed since then and our writing could stand to reflect that.<br /><br />Not that Lord of the Rings is a bad book-- it's not-- but not everything about it is so unquestionably wonderful.<br /><br />First off: The ending sucks.  I still haven't figured out what Haven is meant to be, (Heaven?) and why Frodo and the elves had to go there.  What? Is it that they were too good for our world.  If so then that is really lame.<br /><br />Second: The unquestioning faith Tolkien places in the superiority of high birth and the unfailing belief in a rigid class system, (something which I am surprised to see most modern readers simply don't notice) was old fashioned and retrograde even in his own time.  I mean why should Strider/Aragorn be automatically made king? How come no one questions this? The idea that without the true blue-blood king the land would falter is ridiculous.  Whatever happened to democracy?  This odd yearning for the old class system can be seen in Sam's servile obedience to Frodo and Frodo's servility to Aragorn, the Elves and other high born humans.<br /><br />4.

So I would just like to express my perception of the story to perhaps change the perspective people view this with. Read on.<br /><br />Okay, I'm seriously tired of people not understanding why the content is as it is. What I mean is people complain about the lack of stylized storytelling as they are accustomed to in modern literature. One person said that there shouldn't be an introduction describing the hobbits because those details should be unfolded in the story, one said that there are characters with backgrounds that aren't expanded on, many say the language is too flashy and complicated.<br /><br />Of the language problem, all I have to say to that is: So's the Bible. Really, you have to look at them kind of the same. While The Silmarillion may be the one that is stylized after the Bible, this \\""trilogy\\"" (really one story and not a trilogy) is also a historical document, but just of Middle-Earth. Historical documents are often written in language uncommon to our own; they sound more dated and mostly are. The misunderstanding of this not being an actual series of isolated novels actually answers the other questions as well, and this is something Peter Jackson clearly did not understand when making the movies. The Lord Of The Rings is not the story of Frodo, the Ring, and the Fellowship, but actually a part of the story of Middle-Earth that focuses on them. That is why the back story is not revealed in the text; it's already covered in past sections of this big story that the series fits into. In the original DVD of The Fellowship Of The Ring, I remember Peter Jackson talking about why he decided to cut out stuff like Tom Bombadil. His reason was that he had to look at it and say, \\""What relevence does this have to the story of Frodo and the Ring?\\"" If you can see it from my point of view, that is the wrong question. I think it is ludicrous to cut out plot pieces that could only make the story bigger, better, and more expansive (and Tom's appearance would have been a fine piece of cinema. It could have added to a sense of surrealism and some mystery in the story of the first movie, plus I would love to see his dwelling - accurately - translated onto the big screen).<br /><br />Let me reiterate. There are so many parts of the book irrelevent to Frodo and the Ring because they are not the real subject. You read the Silmarillion and it does not seem as though you are reading a collection of single stories about events in Middle-Earth, instead you feel you are reading the history of the world. You must look at these the same way. Someone may quip that The Hobbit was practically a novel, and I agree there and would have to say I think I like it better for that, but I'm just saying you must understand the context of these stories. Why Tolkien didn't supply us all this backstory information beforehand I do not know, but I think it may have to do with the fact of how it was published. See, the appendix was supposed to be put in The Fellowship Of The Ring after the decision was made to split the one story into three smaller editions because of the post WWII publishing costs. But time and money didn't allow for this to happen so it wasn't until months later when The Return Of The King was published when the appendices were available. So perhaps the backstory was meant to be summarized for you from the beginning but it just didn't end up that way.<br /><br />If you can see it this way I can't guaruntee more enjoyment, but maybe a better understanding as to why it was written in this style and won't complain about it using language you don't understand and not being very traditionally written (although its language style is very traditional). But anyway, to make this a review, I see this as definately being 5 star material and I'm sure just about everyone else in the world does. Who hasn't read these booksnow?

Every time that I think I've found someone that outshines Tolkien, I come back to find that the books have deepened in my absence.<br /><br />The first time I read the book, I enjoyed it because it was a rip-roaring good story.  While it starts off a little slow (I'm not a fan of Tom Bombadil), it ratchets up and maintains a taunt pace for another six or seven hundred pages, not an unimpressive feat.  Strangely, Tolkien manages this without following some of the cardinal rules of storytelling (for example, show, don't tell; and end the story right after the climax).<br /><br />The last time I read it, I had just read the Silmarillion, which is basically a history book of Tolkien's world.  I was amazed at the level of detail in the Lord of the Rings.  Characters often refer offhandedly to ancestors or events thousands of years in their past.  In an earlier reading, I would just let the strange names wash over me, but this time I understood more of the references and why they would make the connection in the context of the story.  While the deep joys and sorrows were felt the first time I read it, seeing that this was merely the latest in a series of battles that had been going on for thousands of years made the sorrows that much keener; and seeing these characters achieve feats of heroism that their ancestors had not managed made the joy that much sweeter.<br /><br />C.S.

I was captured by it at that age and still remain in its thrall to this day. Tolkien was, to say the least, a master of the English language. His uses of the sound of speech to communicate or emphasize emotion are beyond compare. To top it off, he just wrote an amazing adventure story, filled with all of the grand imagery most storytellers only hint at.<br /><br />  In every regard this story captures the imagination. It is the mother, the template for all epic fantasy today. So, if you went to see the movies (and I own and love all three), do yourself a favor, and find out what really happened to the Fellowship, to Sarumon, to Frodo and the rest of the hobbits. Hear about it first hand from Tolkien himself.<br /><br />  But now I'm going to do something most people don't have the courage to do. I'm going to criticize this great work.<br /><br />  First, and only shortly, the love story in this saga lacks depth. His treatment of the relationships between Aragorn and Arwen and Aragorn and Eowyn are brief and extremely niave, as well as overly sentimental. While the the love between Aragorn and Arwen gets short shrift, Eowyn seems to fall in love with Aragorn on first sight, something not entirely in character with this seemingly strong willed woman. Perhaps its only that this aspect of the sotry has not withstood the tests of time.<br /><br />  Second, and a far more egregious flaw is the blatant classism that exists between Frodo and the tirelessly servile Samwise. Okay, Sam is the gardener, but just once when Frodo is whining do you think Sam could kick him in the rear instead of saying \\""Oh, Mister Frodo...\\"" ARGH!<br /><br />  The idea of the manservant is something only the British could spin into something so rediculously sentimental and silly. The idea that any human being could love his master is beyond my comprehension, but maybe thats just me.

I looked at them all before deciding which edtion would be the most fun to read and to own.<br /><br />They each have their advantages: The paperbacks are cheap (the new 2003 single volume edition is a bargain at $12); Three individual volumes are easy to carry; Seven volumes neatly separate each of the the epic's six books plus appendices.<br /><br />But the single volume I think is the best reading experience. Completely indexed and with the appendices close at hand, you can enjoy the whole epic story as Tolkien envisioned it.<br /><br />The red leatherette-bound Collector's Edition is the best designed, type set and bound of all the currently available US editions. It features the corrected 1986 text. It's neat, comfortable to hold, and easy to read. By comparison, 1993 single volume edition (with illustrations by Alan Lee) is a heavy and unwieldy book. The thick glossy pages just fall out of the flimsy binding.  The newest Anniversary edition offers illustrations, but is also very pricey.<br /><br />This \\""Collector's Edition\\"" is printed in black type on attractive, easy-to-read cream paper with nice page headings in red. It has a fairly sturdy sewn-in binding which opens out evenly for comfortable reading. There is a fine fold-out map of Middle Earth as well as numerous maps along with the text.<br /><br />At Amazon's price this terrific edition of \\""Lord of the Rings\\"" is very affordable.

It was my first fantasy series, aside from Narnia or whatever. I just liked those heroic tales about kings, princes, war, and swordfighting... I never felt comfort with other genres like science fiction, thrillers or horror.<br /><br />So I just stumbled on this book in the library, my first fantasy novel. You can imagine when I was sitting in my little room day and night, that cold winter 10 years ago, reading Tolkien's work. I finished the whole series in just two weeks. That day when I turned the last page of the third and last book \\""The Return of the King\\"" I thought I wouldn't read any better series. I promised myself I would read them again another time... Easy cake right? So I thought...<br /><br />Years passed and I eventually became a better reader with tons of fantasy books on my backbone. Today I can tell what books is a great read and what books to stay away from. I tried to read TLOTR several times, and every time I did that I gave up in 24 hours no matter what edition I bought or how much motivated I was.<br /><br />Why was I giving up? Well... There aren't really much of a story in theese books, is it? I almost knew what was going to happen in every next page, except for how many leaves that tree in the next forest had of course. There isn't much happening in TLOTR and because of that I couldn't read it again a second time. Other fantasy series is very enjoyable, such as George RR Martin's \\""A Song of Ice and Fire\\"", and you can reread it again and again without getting bored. But to me that's impossible when it comes to TLOTR even when I really wanted to, especially before the release of the excellent movies by Peter Jackson. Some Tolkien fan might mention that I should read the Hobbit or Silmarillion because it makes it easier. That might be true, but that's not my point, I mean that the story is too slow and not engaging enough after a while.<br /><br />In my opinion TLOTR is great if you never have read it before, but after that I don't think most of you'll be able to read it again unless you suffer from sever Alzheimer's and have forgotten everything or are a Real fan that can speak those Elven language and dress as a Hobbit like Peter Jackson  :) ( Those Tolkien fans I have met acts more like a cult, if they saw me writing this review I would be found in a dark alley motionless).<br /><br />I know that that many authors \\""copied\\"" Tolkien's world.

Well we hopped on the tractor and drove down to his house,farm country if you must know.We saw him from a distance shooting hoops on his makeshift gravel court we drove up and he of course had a puzzled look on his face since we had never visited him before, we just rode the same school bus. Well as an ice breaker we played a game of horse, he won. Then he challenged us to a game, which hardly seemed fair since he was a little person like the Dwarf in \\""Lord of The Rings\\"" , we took him up on it and were soundly trounced, he had an amazing hook shot. Well my brother Charles Chadwick decided to broach the subject of firecrackers and Smedley didn't know what he was talking about, we followed him around abit and he showed us a 5 gallon bucket of grease for the tractors, we had never seen such a quantity of grease in our lives, pretty cool. As we were looking at the grease my brother Charles Chadwick told Smedley that he had dropped a quarter in the grease and he could have it if he dug it out, without hesitation Smedley reached elbow deep into the grease and then my brother Charles Chadwick laughed and said he didn't really, we all laughed, some more than others and thats about all I remember about that visit.

Auden said of LOTR \\""if anyone says that he does not like it, I will never trust his literary judgement again.\\""  When one of the greatest English-language poets of the 20th C. says something like this, he should be paid attention to.  Now, I'm not saying that anyone should say that he likes it if he does not; far from it.  But consider: do you consider your literary judgement superior to Audens?  What have you written lately?  Do you not think that, when your evaluation of a work is so different from that of someone like him that perhaps, just perhaps, you may have missed something?  Just because someone who is tone-deaf can't appreciate a Beethoven symphony, or someone who is color-blind can't appreciate a painting by Matisse doesn't mean that there is something wrong with either the symphony or the painting, but rather with the ears and eyes of the beholder.<br /><br />The charge that JRRT is a racist falls flat as soon as it is seriously examined.  The whole point of LOTR is the members of the different races--dwarf, elf, human, hobbit--uniting and overcoming their mutual distrust and dislike for one another in the face of something that will destroy them all if they do not unite.  The one character who is arrogantly sure of his race's superiority, and who never thinks that he could be wrong, is Denethor, and look what happens to him!<br /><br />As for the charge of the glorification of war, that, too falls flat.  JRRT had been a junior officer in the British Army's infantry during WW I; he was at THE SOMME.  He was one of seven good friends to enlist together; only two survived the War.  How could a man like that glorify war?

These are not the writings of a warmonger.<br /><br />In short, for those who did not like the book, finding it 'boring, trivial or contemptable', JRRT himself said that he didn't mind, as he had similar opinions of their writings, or of the sort of writing they appear to prefer.

I went shopping for a durable hardcover edition that would better reflect my love of Tolkien's masterwork.<br /><br />Having enjoyed Alan Lee's work as a designer on the Peter Jackson films and his exquisite illustrations in the book CASTLES, my choice did not take long to make. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Lee's watercolors are detailed and evocative without imposing on the reader's own imagination. Although there are several portraits and battle scenes, characters are usually dwarfed by the vast landscapes and imaginative architecture that Lee excels at rendering. Tangled untamed forests, crumbling castles, and savage mountainscapes abound. These illustrations hold up to repeated viewings. The prevailing atmosphere may seem grim to those readers who may expect vibrant, children's book colors. The picket-fenced charm of Bag End, for example, is sombered by autumn leaves flying before dark gathering clouds.<br /><br />Although I highly recommend this edition, I cannot quite give it five stars. The print quality of the text pages is not up to that of the color inserts. The type is nice and large, but it is often broken up or flecked with fuzz, as if the plates are wearing out after multiple printings. Also the maps are weakly reproduced, unlike the large red-and-black foldouts I enjoy in my copies of THE SILMARILLION and UNFINISHED TALES. Indeed, these are quibbles, but for the hefty suggested retail price, I hoped for perfection!",2004-08-24

Soon they realize that Gollum, a nasty creature who once possessed the Ring, is following them. Captured, and still under the irresistible lure of the Ring, the twisted wretch agrees to become their guide to the forsaken land. Meanwhile Aragorn the Heir of Kings, Legolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf are running across the grassy plains of Rohan, the domain of the Rohirrim horse masters, to rescue Merry and Pippin and later help Th&eacute;oden, King of Rohan, defend his people against Saruman's army in the battle of Helm's Deep.<br />In The Return of the King, as Frodo and Sam are ineluctably treading closer to the heart of danger, putting the goal of their quest in jeopardy every day a little bit more as Frodo's mind threatens to give in to the power of the Ring, Aragorn and his companions must defend the beautiful white city of Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, in a hopeless struggle against Sauron's reckless army of berserkers.<br />How does one go about writing a review of such a masterpiece, now that The Lord of the Rings is not only the second most read book of the twentieth century (after the Bible), but also a blockbuster movie trilogy?

This is, hands-down, the most encompassing, riveting, imaginative, breath-taking, awe-inspiring, wonderful masterpiece to be written and published in the last hundred years, perhaps longer.<br />The Lord of the Rings is not simply the greatest fantasy novel of all time because of Tolkien's gift with prose, love of poetry, or passion for matters of war and conflict. Here, in these amazing 1000+ pages, we get an entire world. Tolkien was working on creating the lands and history of Middle-earth even as he sat in the trenches of World War I, and it shows. Each race, country, language, all feel real enough to once have existed in our own world, even as fantastic as they may seem. That's why these books are not only priceless, but timeless as well.<br />What can I say about these? I love them, obviously. The story is my favorite ever told, beginning with a simple task undertaken by Frodo Baggins, adopted nephew to the renowned Bilbo Baggins, in The Fellowship of the Ring. From seemingly small beginnings springs an epic in ever sense of the word, as Frodo learns the true nature of The Ring of Power, and the Dark Lord that will stop at nothing to reclaim it. Along the way, he is helped by a fellowship of men, dwarves, elves, fellow hobbits, and even a wizard in his mission to destroy The Ring and end the dominion of the evil Sauron.<br />The story and action continue in The Two Towers, as the fellowship is broken and its members are close to despair. Frodo and his loyal retainer Sam continue to Morder, meeting the creature Gollum, and murderous wretch driven mad by The Ring's power, but their only guide to the fires of Mount. Doom. The other members of the fellowship travel to the besieged land of Rohan, hoping to stop its destruction in a last stand in a mighty fotress.<br />The Return of the King brings the saga to a fantastic close, as Frodo and Sam's journey takes them deep into the lands of Morder, where they are hunted from all sides. Aragorn, lost heir to the throne of Gondor, must defend the city of Minas Tirith against the hordes of Sauron, only to once again enter battle before the Black Gates of Mordor themselves, hopelessly outnumbered, a lost cause to buy enough time for Frodo's quest to succeed.<br />Through the story, readers are treated to some of the most incredible and bizarre creations, humanoid and otherwise, ever to appear upon a page. Likewise, the depictions of the battles waged to save Middle-earth are second to none in modern literature, as is the heart-wrenching ordeal that Frodo goes through during his quest.<br />To top it off, this is one of the best editions of the fantasy trilogy, with leatherette cover, box, maps, and the full appendacies. It is, in fact, the same version that my father read to me nearly fourteen years ago, and it still holds its own against the reissues and movie tie-ins that have come since. If you have never before read J. R. R. Tolkien's literary accomplishment, then this is quite possiby the best way to do it.

I found pages of minute description and background history that was fascinating yet lent very little to the pace and purpose of the story.  Some parts of the books were amazingly slow while other parts led up to action sequences that never happened or were disposed with in one paragraph.  For those who have just watched the movie it should be noted that the fight with the Balrog was much better on screen than in the book.<br />However, years later I went back to LOTR's and read them again thinking that maybe I was just young and the books were meant for a more mature audience.  I found many of the same nagging questions I had the first tiime around.  For instance, the true nature of the magic rings are never really described in detail.  We know the One Ring controls all of the rings but what does that mean?  We know that Gandalf has one of the elven rings along with Elrond and the Elf Queen but how do they ever benefit from them?  More importantly we know Gandalf is a wizard but when does he cast a useful spell?  On top of this I realized the books lack vivid and accurate characters.  I never really identified with any of the characters because they all seemed so inhuman and predictable.<br />So many things in the books just didn't make sense to me.  For instance, if the Nazguls are so powerful (and immortal) why don't they just land in the middle of an army and decimate the warriors?  Why are the elves leaving to the west?  What do the orcs eat if the eastlands are all desolate waste?  What the hell is Tom Bombadil dancing around for all the time?  Why are there no female characters?<br />In short, the books do have literary merit and Tolkien was one the first people to write such a compelling fantasy story.  However, he did not invent the fantasy genre as so many claim, and his books are not without flaws.  But if imitation is the measure of genius than Tolkien deserves the utmost respect.Tolkien deserves the utmost respect.",2004-02-26

The book is over 600,000 words long, and is not by any means a quick read. So why invest all of the time it takes to read this monumental work and everything attached to it?<br />It has been suggested that Tolkien wrote these books in an attempt to educate the masses with ideas and notions from the medieval period. While that may be partly true, no one has really studied or even suggested the psychological reasons for Tolkien's undertaking. He was an Oxford scholar whose specialty was philology(study of languages). He greatly valued the medieval environment in which Lord of the Rings is saturated. There are many points in the books where the medieval influence tends to weigh the reading down, making it more of an advanced history textbook than a story, especially with all of the references to names and events of earlier times gone by. However, that is not to be held against a work of such magnificent significance.<br />It is not simply enough to say that &quot;Lord of the Rings is great!&quot; The book can be approached (and appreciated) on a variety of levels--at the literary, lingual, historical, and for enjoyment for the most part. It is this versatility in which one can approach the book which makes it such a masterpiece. And if one would like to skip over some of the more detailed and descriptive parts, they could still take away a tale of a fantastic journey with enormous ramifications (although it is not recommended).<br />The main point of consideration for these books is that Tolkien meant for them to be an open interpretation. This should mean to anyone what it will, not what the author intended it to be. And maybe, this is a reflection of how he felt about medieval culture, particularly the stories. And we must come back to the crux of this entire work--It is a fantastical world in which trials and tribulations are endured, and joy and mirth are rewarded to those who chose the side of good. For, isn't that the way things should be? As far as the creation of a fantastical world with a vast depth of history goes, the Lord of the Rings has no rival.that the way things should be?

My recommended reading age is 13+ years old, and I recommend reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; first.<br />When I was 15 years old in high school, I had to read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; for an English class. After reading that book, the teacher then let us borrow &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Before I had started &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, I had bought my own set of books. After I had read both books, I actually liked &quot;The Hobbit&quot; better than &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at first - because the &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was brighter: a fun, grand adventure with more humor, whereas &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was darker: a serious, grim life and death struggle for world survival. But by the time I was about 16, the historical significance of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; began to appeal more to me. This is especially true if you read Appendices A and B of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and also read the &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. You begin to understand the rich history of Tolkien's Middle-Earth/ Beleriand creation.

This is still an exciting book, but I discovered what I really love...it is allegory-type stories. J. R. R.

Tolkien wanted a reader to apply their own experiences and tastes to influence what they were reading. OK, but in real history one can still get allegory if their own experiences and tastes allow it. How many can learn about World War II and not apply the basic allegorical interpretation that good triumphs over evil? I've heard of, and can understand, several allegorical interpretations of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Frodo is like Jesus Christ: bearing the greatest of burdens for world salvation while being tempted to stray from his purpose, and the weight of the ring is similar to Christ's cross . The One Ring is like the atomic bomb: the ultimate weapon that corrupts whoever uses it, despite even good intentions, into a power-hungry creature of evil. There's an ecological message with the Ents trying to protect trees; and also the natural beauty of various places throughout Middle-Earth, while evil beings try to destroy it all (including the use of mechanical and polluting progress). I also get out of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; a sense of a military mission: that Frodo &amp; Sam are behind enemy lines on a mission that could end a war, and that Frodo realizes that getting back home or even staying alive doesn't matter - just completion of the mission...that's also sacrifice, perseverance, &amp; camaraderie so prevalent in the military history I've read. There's prejudice with years of animosity between elves and dwarves, and how small, kind gestures can begin to erase all those blighted years...also, how people or races can put aside differences to solve a common problem. There's the recognition of the small, common people (citizen soldiers) that perform the greatest, toughest, and most necessary duty in any war.

Even before the LotR movies, Tolkien was synonymous with THE original classic fantasy works and now they're absolutely huge. With this set, you'll get to see what the fuss is all about.<br />LotR is not a trilogy but a series in six books, with appendices. It is a monumental work detailing the struggle of the Fellowship of the Ring against the dark forces of Sauron and the quest to destroy the Ring of Power. This is clear to those who've either seen the movies (95% of people I think) or heard of them (99.9999%). This is what the content of the books is. Except obviously there's much more detail and it's much more epic in the sheer number of obstacles that are placed in the path of Frodo and friends.<br />The thing that would probably be useful is the differences between the books and the movies. The books are very rich in extraneous material. It is said that one of Tolkien's main purposes of writing the series was to create a world with his own invented languages and populate it - the stories are just a background to the languages! The book contains a lot of mythology. There are a lot of poems relating to times gone by and current events (which I personally didn't find very readable). Overall, there are many profound and emotional parts in the book that aren't given much credence in the movie - a great feeling of melancholy and nostalgia over a world in deterioration. This is only touched on in the films with the atmoshere of the elves.<br />The book contains a lot of journeying and this will also be a new feature. Rather than just getting to places like in the film, the characters spend a lot of time in the day-to-day marches. It is here that you begin to learn and appreciate the natural landscape of Middle-Earth, from the plains of Rohan to the little ecosystem of the Shire.<br />The appendices will only be read by LotR fanatics. There are backstories of the kingdoms and lineages of noble families and notes on the languages. One thing that is recommended to browse through is the timeline, especially what happened to the fellowship after the events of the book.<br />Overall, this is still the great book about timeless issues pertaining to good, evil, courage and hope. But it also has the extra emotional and descriptive elements.

Tolkien did an amazing job at engaging his readers and indeed by the end I felt like I had shared in all of the characters hardships as well as their joys. I am now 13 and still love Lord of the Rings and was able to relive all the magic and glory in Peter Jackson's amazing movies.  Yet, I was a bit disappointed in ROTK because they never really elaborated on many of my favorite parts of the book. But all in all the LOTR trilogy were the best movies ever made.  I have never read a book yet that has lived up to the standards of LOTR, and I know I never will.",2004-02-08

It took me close to a week of obsessive reading - I barely stopped to eat and slept only when I could stay awake no longer. As I turned the last page, I was overwhelmed with a feeling of envy that only a booklover would understand - envy of the people who had not yet read this work, and who could look forward to reading it for the first time. Since then, I have re-read it several times and if ever I am marooned on the stereotyped desert island, this is the book I would want most of all. I have long hesitated to review this opus - how could I possibly do it justice?<br />The storyline is too well known by now to need any repetition. What impressed me were two major features. One, the sheer scale of the epic. Tolkien did not just write a story, he literally created a universe and populated it with peoples of various kinds, each with their own history, culture, language, customs and tradition. Yet the epic is internally and externally consistent, like a huge carpet or tapestry, covered with multiple themes and motifs, yet all fitting seamlessly into the overall pattern. I was, and continue to be in awe at his mastery of the complexity and detail of his universe. Second, the sheer beauty of his writing. Rarely today does one come across writing that is both prose and poetry combined (and I don't mean just the songs in the book). Whether it be dialog or description, history or geography, Tolkien's writing is filled with melody and harmony - not a single word is out of place. Now add in the storyline, a masterpiece of depth, width and color, a blend of commonplace daily life shaken by terror and fear, sparkling with emotion and building always with hope to the climax. We will probably never see the like of this again. Do also read the Silmarillion and the Hobbit; the former in particular will add to your appreciation of the Lord of the Rings.<br />The Leatherette Edition, with high quality binding and an excellent fold-out map multiplies the pleasure of reading.

At slightly over a thousand pages, Tolkien's masterpiece is of perfect length.  A great strength of his work is that it avoids verbosity without losing the depth necessary to bring his private mythology to life in the third age of Middle-Earth.<br /><br />The enduring power of the Lord of the Rings is the fact that it is much more philosophically grounded than a topical or allegorical text.  The themes of good, evil, friendship, nature, simplicity, and many others are all generally applicable to life throughout the ages.  In order to create this landscape of definite moral clarity and beauty, Tolkien drew on his experiences as a linguist, a mythologist, and as a Roman Catholic.<br /><br />As a linguist, Tolkien had a copious knowledge of a variety of languages, both modern and ancient.  In particular, he was a scholar of Old English and was an accomplished professor of this subject.  As the means of expression between rational beings, language had a special place in Tolkien's heart.  It was more than one of mere functionality but one of beauty.  By means of phonetic tastes, as well as morphological and syntactical analysis, he built a linguistic structure from which he built Middle Earth, enfleshing his earliest linguistic creations within the culture of the Elves.<br /><br />Mythology, as a testimony to the infinite nature of God, was of great importance to Tolkien.  It was by means of mythology that man is refreshed and able to view the world anew, shaking free the bonds of complacency that often developed in day-to-day living.  A central theme of his personal reflections is the nature of man as a sub-creator.  In particular, the creative element of the human person, endowed by a creative God, was shown forth in a special way for Tolkien in the work of the mythologist.<br /><br />Finally, the work of the Lord of the Rings is thoroughly Christian and specifically Catholic.

Obviously this is not just a fantasy novel, it is the fantasy novel.  It's the one that moved the genre beyond cheesy entertainment and showed us what could an author with real vision, skill, and understanding could do.  Tolkien brought us meaning, depth, and power.  He brought us a story that is truly magnificent.  Small wonder that so many of today's fantasy dwarves have decided to just rip him off rather than coming up with their own story.  Small wonder also that those who are actually forging new frontiers and thinking up new ideas continue to cite Tolkien as their favorite author and leading influence.<br />What exactly is it that Tolkien gets and the dwarves don't?  Everything, really.  But character is at the heart of it.  Tolkien starts out with characters; that's why he wrote an opening chapter designed the show us the world of the Shire before the action actually starts.  We understand Frodo not just as an automaton who experiences fear at point A and hope at point B, but rather as a living, breathing person.  We know where he comes from, how he was raised, what drives him, and so forth, and thus we actually care what happens to him.  And Tolkien does something that Brooks, Jordan, Goodkind, et. al. would never even consider: he works out true, dynamic personalities for his entire cast.  Even minor characters such as Legolas and Gimli are distinct, not just cheesy comic relief sidekicks.<br />But what really builds &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; into the greatest experience in fantasy is the little moments.  Things that don't necessarily have the fate of the entire world hinging on them, but which are still emotionally memorable.  For instance, when Sam first sees an enemy soldier dying near the start of book four, he pauses a moment to reflect on what that man's life might have been like and why he chose to serve the side of darkness.  I also especially commend the scenes in the Houses of Healing in book six, Gimli's reflections after visiting Lothorien, and some of the pleasant banter between the hobbits in the first three chapters.  Robert Jordan and the terrible Terrys, obsessed as they are with lame fight scenes and cheap melodrama, probably wouldn't be capable of such truly moving moments even if they had the desire to be real authors.<br />Some people claim that Tolkien achieved his current vaunted status merely by being the first author to stew together mythology and fairy tales in a novel with such a large vision, and that his actually skill at writing isn't that great.  They're wrong; it is that great.  In the nuts and bolts elements of writing, he is without peer.  Look at the landscapes.  When the Hobbits arrive at the Black Gate and see the barren mountains of Mordor, Tolkien actually makes you feel the desolation of the landscape and the brooding presence of evil, rather than just telling you that they exist.  I personally have always been delighted by authors who throw in some descriptions of nature just for the sake of describing nature.  It not only helps you visualize the scene, but also lets you enjoy the beauty of it.e scenes in the Houses of Healing in book six, Gimli's reflections after visiting Lothorien, and some of the pleasant banter between the hobbits in the first three chapters.

It looks like something that fell directly out of Middle-Earth and right onto your lap! The entire Trilogy along with the appendices and a fold out map are contained within the single volume. A sturdy protective slipcover is also included. A wonderful fold-out map of Middle Earth is secured inside the back cover. I have read reviews that complained about the type-set. I think that it is fine. There might be a couple places where a letter, like the top of an &quot;a&quot; or &quot;e&quot; might be a little light. But this is few &amp; far between &amp; does not affect one's ability to read this treasured tome. The pages are a soft white...almost like an ecru...not quite yellow, but very easy on the eyes. There are no illustrations, but they are not at all necessary. The Illustrated Edition has illustrations, but just cannot measure up to the Red Book.

With the advent of the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many &quot;best book&quot; polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as &quot;Star Wars.&quot;<br />Following up on events in &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.<br />&quot;The Two Towers&quot; begins directly after &quot;Fellowship,&quot; after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them; his cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs of the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised, the Ring's slave Gollum.<br />&quot;Return of the King&quot; brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br />&quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences, and the mechanization of the countryside for the most moving passages of the book. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of how he is influenced by the Ring. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage over the course of the trilogy. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual Obi-Wan Kenobi wizards. Merry and Pippin start out as a chirpy boy and a well-meaning flake, but are matured and made more multi-dimensional by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from absolutely hilarious to solemn and biblical, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story.

I decided to listen to the audiobook version (unabridged, of course; beware of many abridged versions of this and other long books). Narrator Roy Inglis does an excellent job of acting out the myriad of voices in this vast novel. He even sings the many songs, some in the Elvish language. I highly recommend the audiobook, especially to anyone already familiar with the story; hearing it read adds a dimension. If you haven't yet read it, it might be better to read the print version as there are many subplots and characters to keep track of. I think the Lord of the Rings is one of the greatest works of literature in the English language. I'm afraid that it is often dismissed as a mere genre novel,  of interest only to fantasy enthusiasts. In truth, I think it is more akin to an epic novel like War and Peace. Indeed, having read the latter fairly recently I was struck by some similarities. Not in the writing style, but in the scope and the amazing subtleties of character. Both novels, in addition to being centered on great wars, focus on the importance of smaller characters and apparent random chance in the making of history. The most impressive quality of Tolkien's novel is the way he literally created a completely believable world that is at once beautiful and terrible. The descriptions of geography, languages and the various races of folk sometimes seem excessive, but these serve to create an unparalleled authenticity. Tolkien's Middle Earth is more plausible than the \\""real\\"" places of most other writers. One could write an entire book on some of the philosophical and spiritual implications of LOR, especially on the topic of duality. Some, including myself, are not comfortable with the apparent Manichean quality of his universe, where everything seems to be good vs. evil. There may even be some justification for claims that the book has certain ethnocentric qualities -e.g. the constant association of black with evil and white with good, and also the tendency of good being associated with the West, and evil with the East. However, the book also contains enough subtleties and shadings to compensate for this; characters such as Gollum and Saruman, who exist on a shaky moral precipice, show that Tolkien did not see life in simplistic terms.

The book was inspired by Tolkien's personal ultra-conservative Catholic faith and his study of Nordic myths and languages.  One of Tolkien's favorites was of course Beowulf.  There is little modernity in LOTR, and the Hobbits who live simply off the land in their small pastoral countryside are given the center stage.  The great wizards, wise elves, and warriors don't accomplish the task of destroying the Ring of Doom, they instead play a supporting role--the ultimate cause of victory remains an unknown force that plays its hand in the courses of the world, aiding individual effort.  Tolkien borrowed something from the ancient Atlantis and Golden Age myths in the plot of his story.  The men of \\""Numenor\\"" were a semi-divine race that came from the West across the sea and set up kingdoms where they ruled over men of lesser stock.  Eventually they declined after their will to life had been sapped from internal decay, stagnation, and violent conquests from outside demonic forces.  _Lord of the Rings_ is the story of their recovery and regaining of the their lost king, who reunites their kindoms and establishes his rule on Middle Earth after the Dark Lord is vanquished.  The political outlook of the book is similar to the feudalistic Middle Ages and Sparta rather from modern day liberalism, democracy, fascism, communism or other forms of rule \\""by the masses.\\""  The rulers have a higher-than-human origin, but at the same time they are not despots or pillagers.  Evil is portrayed as the total corruption of what is natural and free-flowing, such as the destruction of forests, industrialized machinery, agricultural decline, and mindless bloodthirsty soldiers who fight among themselves but obey their demonic masters' every whim.  The book concludes, not with the destrution of the Ring, but with the Hobbits' fight to liberate their homeland, which had run itself well independently until one Hobbit began trading with the evil wizard Saruman and the Shire was taken over by gangs of thugs.  The book is almost an unconscious indictment of what government control, greedy capitalism and communism alike has done to the planet over the past 200 years: cultural decline, rootlessness, and environmental degradation.  Possibly the reason this book has been so popular is because LOTR portrays an idealistic world with settings and characters so radically different in their lives and worldviews from our own.  The protagonists are not self-serving hedonists rebelling for no reason, but rather individuals who are concerned with maintaining their traditions, old ways of life, and are in touch with a transcendant mission above and beyond themselves.itself well independently until one Hobbit began trading with the evil wizard Saruman and the Shire was taken over by gangs of thugs.

This would be a mistake; it is one of the finest stories in literature, and well worth its reputation.<br />Granted, it is not to everyone's taste; nothing is. Some may find it overly wordy or pretentious; this reviewer finds some of Tolkien's other works (notably his postumously published works, such as &quot;The Silmarilien&quot; and the &quot;Books of Lost Tales&quot;) to fit that description, and granted, this book occasionally comes closer to that than its companion volume, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, which is told in a much more accessible, lighthearted style. (Others may not care for the heroic-fantasy genre at all; there's no accounting for taste.) This book, however, is intended to be a more serious tale, and its style reflects that. But it only rarely takes itself over-seriously, (at least until one finishes the actual story and reads the appendices, if one indeed bothers doing so) and is a story of much grander scope and accomplishment than &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.<br />This book is nothing less than THE seminal modern heroic fantasy story; everything that has come after it owes much to its influence. Just as there were vampire stories before Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot;, there was heroic fantasy before Tolkien. And as there are modern vampire stories that diverge greatly from the concepts in &quot;Dracula&quot;, so there are modern heroic fantasies that similarly diverge from the concepts in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. Yet just as &quot;Dracula&quot; is unquestionably a major influence on all vampire fiction that has come after, so with &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and heroic fantasy. If any author of heroic fantasy has not read this book (unlikely in and of itself) they still could not escape its influence, because WHATEVER stories they may have read that influenced their writings are guaranteed to have been influenced by Tolkien and this book.

After seeing the two movies, I was mildly interested, so I read The Hobbit. After having read The Hobbit and then all three (well... six, actually) LOTR books, I was left at a loss for words.<br />The world that is painted in the pages of the books is fascinating - truly, the movies do not do them justice (nor will any, ever, in all likelihood). There are hundreds of pages omitted from the book in the course of the movie, and quite a few plotlines are heavily modified (not always for the better). As great as Peter Jackson's efforts are, comparing the book to the film is like comparing living a life to watching a film. As an example, consider the road from Hobbiton to Bree - largely uneventful in the film, while it comprises a good half of the book, including an encounter with Tom Bombadil (entirely missing from the film) and a brush with Barrow wights, which is where the Hobbits obtain most of their swords (one of which Merry uses to ... well... I'd rather not ruin the _real_ story).<br />It is often said that Tolkien describes things in extreme detail, and I don't disagree with that - he often goes on for a page or two describing history, lands, objects, etc... However, this only goes to show the rigor of Tolkien's efforts - one does not read LOTR so much as experience Middle Earth. Parts of it (history, geography) often appear within the story in various places, only increasing one's curiosity in what exactly happened before the War of the Ring. As for the fact that the songs and snatches are extraneous in the story - that's just silly. They're as big a part of LOTR as pretty much everything else.<br />The third book contains a hefty set of appendices full of history, meanings of words, information on the origins of languages of Middle Earth and its people. In short, the amount of work and effort that has been spent on LOTR is obviously staggering. There are maps that one can follow as the story develops, and illustrations also go to a great extent in providing windows into Middle Earth through the eyes of Alan Lee.<br />Having read the books has left me with a desire to go through appendices, perhaps re-read the book, and more importantly, read The Silmarillion, which describes the Middle Earth before the War of The Ring - history parts of which are described in LOTR in various places.<br />In short, I can't recommend this book enough.

(ISBN 0618260587) Maddened by the inaccuracies of the lavish but perhaps unavoidably \\""Hollywoodish\\"" film version, I wanted to get back in touch with Tolkein's much more complex, dramatic, but more leisurely paced original text. The copies I bought in junior high were long gone, so I put this on my birthday list, and two people gave me these different versions. I know they both came from Amazon.com because of the wrapping paper. Both versions have things to recommend them. The leatherette covered one is covered with a durable nubbly plastic with a Tolkeinesque star on the cover (the star of F¸anor?) and drawings meant to indicate the hinges on some large, antique books. It comes in a plain red leatherette box, which I find only fills up precious book shelf real-estate, but some would like. It also has a large, clear fold-out map in the back. The paper is a nice, creamy vanilla color that is fittingly the same kind of paper \\""The New Jerusalem Bible\\"" is printed on. Because it is a single volume, it has about twelve or thirteen hundred pages with the introductions and the appendices, so reading it gives one the impression that one is setting off on a quest of one's own. I am not one of these people, but some would complain that it is a bit too heavy and unwieldy, particularly for reading in bed. It is a handsome volume, and my only complaint about it is that the type, which is perhaps the result of some photographic process, is of varying darkness, and this detracts from the overall feeling of quality.<br />The other version I was given was the set illustrated by Alan Lee. He was a consultant on the recent Peter Jackson film version, and his illustration of Orthanc on the cover of \\""The Two Towers\\"" looks just like the movie poster. Lee is a very competent illustrator, and I like his pictures, but there aren't enough of them. There seems to be an average of one picture every two chapters, and Mr. Lee's choice seems to be to shy away from the vulgarly dramatic, like Gandalf confronting the Balrog in Moria, in favor of pictures that depict the incredibly overgrown nature of Middle-Earth locales like Fangorn Forest.<br />The three volumes of this version are printed on glossy paper of such heavy duty thickness that I constantly had to glance at the page number to make sure I'd only turned over only one page. They come in an illustrated case, and because of the thickness of the paper, it gives the impression of weighing about thirty pounds. The reservations about weight that applied to the previous version apply to this one too.<br />The typeface of this volume is excellent: dark and precise, although I think it would benefit from the occasional touch of ornamental flair.<br />This version does not have the large fold-out map of the leatherette edition, but a map printed inside the cover. Therefore, it is not as big and clear as that map, but much more accessible. (BTW, I think Tolkien's maps badly need revision. What's needed is a reworking that follows his basic look and design, but is more detailed and more closely follows the text.)<br />I like both of these versions, but if forced to choose, I would probably pick the Alan Lee illustrated version. Some might find his illustrations too restrained, but I thought this characteristic made them suitably elegant for a faery tale that appealed to adults. (Also Mr. Lee's style is formal and remote enough that it wouldn't get in the reader's way if his or her conception of a certain event or character was different.)

They all have strengths and weaknesses that one can relate to and understand.  As the story progresses, each character's personality is bent and forged, shaped by the terrors and joys faced by each as the tale fulfills itself.<br />The Fellowship of the Ring is only the first part of three novels in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  It moves slower than the latter two books but is more descriptive and sets up a lot of the staging for the latter plot development.  It is a wonderful story line, and is played out with exquisite results, often catching the reader off guard.<br />This book will entertain you if you have any kind of interest in the subject matter.  It is one of the few books I've read that gave me emotional reactions from cold chills to sincere worry.  Rich in characters, plot, and imagination this book is a classic.",2003-04-29

Persons desiring to just read and enjoy these volumes may get along fine with a paperback edition. However, those fans who desire a beautifully presented, quality hardcover version of the works can do no better than to acquire this particular edition.<br />The Lord of The Rings is a work that defined the genre and set the stage for many, many other fantasy writers that followed. Dr. Tolkien's intent was to present the work not as an isolated telling of tales but rather as a historical recounting of events as they occurred within the context of his extensive mythological universe. Although such a statement may make one disposed to thinking the mateiral will be bland, it is in fact one of the most complex, colorful, engrossing fantasy journeys one can hope to find. Characters of diverse fantastical races with immense depth and personal motivations strive against an all-encompassing, ancient, and singular evil. Their efforts are painted against a world so resplendent in its detail and authenticity that readers cannot be blamed for becoming lost in its descriptions. No greater work of fantasy fiction can be found.<br />The added appeal of this particular edition is the inclusion of fifty watercolor paintings from reknowned Tolkien artist Alan Lee. Though Tolkien's written words are more than enough to germinate the seed of imagination in any readers mind, it is interesting to see his world through Mr. Lee's brushstrokes particularly considering Alan's painintings and talents were used to great effect is bringing The Lord of The Rings to life in Peter Jackson's recent films. In one particular example, Alan's rendition of the valley of Rivendell is recreated in the film almost detail-for-detail, breathing three-dimensional life into his painted work, and it's very satisfying, certainly for fans of both artist and author.<br />Again, for the discriminating fan, this is an exceptional volume to add to your Tolkien library, one that should bring a new element of enjoyment to your next reading of Dr. Tolkien's classic work.this is an exceptional volume to add to your Tolkien library, one that should bring a new element of enjoyment to your next reading of Dr. Tolkien's classic work.",2003-02-22

The binding of the 3 book set seems superior to that of the single volume and will probably last longer, especially when you take into account the fact that with one book, there are 3 times more pages to be held together!<br />  One of the biggest differences between these books is the quality of the paper. The paper in the single volume is white, non-gloss, and unsuitably thin; the text of an underlying page can easily be seen. On a positive note, the pages that contain the art work are thicker with a glossy finish; the art is on one side and the opposite side is blank. The paper in the 3 book set is white, semi-glossy, and fairly thick. Pages that have art work on one side have text on the back.<br />  There are also differences to be found in the printed text. The single volume is bolder, coarser, and very easy to read. The 3 volume set employs a more delicate and elegant style of type, which makes it slightly harder to see from a distance, but nonetheless is easily read.<br />  Both volumes do a good job of presenting Alan Lee's art. The pictures are placed to follow the story, and I think Mr. Lee does an excellent job of using Tolkiens words to create a visual presentation of the characters and locations. Some people have complained that the colors are a little drab, and in some cases I would agree, but I think that one of the reasons for this is the fact that all of these pictures were done in watercolor. One thing I noticed was that the colors in the one volume set seemed a little more vibrant and are probably truer to the original paintings than those in the box set, but this will not be noticeable unless you have them side by side. In addition, the maps in the single edition are all printed on the same thin paper as the rest of the text and are located in the back of the book. In the box set, the maps are printed on the inside covers of the dust jackets.<br />  In summary, I feel that this box set is probably the best hardcover edition you can buy, illustrated or not. It is very well constructed and I think you are getting a lot of value for your money. I would also like to mention that there is an Alan Lee illustrated hardcover version of \\""The Hobbit\\"" which is the same size as this boxed set and looks good on the bookshelf together.

Probably the best thing about the films is that they will likely entice the reading of the book. The book is very different in some spots, verbatim in others. For example, after seeing the films, it's hard to think of Frodo as being 50 years old when he leaves the Shire (Elijah Wood, Frodo Baggins in the films, barely looks out of his teens), but in the book he is well aged by the time Gandalf sends him on his way. This is only one of many many examples.<br />It's interesting to read the one-volume edition. It's how Tolkien intended it to be presented, as one large novel (Tolkien's publisher divided the story into three parts against his wishes). With the one-volume edition you feel like you're reading something hefty, an old tome from mythology, something with real weight and umph. It's a massive 1008 pages (not including the appendices and index), but it's a fast fast neckbreaking page turning read. It isn't difficult reading (i.e., not much unfamiliar vocabulary apart from terms coined by Tolkien and the passages in Elvish or Mordor), but it is detailed, far more detailed than a film could ever hope to be. It is a book that will reward many repeated readings.<br />Some of the basic themes of the book seem to be hope, despair, singularity, and plurality. There are many places in this book where things seem beyond hope for the heroes. In some places this leads them to despair, which does them no good. Finding hope in despair seems to be one of the book's main themes: we don't know what will happen, so why despair before the fact? All you can do is keep going. In a way the book is an analogy for our lives which are filled with hope and despair, but we keep going on even against impossible odds.<br />Concerning singularity and plurality, on one side there is the fellowship of the ring which is made up of a diverse cast of beings: hobbits, a dwarf, humans, and an elf. They set out to meet their task together while trying their best to put behind their differences. On the other side you have Sauron and the One Ring or singularity. Sauron is trying to bind the world to his single will which is embodied in the ring of power. It ruins those who try to possess it (Humans are particularly susceptible to it). It is pure self-obsession and self-importance. This singularity is put forth as evil, while the plurality of the fellowship is presented as good. It's an interesting dichotomy.<br />Fans of the films will be shocked to see the differences in the story line, especially in \\""The Two Towers.\\"" In terms of suspense, the book is far superior to the film (I'm sure the filmmakers would completely agree). I literally could not wait to begin reading \\""The Return of The King\\"" and I could not put the book down until I reached page 1008. The book sometimes kept me reading obsessively until 3 or 4 in the morning (such as when I was reading the chapters with Shelob in \\""The Two Towers\\"" - amazing).<br />This book deserves its place amongst the greatest works of the 20th century. It is a story that can re-invent itself in terms of the time it is read in or the perspective it is read from. It is this ambiguity and multi-facetness that makes the book timeless.

They set out to meet their task together while trying their best to put behind their differences. On the other side you have Sauron and the One Ring or singularity. Sauron is trying to bind the world to his single will which is embodied in the ring of power. It ruins those who try to possess it (Humans are particularly susceptible to it). It is pure self-obsession and self-importance. This singularity is put forth as evil, while the plurality of the fellowship is presented as good. It's an interesting dichotomy.<br />Fans of the films will be shocked to see the differences in the story line, especially in \\""The Two Towers.\\"" In terms of suspense, the book is far superior to the film (I'm sure the filmmakers would completely agree). I literally could not wait to begin reading \\""The Return of The King\\"" and I could not put the book down until I reached page 1008.

Between Alan Lee and John Howe, I prefer the latter's depictions of Middle Earth and its characters. Howe's illustrations are more detailed and they never fail to ignite some fantasy daydreaming wherelse Lee's illustrations (after being so familiar with Howe) just seem a mite childish.<br />And because I loved my paperback one-volume John Howe-illustrated version, it gradually (as all paperbacks go) fell apart after 6 years of passing around and continuous readings. I decided to look for a new edition (preferably a hardbound one-volume edition with Howe's illustrations but there is apparently none in the US market, though UK seems to have some.)<br />Before I elaborate on the leatherette edition that I now own, let me tell you about my experience with LOTR. Like I said, I first read of this book in a newspaper article and was curious as to whether the quote about the english literary population having been divided between those who have read it and those who have not, held up.<br />Admittedly I did not jump with awe at the first few attempts of reading LOTR. It took me 1 1/2 years before I actually restarted again after a few tries to get through the first few chapters. This time I attacked it, I read it properly, looking at the appendices, and maps. And after awhile, the story just kept getting better and I was hooked. It was just incredible, I couldn't put down the book. I went through a reading marathon. I slept, ate and dreamnt the book for days and when it came to an end, I was actually disappointed. Really disappointed that it has come to an end.<br />The movie to me was great because it helped visualized some of the scenes and plot that were lost to me when I was reading the book. If any, it helped make LOTR more meaningful and understandable. And if it were Jackson's intention to complement the book and not rival it, that the movie is a ranging success.<br />As for the leatherette edition, I cannot fathom what all the negative reviews about its terrible terrible quality is about. The book is very nicely bound, the paper quality is indisputable and the text neatly aligned to the sides as it should be. The map at the back is very nice and clear. The only gripe I have is that the text colour (both red and black) tend to vary from pages to pages and I had only noticed this because I was reading the reviews and everyone kept complaining about its shortcomings. Otherwise, I did not find any badly-printed characters on its own, just whole pages of text with varying colours, some lighter or darker than others.<br />I'd like to think it gives the book a little character and rawness which goes with the creamish paper and the imperfection of most ancient books.<br />All in all, I am happy with what I have bought.dable.

Saying this, however, it does not cheapen the book, I'm saying merely to clarify. This 'plastic' is actually made to look 100% like real leather, if only for the feel, you would be fooled into thinking it was leather (leather is less resitant, scratches more easily and is softer under-hand). I personally dont mind, the book is most beautifully crafted with 'simulation' gold gild (more than likely its a gold ink or paint).<br />The pages themselves are of good, rather great -quality, not cheap 'bright-white' 'mass market' pages, but rather a subtle shade of mild yellow, not to mention the pages being almost twice as thick as paperback editions (if not, in fact thicker), which makes for a much more comfortable read. I have only one 'gripe' or 'probleme' with this book, and that is that the text that is printed on the pages seems to be at an angle (rather than being 90deg to the pages edge, the text seems to be off by about 3-5 degrees). This is only a slight annoyance, and I am not totally convinced that it is either an error while printing nor that all copies have the same 'condition'; I personally dont mind too much, but for the 'perfectionistic reader' it can be quite distracting, but to be honest that is the fault of the reader rather than the book's.<br />Finally (and perhaps most importantly?),<br />The book comes with a 'container' wich is, also, bound with 'leatherette', they both complement each other and the cover is a perfect protector against the day to day 'wear n tear' of life.<br />Personally, I cant put the book down.

Both my husband and I have owned a variety of paperbacks of the books, but when the movie was made and I saw this edition, I decided to splurge and get it. I went and saw the first and second movies without prereading again, and for a deaf person, seeing a film in the theater is something we rarely do, but I did to get the majesty of the film and the story. AFter the recent release of the second part of the film, I finally opened this edition, and started reading.<br />The story has not faded with time, if anything it still remains the ultimate fictional story of good against evil.

The Centennial Edition is devoid of the movie art, photo stills or any similar tie-ins to Peter Jackson's production of The Lord of the Rings movies.  The book itself (or books, if you read it as a trilogy) is a classic and doing justice to it in a review of less than 1000 words is nearly impossible.<br />This single-volume hardcover is commonly referred to as the Alan Lee Edition. Lee contributed about 50 watercolor plates for the book and they range from solid (the Old Forest, Treebeard) to spectacular (Dawn over Minas Tirith, Helm's Deep, Orthanc, The Black Gate) and, altogether, render Tolkien's world realistically while simultaneously (through the medium of watercolor with its muted colors, soft lines and blended images) maintaining the mystical qualities of Middle Earth.  Lee is probably the most accomplished of the Tolkien artists (John Howe, Ted Nasmith, the Hildebrants, et al.) and his paintings of the Morannon (the gate of Mordor) and Helm's Deep are famous images of Tolkien's world.  The print quality of this edition is a larger and clearer version of the text used in the mass-market paperback editions from the 1970s and 1980s. The maps are only ok, and that's the sole problem with the edition.<br />Alan Lee (along with John Howe) was one of the artistic consultants for the Peter Jackson films.  His artwork is therefore a basis for the \\""look\\"" of many of the films key sequences.  This edition provides a fine one-volume compilation of The Lord of the Rings, replete with the art gallery of the most influential of the Tolkien artists.  Highly recommended.",2003-01-04

BUT, if you push through, it is COMPLETELY worth it. You can get used to flying by names (without missing anything because most of the time he writes &quot;and the elvish name is&quot;...).<br />The world Tolkien creates is absolutely amazing. You absolutely get a feel for this world and can put yourself there. If you have not seen the movies (unlikely but possible right?!), I would HIGHLY suggest reading these first. There are so many things you miss in the movie. A quick example is when Gollum/Smeagol is writhing around because of the rope that has him restrained. That is because it is an Elvish rope and it burns his skin (there was a lot of good dialog left out there).<br />As we know, the book is 99.9% of the time better than the movie and these books are no exception (this should say a great deal given how awesome the movies are!). I found that it was a ton of fun to see the story come to life on the screen and it enhanced the already exciting story I had read.<br />If you have already seen the first two movies, you don't have to wait to find out what happens! Although, in the second movie they left out some of the action that happens in the second book. In the movie, Gollum (Smeagol) says something like &quot;she will take care of them&quot;. In the book, you aren't told this but, in any case, what he is referring to happens in book two.

It's difficult to know which one to choose. If you want one that is going to hold up over time & through many readings, I say the Red Collector's edition it the best, by far.

After looking at both of them, it was a no-brainer....the Red Leatherette wins by a Landslide!!!! The book is a nice size....not too big, yet not too little. The beautiful gold, blue & green foil embossing that embellishes the front cover, back cover, & spine add to the book's elegance.

A sturdy protective slipcover is also included. A wonderful fold-out map of Middle Earth is secured inside the back cover. I have read reviews that complained about the type-set.

I've since read the trilogy through perhaps 10 times. Many people here have described the plot so I won't bother. Instead I want to talk about the way that Tolkien creates a 'believeable' world out of totally fantastic material -- and why Peter Jackson's movies are bound to have such mixed results.<br />Throughout LOTR, Tolkien employs an interesting strategy for dealing with the most fantastical events that occur -- he only lets us see them secondhand through the recollection of the characters. This happens in many places: Gandalf's imprisonment by Saruman is told to us after the fact by Gandalf himself at the Council of Elrond; the battle with the Balrog on Zirak-Zigil is again Gandalf's recollection. I could go on: the destruction of Isengard by the Ents is not directly narrated but comes to us  as Merry and Pippin tell the story to their companions, Aragorn's battle with Sauron to wrest control of the Palantir is told from Aragorn's memory, we experience the harrowing Paths of the Dead in the form of Gimli's painful confessional.<br />There are a few places where fantastic events are directly described but most of the time Tolkien lets his characters tell us about 'magical' happenings after the fact. He does this, I think, because it allows the reader to accept them more easily. Tolkien painstakingly creates human-like characters that we trust (even when they're dwarves or hobbits!) and the lets them tell us what happens. So when Merry and Pippin describe the fall of Isengard I believe them. More unconditionally than if I had been shown it 'directly'.<br />Movies, however, can't work this way. I do like many parts of the Peter Jackson's 'Fellowship' -- Hobbiton, Bag-End, Frodo, Legolas and Boromir are all nearly perfect visions from the books. But when really magical things begin to happen the movie falls into caricature in ways that the books avoid. One only needs to compare Gandalf's economical telling of his contest with Saruman at Orthanc to the 'Kung-Fu Wizards' scene in 'Fellowship' to  get the idea.<br />The books are an entirely different experience for this reason and more. I could write another review that just talks about the poems and songs for which the movies have no time.  If you've become familiar with LOTR through the movies by all means enjoy them! But then do yourself a favor and *run* to get the real thing and read them over and over.Gandalf's economical telling of his contest with Saruman at Orthanc to the 'Kung-Fu Wizards' scene in 'Fellowship' to  get the idea.<br />The books are an entirely different experience for this reason and more.

(It's also a lot cheaper but that's another issue.)  Also, it's easier to navigate the book using the index at the back if you use a paperback.  I've found it useful to dip in and out of the text with the help of the index.  Not many novels have an index and this one happens to have one, thus making the paperback very convenient.<br />Don't bother buying the three-separate-books version unless you don't find it necessary to use the index.  If you use the index a lot, three separate books will drive you nuts.<br />Tolkien's own complaint about the book is that it's too short (see foreword to the second edition).  I agree.  No doubt the story would have been far more exciting with twice the length and three times the number of characters.  A longer book perhaps would have made the appearances of dragons possible.  There are no dragons in this story, as it stands.  (Dragons do exist in Tolkien's mythology, but you'll only find them in The Silmarillion and The Hobbit.)<br />The Silmarillion suffers from having too many characters and from being too short a book.  LoTR suffers from having too few characters and also from being too short.  Combining the two into one book would have been a splendid idea.  Perhaps that's why Tolkien was so unhappy about not being able to publish both books together.  The trouble was that he kept making changes to The Silmarillion - he could not settle down to any version.  He kept changing his mind.<br />If alive today, Tolkien would still be revising his all his books.  But then we might have had another full-length sequel (or prequel) to LoTR!  A pity!<br />As far as messages to &quot;take home&quot;, I don't know for sure. Tolkien did not intend his book to be a fable.  But I suppose Tolkien wants to tell us that under certain circumstances even very insignificant people (e.g., the hobbits) can do extraordinary things, and that even your enemy (e.g., Gollum) can change your fate for the better.

Moreover, this edition is published as the story was meant to be read: with all three &quot;books&quot; in one (many uneducated folk scorned the 2001 movie's unsatisfying ending, which was meant to be merely a cliff-hanger leading into the immediately ensuing chapter).  True, the size may render it unwieldy for younger fans (PLEASE take great care), but part of the treasure of this edition is its textile feel and weight, its &quot;sprawl out in front of the fireplace&quot; nature, for this is not a magazine to skim but a treasure trove to ponder and study.

It has been lost however for thousands of years. Eventually it is found and winds up in hands of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, who then gives it to Frodo Baggins. Gandalf the Grey wizard discovers what this little ring actually is and tells Frodo he must leave his home with it to a keep it away from the enemy. This starts an epic journey with elves, dwarfs, men, wizards, orcs, and ring wraiths that is scary, wondrous, and truly adventurous. It is eventually determined that the ring must be destroyed in Mt Doom where it was created. However this is located in Mordor the land of the Dark Lord Sauron. The peril deepens with every step of the journey resulting in classic confrontations, epic battles, and true selfless heroics.<br />The story is broken into three books, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King.

The second time through, I enjoyed it much more. At its heart, FotR is a simple tale between good and evil, with a microcosm of the world and its varied people exemplified by the denizens of Tolkein's Middle-Earth. There are the Hobits, the Elves, the Dwarves, the Orcs, the Wizards, the Humans, and whatever race Strider belongs to. The story starts in the Shire, where Biblo Baggins (a Hobit) is staging his disappearence on his (elevnty-first) 111st birthday. He leaves as a heirloom a ring to his cousin (Frodo). This is no ordinary ring, however; it is imbubed with power to control the mind of the wearer and even to make him (all of the bearers were male) invisible! Problem is that Sauron, the dark lord is looking desperately for this ring, through a team of his dreaded henchmen, the Ringwraiths. The job of Frodo is to enter Mordor, the dark land, and destroy the ring. The 'Fellowship' in the title refers to the band of (for the lack of a better term) people who leave their peaceful existence behind and start journey which will terminate in Mordor (by book 3).

Likewise, the spine did not hold up as well as that of The Hobbit, although since this book is far larger and heavier, some of that is to be expected.<br />The map at the back is bound in a little too well for my tastes, and it is difficult to read without running the risk of damaging it.

No modern literary fiction has been nearly so devotedly reread by its admirers.<br />To foreshorten, hobbits are not just rabbits or even leprechauns:  hobbits are Pycts (evidently migrant pygmies, who picked Britain out of all the world, before even the Celts came, following whom Romans, Saxons and Normans became Britons too).  Tolkien's interlaced narrative is as Dickensian as it is medieval, and hobbits are Dickensian ambassadors to Valhalla.<br />Like all of Tolkien's fictions, The Lord of the Rings is a saga:  the story of a family's place in the history of the world.  Frodo and Sam, master and servant, become family.  With reference presumably to Malory's Arthur, Tolkien termed The Lord of the Rings a Romance.  The point being that, unlike almost all other longer modern prose fictions, The Lord of the Rings is not a novel.  Nor is it a fanciful gloss of medieval society, but rather of medieval literature per se.<br />There are female characters in The Lord of the Rings, and the journeys of the Fellowship are great nature hikes.  The Lord of the Rings has been translated into many languages.<br />There are 1100+ lines of verse in the Old and Middle English alliterative meters, the long, common and half ballad measures and two neoClassical meters, the leonine hexameter and the English fourteener; plus an invented-language group in pastiches of metrical devices from various Celtic, Germanic and Latinate traditions.  There is a near-hiatus of verse in volume two after its first hundred pages, and volume three's reprise of all prior metrical modalities features the Old English meter prominently.  There are also Tolkien's own runes and his son's map.<br />To the Bible belt school of Tolkien criticism I should recommend Thucydides' History of the Pelloponesian War, in which I count a few hundred parallels.

The biggest problem had to be their change of speech.Did anyone else notice that in the beginning they talked just about the same as one might hear walking down the street, and that by the end of The Return of the King the characters sounded like they were quoting Shakespeare?<br />Also, some times Tolkien had his characters say very strange things, for example:<br />Sam says \\""Ninnyhammer!

My beautiful rope!\\"" something like that, but.. honestly, NINNYHAMMER??<br />And then, before that, when discussing the elven rope, Sam also says \\""the rope is as soft as milk\\"" or the like.<br />Anyways, overall, a great book, Tolkien really started off the entire Fantasy genre, but just because he was the first, doesn't mean he's the best.

Some people criticize the slow development, and the various included songs and poetry as being archaic, and the journey through the marshes as being depressing, but they miss part of the point - this is literature influenced and honoring older styles.  The MTV generation should consider learning to slow down and savour things.  I cannot contribute anything particularly original to a review of this book as a literary work.<br />However - on the edition:  One caution:  The boxed red-leather bound collector's edition, (echoing the fictional &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot;, the mythical preserved source of the story) has one jarring flaw.  It lacks the much enlarged, detailed map, showing Gondor, Rohan, and western Mordor, normally found in the third volume (The Return of the King, ROTK) in the individual-volume  editions.

Yet I must mention some of the greatest joys I found in Tolkien's masterpiece. First, though The Lord of the Rings is a wonderfully original creation and a fully formed world, I am repeatedly struck and entertained by how Tolkien weaves in themes from other works. Those familiar with the Edda and Wagner's Ring cycle will be pleasantly surprised how Tolkien takes old material and reweaves it into something appealing and new. Also, Tolkien reworks a lot of George MacDonald's ideas (the greatness of courage, the self-destructiveness of evil, and the wisdom of innocence) into a new, more complex setting. The theme that I love most from The Lord of the Rings is that truth overcomes knowledge. Truth keeps knowledge guessing and uninformed. This is seen in the misplays of both Saruman and Sauron. Most importantly, this is a tale that [stinks] the reader in and will not let them go...even after it ends.",2002-04-02

It is a timeless classic that I find myself reading again and again.<br />What really sets this book apart from others in the fantasy genre are subtle yet crucial to making this book a classic.  First, because of Tolkien's educational background at Oxford, and talent with old, forgotten languages, he created names and languages that really strike a chord in the reader.  The elven languages were a stroke of genious, that linguists still continue to ponder over today.  Names for people and locations also resonate in our minds in a unique way as if they were really had existed.  Those who are familiar with Old or Middle English will particularly understand this point.<br />More ingenious though is the deep meaning behind the books.  The Ring of Power, being a symbol of absolute power, corrupts the minds of all it touches.  The wise and strong are particularly vulnerable to its dark touch, even if they intend to use it for good (as Boromir had hoped to do).  Like many other aspects of the trilogy, Tolkien clearly intended to reveal many aspects of our lives through this book, and he did so masterfully.<br />As for this particular hardback edition, I enjoy it immensely.

I hate to say this about a book so venerated to my favorite genre, but the racism of Tolkein set the tone for the next 50+ years in terms of the racism that was (and still is) so prevalent in the fantasy genre. His descriptions of orcs resembles 13th-century descriptions of Mongols, giving them no redeeming factors at all. I realize that the 1950s weren't the most politically correct times, but Tolkein was an academic, and I feel he has a responsibility to fight this sort of mindless drivel. He was a professor at Oxford, so he likely understood what he was writing, and that makes what he wrote all the more galling.

Something that may draw people away is racial comments, which are proved UNTRUE.  Tolkien published the book and said it has nothing to do with outside affairs.

Elves in these books are usually portrayed the greatest, but note that the Orcs came from Elves, which says that they cannot be perfect.

Hummm Let's review shall we.","There is so much to be said against The Lord Of The Rings that it shouldn't be worth the effort. A book that, judged by conventional standards, contains so many appalling lapses of taste and so much coarse vulgarity really ought, by now, to have faded from sight.<br />From many points of view, it has dated badly, and its aesthetics and politics are now so odd that you might be forgiven for thinking, as Peter Jackson's new trilogy of movies rapidly approaches, that its appeal, after all, is one of a delicious period piece.<br />But all judgements have always been confounded by this extraordinary book. It ought to be too long, and too pointlessly abstruse, to command wide popularity; it is not a book for children, and yet not a book for adults either; its style is too elevated for popular literature, but too coarse for &quot;high&quot; literature. There is no reason on earth for anyone to like it, and there are plenty of readers who still think that the judgement of JRR Tolkien's first publisher - who was surprised when it started to look as if the book might make as much as £1,000 - was much sounder than the people who, in the past 50 years, have bought more than 100 million copies of the book.<br />However, by now, The Lord Of The Rings is unarguably a part of English literature. Contrary to popular belief, 100 million readers can perfectly well be wrong; but the continuing life of the book cannot just be ignored. It is just there, massively.<br />But, in many ways, it is just awful. It is amazingly humourless, and Tolkien knows it - over and over again, he writes &quot; 'Come, master Pippin!' Gandalf laughed&quot; - a very bad sign, all those laughing wizards. You don't have to be politically correct to be mildly alarmed by some aspects of it. Apart from Eowyn, the women in it are not madly significant, or allowed to do anything much. There is Galadriel, who stays at home being Wise; there are Goldberry or Rose, who stay at home being Patient Helpmeets; there are Lobelia Sackville Baggins and Shelob, who stay at home being completely ghastly.<br />It is an appallingly naïve fantasy of good and evil races; mostly, the good people are tall and blond and speak Nordic or Celtic languages, and the bad ones are dark and hairy and talk a sort of Persian - those guttural dwarves are allowed a sort of virtue, but it is rather grudging in tone. Sam Gamgee is a loyal retainer of the most frightful variety, still &quot;Mr Frodo-ing&quot; away and knowing his place 1,000 pages in; basically, he is Dickens's Sam Weller, and Tolkien couldn't even be bothered to change his name.<br />Tolkien probably knew as much about language as anyone, but it would be fair to say that his interest stopped at grammatical inflection. The Lord of the Rings, by ordinary standards, is just badly written. Great swathes of it are in a sort of Ben-Hur biblical: &quot;And all the host laughed and wept, and in the midst of their merriment and tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold, and all men were hushed. And he sang to them... until their hearts, wounded with sweet words, overflowed, and their joy was like swords...&quot;<br />There are endless mock subtleties of the &quot;It seemed to Sam that he saw...&quot; variety. And there is, too, that infallible sign of a really bad writer, the overuse of the word &quot;suddenly&quot;. Everything in The Lord of the Rings happens suddenly, dozens of times a chapter. And yet it is one of those very rare books that confounds all objections, all standards, and which in the end may make its own standards. Nobody, I think, has ever produced anything with the imaginative density and intricacy of the book. The reviewer's clich&eacute; is, for once, apt here; he really created a world.<br />The power and resonance of the book come in part from an ethical debate that is much more adult than one remembers - it is haunted by the cruelty of its age, and is not, in fact, just about the alternative of Good andEvil, the elves and the orcs, but largely about the possibility of becoming evil through the best intentions. It is really about slow corruption, and is at its finest in the portraits of Saruman and Denethor, characters who it is not difficult to parallel in 20th-century history.<br />But its claim on real greatness comes from the sense of huge, half-glimpsed vistas of history and language, the illusion (which may not be an illusion) that its author knew exactly the languages each of its characters would have spoken and understood the events of ancient history that lead all of them to act as they do.<br />In a realistic novelist, writing about a real war, this would be a remarkable feat of intelligence; when you consider that Tolkien invented absolutely everything - the backstory, the languages, the geography - it quickly becomes almost incredible. At some point, the critics and the literati have to admit that they were just wrong, and, by now, it is probably time to start considering his extraordinary flight of imagination as one of the key works of modern literature.vil, the elves and the orcs, but largely about the possibility of becoming evil through the best intentions.

That one man created a world in such stunning detail, a world full of beauty and ugliness, courage and cowardice, joy and despair, good and evil is awe-inspiring. And not just a world, but a complete history - replete with folklore and legend, poetry and song, heroes and villains. `The Lord of the Rings' is the product of a formidable imagination, a book that spawned a whole genre of writing, none of which matches this, the Bible of fantasy literature.<br />Tolkien was clearly in love with Middle-Earth and its mythology. Every character, from Gollum to Galadriel is lovingly rendered in compelling detail. Every twist of the road  to Mordor is convincingly constructed, as though the author had ridden across Middle-Earth in his mind. What Tolkien has managed to do, like the handful of other great epic writers, is take a very personal story and set it against the backdrop of great events with which it is inextricably bound (don't laugh, but in this respect the book is reminiscent of `War and Peace'). The average reader will associate themselves much more with Frodo or Sam than Gandalf or Aragorn, but that is not to say we aren't as interested in their fates - we just get to see them through the eyes of the less elevated, which makes them seem more human.<br />The three parts to `The Lord of the Rings' are each quite different from each other. `The Fellowship of the Ring' begins with Bilbo's birthday party and sees the company formed in haste as they realise that Bilbo's ring is indeed the One Ring, and that Sauron's servants, the Nazgul, are hot on its trail. `The Two Towers' sees the narrative take three different routes, as the fellowship is broken up, while `The Return of the King' deals with the final great events in the War of the Rings, and is the most epic of the three.  The sadness at the passing of the third age of Middle-Earth is quite poignant, and the fact that Tolkien was writing at the time of the second World War should not be overlooked.<br />'The Lord of the Rings' is a very long book, but all the better to lose yourself in.

It includes durable binding, smooth white pages, glossy illustrations, an illustrated cover jacket, and an red ribbon bookmark sewn into the binding.  However, the book is the largest LOTR book I've ever seen in my life -- It's quite hefty.<br />There is a red, faux-leather collector's edition published in 1974.  It is slightly smaller in dimensions compared to the centennial edition and weighs considerably less.  The cover is beautiful and unmatched in elegance.  Chapter headings and margin headings are in orange red.  The pages are slightly tinted yellow, as smooth as the centennial edition, and seem to emit a pleasant flagrance.  However, there is &quot;broken type&quot; on nearly every page because the text is not conventionally set, but rather a photo offset from another edition. (Conventionally set text would read like a Word document printed with a laser printer.  Photo offset would be as if one had scanned that laser-printed World document into a JPEG, and reprinted out that JPEG.)  The binding of this edition also seems to be of lesser quality than the 1991 centennial edition.<br />There is also the LOTR Movie Art Cover edition printed in June of 2001.  Like the centennial edition's cover illustration, this edition's movie art is also on a cover jacket.  I am not too familiar with this edition, but from casual browsing, I've found that the text, though smallest, looks the most &quot;conventionally set,&quot; and the pages are of the same quality as the centennial edition.  The book is smaller in height and width but thicker than the collector's edition.  The binding looks solid enough, but there is no movie art in the book.<br />My personal favorite is the centennial edition.",2001-11-18

Personally I have a very, very strong affection for this book and I think it is truly one of the most beautiful works of literature. Tolkien's imagination is mind-blowing. I understand that some people may find the songs and poems tedious to read, but I think it is these songs and poems which bring a certain magic to the whole story. Tolkien's writing is simple but elegant and beautiful. I thought that many of the characters were given great depth, and I became especially fond of Gandalf and Sam! And one of the things I really loved about this story was that the 'hero' who embarked on the quest to destroy the Ring was a little hobbit and not some stereotyped handsome hero you read about in so many books. This goes to show that everyone - including little plain people - can be a hero in our own way, as long as we have the heart to reach our goals.<br />I have read other fantasy stories, but somehow I just don't find them even remotely as captivating as Tolkien's LOTR.

Tolkien released the last installment of the Lord of the Rings in 1955, it was as though he had tilled a seismic line in the sands of fantasy and fiction literature: Before Tolkien and After Tolkien. With his extraordinary depth of characters and storyline, scrutiny of detail, and flowing, serial writing style, the author - in one swift stroke - redefined a genre of modern literature in much the same way that the great bards in Shakespeare's time recast the foundations of drama and the spoken word. The story begins in the fictional land of Middle-Earth, a place not unlike our own in days gone by. Turquoise streams and chill valleys cut across the scenery; intimate villages and great stone cities dot the landscape; and an endless array of interesting characters, both kindly good and plotting evil, wait to be met. The reader first meets Frodo Baggins, the book's protagonist, in a town called Hobbiton - a mythical Pleasantville, USA where the grass is mowed and one's neighbors are just down the road. Frodo is a Hobbit, a kind, soft-footed creature of small stature. He could be any one of us, an Everyday Joe going about their tasks of today. But a mission soon thrust in his hands by Middle-Earth's powers-that-be? To destroy the One Ring, a fulcrum symbol of absolute power, creation and authority... and the one device that may end the world. In short, Lord of the Rings is truly epic: It is chock-full of battles, heroism, romance, comradeship, royalty, long-days, cold nights, plot twists. But Tolkien's ability to capture the imagination of the everyday reader is, perhaps, his greatest accomplishment. The reader feels drained at the conclusion of Frodo's remarkable journey, but filled with new experiences, as if one was actually there riding, walking and fighting with him and his colleagues. Tolkien succeeds in stimulating our emotions and diverting our minds, while clasping our hearts in a way that no other epic has before.",2001-10-03

They don't have much magic about them, and they aren't nearly as formidable as Dwarves.  They do, however, possess extraordinary grit and endurance.  These qualities stand Frodo Baggins in good stead as he sets off to dispose of a magic ring left to him by his Uncle Bilbo.  Disposing of such a trinket may seem a small matter, but the very fate of Middle Earth depends upon the outcome of Frodo's errand.<br />Along the way, Frodo acquires a motley crew of helpers:  Legolas, a woodland Elf who is a dead shot with a bow; Gimli, a brawny Dwarf whose axe can cleave Goblins with the best of them; Pippin, Merry, and Samwise, fellow Hobbits who are great friends and admirers of Frodo; Aragorn, son of Arathorn, a mysterious woodsman; Boromir of Gondor, the very incarnation of the knight errant; and Gandalf the Grey, a wizard who knows better than any other member of the company the importance of their mission.<br />The company travels through strange lands, confronts awful perils, makes exotic friends, and all the while battles the evil influence of Sauron, the Dark Lord.  Eventually they become separated and undertake individual quests.  They perform mighty deeds, endure privation, suffer grievous wounds, and some of them even die, but finally the survivors reunite at a battle before the very gates of the Evil Empire.  The battle is not an Armageddon, with a fore-ordained winner.  It is a Ragnarok whose outcome cannot be known.  Writers have often imitated, but never equaled, Tolkien's adult fairy tale.<br />Although I'm not 100% sure, I believe the  Soundelux production differs from the BBC production of LOTR.  The production values and acting quality suffer by comparison with the BBC production of &quot;The Hobbit.&quot;  To say that production values are only adequate is no condemnation.  A great story can survive even a poor telling, and this production of LOTR is NOT a poor telling of the story.

Since Master Tolkien wrote this book over fifty years ago, it just goes to show us that some stories were meant to last forever.  This is one of those.<br />The story is the continuation of 'The Hobbit' --- the story of Mr. Bilbo Baggins.  Bilbo has adopted his nephew, Frodo, and gives him all his worldly possessions...including The One Ring, The Ruling Ring.  It is this Ring, in the possession of Frodo the Ring Bearer, that causes the ultimate downfall of Middle Earth.  It is evil and was forged by Sauron on Mount Doom in the cracks of fire.  It is the One Ring that rules all the other magical rings of Middle Earth, and if Sauron gets it, darkness will envelop all.  So it must be destroyed, and Frodo is given the task of taking it to Mount Doom (where it was forged) and throwing it into the Fire, thus diminishing all the other Rings of Power, but saving Middle Earth from eternal darkness.<br />The battles are daring and brave as are the characters: Boromir, Aragon, Samwise, Pippin, Merry, Gandalf (Mithrandeer), Treebeard, and many, many others.  Of course, we also can't forget Gollum (also known as Smeagol).  He is the unwitting player in the book that serves a purpose that he cannot and could not comprehend.  Nor could Frodo...till the end.  And how does it end?  You'll have to read it.  And maybe re-read it.  And then maybe re-read it again.

My first reading of it was about three years ago. Amazingly, (and I think this says something of the quality of the story itself) I would say I enjoyed it even more this second time around. It is so sweeping and wide that it still thrills, never losing any of its unpredictablity even if one is already familiar with the ending. Tolkien's Middle Earth is so immense, such an entire &quot;sub-creation&quot; (as the author himself referred to it)... complete with its own creatures, history, languages, and breathtaking landscapes... I believe it is without parallel in fantasy literature of any era. This book is myth, rather than allegory. By that I mean that there is not really meant to be any strict one-to-one correspondence to specifically theological, political, or psychological aspects of our own &quot;real&quot; world. No-one in Middle-Earth is named Mr. Worldly-Wiseman or Mr. Evangelist or Mr. Charity. No, here we meet people and things like Tom Bombadil, Gollum or Treebeard... hobbits, elves, dwarves, ents, orcs and yes, even Men. And yet, as with great allegorical works all of these characters gravitate to one of two poles or extremes that can be seen as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;. The Lord of The Rings is truly about a grandiose struggle between the FORCES of good and evil. In Chapter 2 of Book 2 we read that &quot;Good and ill have not changed... nor are they one thing among Elves and Dwarves and another among Men.&quot; An interesting thing about the book is how Tolkien's brand of &quot;dualism&quot; very subtly points to the reality that ultimate Good or Evil is something yet greater (or beyond) any of the characters that try to perpetrate either of them. This is most clear in a statement by Gandalf in Book 3 during &quot;The Last Debate&quot; where he says &quot;Other evils there are that may come; for Sauron is himself but a servant or emissary. Yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.&quot; If Sauron (who throughout the book appears as the evil to be reckoned with) is &quot;but a servant or emissary&quot;... then we must consider the question... an emissary of what? Or whom? And similarly, if all of the &quot;good&quot; that the Fellowship of The Ring strives to achieve will yet not &quot;master all of the tides of the world&quot;... then where is this locus of ULTIMATE good? Gandalf makes it clear that their own &quot;goodness&quot; is limited to the years wherein they are set. At the end of The Lord of The Rings, the future yet belongs to the good AND the evil that lie beyond the powers of any of the characters that have played a part in the present conflict. Maybe we are supposed to wonder... who IS the Lord of the rings? Almost 50 years ago C.S. Lewis, a friend of Tolkien's, said of The Lord of The Rings: &quot;Such a book has of course its predestined readers, even now more numerous and more critical than is always realised. To them a reviewer need say little, except that here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron; here is a book that will break your heart.&quot; And I too, could go on forever about it, but my best suggestion is for you to quit reading this, and just read the book.

To them a reviewer need say little, except that here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron; here is a book that will break your heart.&quot; And I too, could go on forever about it, but my best suggestion is for you to quit reading this, and just read the book. Or re-read it! The best review would be terribly inadequate. Tolkien's Middle-Earth is as impossible to imagine before you go there as it is to forget about once you've been.",2001-08-27

Tolkien released the last installment of the Lord of the Rings in 1955, it was as though he had tilled a seismic line in the sands of fantasy and fiction literature: Before Tolkien and After Tolkien. With his extraordinary depth of characters and storyline, scrutiny of detail, and flowing, serial writing style, the author - in one swift stroke - redefined a genre of modern literature in much the same way that the great bards in Shakespeare's time recast the foundations of drama and the spoken word. The story begins in the fictional land of Middle-Earth, a place not unlike our own in days gone by. Turquoise streams and chill valleys cut across the scenery; intimate villages and great stone cities dot the landscape; and an endless array of interesting characters, both kindly good and plotting evil, wait to be met. The reader first meets Frodo Baggins, the book's protagonist, in a town called Hobbiton - a mythical Pleasantville, USA where the grass is mowed and one's neighbors are just down the road. Frodo is a Hobbit, a kind, soft-footed creature of small stature. He could be any one of us, an Everyday Joe going about their tasks of today. But a mission soon thrust in his hands by Middle-Earth's powers-that-be? To destroy the One Ring, a fulcrum symbol of absolute power, creation and authority... and the one device that may end the world. In short, Lord of the Rings is truly epic: It is chock-full of battles, heroism, romance, comradeship, royalty, long-days, cold nights, plot twists. But Tolkien's ability to capture the imagination of the everyday reader is, perhaps, his greatest accomplishment. The reader feels drained at the conclusion of Frodo's remarkable journey, but filled with new experiences, as if one was actually there riding, walking and fighting with him and his colleagues. Tolkien succeeds in stimulating our emotions and diverting our minds, while clasping our hearts in a way that no other epic has before.",2001-08-24

I mean, c'mon how good could one book be. Well as time went on the rave reviews of The Lord of the Rings continued. And so finally I decided I had to read the book to see what the big fuss was about. Well I went down to my local library but couldn't find Lord of the Rings, instead I picked up Tolkien's first book The Hobbit. The 1st of Tolkien's books was a great novel indeed. Despite its more fantastical and somewhat childish approach, The Hobbit proved to be a very good read. I was completely drawn into the fantasically detailed world of Middle-earth. I soon ordered a copy of the Lord of the Rings and found it was well worth the money. It spends an amazing amount of time intricately detailing everything in Hobbiton, The Shire, Bree, Weathertop, Rivendell and all of the other locations in Middle-earth. By doing this it completely draws the reader into its world and refuses to let you go until the book is finished, which by the way is the only bad part about it. I found myself so excited in the events of the book such as when Frodo and his company were being followed the Black Riders in the dead of night, I could hardly wait to the read the next line and turn the page to see what became of them. I could simply go on for pages about just how good this book is and how brilliant the J. R. R. Tolkien is but my limit is a mere 1000 words. This book is absolutely, uncomparably better than anything anyone could have written. Before reading The Hobbit, I was never a big fan of fantasy type stories, but I assure this book will change your view of fantasy novels. Especially since it was the novel that started the fantasy fiction genre which created such unforgettable titles as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, The Chronicles of Narnia, and even Harry Potter. Believe me when I say it, if you can read than it would be an absolute shame if you deprived yourself of the joy that is Lord of the Rings.

J. R. R. Tolkien created a world of such intricacy that there are layers of depth hinted at throughout the book.  These can be read casually without detracting from the beauty of the story, but a closer understanding of the majesty behind Tolkien's First Age allusions makes for a far greater appreciation and enjoyment of the world created.  Unfortunately for many, the understanding of these allusions must come from reading &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; a task that many seem to find too daunting to attempt.  The one thing that Tolkien has understood better than any other writer I've encountered, and this shines through in LOTR, is that there are no happy stories as long as time continues to flow.  Even though LOTR ends in a victory for good over evil, time continues to pass and people continue to get old and old wounds continue to ache painfully.  This is especially apparent if you read the end of the saga of Aragorn and Arwen in Appendix A.  The sadness in this tale rends one's heart, even more so than does the final scene with Frodo and Samwise.  But as Gandalf says, &quot;Not all tears are bitter,&quot; and the sorrow is a sorrow that even in passing great things were accomplished and great evils were averted.  The rest of LOTR is however a story of the majesty of Aragorn and the wisdom and power of Gandalf and the sheer incorruptibility and stalwartness of Frodo and Samwise.  Tolkien reveals himself as an extremely wise and merciful man with his handling of Frodo Baggins and Smeagol.  It is here that Tolkien shows that although Gollum is a wretched creature, to execute him out of hand is an act of equal wretchedness.  Proponents of Samwise Gamgee would do well to look at Sam's treatment of Gollum in book two in comparison to Frodo at the same time.  Sam actually comes off very badly.  It is only in the third book, especially after Sam eventually shows himself to be merciful towards Gollum, that Sam becomes the heroic figure that readers look back at with such fondness (although his battle with Shelob in book two is one for the ages).  Anyway, this is a book that can be read over and over with new experiences every time.  In fact, it was only on my latest reading that I realised just how active a role is played by the Lords of the West throughout the War of the Ring.  Of course, without reading &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; that nuance would have continued to escape me.  I highly recommend that readers read &quot;the Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; and then read &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; and then come back and read LOTR again.

So when I saw &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; on the bookshelf in a local bookstore, I figured why not give it a try, a well-known book I'd not yet read. And I was completely surprised: Tolkein's epic exceeded my every expectation.<br />The story of how Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit from the backwoods Shire, stumbles upon the One Ring, which harnesses the power of world domination, is truly gripping - and I know that word gets used a lot to describe books, but in this case it's quite appropriate. I spent an entire day reading it, and could not put it down; it lured me back every time I tried to go do something else, like eating.<br />A whole slew of memorable characters intersect with Frodo as he ventures across Middle-Earth, some of whom were introduced in The Hobbit, some new: Gandalf, Smeagol, the Lady Galadriel, Sam Gamgee, et al. Each one has a distinct personality all his own, although I must confess I had trouble distinguishing between all the Kings and Lords and such. If the characters weren't sufficiently distinct, the plot line was quite complex and I found myself guessing time and again at what would happen next - wrongly.<br />The book, in short, is a masterpiece.

A more serious sequel to &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, while still a single coherent narrative, unlike &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and subsequent barrel-scrapings. The LOTR is not explicitly a kids' book like the Hobbit, but neither is it a fully adult piece of Modern Fantasy.If you try to read it too young, you will be scared off by the high-toned heroic writing style that develops after the first few chapters. If you leave it too late, the Gate to this Particular Otherworld will be locked for you. 'Too Late&quot; may be as young as 12 or somewhere in early adulthood. The story is a simple quest. The good guys (not many gals here!) are whiter-than-white, and the bad guys are horrid. Given the depressing result of JRRT's experiments with moral ambiguity in 'The Silmarillion', this may be as well. The major achievement of LOTR is the creation of a self-consistent world with a long and detailed history, linguistically plausible languages, and a believable mix of low-key magic with everyday physics. This was a major innovation in the first half of the 20th century when JRRT was evolving the framework for the Middle Earth books. However, it should be noted that other writers have achieved this since, with appreciably more realistic characters and storylines, and less explicit lifting from Norse and Anglo-Saxon mythology. Vastly overrated, but undeniably influential, this trilogy is a flawed masterpiece. I am amazed that I have weaned off it enough to become critical.  N.B - the most pernicious example of LOTR influence: the belief among certain publishers and writers that all good fantasy stories MUST be quests and MUST be &quot;trilogies&quot; (in however many parts..).",2001-02-27

It brought the genre of fantasy into the mainstream and because of its depth, clarity, and Tolkien's keen sense of language and detail it remains the standard bearer for fantasy today.<br />  The plot of the Lord of the Rings is too large to allow much comment here.  In short, the Lord of the Rings is the story of a hobbit named Frodo who undertakes a seemingly impossible mission to destroy a ring of unspeakable power and evil.  If you are not a fan of the fantasy genre, this may seem too &quot;fairy-tale-ish&quot; to be taken seriously.  However, while the setting and characters are in many ways fantastical (it is fantasy after all!), the themes found in the book are universal and timeless.  Good versus evil.  Fear versus courage.  This story is trully &quot;epic.&quot;<br />  I would suggest this book to any newcomer not only as a introduction to the fantasy genre but as work of literature as well.  Tolkien's style is lucid.  The characters are intriguing, not neccessarily because of their strengths but often because of their flaws.  One of the only criticisms of Tolkien is that the characters and story are often aloof.  While this is true, it was most likely the intention of the author to infuse an epic quality to the work.<br />  Now, for some notes on editions.  For those who want to keep expenses to a minimum, the 1999 paperback edition ... is a good choice.  For those Tolkien enthusiasts looking for a more durable edition, the millineum edition leaves a lot to be desired because of the binding and type face.

As a lover of the great fantasy novels (the Alice books, Lewis' Narnia chronicles, et al), I come always, inevitably, back to The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion -- the triptych of fantasy, without which none of what followed would be possible. (Simply look at Terry Brooks' Sword of Shannara to see what I mean. It parallels Tolkien in so many ways, it would be plagiarism if it wasn't so obviously a homage.) In thinking about the Rings saga while working on this review, I find so many things that delight and enlighten -- Tolkien's wonderful, memorable characters, his inventive Elven and Dwarvish languages, not to mention his even more inventive use of the English lamguage, his impeccably mythic story...I could go on, and I think I will! Continuing in the mythic vein for a moment, think about such creatures as the deadly, horrific barrow-wights, unseen in the story save for one clutching arm; Tom Bombadil, full of jollity and song, yet somehow wistful and a little sad at the same time; the hrm-ing, hooming, completely delightful Ents, pining for their lost wives -- that is what I mean by impeccably mythic. They all sound like stories you heard a hundred times when you were a child, as familiar as King Arthur, as spooky as Jack running from the Giant, as full of life and light, and sadness and darkness, as every adventure Dorothy ever had in Oz. Somehow, Tolkien tapped directly into what critic Burt Hatlen called the &quot;myth-pool&quot; with the Rings saga; his words and wonders are as intimate to us, in the archetypal sense, as our own blood and nerves. As an example, look at two key moments in The Fellowship of the Ring, where Frodo is rendered unconscious, first at the lair of the barrow-wights, then again at the high hill where his company is accosted by the ring-wraiths. In both instances, Frodo is nearly slain, and falls forward, his sword broken beneath him, calling to mind Arthur, fallen in his final battle, Achilles at Troy, or even a Biblical martyr, though that may be stretching a point. When we learn later that the Elven-king who cut the Ring-hand from Sauron's arm also fell slain with his sword broken beneath him, we know that not only is Tolkien paying close attention to detail, he understands full well that certain myths have a habit of running in cycles, and what happened to one Ring-Bearer will almost certainly happen to the next one. This is but one example of Tolkien's amazing work, which has such breadth and scope that I cannot fully convey its perfection in this short space, much as I would like to try. I will only say that if you have not read Lord of the Rings, you must; if you have read it but did not enjoy it, then there is no sense of wonder in your heart -- and may Shelob and Gollum cast you into the Cracks of Doom.

A copy of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was lying around the cabin where we were staying, and I innocently picked it up.  Some twenty years later, I am still can't put down any of Tolkien's writings.  And in the &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; Tolkien distills his already phenomenal talents, imagination and learning into its most potent form.<br />But what is the power of the trilogy?  There are stories that are more action-packed, more prolix in their descriptions and (with the notable example of Robert Jordan) much longer.  But Tolkien has created a peculiarly bewitching book, with a blend of his love of mythology and folklore, his vast learning in the area of languages and the skill at writing he honed through being a part of the academic world at Oxford University.  Tolkien participated in a group at Oxford called \\""The Inklings\\"" who included several people including C.S. Lewis, Charles Williams and (by honorable mention) Dorothy L. Sayers.  From the reading of several of their works, they had a particular concern for the \\""Mythopoeic\\"" aspects of literature.<br />Recently when dabbling in some of the collected works of C.G.Jung, I was struck by how much his ideas of the collective unconscious tapped into the same vein of inspiration that is so present in Lewis and Williams, and above all in Tolkien's \\""The Lord of the Rings.\\""  I went back and re-read my \\""Lord of the Rings\\"" after reading Jung.  The experience was astonishingly vivid.  Figures with terrible primeval power seemed to stalk from Jung through Tolkien into my imagination.  It made our conscious world of rational cause and effect into a pale shadow beside the images Tolkien has conjured out of the dark misty world of the unconscious.<br />Like most epic myths, the characters are in some way secondary to the vividness of the story.  While Tolkien's characters are human (or a reasonable variation thereof), they are also representatives of elemental ideas.  Strider/Aragorn is more than a mere heir of Kings, he is the essence of Kingship.  Gandalf, more than just the leader of the Fellowship of the Ring, is the very archetype of the wise old man who leads people to mature self-knowledge.  Frodo Baggins (the protagonist and hero of the trilogy) moves inexorably from being a part of the mundane world into the realm of being a hero in the mythopoeic world.  As Frodo changes, the \\""viewpoint\\"" of the story changes - from being Frodo's own personal viewpoint to being that of him observed by his servant Sam Gamgee.  Frodo, through his actions, moves from history into myth, from prose into poetry, from flesh into spirit.<br />The \\""Lord of the Ring's\\"" epic power springs from its ability to connect with deep human intuitions or beliefs or attitudes about the nature of life, of good and evil, and of time and eternity.  Vivid and flashing, the images move directly from the written page into our own unconscious.  To those with whom Tolkien connects, the response is visceral and overwhelming - and something that can't quite be explained by the rational mind.  I suppose to someone, with whom Tolkien doesn't connect, this is all vaguely unsettling and a bit mystifying.  To someone who was expecting a standard sword and sorcery confection, Tolkien must appear ponderous, heavy and leaden.<br />In summary, for everyone with the slightest interest in mythology or folklore, Tolkien's work can not be missed.

The comparison with the Oxford Professor of Anglo-Saxon seems to be a quite common and prefered way to give the reader an impression of how the work that he is going to buy would be. And yet... All of these reviews, how poor they will prove after the dazzled customer opens and starts the novel! No other work of fantasy literature that has appeared or still will appear after &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; deserves it at the least to be compared with Tolkien's epic.<br />What Tolkien has created with his opus on a literary basis, exceeds with no trouble all other works of fantasy, lets authors like Feist, Jordan or even Williams look like right fools. Tolkien has not only written an outstanding novel or shaped a wonderful world, but he has managed to give readers all over the world one thing back, which they were likely to lose in a world as fast living as ours: Their own fantasy, their own imagination. In doing this, Tolkien is not pleased to simply tell a compelling and entertaining story, but he presents a world with its own mythology, an existence of its own in the truest sense of the word.<br />Even though some critics may dispute Tolkien's literacy in comparison to Feist or Jordan (let me just laugh a little!), I won't be blinded by your comments! Now, for the second time, I started reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; - this time in its original language, after having read the German translation in no more than three days without sleep - and it seems, as if I have never left Middle-Earth and its fabulous flora and fauna. But now I truly understand the profundity of this masterpiece. Perhaps Jordan and Co. might have the talent to arrange some of the scenes in a more exciting way, yet their works lack one of the most elementary features of faerie (as Tolkien calls it) and fantasy: the language, and I don't mean the creation of new languages like the Sindarin or Quenya, but the language of the novel!<br />Tolkien shows remarkably that it is the language of the protagonists (let me remind you of the wizard Gandalf!), the language of the scenery, the language of the history that helps the reader to imagine an independent albeit foreign world that is not so different from his own. And remember the fight of Gandalf against the Balrog in Moria! Whoever did not devour each word, each syllable in this scene as if spellbound, I think noone can ever help these people...<br />In my honest opinion, all those new &quot;bestsellers&quot; do not deserve to stand in line with Tolkien's work. Even though &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; sometimes reads sluggishly due to its preference for distinctive and eloquent description of landscape, this novel is nevertheless the ultimative in fantasy literature. Many works of fantasy, if not all, are far, far away from such gloria perpetua. Giving 5 stars for this milestone of literature in each genre, is simply not enough, but not even 10, 100 or thousands of stars could fathom what treasure one of the most wonderful authors has laid in our laps.<br />I thank Tolkien for this legacy, and I will carry it within me - until Morgoth will rise again...Co. might have the talent to arrange some of the scenes in a more exciting way, yet their works lack one of the most elementary features of faerie (as Tolkien calls it) and fantasy: the language, and I don't mean the creation of new languages like the Sindarin or Quenya, but the language of the novel!<br />Tolkien shows remarkably that it is the language of the protagonists (let me remind you of the wizard Gandalf!), the language of the scenery, the language of the history that helps the reader to imagine an independent albeit foreign world that is not so different from his own.

Now how in the world is that possible?  And who vanished?  The Lord of the Rings, part one, The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien, will tell you.  This story is full of detail and adventure.  I highly recommend this book.  Since J.R.R. Tolkien is so descriptive, whoever reads any of these stories can picture exactly what the scene looks like.  He described the forest that the adventurers went through wonderfully.  All throughout the story, &quot;black riders&quot; were following the main characters.  These riders were trying to catch the main character, Frodo.  I could see the whole scene.  This story could have been a lot shorter if so much detail wasn't in the story.  I'm not saying the detail is bad, but since so much detail was described, at times I did get bored while reading the book.  Throughout the first part of the story, the travelers were going through the woods.  Most of the beginning was description, but a little adventure thrown in to keep the reader reading.  For example, when they were in the woods, they became tired and fell asleep under a willow tree.  While they were sleeping, the willow tree opened up and surrounded two of the characters.  They were in quite the predicament.  This kept me reading to see what the outcome was.  Wolves, and/or the black riders throughout the story would also attack them.  An image in this book that has really stuck in my head is at the end when Frodo was coming upon Mordor, his destination.  He was going down a river and ahead of him were two pillars on each side of the river.  The river was in the woods, so I could see the trees, looking dark and gloomy since the weather was bad, and he was near an evil place.  I could also see the little creatures attacking them in the woods.  The picture on the cover illustrates a scene perfectly from the book.  The reader would picture that same scene in his head.  I immediately knew when I read that scene what the picture on the front of the book was.  He described the horses coming out of the water, engulfing the black riders immediately after Frodo crossed the lake.  I know who everyone is in that picture.  If so much wasn't put in the book, I wouldn't know who was who or where the scene was from.  When I've read other books, I couldn't tell what part of the book the picture on the front was, or I could, but I had a different picture in mind.  In this story, I had the same exact image in my head as the one on the front of the book.  I liked The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R Tolkien.  I chose this book because it was recommended to me.  Every person I talked to recommended that I read this story, along with the others, which go along with this story.  I haven't yet read the next two books, but I do plan on reading them in the future.  I'm glad I took my friends' advice, and now I recommended this book to anyone who likes adventure.picture on the front of the book was.

I unabashedly admit enjoying The Count of Monte Cristo more than Don Quixote and am liable to devour a book whole rather than delve into its heart and soul like that time I gorged on the first seven books of the Wheel of Time in seven days straight.  Perhaps for the preceding reasons I may be classified more of a casual reader than a serious bibliophile.  Nevertheless, please don't ignore my protestations completely.<br />I guess it is inevitable that review lists like this will have many more reviews from supporters of a book than reviews from detractors, especially a series of such stature as Lord of the Rings.  Loyal devotees would naturally be drawn here while those dissatisfied would likely not even bother.  As one of the few detractors though that has bothered to post, let me at least weigh in and try to counter the imbalance I perceive.  First this warning to all those out there that have not read or bought LOTR yet, especially those who may have been drawn to it via other popular fantasy fare:  contrary to what some of the posts here would have you believe, LOTR is not for everyone.<br />Although this series figured prominently in the establishment of the fantasy genre as we know it today, and is deservedly considered a classic, it is my opinion that it would also suffer from all the stereotypes associated with a &quot;classic.&quot;  Lord of the Rings is actually quite a different animal from the popular fantasy stories dominating the market today.  It has pretensions of being highbrow and is not a soap opera.  It is epic in the sense you'd characterize The Iliad, The Odyssey, or Beowulf (and equally dreary) and not in the sense Jordan's Wheel of Time (which I confess is probably a tad too fruity) is epic.  LOTR has more in common with The Chronicles of Narnia (which I prefer) than contemporary populist fantasy.<br />One reviewer said that no one would ever make a series to compare to LOTR.  I agree.  I think LOTR was the right work that came out at the right time.  If another work had defined the fantasy genre and LOTR came out only now to compete with the current crop of fantasy, I suspect LOTR would be a commercial flop despite any literary merit or advantage it may have.  Disagree?  Please refer to the contemporary series that most closely follows LOTR in style and form if not substance.  Not many very well known that I can think of.  Most are of the soap opera variety, not classic epic.  I would have thought that the imitators would be more recognizable and come in much greater numbers.<br />Like another reviewer here, I had to force myself to keep reading LOTR.  Unfortunately I had to keep it up even past the first 100 pages and I did not end up enjoying it. The reason I put up with it is probably the least arguable reason I can think of for reading LOTR.  LOTR probably carries enough gravitas because of its significant role in developing fantasy to make it worthwhile to read just for the sake of reading it.  Now at least I can say I've read it if nothing else.<br />If you like symbolism and profound insight in a fantasy setting and don't think you'd get bored in the process, you might find it here. I wouldn't know for sure-that's not what I read fantasy for.  If that was what I was after I'd read the Bible, Dead Sea Scrolls, Qu'ran, Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Catcher in the Rye, or something else.<br />However, if a good story is the only thing you are after, it is debatable if you'll enjoy LOTR.  A story that will have you at the edge of your seat with cliffhanger after cliffhanger LOTR is not and I doubt it is a series one would likely lose sleep over.t no one would ever make a series to compare to LOTR.

If you're used to a junk food diet of contemporary easy-to-read thrillers, you'll find &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; tough going.  This is no bag of high-cholesterol potato chips to be consumed in five minutes - this is a sack of solid food to be enjoyed over several evenings!  Unlike the brief attractions offered by a 100-meter sprint, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; offers the scenic adventures of a 100-mile walk.  Don't misunderstand this to mean that this journey is boring.  Most 100-meter sprint type novels provide only momentary and fleeting pleasure, whereas the marathon journey of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; provides an enduring and challenging journey, with a multitude of memorable pleasures.<br />Whose journey is it?  At the face of it, it is a journey undertaken by the hobbit Frodo and his companions.  Frodo possesses a most powerful ring, and the only way to prevent this ring from ever falling into the hands of the powers of evil is to destroy it - in the very heart of the kingdom of evil.  &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; describes the epic journey of the ring-bearer Frodo and his companions as they journey into the heart of enemy territory to do battle with the powers of evil.  If they successfully accomplish their quest, they will assure the  conquest of evil by good.<br />But it is not just Frodo who makes this marathon journey.  Tolkien has an uncanny ability to ensnare the reader, so that you will find yourself not just a spectator, but a participant in the marathon mission undertaken by Frodo and friends.  As you travel the journey with the ring-bearer Frodo and his company, they will become more than mere travelling companions.  They will become your friends.  You will feel you know them, and you will grow to love them - their joys will excite you, their sorrows will hurt you, their conquests will delight you, their failures will grief you.  And it will pain you to say goodbye to them all at the end.<br />Like the journey itself, however, participating in the journey by reading the trilogy can be tough going.  At times the travelling through the words is slow and tough going.  But at other times the pages fly by fast and furious with high paced action.  And precisely this makes the epic journey through the treasured pages of Tolkien so rewarding.  As a reader, you find yourself sharing in a very fantastic and yet very real journey, one which encompasses all of real life's emotions and experiences: sorrow as well as joy, inactivity as well as action, pain as well as pleasure.  While reading, you partake in the emotions and experiences of fantasy characters - hobbits, dwarves, elves, and the like - because these emotions and experiences are distinctly recognizable - morally these characters are so much like ourselves, and we recognize aspects of ourselves in them.<br />What's more, in the course of this long journey, you will be presented with breath-taking scenery.  Tolkien has a remarkable ability to describe scenery with colour, character and clarity, so that you will visualize every tree, rock and road.  By the time you are done, the setting of Middle-Earth will be as real as any place you've visited.  As such, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is not just about a story and a journey, it is about a place.  This place, you will discover, is immense and grand, because Tolkien has created cultures, histories, and languages.  The vast scope of the journey and place in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; makes it a truly epic novel.<br />In fact, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; has all the qualities of an epic - an immense scope, combined with a heroic and grand style.  Tolkien constantly displays a mastery of the English language - the word usage at times gloriously grand, at times passionately poetic, at times wonderfully descriptive, but always amazing.  Together, the vast scope and elevated style combine to create a truly epic masterpiece, so that the three volumes of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; read like three acts of tremendously immense play, with a global cast of characters, and a worldwide stage.  And as you read, you are never quite sure whether this play is going to be a tragedy or triumph, as the powers of good seek to overcome the powers of evil.<br />This struggle between good and evil that actually makes &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; a deeply religious book.  Tolkien was a devout Catholic, and although he adamantly maintained that it was written for pure entertainment and had no deeper meaning,  he could not avoid being influenced by his religious background, as is evidenced by his sharp view on morality, where good and evil are viewed as moral absolutes.  The epic struggle between good and evil occurs on a wider scale than in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and this gives the &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; a much more serious tone, arising out of deeply rooted religious convictions.  Yet the struggle of good against evil never becomes a simplistic or shallow.  As in real life, Tolkien's characters have weaknesses and flaws, and are affected by their experiences - some on the side of good even being corrupted by evil.  And this makes the epic struggle for truth, freedom, justice and goodness all the more stimulating as your return to real life.  One cannot be unaffected by the commitment and undying devotion towards the cause of good, the undying devotion, even when it requires unselfish sacrifices to be made in the process.  In this sense, those who share Tolkien's underlying Christian values will especially enjoy the epic journey he has created.<br />But there are more ways in which Tolkien's religious insights implicitly shine through.  Biblical imagery is discernable throughout, especially the king's final victory and eternal reign of peace and joy, and banishment of evil is reminiscent of the victory of Christ over the dragon in Revelation.  For readers of Scripture, the images of light and happiness, the tree of life, and an eternal kingdom, will be strikingly familiar and recognizable.<br />But you do not have to be a Christian to enjoy &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;  There is nothing overtly religious about this trilogy, since the universe Tolkien creates and describes is a universe without God, where chance and fate are acknowledged as crucial players of the game, and where the conquest of evil is accomplished by the power of one's own will.  This is probably exactly what we should expect from a Catholic writer.<br />If you have never read &quot;The Lord of Rings&quot;, you should read it if only for the fact that it is widely acclaimed as the greatest fantasy classic, equaled by none.  Few have read it and failed to be affected by.  If you have not yet read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, a most distinct pleasure and experience awaits you.  If you have already read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, you likely have already been touched by it, and yet the captivation of the reading experience is far from over.

When I received this particular edition I was shocked at the extremely poor quality of print and generally poor quality of every aspect of the presentation. In two of the volumes the maps are incorrectly bound so that they are impossible to unfold. It is not even possible to cut the map out of the book because important parts of the middle of it have been sewn up in the binding.<br />But the damning point of this edition is the printed page. Every single page has both drop outs and extra ink everywhere. The printing weight varies from page to page, at times fading to a medium gray, at other times a dense bold face.

Although he did have a major hand in starting the fantasy genre (he really isn't the creator), and his books are good, their not flawless.<br />Its true he has written a compelling series. the world is beautifully drawn and the epic involves you. The language is well-constructed and lyrical. The major strength of the series is its theme. Although Tolkien claims otherwise, his quest can be interpreted to have allegorical meanings. In my own reading, the Ring symblolizes technology, which all want; (but in Tolkien's view, and this view is apparent in his other writings) however it also corrupts. There is a beauty in the theme.<br />There are however, numerous problems. The series is highly Eurocentric (hm.. Proud, strong, light Northerners like Aragorn; weak, corrupt dark Southerners and Easterners like the Easterlings). Not only this but Tolkien's literature is highly nostalgic and yearning for a better past when 'giants' (as in heroes) walked the land. Tolkien apparently detested change which is inevitable. And change is certainly not all bad. His characters are always bursting into song and telling great tales of the PAST while the great deeds being done at present are largely ignored or downplayed.<br />Most annoying though, was the change of style. The beginning starts out like the Hobbit, in the sort of style that children's tales have (Tolkien even addresses the reader directly sometimes, a device almost exclusively confined to children's books or confessionals). Midway through the first book, the tone abruptly changes and we are left with a darker (and more suitable) tone that continues to grow darker and drearier. By the time Frodo was getting near Mordor I felt like kicking him, I was so tired of the author's continuous description him as weary, weak, tired, half-dead.<br />The ending too was highly nostalgic which may be beautiful for a while but quickly grows tedious.

And he did create a wonderful, if highly eurocentric, world.<br />But this book fails because of its incessant praise of war.  The Nazis were evil because of the Holocaust. What did the Allies do to stop that?  Not much (didn't even bomb the tracks leading to the death camps).  War is simply evil; the sad lesson of the 20th Century is that warriors only contribute to the problem (Hiroshima) and only peacemakers fight evil effectively. (MLK, Ghandi, Einstein)<br />Tolkein should be criticised for glorifing war because he: (1) wrote for children, is very popular, and (3)is credited with greatness. But Tolkein set up a world where war is becomes the essentially bloodless killing of evil subhumans or spirits.  As in Beowulf, there's no horror, just glory.  The enemies, who live in a &quot;black and evil land&quot; can't be reasoned with, only killed.  (Contrast this with the Iliad). Real evil never works that way; Hitler came from the same people that produced Beethoven and Goethe.  Speaking of which, the the book's subhumans are so gleefully killed, that one wonders how Lord of the Rings would have been received if the author were german and not british.<br />It's too bad really.

The sheer scale of it is awe-inspiring. Nothing else I've ever read even comes close to the vast, intricately created world of Tolkien, complete with its own geography, flora, fauna, history and of course a fabulous cast of characters (I'm gushing a bit here, amn't I?).<br />I first read the Lord of the Rings when I was something like 8 or 9, and it's been a couple of years since I last opened it, but so many details are still vivid in my mind - Gandalf's stand on the Bridge of Moria, the vivid battle scenes (one with comic relief as an elf and a dwarf compete to see who can kill more orcs), the horrors of Mordor, the final confrontation with the Enemy and the wistful, bittersweet final chapter. Of course, this could be partly because I've reread the whole book once at least, and certain bits more times than Barad-Dur has dungeons.<br />The Lord of the Rings also contains many intelligent personal stories set against its vast canvas. The hero, Frodo the hobbit, tortured by the terrible burden of the Ring that he carries, the good man corrupted by its terrible power, the wise and powerful people who fall under the spell of the Enemy without realising it, the schizophrenic Smeagol/Gollum, all these and more can be found in this book.<br />Galvanised by the oncoming release of the first part in cinemas (December of next year), I am going to read this wonderful book again soon.

Twenty years of setting it aside, I spent the end of this past summer slowly and patiently enjoying every minute of Tolkien's grand and masterful tale of Middle-earth.<br />The hobbit Frodo has a simple task fraught with the most terrible of dangers--journey to the Crack of Doom to destroy the One Ring so that the evil lord Sauron cannot use it to subjugate the land and all its inhabitants.  The trouble is that the Crack of Doom is in Sauron's own country, and his Eye sees almost everything.  Advised by the wizard Gandalf and accompanied by three fellow hobbits, two men, a dwarf and an elf, Frodo's journey is the main thrust of the tale.  Meanwhile, preparations for the decisive war are being made on both sides of the mountains that border Mordor, the land of Sauron.<br />Tolkien's style is straightforward and measured--the narrator never gets excited.  Tolkien was a Classics professor so it should be no surprise that Frodo's journey is told with several Homeric devices, notably the repeated descriptions of the weather (reminded me of &quot;dawn's rosy fingers&quot; reappearing every day in THE ODYSSEY) and the state of the characters' stomachs.  Also like Homer, Tolkien allows his characters to tell their own stories around the fire.  To read THE LORD OF THE RINGS well perhaps also takes the skills of a good listener.<br />The length of THE LORD OF THE RINGS forces well-intended readers afflicted with the modern short attention span into a calmer, more relaxed perspective.  While Frodo and his dear friend Sam may run till they drop, while Gandalf's horse Shadowfax may outpace all other animals that run, Tolkien never rushes. This deliberate pacing is a prime reason why his epic is so rich and rewarding.<br />THE LORD OF RINGS gives us much to think about on the theme of what any one of us is really capable of.  It deals with honor, endurance, treachery and sacrifice like few other stories of the twentieth century.

JRR left us a treasure.","I first read LOTR years ago, when I was a teenager, it amazed me back then, and since those days I have read its pages over 6 or 7 times. It's about time I write a few words here about my all time favorite book.<br />Tolkien died a year before I was born (73), a scholar by profession, he was specialized in Anglo-Saxon (Old English) and its relation to linguistically similar languages (Old Norse, Old German and Gothic). He became a master into the language of poetry and the poetry of language. His interest in mythology (shared by his friend C.S. Lewis) and his faith in Christianity also had a stunning effect in his stories.<br />LOTR is above anything, a book about the struggle between good and evil, somewhere in our own world, but in an imaginary time. It all feels familiar, but &quot;glorified by the enchantment of distance in time&quot;.<br /> In Middle Earth (North-western Europe was probably what Tolkien had in mind) Bilbo, a Hobbit (a branch of the human race) finds himself in a quest to destroy the One Ring, crafted by the elven-smiths and Sauron, the Dark Lord, but lost. Sauron searches far and wide for the ring that would complete his dominion of evil, while the initially naïve Bilbo and his friends (The so called Fellowship of the Ring) journey Middle-Earth, deep into the shadow of Sauron, to destroy the Ring by casting it in the Cracks of Doom.<br />LOTR is amazing by many reasons. The languages presented are most certainly real languages, especially the Elven languages. It is unbelievable how they are not arbitrary gibberish but really possible tongues with established roots, sound laws and inflexions. Tolkien used all his knowledge and imaginative powers deriving them, in a realistic manner.<br />LOTR is narrated by Tolkien, based on ancient manuscripts written by the main characters Frodo and Bilbo, or at least, many people think that Tolkien sought to maintain that he was only the editor and translator. This would be nothing special, as many authors tried to make their fantasies sound as true stories from some ancient times, but very few have done it so successfully as Tolkien. His love for language and his imagination and scholarship produced a work that is hard to translate, at least, without losing much of its impact. For instance, an adequate translation of Rohirric would have to be replaced with some ancient language whose relation to the language of the translation was the same as that of Anglo-Saxon to modern English. Tolkien actually used an approximation of Anglo-Saxon so we it would remain intelligible to modern readers like us. This was not accidental, but carefully devised. New land, languages, races, history, cultures, a whole new world; That is what you will find in this most remarkable work of literature.<br />Tolkien has left us a gorgeous, eloquent and heroic romance, and after you read it you will understand why this has been named the &quot;Book of the Century&quot; many times.  Some readers gave it 4 stars because it's &quot;so long&quot;. That's the only problem I can point to LOTR, its length, but for the opposite reason. I feel it should be a lot longer. :) It is true that the first 100 pages are somewhat slow for some readers, but they are still rich and interesting.<br />The struggle of good and evil, the depth of all the characters, friendship, love, temptation, war, hate and the inner moral conflicts the characters face, all is presented marvellously thanks to Tolkien's keen abilities for both prosaic and poetic expression, based on his deep love for ancient languages, myth and nature.<br />This is the Bible of fantasy literature, but you will probably still like it even if you're not used to its kind. No other writer of fantasy titles has ever come close. Not even the best like Tad Williams, Robert Jordan or others.  Never read it? What are you waiting for? Get it. Get the hardcover illustrated version by Alan Lee. I own a few versions and will probably end up buying more. The best LOTR hardcovers are expensive, but it's fully worth it.

Tolkien is masterful at introducing people (from hobbits to wizards), making us fall in love with them, their dreams and desires, their faults, and their fears.  Even a character as deplorable as Saruman can be enjoyed because of the instant journey you can see his character has taken (simply from references other characters in the novel make about him!). Tolkien has written a most theatrical work, a little bit of fantastic genius springing from a work of fun and adventure (the Hobbit, its predecessor).  It is said that almost all fantasy since Tolkien has drawn in one way or another from this work.  I only wish they could come as close to perfection.

I revised and posted it on Amazon's UK site.  As I say in the first paragraph, I want to bring this element out to show readers a little acknowledge fact about the most important novel of the twentieth century.  Of all the reviews I've written for Amazon this stands as the one with the most important thing to say.  Ideally, reviews, etc, should be used as enhancing literature and \\""comparing notes\\"" as Lewis says in his EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM.  This is what I mean to do here, to enlighten and compare notes.  The enthusiasm of the original review is tempered with a more mature voice.  Tolkien's work is strictly his own, but I feel Lewis should get acknowledged for his contribution to fantasy literature by his encouraging Tolkien.  However, I am getting ahead of myself.  I hope this review helps you better understand the powerful literary group that was the Inklings.<br /><br />Mike London, 8-22-01.<br /><br />The Review:  It is often customary to sing the praise of Tolkien and his accomplishments, but in this review I purpose to bring out an aspect often neglected in the circle of Tolkien fans, and that is the influence his Christian brother C. S. Lewis had upon him. Because there is so much else covering Tolkien's achievements, I, in this review, will stress Lewis and how, in keeping a keen interest and continual encouragement in this work, is, in an indirect way, as much responsible as Tolkien is, though this book is none of Lewis's creation. I only choose to stress this because it seems it is not very often pointed out.<br /><br />C. S. Lewis has accomplished many things as a writer and a Christian, which an incredible amount to contribute to the world of literature. Some will argue what is his most important literary contribution, wether it be THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, TILL WE HAVE FACES, literary criticism, or his apologetic works. But these arguments always leave out what I feel is the single most important contribution he ever made to the world of literature.<br /><br />THE LORD OF THE RINGS.<br /><br />Without Lewis, we would not have the genre of fantasy as we know it, because Tolkien would not have finished his masterpiece. In Tolkien's own words, he says, \\""But for the encouragement of C.S.L. I do not think I should ever have completed or offered for publication THE LORD OF THE RINGS,\\"" in THE LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN, #282.  Lewis said that he had no influence on Tolkien in the conventional way - that is, Lewis had no influence on WHAT he wrote. His main contribution was just to listen. He said of his own role to his famous friend was that of a midwife to Tolkien's works, not a father. As far as any substance or influence goes, I think the only appearance of C. S. Lewis in the works of Tolkien is the character Treebeard, which, according to Carpenter's biography TOLKIEN, whose voice is modeled after the speech patterns of Lewis, with his great \\""ho hum\\"" voice that had a tendency to be rather booming. In Lewis's own fiction, the character of Elwin Ransom from his space trilogy is modeled after Tolkien, for Ransom, like Tolkien, is a philologist, and according to Tolkien some of his ideas and concepts regarding the discipline of philology were \\""Lewisfied\\"" (Tolkien's terminology, not mine) in the character of Ransom (again, Carpenter, and I think this information is also in THE LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN.)<br /><br />Without C. S.

But it is a rara avis indeed that can touch me  forever: that one album that I pick up to change my moods that can  thoroughly permeate and lift my spirits.

LotR's position in the world of fantasy has never been challenged. The story is simply too great. Situated in a whole new world, with its own background, its own  legends, history and culture, Tolkien tells about the escalation of the  battle between good and evil. What started out as the simple discovery of  the powers of an ancient artifact, owned by the unlikely heroes of the  story, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, hobbits, finally results in an  all-consuming war between the peoples of middle-earth.<br />What made the  story so rich, is that it's a legend containing other legends. While  reading it you can't help but be overwhelmed by the complexity of  middle-earth's history. While modern fantasy-stories tend to be superficial  tales set in a stereotypical environment, presenting stereotypical heroes  and bad-guys, LotR keeps a sense of historical realism.<br />On the other  hand, the story is quite old-fashioned in a way. Good is good and bad is  bad. There's hardly any character development: heroes stay heroes, bad guys  stay bad guys. There's no gray area. There's no real romance, besides the  &quot;hero meets royal girl and both instantly feel true love&quot;-thing.  The story itself is pretty straight-forward, and although the journey and  battle are long, as a reader you never doubt a happy ending will follow.

I immediately fell in love with Tolkien's Middle Earth, its characters and the incredible plot he created.<br />I am now on my third  reading of the cycle. I came back to it after leaving it on the bookshelf  for many years (I like to forget many of the details so the book has a  certain freshness when reread).  To my amazment the book still has much  more freshness than I expected.  This time through I am seeing so much of  Tolkien's genius in the genre of fantasy: he created a whole world with  geography and history and complexity, and he makes it really  &quot;work&quot;.  Much other fantasy is weak in this area: the created  worlds just don't work all that well.  Tolkien's regions and cultures have  a depth that puts them a quantam leap above those of standard  fantasy.<br />Also, many of Tolkien's characters are round and deep.  I  actually thought them rather cardboard on my first reading, but this time  through I begin to see that though Tolkien uses certain stereotypical  character types, he fleshes them with an interesting life all their own.  On my first read I thought the hobbits were the most intriguing of  Tolkiens' characters.  I find them even more intriguing this time through.  I also found MUCH more depth in the elves and dwarves, who seemed VERY  stereotypical on the first read.  I think I was so engrossed by the plot on  my first time through I did not pay much attention to the  characters.<br />This book is one everyone should read at least twice.  It is  a modern classic.  Those who shun fantasy because of it being  &quot;unrealistic&quot; need to read this book so they can learn about a  different kind of realism.<br />The specific things I enjoy about this  hardcover edition are the maps and the artwork.  It includes Tolkien's  original maps, which are better than the ones in my old paperback edition.<br />And as for the illustrations: Alan Lee's works are masterful.  He pays  great heed to Tolkien's details so that his pictures don't contradict the  text; though I found a few minor discrepancies (which could be errors in my  own imagination).  His detailed and beautiful watercolors gave more  substance and shape to my own images of Middle Earth and its inhabitants.  My only criticism is that I find Tolkien's world to be more solid than Alan  Lee's.  Mr. Lee's version of Middle Earth is more etherial and less earthy  than Tolkien's.<br />Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is his magnum opus and it is  a great book for ALL TIME.

Let me just tell you, then, it's a great story, and for some, it will be  hard to find a better.  Tolkien has taken the raw material of the human  psyche and fashioned a world with it, and then put a story in that world  that will fill your imagination with unforgetable images.  I don't think I  even noticed, the first several times through, the genius he displays for  character and motivation or for linguistic invention, the story swept me  off my feet so completely.  After years of reading it, even the things I  don't much care for -- some of the poetry, Sam's overly servile attitude, a  bit of a slow beginning in Fellowship of the Ring, some rather clumsy  map-making -- have worked into the whole and become a part of its charm.

Indeed, this is the literary work against which all others of that genre  are measured.<br />  It is powerful on so many levels.

It's backstory spans thousands of years, but  with such accuracy and detail that the reader perceives history rather than  fantasy. And it is interesting! Despite the Men, Elves, Dwarves, and  Hobbits central to the story itself, the reader is convinced of embarking  on a worthwhile quest with them, and with terrors and delights of his own.<br />  But it is more than simple entertainment. It is ennobling to read of  such lofty depth and serious virtue, all the while appreciating life's  simple pleasures and everyday indignities. These things are woven into a  tale of the agelong opposition of good struggling against all odds to fight  evils both great and subtle.  The Lord of the Rings is absolutely a must  for those who appreciate being both entertained and ennobled by something  as simple and inexpensive as a book; but here is a tome which has sold 50  million copies in over 25 languages worldwide. It delves into and explores  social issues as far-reaching now as when it was written decades ago. Thus,  it is partly because of Tolkien's effort, in the hearts of those who  appreciate it, that the fires of good in each of us have not gone out. Read  on!",2000-01-05

As  for the Tolkien critics, amateur and professional, it has always amazed me  to no end what some find offensive in his writing.

It has nothing to do with race, it just is. It can be  summed up as simply as this: Day = Good, Night = Evil. Tolkien emphasizes  this again and again in his work. Another argument is that it is a work  only for children and the immature. Lord, I hope not. If I weren't reading  it to my kids I'd be reading it again for myself.

The fire in the well-tended hearth at Bag End burns  all the more brightly because of the shadows of the Old Forest, and the  deep night of Moria, and the looming darkness of Barad-dur. There is more  hobbit than hero in almost all of us, but the essence of Tolkien's genius  is displayed when he reminds us that there is a hero hiding somewhere deep  within even the most timid hobbit.<br />Ultimately, the only real test of  literature is whether it lasts. And the works that last are those that  speak to the deepest fears, desires, hopes, and imaginative needs of the  reader. To the skeptic and cynic who dismisses Tolkien, no better reply can  be given than the hundreds of reviews below, that illustrate how this book  has meant more to countless readers than perhaps any other work of  imagination written in the last 50 years.

Indeed, the universally recognized construct of good vs. evil has been the  crown jewel of all stories since Genesis. Humanity itself is reflected in  this dynamic, and the drama unfolds in Tolkien's pages with a grace and  fury uncommon to the genre. His tale of the diminutive, peaceful Hobbits  placed against a frightening array of evil forces and corruption is one  that reaches deep, clenching your heart. It is compelling because of its  verisimilitude. We all wish for our heroes to be brave but to find valor in  such an unexpected place is lyrically pure beyond means. Call it 'fairy  tale' or what you will-- LOTR is a literary masterpiece, easily qualified  by its keen portrayal of endurance against adversity.<br />But it has many  other strengths. Consider that the civilizations, cultures, and history as  devised by Tolkien are the product of decades of careful research into  Anglo-Saxon and Gaelic myth. They seem real because they are drawn from a  felicitous past. Painstaking effort provided the invention of real  languages and alphabets for his Elves and Dwarfs. His erudition inspires  awe. By great leaps of his imagination, he gave Middle-Earth an authentic  backdrop of mythical deities, battles, natural wonders, and poetry.  &quot;I've always preferred history to fiction,&quot; Tolkien is quoted as  saying. Indeed, he has provided such a rich explication of this past that  the narrative takes on a substance unmatched in modern fantasy.<br />This  masterful portrait of high romance and adventure stands apart. The Lord of  the Rings has been voted &quot;Book of the Century&quot; by Britain's  largest reader survey (not once but TWICE). In the 60's &amp; early 70's  here in the United States it defined a generation. As C.S. Lewis once said  of his friend's work: &quot;Here are beauties which pierce like swords or  burn like cold iron.&quot;  A more fulfulling, deeply-layered work you  could not ask for.aid  of his friend's work: &quot;Here are beauties which pierce like swords or  burn like cold iron.&quot;  A more fulfulling, deeply-layered work you  could not ask for.",1999-11-24

Not a bestseller when it was first published, it slowly gathered a cult following which then grew into universal popularity. Millions of people have read  this series and I wanted to be one of those millions. I was told by other  readers how great this series is, a great story, etc. After reading  &quot;The Hobbit&quot; I attempted to read &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.<br />Earlier this year I read the first two books but I didn't finish the  third. To be honest, I found the first two books a bit of a trial as well.  To me the story was slow and meandering. I thought there was too much  singing, which lulled me. I found Sam pretty annoying too. I would hate to  have him following me around all the time. Everything seemed a bit sugar  sweet.<br />I will concede the story was written well and had some good  moments, like the flight from the Black Riders and the Balrog in the Mines  of Moria. But a lot of the story was just people travelling here and there  in a way that seemed repetitive: characters coming to yet another forest,  another mountain, another dark cavern. I felt a bit guilty that I wasn't  enjoying the story the way everyone else had. But I have heard of other  people who have similar feelings. The well-known fantasy and science  fiction writer Michael Moorcock described &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; as  &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; posing as an epic. People have described how  the defeat of Sauron is accomplished too easily.

Like at least one other reviewer, I first read LOTR as a  teenager.  I'm now 34 and, having read it about three times, I still  remember vividly the images painstakingly created from the choicest  language...the sparkling white towers of Minas Tirith...the darkness and  filth of Shelob's lair...the terror of the Riders' shadows and their  screams in the distance.  I remember the knot in my chest as the despair of  the defenders of Minas Tirith deepened before the onslaught of Mordor, and  then just as a glimmer of hope appears that they might weather the storm,  the armies of the south arriving to seal their doom.  And I, too, remember  fondly the final scene as the hobbit heroes return to their homes to sweep  them clean of the foul, cowardly band of rouges pretending to rule the  Shire.  How can one find words to describe the emotions called forth upon  witnessing the struggles of the small, pure, and weak against the big,  corrupt, and powerful?  How can one describe what it feels like to join  their journeys through the foggy swamps and glistening forests with no food  or plenty of food?  And how could I hope to describe the catch in the  throught when watching the horrific, pathetic inner struggle of the  ring-bearer and his steadfast companion?  Only Tolkien himself could summon  the paragraphs and pages to describe the experience of reading his  work.<br />Tolkien's work is a literary classic where many other epic works of  fantasy have just missed that mark (Shannara, for example) because there  is, for lack of a better way to describe it, not a hair out of place.  In  other fantasy epics I have read, circumstances seem just a bit contrived or  convenient, or of insufficient depth to fill the imagination (WHY the sword  glows blue).  Tolkien creates a legend with the weft of history, the  dignity of tradition, the gravity of time and age and blood and tears.

This is an amazing piece of literature that I would hope everyone who can read, will read. The prose and structure of this work are absolutely solid. Professor Tolkien was a very skilled author technically.  Yet there  is so much more here than technical perfection. There is the amazing world  that he builds for us with his words. The attention which is payed to the  landscape is awe inspiring. He truly envisions for us a real three  dimensional continent through his writing. The characters he introduces us  to are just as solid and true. From the quiet and philosophical Frodo and  the faithful and down to earth Samwise to the twisted and pitiful Gollum  these characters ring true.  The story is epic and it never falters once as  it winds it's way along the paths of middle earth.  What impressed  me the most during this reading was the incredible depth that Tolkien  instilled in all of his creations. Whether it was a wandering king biding  his time to claim his throne, a lush forest of gold and light, or song that  told of a beautiful  and bitter romance, it was solidly constructed and set  into place in the story. There is never a time in the tale that we are  asked to simply accept anything suddenly that is thrust on us, there are no  plot loopholes.  At the core of this epic tale is a very tough and  important message. Don't become enslaved by your comforts and your power  this story says. Don't hold so tightly to a thing that gives you joy that  you kill the object, the joy and yourself. Most cling to the past and the  memory of a pleasure that once was, but lives no more, out of fear of  stepping into the next moment where that joy may or may not exist.  &quot;The road goes ever on,&quot; sing Bilbo and Frodo.

Tolkien's work is not simply a series of books.  It is not merely a story.  It is a mythology.  Tolkien created a world all his own.  Not like some other authors have a &quot;world&quot; for their stories to take place  in, but a full and total world, complete with history and languages.  His  work is not so much a story as it is a glimpse, as through a window, into a  different universe.<br />Tolkien begins, in The Silmarillion, with the  creation of the world itself.  He tells the tale of the original powers of  the Earth, and how evil entered the world.  He covers the history of the  Elves, the Dwarves, and yes, even the Humans, from their first awakenings.  He continues this history through three ages of the world and the epic of  The Lord of the Rings.<br />In all, over four thousand years of history are  covered in amazing detail.  Not simply mentioned.  Not simply outlined on a  few pages of notes.  No, Tolkien is far better then that.  His is a  complete history, not simply a background to a story.  He starts with the  creation of the world, and ends, in effect, with the start of real-life  recorded history.  Tolkien's work expands to fill the sum-total span of  human comprehension.<br />With that in mind, you can begin to appreciate why  you cannot read Tolkien's work just once and expect to enjoy it.  Like our  own world, you need to study it, to examine it, to live in it for awhile,  before you truly start to feel just how rich and textured it is.  After two  or three reads, you will begin to see the pieces fit together into one,  large, complex *thing* that can only be called a world.<br />You need to  realize that fact to enjoy these books.  Tolkien does not let you off easy.  You have to work to take it all in, just as you have to study history to  understand the human race.  If you are unwilling to make that commitment,  do not bother reading it.  You will be bored to tears.  If you make the  effort, however, the reward is that of dreams themselves.<br />Too many people  miss the point of Tolkien's work.

The  omission is a mistake from an almost-unfailingly perceptive reader.  &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; belongs in the canon.  One need only read  the comments on this page to see that it is in the canon already.  It is a  great book for many reasons, but canonical and lasting for an emotion  evoked almost on every page: a rare and plaintive sadness.<br />It is an  uncanny sadness that Mr. Tolkien has expressed among a monumental adventure  story, touching the limits of lament for things past, lost beauty, and  grandeur that has failed.  Why we should feel sadness for the passing of an  imaginary world is odd. At the passing, the author dwells lovingly on  lengthy goodbyes to his beloved characters, as they themselves are saddened  at their many partings. The author is not subtle.  He builds up sadness  upon sadness even amid the greatest celebrations, and has his characters  pine for glories that were.  We finally reach a zenith of this strange  sadness when Mr. Tolkien has his drowsy Bilbo the Hobbit (who started it  all) utter the reprise of a poem given earlier in the book, but now  slightly changed, that is so simple and moving  that it can bring  tears.<br />&quot;The Road goes ever on and on ----- Out from the door where  it began. ----- Now far ahead the Road has gone, ----- Let others follow it  who can! ----- Let them a journey new begin, ----- But I at last with weary  feet ----- Will turn towards the lighted inn, ----- My evening-rest and  sleep to meet.&quot;<br />The book's sadness is not limited to the ending;  many characters are sad at heart from the very beginning.  The hero is  unusually stoic throughout, carrying a great and growing melancholy; the  Elven lords never cease mourning their Eden that is passing away; the Ents  are bereft of the wives they have lost and have been so for ages past; the  list goes on.  Perhaps the saddest character of all (who also reaches the  highest joy of any) is the King who has returned.  His lost years in the  wilderness, away from the love of his life, is akin to the sadness in Jane  Austen's &quot;Persuasion&quot;.  It is a love lost and thwarted through  the years and then refound.  But upon refinding each other, hero and  heroine are painfully aware of the Time they have lost.  They remember a  shining moment only as a longing.  This is not to say that there is not  also great joy and excitement.  The book gives the reader much  satisfaction.  Perhaps that is a clue to the nature of its canonical  greatness: satisfying sadness.<br />Mr. Tolkien went to heroic lengths to  show us characters aware of what they were losing and had already lost.

I've read Steinbeck, Hemingway, Joyce, Faulkner, Heller, Orwell, and none have given me the pleasure of Lord of  the Rings. It is as influential as any book that has ever been written, has  superlative writing, outstanding pace, etc. It can work on multiple levels:  great character development, gripping plot, deep symbolism; while most  books (Ulysses, 1984) have just one or two of those three elements, Lord of  the Rings have all. You can plop down on the couch and read them for fun,  or you can conduct extensive studies dealing with mythological symbols and  religious meanings. A 9-10 year old can read The Hobbit and love it, and a  50 year-old college PhD. can analyze it to no end. These books have the  univeral appeal necissary to stand the test of time. Will people still read  The Great Gatsby in a hundred years? Who knows. They WILL be reading Lord  of the Rings. I can't recommend these books enough.

For members of Generation X, I would like to recommend the book, even though it is not written in a contemporary style.<br />The Lord of the Rings initially caught on for reasons I can  only guess.  My theory:  The fears of a generation living in the nuclear age (One ring  = Raw Power Used irresponsibly-- The Bomb etc) were defeated symbolically  in a mythically based story, written by a man who would, were he alive  today, most likely be a member of the Green Party.  I read the Hobbit and  LOTR while in high school in the mid-70's, a few years after the great  Tolkein craze had settled down.  I have reread them frequently since then.<br />Here are the story's strengths:<br />A world you can picture because it is  so thoroughly and lovingly described.<br />A clean story.  No profanity.  No  sex.  Some romantic love a la Sir Walter Scott.  The battle and combat  scenes are full of energy, but not graphic/gory detail of spilled entrails  and vomiting blood.<br />Good versus evil, corruption of the greedy, tragic  loss of life.<br />Heroes you can identify with somewhat, i.e. the Hobbits.  Because they are the least powerful, through them the sense of danger is  vividly portrayed.<br />Magic that is not really explained, but that adds a  sense of wonder to the tale.<br />Here are weaknesses, when measuring LOTR  against contemporary fantasy:<br />Does not dig deeply into very many  characters' minds.  One of the advantages of the current fantasy offerings  at the quality end are the depth of characterization.<br />You only get to  know a few of the primary characters very well.<br />Too dependent on  Appendices for detail that explains the &quot;political&quot;  situation.<br />You never get enough detail on the Ring Wraiths or Sauron,  though they are certainly vivid in their personification of pure,  unadulterated evil.<br />Not PC as it was way pre-PC, like many other good  books.(See Huckleberry Finn.)<br />When all is said and done, many  contemporary fantasy writers have improved upon Tolkein's introduction of  heroic fantasy into fine novel form, or used the genre as a back drop for  what would otherwise be simple dramas, similar to what SF writers have  often done.<br />The best thing about this series, all four books, is that  you can share them with children.  Far too many current fantasy books in  the swords and sorcery genre are simply too graphic, albeit well written,  for consumption by young audiences.<br />For those who ascribe racist and  anti-woman complaints to JRR Tolkein, please remember that in the 1920's  through 1950's, when the work was going through various stages of  development, the cultural context that we currently accept was hardly the  normal outlook of a university educated Englishman.  And remember, _for  centuries_, Europeans had feared not Black/Negro invaders, but rather tan  Turk/Arab/Moorish moslem invaders who were a real &quot;threat&quot; to  Christendom--for centuries!!  This shared cultural perception made  portraying the Southrons and Orcs as swarthy/dark skinned made easy  identification of bad guys for a 1950's British audience, far better than  for our enlightened, and lately 'politically correct' _American_ cultural  world view.  And oh by the way, women had only had the vote for one  generation at the time of initial publication, and the feminist activism of  the 60's was yet to make deep changes to American, and lately European,  cultural norms.  Yet Prof Tolkein's Galadriel preceded Maggy Thatcher as a  strong female leader under pressure, in position of power if not in style,  and both Elrond and Aragorn descended from &quot;interracial&quot;  marriages.<br />So put the PC histrionics on the shelf for a few days, enjoy  a well told story of high fantasy, and share its positive aspects with your  friends and/ or children.  You will enjoy it, even if it does not turn you  into a foaming-at-the-mouth advocate like some of the reviewers below.ing-at-the-mouth advocate like some of the reviewers below.",1999-09-02

Some of the really great classical books (greek, roman,  medieval, i.e Shakespeare and so on) could so easily be laid to blame for  the same faults if one chooses that approach.<br />I find that Tolkiens way  of creating &quot;deep lore&quot;, in his own terms, out of the intricate  mechanics of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, however inappropriate  these terms may be, are astounding and make for fantastic reading on any  level.<br />To anyone who likes to read - do yourself a favour and read  Tolkien. For the older readers it might be interesting to start with The  Silmarillion which puts not only The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings in  perspective but actually Tolkiens whole perception of life and love.<br />I  hardly think that anyone could be &quot;hurt&quot; or become a racist or  sexist by reading Tolkiens books, a claim almost too ridiculous to contest.<br />I do, on the other hand, believe (and there are many millions who would  agree) that there's a very great chance that reading any work of Tolkien is  the start of a lifelong relationship to Tolkien and Middle-Earth.",1999-08-15

There are some things that are so bad it makes you wonder how  they got famous. This is one of those. I am absolutely baffled as to why  this is considered to be one of the greatest books ever written. The  problems are numerous.  Firstly, it is just downright boring. While there  are some wondrous, masterful parts of the story, they are few and far  between. For every battle with Shelob, the Balrog, or the Nazgul, there are  literally a hundred pages of nothing. I swear, parts of the story seem  like: THEY TRAVELED TO THE INN AT BORONOR, THEN WALKED ON FOOT THROUGH THE  MOUNTAINS, THEN RODE HORSES ALONG THE RIVERSIDE, THEN SLEPT IN THE ELVEN  CAMP, THEN VISITED GENERIC KING #12. Now imagine that I'd taken 300 pages  to tell you that. In THE HOBBIT, a similar story was told. The difference  is that in each chapter the characters found something new and wonderful.  Here they just find a new road to trundle down.  Secondly, the characters  are robots. Some are great, and do in fact deserve to outlive the series.  Legolas and Tom Bombadil are both interesting, and entertaining. Gollum,  one of my favorite characters from any book, is funny and sad and  disgusting all at once. However these are the acceptions that prove the  rule.  Also, their seems to be no heart in the story. The characters and  the events don't seem to matter; their just pieces of a huge, boring  puzzle. The sub title of the book is THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH, and  that's what it reads like. A history book. Just names, places and dates,  but no real feeling. In fact, the story doesn't even give us the full  story. The real end is tucked away into a corner of one of the many  appendices. The idea that the story ends in a minor footnote and not the  text is sickening.  Perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps I overlook the impact that  was actually made by the book at the time.

Then, towards the end, it suddenly changes to a mythical style - lots of Lo!'s, and 'he beheld's. It seems almost as though Tolkien couldn't make his mind up about what sort of story he was writing.<br />Please, though, don't think I'm slagging it off.

The words of praise would sound like most of the other reviews here, though a bit less gushy, perhaps. ;-)  Though the book does drag in places, and Tolkien's dialogue is a bit awkward at times, the tale of Frodo and Sam made this book memorable the first time I read it at age 11 -- many years ago -- and was what compelled me to keep reading.<br />  That being said, let me address what I consider a weakness (gasp!) in Tolkien's work:  his view of &quot;Elvishness&quot; as superior to this flawed and &quot;fallen&quot; world.  It is this worldview, I have concluded, which underlies the way he chose to end the book.<br />  No, I won't give it away!  Suffice to say that I did NOT like the ending the first time I read it, and numerous rereadings and indepth analysis from an adult, philosophical perspective have only reinforced my disagreement with Frodo's choice at the end of the book.<br />  I have been told by other Tolkien fans that this was a wonderful and blessed and beautiful ending, far better than if Frodo had not chosen what he did.  Bullroar.  This world, for all its flaws, is holy, not &quot;fallen,&quot; and I firmly believe that we don't need to seek Elvish perfection &quot;somewhere else&quot; to find blessedness, even when we are deeply wounded (which includes most of the human race at some point in our lifetimes).  So ultimately, my criticism of Tolkien is a fundamental ideological disagreement.<br />  None of this should be taken to detract from the fact that Tolkien wrote a compelling and moving story.  My advice, though, is to read it and THINK about what you are reading, not just mindlessly imbibe it as Unquestionable Wisdom.<br />  Come to think of it, that's good advice for anything you read -- including this Humble Review.",1998-04-26

I can see through the books more now than when I was a boy, but I love them no less.  Tolkien's Christian faith, his heavy reliance on Norse and Anglo-Saxon mythology and his sometimes stilted language, are perhaps more apparent to me now than when I first encountered them, but in the end, it is the story telling that drives the books, not the intellectual undercurrents, and it is the simple power of Frodo's tale that still makes me smile and shiver and turn the next page.

Having said that I must confess Tolken does a marvolous job of dragging things out and putting in stuff that just seemed unnessicary to me.<br /><br />It also did not seem very well written when compared to some other books I have read. However I must give Tolken credit for the fantastic amount of thought and detail that he put into this book, he was truly gifted with creativity but not at putting that creativity into words.  That is not to say that I could have done better, goodness no, I am very bad at putting ideas to words but I have read books by people who are and it makes a real diffrence.<br /><br />In conclusion I would recommend this book only if you are dying to know the whole original story and you don't mind spending alot of time reading and wondering what the heck was the point of that?

They told me I should get a refund and then re-order the book, then re-download it. I did. I got the exact same file with the wrong author listed.<br /><br />Kindle support ultimately concluded that the Kindle document provided by the publisher had the errors, so there was nothing Amazon could do about it. They suggested I write a review on the product page; so here I am. I encouraged them to contact the publisher, and they said they would try but seemed to be working to figure out how to go about doing that.

But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.<br /><br />\\""The Two Towers\\"" begins directly after \\""Fellowship,\\"" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.<br /><br />\\""Return of the King\\"" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br /><br />\\""Lord of the Rings\\"" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br /><br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue can range from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary -- readers with short attention spans won't be able to handle this story. If they can handle sprawling, epic tales, then probably they can.<br /><br />Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\""Lord of the Rings\\"" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature.
