Mitchell takes us from the days prior to the war breaking out, where gallantry , beautiful gowns, music and graciousness abounded to the absolute hell of war.

It takes years to read them all. But when I recently bought and read Gone With the Wind, I realized with a shock that Gone With the Wind could replace those book for a reader with limited time to understand the WBTS. Margaret Mitchell did an inspired job of research and telling the story of the horrors visited upon the South by the North when the South wanted their independence from the North.<br /><br />There are many excellent books about this tragedy, this Great Lost Cause, the War Between the States. I have spent much time and more than $1,400 on such books, but  Gone With the Wind, a fiction novel, quickly gives the tone and tragedy of the War. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a starting point for learning about the War.

This book is by the author Margaret Mitchell. This story is about an independent teenage girl named Scarlett O'Hara who lives in Georgia before the Civil War. She is in love with a boy named Ashley, and plans to be with him but he is arranged to be married with another girl, so Scarlett makes a big plan to make him hers, but before she can do it the Civil War breaks out and complicates everything for her. The front and back cover made me want to read it. If you are a person who loves adventure, suspense, and romance, then you should definitely read this book. This book is targeted for people between the ages of 15 and 70.<br /><br />The good thing about this book is that it has a plot that seems at some points seem irrelevant but are actually very important to the outcome of the resolution. If the book had even more conflicts then it would be even better because the conflicts make the story nail biting like this excerpt from the book. &#34;Somebody hollerin',&#34; said Porky uneasily. &#34;The Yankees are coming! I saw them! Down the road! The Yankees ---,&#34; Another thing I like about the book is that it has Scarlett, the main character, is a perfect mix of flare and emotions like this excerpt from the book. &#34;I don't want your advice,&#34; yelled Scarlett. I think this book has anything that I didn't like but if there were it would probably be the way there are many characters, but it sort of makes the story better, but for me it gets me confused sometimes like in this excerpt of the book. &#34;Well push Randa off you, Betsy, and hush. Now listen to me Gerald O'Hara.&#34; My overall opinion off the book is that I liked it very much. I think I like it so much because it contains a plot and setting that takes place in many different locations, it's not just stationary. So again, I think you should read this book because it contains vivid vocabulary, has triumphs and downfalls that make the story better, andhas takes advantage of the readers' sense of adventure, and after watch the movie.",2014-02-18

Scarlett is complex in her own mind, tormented about what she wants vs what's right to do, while she fights to survive during and after the Civil War.  She is selfish and aware of it.  Adding to the complexity of Scarlett, is her kindness that she affords others despite her selfish desire.  While she is the daughter of a slave holder, she remains loyal to caring for her former slaves after the war and has a developed relationship with Mammy.  Unfortunately, the social thread of America, and much of the world from Bible days going forward, thought nothing wrong of owning slaves.  However, that social paradigm shifts as the story continues.  Scarlett might be from a wealthy family, but she is still a female that bucks societal trends and owns and operates business.  On occasion she is outright ruthless with men.  In the end of the book she is \\""punished\\"" for her misdeeds.  However, her husband is not.      It surprises me that many people compare GWTW to Birth of a Nation.  The problem is we are viewing GWTW as if it can be held to today's value system.  It does not.  It cannot.  It's not a book about human unity or human dignity.  It's a book about surviving crisis and how some American's got through a war that killed 12% of the US population.  In the 1920s and 30s the KKK was very strong in the South and perpetuated stories about black attacks on whites and many political groups argued that blacks were not fit for society.  Using genteel approaches GWTW presents strong women who helped the south survive the war, it also showed blacks as \\""southerners\\"" and caring people (Scarlett's life is saved at least twice by a black character in the book), it also suggests that war is not a wise solution.   Scarlett gets away with voicing unpopular opinions \\""war is a waste of time\\"", \\""the south should just free the slaves\\"", \\""why should women always stay quiet around men?\\"" because she's portrayed as an anti-hero.  If she were a do-gooder she might come off differently.  Pretend she had Melanie's \\""kind nature\\"" combined with her practical and self serving criticism of \\""states rights, sexism, & war\\"", she would be seen by many readers in the 1930s as almost being an abolitionist sympathizer.  The book would have failed at that point in delivering it's message about survival.  The message would be lost.  Furthermore, it wouldn't express what many southerners already felt, a kinship and love of the land.  When you read the last paragraph of the book you get a picture of what prevails in the south, the love of the earth, southern life, quiet country evenings and the simple relationship of Scarlett and Mammy (the only person she has left: her father and mother died, her friend Melanie died, daughter died and her husband left).  Scarlett also realizes too late that she is in love with Rhett and losses him, just as the South realized too late that \\""states rights\\"" cost them what they loved the most.",2011-08-26

But as a child of Barbadians, my ancestors had been free for roughly 30 years by the time the story begins, and as subjects of the British Crown, had the option of attending British Universities, whereas America was on the verge of its most catastrophic war, in which slavery was a major issue, and Jim Crow laws would succeed slavery, I can and did read this novel with a little more detachment than most African Americans could.<br /> It took me 17 days to complete it, my eyes flowing faciley over the pages of the Avon Book rendition.<br /> Margaret Mitchell introduces her heroine, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, a willful green-eyed beauty of Franco-Irish descent, on an April day in 1861, where the 16-year-old is entertaining two suitors, the Tarleton Twins, on the front porch of her family's Georgia plantation, Tara.<br /> The lanky handsome red-haired Tarleton Twins, Stuart, and Brent, had been expelled from college,but were planning to join the Confederate Army, and they begin to aggravate their coquettish young hostess with their frequent talk of war. Scarlett threatens to go inside and lock herself away if they fail to change the topic of conversation, and is obliged. In due time, of course,  the young Southern Belle would have to shed her preconceived notions about war  as a gender-segregated issue, and accept it as everyone's business, regardless of gender.<br /> In the meantime, the topic turns to the upcoming barbecue at the neighboring Wilkes plantation, Twelve Oaks, where the handsome, blond Ashley Wilkes, whom Scarlet desires above all others, resides with his widowered father, John, and sisters, India and Honey. She learns Ashley will marry his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, who is sweet, delicate, and of a milder mold than she, who despises her.<br /> Literally turning into something of a green-eyed monster, Scarlett schemes to steal Ashley from Melanie--a central plot in the story.<br /> Her firey Irish father, Gerald, discourages her pursuit of Ashley, knowing such a union would be an unhappy one. Like most of the men closest to Scarlett, he had her best interest at heart.<br /> Her mother, Ellen Robillard O'Hara, from a notable French family from Savannah, tends to  the plantation, nursing the sick, settling the accounts of the estate, and spending ample time delivering and baptizing the out-of-wedlock children of the impoverished Emmie Slattery, who are fathered by the O'Hara's Yankee overseer, Jonas Wikerson.Although better educated that the lowly Slatteries, his profession bars him from association with Georgia's upper echelon. So he turns to the lowly Slattereys for companionship.Ellen asks her husband to fire Wilkerson for his immorality, but Gerald refuses.Ellen appears too busy to really notice her oldest daughter's intrigues.<br /> The evening ritual of family prayers provides some temporary solace for Scarlett, who has quarreled with  younger sisters Careen (baptized Caroline Irene) and Sue Ellen(baptized Susan Elinor). Servants Mammy, Pork, Dilcey, and Prissy stand guard as Ellen leads the family in Roman Catholic breviaries.<br /> Mammy knows Scarlett best, and calls her out as her charges prepares to attend the barbecue, but Scarlett has ways of manipulating Mammy to get her way.<br /> At the barbecue, Scarlett shines. In due time, it is revealed that all the men who will play a pivotal role in her life are there. She gathers her suitors under a tree, flushed and flirtatious.<br /> In the meantime, a mysterious man from Charleston with a murky reputation has his eye on the raven-haired beauty. As Scarlett is winning men's hearts, this man, Rhett Butler, earns the ire of the same men by givingthem a realistic account of their chances of defeating the Yankees, as he has visited Northern factories, and areas of that region many of John Wilkes' guests had not.Gradually, it will be seen that Rhett Butler is right, and most of the men quarreling with him are dead.<br /> Slipping away from the rooms where the young ladies are napping,  Scarlett confronts Ashley in the library to reveal her feelings, and is gently rebuffed. In a tearful rage, she slaps the man she claims to love and throws a  china bowl decorated with roses, smashing it, and startling Rhett, who had been sleeping on the couch, initially out of her sight. Her response to his remarks about her behavior reveal her to be unsure of her own mind where Ashley is concerned.<br /> Amid Scarlett's dealing with the hurtful sniping of other young ladies,  the word gets out that recruits are called for and all eligible men, including Ashley, rush off to enlist.<br /> A moment of desperate jealousy towards Ashley and Melanie leads Scarlett into an ill-conceived union with  Melanie's brother, Charles--the day before Ashley and Melanie's marriage--. Charles dies of illness while at war, leaving Scarlett widowed and pregnant with their son, Wade, with whom, like many parents in wartime, Scarlett will have difficulty bonding.<br /> During a visit with her Aunt Pittypat, the widow scandalizes Atlanta by dancing with blockade runner Rhett at a ball benefitting the troops, while clad in widow's weeds.<br /> The story follows the young beauty through nursing soldiers with Dr. Meade and a pregnant Melanie, her frustration with Prissy during Melanie's labor(Prissy's simplemindedness was most likely a ruse as it was for most slaves), and her  perilous flight  back to Tara from Atlanta despite bad weather and battles, during which Rhett journeys with her only part of the way before rushing off to enlist.<br /> With Melanie, Wade, Prissy and newborn Beau in tow, she returns to find Tara still standing, unlike Twelve Oaks, although blighted by soldier's lootings, Mammy, Pork, and Dilcey about the only remaining servants, her sisters ailing, her father non compos mentos, and her mother dead of typhoid fever contracted from nursing Emmie Slattery.<br /> Finding only rotten produce to eat, she vows to rebuild her life by any means necessary, and as the saying goes, \\""There is nothing angrier than an educated Southern lady.\\""<br /> Using all her cunning, education,and inner strength unleashed by harsh circumstances, she acheives her goal at the expense of many friendships, marrying twice more, bearing daughters Ella(by Frank Kennedy, the \\""old maid in britches\\"" she steals from sister, Sue Ellen when she realizes his business can help pay the taxes on Tara) and Bonnie(by Rhett) along the way--the last of whose strong will matches her mother's, leading to grave consequences.<br /> In a very poignant ending, Scarlett does come to appreciate how much Melanie really means to her, seeing how her kindness and fortitude complemented and buttressed her own grit and determination, and she finally sees Ashley as a hopeless and perpetual dreamer in view of her  own willingness to face and deal with life's realities head-on.<br /> Intriguing characters include the amputee soldier, Will Benteen,and the crude Hillbilly, Archie, whose history proves the practice of Honor Death was not confined to Mid-Eastern culture. Both show how the war brought disparate social groups together, as does Madame Belle Watling.<br /> The political incorrectness, mysogyny, and racism may ruffle a few feathers. But it is appreciated that these people were products of their time, although impressively, Scarlett's mother forbade her to use the \\""N\\"" word.<br /> Still, this story is an American epic that reflects the resilience of a human spirit that never conceded defeat.<br /> I recall that during a televised airing of the film version of this epic in the early 1980s, the announcer referred to Scarlett as \\""The Jewel of Tara\\"", and indeed, in facing life's great calamities, she does prove to be \\""Diamond hard\\"".",2011-04-12

The novel has undergone much criticism, for black dialect (which we studied, along with other dialects in History of the English Language), for rosy portrayals of slavery, and for being a forbidden romance that happens to have the Civil War as its background.     \\""Gone With the Wind,\\"" is more than a novel; it is an experience. Scarlett O'Hara is devout with faith---in herself, and is a survivor. The true tragedy of the book is that she is blinded by her ignorance into ignoring true love when it was present, and longing after an idealized love with a married friend.  The book is lush with descriptions of the period, and very accurate in its detail.  Scarlett is externally strong, with fragile emotions, while her foil Melanie Hamilton Wilkes is internally strong, with character and devotion that run deep.  Ashley Wilkes is rather pathetic in that he never has the integrity to admit a lust for his childhood friend Scarlett but not romantic love, while Rhett, in many ways like Scarlett, and older and wiser, loves her for who she really is, not the face that society of the time demands she show in public. The story is mostly about character development in the face of tragedy, and shows three survivors with one \\""displaced person,\\"" forever malcontent in the new world that the War has created, out of place, sad, and futile.      A word about the slavery element:  slavery was NOT a good thing.  Not all slaves were named after their owners or treated as trusted members of the family or confidantes.  Aside from Rhett, Mammy is the only person who knows Scarlett, what she is capable of, and chastises her for her lack of morals or values.  I feel her character is critiqued based upon her speech patterns, not her actual actions.  With the exception of Prissy, none of the African-Americans appear to be ridiculed or used for comic effect, nor do stereotypes surface.  Pork, Dilcey, Mammy, and Prissy are fortunate that the emotional ties they shared with the O'Haras continued so much that they remain as paid staff after being freed. Cruelty from others is also depicted, usually in the form of Northerners who didn't understand the way of life.     What remains is a tale of what happens when one's way of life and world are turned upside down, and how the principal character handles it, and relates with the others, failing at times to recognize the quality of friendship from her sister-in-law Melanie and the weakness of Ashley Wilkes.  I quite wonder if Mittie Bulloch Roosevelt felt this way, when the enchanting Clayton County belle (from whom some of Scarlett's physical traits seem drawn) moved to New York State with new husband Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.      While not all elements of the novel are positive, GWTW is a snapshot album of life during the Civil War and Reconstruction.",2011-02-10

But when she learns the man she had been psuedo-courting, Ashley Wilkes, is marrying Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta, his cousin, she schemes to win him back.  When he refuses, she immediately marries Charles Hamilton in spite.  But Civil War has come to the South, and Scarlett quickly finds herself a widow, stuck in Atlanta, with a child, unable to be the pretty belle she had been a few months prior.  Will Scarlett ever get Ashley?  What about the strange Rhett Butler character, who is constantly tweaking her?  Will Scarlett and her family survive the war?<br />Let me preface my review with this: I don't read a lot of historical fiction or chick lit or romance or anything.  My speciality is science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy.  However, this book absolutely, positively blew me away!<br />At first, I found the novel a bit slow.  There were so many characters, and at first, it seemed like nothing happened.  But that wasn't to last.  Quickly, I became interested in Scarlett's schemes to snatch Ashley away from Melanie, all the while hating her for her bad behavior.  By the end of the book, there were points were I was in near tears.<br />Scarlett wasn't my favorite character.  She was a rude, bitter, selfish woman.  But I completely understood her predicament.  To the reader, she was completely honest, despising her first husband's death (and life!), her dislike of children (don't see that much in romance do we!), her dislike of women's poor station (always having to act \\""silly\\"" in front of the menfolk), and taking the reigns of business to make a life of her own.  So while I didn't like her, I also didn't hate her.  I understood what she was trying to do and found myself rooting for her against the odds.  She is a brilliantly written character, so dynamic, multifaceted and full.<br />Melanie Hamilton was probably my favorite character.  This might seem odd as she does come off as a Mary Sue--perfect and sweet to everyone, always right, yada, yada--and I hate Mary Sues.  But I really never found Melanie a Mary Sue.  Scarlett repeatedly downplays Melanie's beauty.  Melanie is strong-willed and works diligently, but tires easily (such as when she works at Tara in the cotton fields).  Like Scarlett, Melanie was definitely not a 1-D character.  She appeared weak on the outside, while maintaining strenght in the face of danger, in the face of childbirth, in the face of hard times.  She was a true inspiration to me.<br />Rhett Butler made me so furious, sometimes I wanted to slap him like Scarlett!  But other times, he was so charming and debonair, that I wanted to melt in his arms like butter.  I loved how forthright he was, how practical and realistic he was, and yet how at times, his passionate nature came through (joining the Confederate army at the end, for example).<br />Side characters, such as Miss Pittypat, Mammy, Dilcey, Pork, Uncle Peter, Mrs. Meade, Belle Watling, and more, jumped out at me.  They felt like real people, people influenced by dreams, desires, and feelings.  Probably one of the sweetest moments was when Dr. and Mrs. Meade were talking and she mentioned she would rather him be at Belle's than dead.  Given what Mrs. Meade had been through, what she held dear, it was particularly poignant.<br />I could go on endlessly about the amazing life lessons and themes and symbols in the book.  Quotes about the status of women at the time, about changing with the changing times, about strength of character, about being who you are, and about what is really important in life abound in this book.  Most of the ones that really touched me may be found on my profile page, though the whole book is brimming with it.<br />As this deals with the South during the Civil War,there is much talk of slavery; one of the reasons, I believe, it has been so frequently placed on the Banned Books list.  Some people believe that it shows slavery in a favorable light, that blacks were/are children that need to be tended by whites.  My opinion is this: it shows how many white Southern plantation owners viewed slaves.  Not all slave owners were Mr. Simon Legree of Uncle Tom's Cabin.  Conversely, not all slave owners are like the O'Hara's.  Yes, there are a lot of black stereotypes (Mammy, Prissy, etc.), but this is a snapshot into the past.  You can't take this book and try to force modern views of civil rights and racism into it.  However, I do believe it makes a brilliant discussion piece: comparing Scarlett and other Southern whites' views of blacks with other accounts (such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).<br />All in all, this is a brilliant book, made more excellent by the narrator, who deftly interprets the Southern dialect and accents for the listener.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and was heart-broken, but inspired, when it ended.

It narrates the personal struggle of our not always likable but always resilient and resourceful heroine Scarlett O'Hara, and her relationship with the cynical and worldly Rhett Butler. It is also a sweeping saga of the people of the American South (mostly two locales in Georgia: Tara Plantation and Atlanta), spanning from antebellum to Civil War to the Reconstruction. Michell's writing is superb; it is full of details and nuances to the southern life, especial life in the plantations and life in Atlanta. The personalities of the characters are consistent and believable. Even descriptions of minor events and characters are vivid, such as the conversion between Gerald O'Hara and Mrs. Tarleton and her daughters on the way to the barbecue, from the chorus of the girls' shrieking and arguing you really get a rich and lively picture of antebellum Southern life. Of course, we shouldn't confuse the author's nostalgic and overly-romanticized view of Southern plantation life with reality, but this is a fiction, not a historical study. I find it hard to fault the author for painting a picture from the perspective that she chose (that is, a white plantation owner's perspective), just like you cannot criticize a painting of peaceful rural scenery for not exposing the garbage dump and outer house.<br /><br />But the book is not without flaws, and I see two major ones:<br /><br />1. Racism. I don't think anyone can really defend the author for this. It is one thing that her characters say and think in racist terms, but she also expressed such opinions numerous times in the narrator's voice. Some defend her by saying that it is because of the time (1920s-1930s) that Michell wrote this book; that may be true, but it does not exempt her from such criticism. I would rather say it is a \\""flaw of her time\\"" than \\""not a flaw because of her time\\"".<br /><br />2. The reconstruction part (Part Four) of the book is a little dragging. Some tangential characters such as Will Benteen and Archie introduced in this part are an awkward fit to the storyline and they certainly do not add much to the central plot (not surprisingly, they were completely eliminated in the movie). In this period Butler's role also became more shadowy, except at the end when he rescued the men from their ill-fated Shantytown revenge. I get a sense that Mitchell was really critical of the reconstruction and she was just drawing this out to give herself more room to air her criticism.<br /><br />Nevertheless, even with these flaws, it is really an exquisitely crafted piece of work. It will always have its place in the Alta of American literature.characters such as Will Benteen and Archie introduced in this part are an awkward fit to the storyline and they certainly do not add much to the central plot (not surprisingly, they were completely eliminated in the movie).

Still, there's no guarantee of happiness ...","This is the classic tale of wanting what you can't have ... until you can. Romance aside, this book is chock full of history, drama, suspense, emotional turmoil and philosophical whimsy. It's peppered with a dry, cynical wittiness that will keep you, not only turning pages, but smiling, laughing, and even occasionally gasping incredulously. Especially whenever the irresistible Rhett Butler enters a scene.     The dialogue is simply smashing. The characters are realistic and resonate on a soul deep level. This is something that the movie version was, understandably, unable to pull off. Scarlett came across as a one dimensional, selfish, cold hearted monster on the big screen. In the book, however, we have behind the scenes access to her mind, heart, will and emotions. When this story is appreciated in literary form, one finds it difficult to either love or hate her entirely because, just as in reality, there are too many shades of gray.    I have seen some people label this book as racist and intolerant. While I agree that there are some rather uncomfortable themes and an indisputable usage of inappropriate language, readers must bear in mind that this is a work of fiction depicting the culture and mind sets of characters living during the Civil War period. If the story had been written in any other way, it would have detracted from the authenticity of the tale. That being said, if you are sensitive to such things, you should probably steer clear.           As far as I am concerned, this is a must read for any fan of historical fiction. Yet, I must warn you; Don't expect a happy or conclusive ending lest you be disappointed. After reading  Forever Amber and many Anita Shreve books, I am always emotionally prepared for such a let down. Still, that didn't stop me from turning the last page of Gone With The Wind, anxiously looking for more. I was breathless with wonder, racked with unanswered questions, passionately angry at fate and, of course, torn between love and hate.

Mitchell once said that Scarlett was a hussy, so I guess she was, but I never saw her that way.

This should have been given to Flo Gibson--someone with the vocal and acting chops to really do justice to both the narative and character portrayal.   Just because someone can act well, it doesn't necessarily follow that she will be a great reader.  This actor does, in all justice a fairly good job with Scarlett.  However, her pacing and phrasing during the narrative portions was mediocre at best and GWTW has a lot of narrative.  Secondary characters are not treated with much differentiation of vocal dynamics, expression or seemingly thought about character.  The phrasing was particularly poor and down right irritating at times.  It sounded as if this reader gave no preparation to some passages and sat down with the book to read aloud passages that she was seeing for the first time.

I would recommend this book to anyone, although girls seem to enjoy it more as it is told by Scarlett's point of view. Scarlett is the girl you love to hate. She is so endearing and strong but so young and naive that you want to hit her and shelter her at the same time. Rhett is a man's man and women across the world want to have him. He exudes all that is strong and masculine while being head over heels in love with Scarlett and their baby girl. Ashley is a pity case as he is torn and used. Melanie is a personal favorite of mine, like a pet kitten. She is fierce and strong with claws of steel but purrs and mews with the innocence and undying love of a newborn baby kitten.

Set against the breath-taking backdrop of the red hills of Georgia during the American Civil War, Gone With the Wind is a window into a society that was swept away by war. Although I must say I doubt the portrayal of slavery is authentic in this work, every other aspect must be accurate. I have read some background information on Mitchell and, to my knowledge, she spent a significant amount of time researching every detail of her story--even down to the time of day that the list of deaths from the Battle of Gettysburg arrived in Atlanta.    As a Southerner, I am proud of Mitchell's success and her novel. I would have to say that this is my favorite novel of all time--a great epic about the South and its storied past.    However, as vast as the setting may be, it's easy to forget that there are two different plots going on: that of Georgia, and the South, during the Civil War, and that of Scarlett O'Hara and her struggle of hunger, poverty, love, and much more. The timing that Margaret Mitchell used in her novel (i.e. the death of Melanie, thus setting Ashley free; but at the same time realizing she, Scarlett, loved Rhett all along.) is amazing. However, the last part, Part V, moves a bit fast. But I suppose you can't dwell on 12 years worth of dialogue and narrative...    I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a historical novel.

I expected a shallow romance novel, much like the movie it spawned, complete with the longing stares and the yearning desires of a woman who has been spited by circumstance.  I could not have been more surprised to find so much more.     What I found was a novel that is surprisingly layered.  The outermost layer, of course, is the romantic narrative many will recognize, but beneath this superficial casting resides a deeper narrative about the tragic hubris, resulting fall, and struggle to reemerge by a small class of Southern aristocrats.  As this historical narrative unfolds, additional layers advance and recede in waves, each ushered in with insightful dialogue and commentary by the book's fascinating characters.      At the base of their hubris, for example, is layered an adolescent confidence in the invincibility of King Cotton and the superiority of the antebellum order, which one character ridicules and one character fears will prove all too true.  Surrounding their fall, their economic and political naivety retreats before scarcity, Sherman, and a struggle to survive, all of which is replaced by a remarkable perseverance that is more a testament to the antebellum order than anything before the war.  As their struggle plays out in the treacherous climate of Reconstruction, it eventually turns into a modest triumph capped by tragedy and accompanied by ominous undertones of the segregated order to come.      Other layers abound and while each is fascinating in its own right, together they are interwoven to present an even more fascinating and coherent telling of the most tumultuous period in American history.

Written in the early 20th century by an author who grew up hearing stories about the Civil War and Reconstruction, it recreates that era far more successfully than any modern-day writer could. I've lived most of my life within a half-day's drive of Atlanta, but had never heard the South's perspective in the Civil War laid out as it is here. Some have complained that the book is racist, but to me, that's part of the point. This is no whitewashed, modern-day version of what Southerners thought in the 1860s; instead, it's a priceless and sometimes surprising reproduction of what they really thought and how that culture (very different from today's South!) operated.<br /><br />Aside from the beautiful portrayals of the people, places and events of the time period, there's some good action--those turned off by long books will be surprised at how readable this one is. The main characters, like them or hate them, are well-developed. And, yes, they have love lives.

This novel exemplifies the Lost Cause movement, which showed the Confederacy as noble but outnumbered, and slavery as a benign and paternal institution.  It is worth reading for the story, but I shudder to think that some may take what it states as fact.  I am not saying that the book should be banned or censored, but it is certainly difficult to read the numerous descriptions of freedmen as lazy and the countless explanations that slaves were just so dumb that they needed the care of white people.    Also, Scarlett O'Hara is a terribly unlikeable character.  Whether she is stealing her sister's boyfriend or daydreaming about murdering her only true friend, Ashley, her actions and thoughts will just appall you.

As I said, I don't know what I can add that others haven't already said...but I have often thought, as I have read and re-read this wonderful novel, that I don't think Scarlett would get Rhett back in the end.  I always thought Rhett was far more intelligent, well-rounded, and wise than she, and that an awful lot of his longing for her was comprised of her lack of availability (her heart, that is, that heart that belonged only to Ashley), and her looks.  After all, when did he fall for her?  When he looked up at her on the staircase and she was wearing that low-cut green-sprigged dress!<br /><br />The fascinating characters that Mitchell so deftly brings to life are what make this novel so unforgettable.  I don't know that any of them are truly believable, but somehow that doesn't matter.  The writing style is dated (all those exclamation points!), and of course the dialect and political viewpoints are atrocious in this day and age.  The amazing thing is that none of this matters as we find ourselves caught up in Scarlett's world, a world, as Mitchell so poignantly writes,that was gone with the wind.<br /><br />When Rhett tells Scarlett at the end, \\""I won't be pursued as the luckless Ashley was pursued,\\""  I believe he meant it.  The fact that he could coin a phrase like, \\""Someone or something has convinced you that your lover is too large a piece of Dead Sea fruit for even you to chew\\"" (not sure if I'm quoting this 100% correctly, but I've memorized large portions of the dialogue through re-reading) simply showcases how much more extensive his intellect is than Scarlett's.  He realizes now that she no longer holds any appeal for him;  her charm for him, simply, was her unattainable-ness. (not a word, either - sorry!)<br /><br />I never read the sequel.  To me, that would be a sacrilege.  Mitchell always said that for her, the novel ended when it ended.

It is the story of the South right before the Civil War, during the war, and the aftermath when Reconstruction began in the South.  It is filled with drama, romance, tragedy, real characters with flaws, and I can see why this book won a Pulitzer Prize and why it continues to be a very popular book decades after it was first published in 1936.<br /><br />I don't need to go into a synopsis of the book, if anyone hasn't heard of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, I'd be very surprised. If you have only seen the wonderful movie adaptation of the book, but have never read the book, I highly recommend you read the book.  The movie doesn't capture the essence of the characters, the entirety of their personalities and motives behind certain actions and behaviors.<br /><br />I was captivated from the very first page.  I can't describe exactly how or why, but Mitchell wrote in such a way that pulls you into the story.  Her writing is simple and straightforward, and it touches you in a way that helps you relate to the characters and the world she wrote about.  Her writing resonates with you, and keeps you reading.  Her writing of the scenery and backdrop of the South, her depictions of the various characters, their motives, their thoughts, their innermost secrets that make them who they are.  Mitchell brought this time period to life and causes you, the reader, to empathize with the characters and the struggles and upheaval they go through.<br /><br />Even though I know this story, how it unfolds and how it concludes, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough until I reached the very end.  Scarlett O'Hara isn't the most sympathetic character you'll encounter, but as I gradually read her story, I found myself liking this character and rooting for her happily ever after, although you know she doesn't get that HEA in the end.  I actually found the ending appropriate, it fits in with Scarlett's personality of a person who won't quit no matter what.  She has seen the worst in life, and she remains stubborn in defeat that she can win back Rhett's love.<br /><br />Scarlett was a very selfish, manipulative, and cruel young woman, the only person she cared about was herself (with the exception of her mother, Ellen O'Hara, who she revered and respected and was the only woman she trusted).  She was a simple person, not easily able to understand more serious and complex issues, which she usually shrugged off in a careless fashion as insignificant and unworthy of her time.  She presented a facade of a lady of gentility to the world, all the while seething secretly inside at what she perceived as injustices against her or the unfairness of life if she didn't get her way.  She was also willfully stubborn in her unrequited love for childhood friend, Ashley Wilkes, and it was quite sad to see her pine for a man who rejected her even though he did love her but was too cowardly to do anything about it.<br /><br />Despite her numerous character flaws, Scarlett had some admirable traits, such as her perseverance and flinty determination to survive.  There were so many times where she was numb with weariness and feeling desolate at the heavy burden on her shoulders, but she would always put off her morose thoughts and say, \\""I will think about it later\\"", and mentally force herself to take it one step at a time in order to stay sane and calm in a chaotic world.  This was in contrast to her weak sisters who couldn't seem to comprehend that their old lifestyle had vanished forever and that a change was needed within themselves in order to survive.  Scarlett, with her unladylike blunt honesty and very practical nature realizes this almost immediately.  She was so unlike her tender and kind mother, Ellen, in almost every way except in one.  Like her mother before her, she became the mistress of Tara, and in her newfound role she fills her mother's shoes in becoming what her family needed.  Someone to look up to and lean upon for aid when needed.<br /><br />I found Scarlett a contradiction of sorts.  She would look upon in contempt or disgust at  those who depended on her, yet she would cast such thoughts aside in order to fulfill her duty to them as she couldn't abandon them.  For her family because they *were* family and an O'Hara always helped family, and for Melanie, Ashley's wife, because of a promise.  On the one hand she was a strong woman, strong in that she was able to survive the devastation of the South and show a courage of spirit in facing adversity and impossibility, but on the other hand, she was weak too.  Weak in continuing in her girlhood, idealistic, puppy love for Ashley that blinded her to real, true lasting love with Rhett Butler who was her true soul mate.  In some ways she was finally a woman, having the burden of responsibility of her family forcing her to mature, but in other ways, in her relationship with men, she was still a child.  Of course, in the latter category she realizes too late what she knew instinctively all along, that Rhett Butler was the man for her and she had just been too immature, stubborn, and childish to see it clearly.<br /><br />Rhett Butler was the perfect match for fiery Scarlett.  He was exactly like her, unscrupulous and looking to number one first (although, he did have his gentlemanly and kind moments beneath the veneer of mockery and sardonic amusement).  Unlike Scarlett, he didn't pretend to be what he was not. He was no refined Southern gentleman and he took perverse pleasure in flaunting this in subtle ways.  He is basically Scarlett in masculine form, only more intelligent.<br /><br />Some of my favorite moments of the book were the scenes with Rhett and Scarlett sparring with the other.  It was amusing to see Rhett get the upper-hand over Scarlett every time.  His witty quips most times went completely over her head, as she wasn't as clever as he, but that made it all the more amusing to see Scarlett finally meet her match in Rhett.  I laughed aloud several times as I read Scarlett getting frustrated and upset stating he was no gentleman, only to see him laugh at her and agree with her he wasn't.  Other scenes I enjoyed reading was the scenes back at Tara after she fled Atlanta, where you are witness to the transformation of Scarlett the Southern belle to Scarlett the survivor as she toiled in the cotton fields in Tara and tried to put food on the table for her family.<br /><br />I thought it was quite saddening to read about the delusions people in the South had regarding the war.  The characters in Atlanta, such as Mrs. Merriweather or Dr. Meade, with their desperate, futile hope, and optimism that the South would prevail was sad to read about.  Defiant to the end, in their naive and stubborn pride they thought the South and \\""the Cause\\"" they fought for would triumph no matter the cost.  It was this hope they clung to even as Atlanta was under siege by the Union army.  None would know (or wanted to admit to knowing), except those perceptive enough to see the truth, such as Rhett Butler or Ashley Wilkes, that the way of life the South enjoyed up to the war was dead and gone.  An old world that wouldn't come back, even if they had won, as it was forever changed, and like the title of the book gone with the wind.  This book was poignantly sorrowful in that regard, you get a brief glimpse into the South portrayed pre-war and then post-war, and you realize it was never to be the same again.<br /><br />Although this story is told from the perspective of a Southern woman and her story of surviving the war, I think one could say her personal story reflects on a larger scale the entire South's struggles to survive in a new and changed world.  The scenes of the ruined and abandoned plantations, with their eerie tomb stillness,  was described in very convincing detail, and I found myself with Scarlett mourning the lost world she loved and grew up in.<br /><br />I could keep on writing about the various aspects of this story that were enjoyable and what I thought, but this review would get very lengthy if I did!

However, Margaret Mitchell uses a little bit of both meanings in her description of Scarlett O'Hara, protagonist of Gone with the Wind.  Scarlett represents two of the most powerful human emotions: love and hate.  Gone with the Wind is truly classic American literature, as it encompasses such strong emotions and redefines the reader's historical understanding.    It is hard to describe the level of feeling one gets from reading this book.  Mitchell has loaded her story from cover to cover with strong details that take the reader on an intense voyage of human emotion.  The reader can easily become involved in the story through this detail.  The feelings Scarlett has for Ashley draw the reader back to his or her childhood.  As Scarlett matures throughout the course of the novel, so too does the reader.   Love, hate, anger and sorrow are all common emotions everyone experiences, and Mitchell uses her words to draw out these emotions from her readers so that they can truly understand Scarlett's character.    They say that history is always written from the winner's perspective.  This novel counters that, as it tells the story of the South from the South's perspective.  For example, it provides a new point of view on Sherman's march to the sea, showing the way the Southern cities were affected and the feelings of the people living in them.  Because the events are familiar to the reader, they stick out and maintain the reader's interest.    Gone with the Wind is a classic in American literature, and is a touching story of a young woman experiencing life.  Her name reflects her various personality traits, and makes for an interesting story.  Everyone should read this book, but make sure you have plenty of time, as it is quite a lengthy book.  Also, while extremely touching and a fun read, it can be difficult at times due to the broken Southern used as dialogue.  Despite these few drawbacks, the novel is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys curling up with a good book and becoming emotionally part of the story.

The book is written about a south that the people of the south say and believed in, and the characters are all people who fit into this setting.

This view is premature and biased, in my opinion.  If one digs deeply into the fabric of this very complex novel, one is likely to find that this novel works on two very different levels: the external level, in which themes such as survival and romantic love figure prominently; and the internal level, in which themes such as division v. reunion and the child v. the adult figure prominently.    An external analysis of the novel yields much that has been obvious to the reading and movie-going public for years.  \\""Gone With the Wind\\"" is, most obviously, a very powerful novel about a young woman's survival of two unique crises: the American Civil War and Reconstruction of the South that followed.  The personal qualities of those who survive and prosper in this novel -- characters such as Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Mammy, Will Benteen, old Mrs. Fontaine, even Mrs. Merriwether -- are contrasted sharply with those who do not survive and prosper: Ashley Wilkes, Ellen O'Hara, Gerald O'Hara, and Scarlett's first two husbands, Charles Hamilton and Frank Kennedy.    Melanie Hamilton presents an interesting study in the story of survival.  Margaret Mitchell uses her to represent the dignified stateliness of the Old South matron.  Rather than becoming a victim of the Old South's disintegration, she survives in a way that equals or even surpasses Scarlett's survival.  Melanie, whom Mitchell originally intended as the novel's heroine, is the woman who saves Tara from burning to the ground; the woman who drags her father's Mexican War sword to the landing at Tara, helping Scarlett defend it from the Yankee invader; and the woman who stands against polite society in order to defend Scarlett, her beloved sister-in-law, from the town's gossip.  Yes, she dies at the end of the novel, and Mitchell uses this to represent the passing of the Old South.  However, even here,Melanie dies in her own bed, in her own home, with her own family about her, and she dies on her own terms: after conceiving a child she knew placed her own life at risk.    It is also about three interconnected love stories: the traditional, dignified courtship and marriage of Melanie Hamilton and Ashley Wilkes; the thwarted, unconsummated relationship between Ashley Wilkes and Scarlett O'Hara; and the temptuous, passionate courtship and marriage of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler.  The central theme of these love stories is summarized early in the novel by Scarlett's father, Gerald O'Hara:  \\""Only when like marries like can there be any happiness.\\""    These themes, while universal and very powerful, are only external to the novel, and I don't believe the novel's power or universality are derived from the themes of survival and love.  I believe its power is much more subtle.  Indeed, for years, it has been a mystery to literary critics why this novel was received equally well by 10-year olds as well as 95-year olds.  Therein lies its secret: it is a novel with which both the 10-year old child and the 95-year old adult can identify strongly.  It is a novel about children and it is a novel about adults.    Every one of the major characters has qualities of both children and adults in them.  These are handled subtly, not obviously, and the language of the novel, which I believe Margaret Mitchell crafted deliberately along these lines, takes the reader in this direction.  For example, listen to what Scarlett says about men: \\""All the men in Scarlett's life, the Tarleton twins, the Calvert boys, Charles, and Frank, she could dismiss with the phrase, 'What a child!' Not Rhett.  He was an adult in everything he did.  Only Rhett and Ashley ...\\""    Scarlett is portrayed as both child and adult.  \\""I'm always your little girl,\\"" she says to her mother in the middle of the Civil War, when in fact she is a widow with a 2-year old son.  The woman whose heroism saves Tara from oblivion is evaluated by Rhett at the end: \\""My pet, you're such a child.\\""  By the end of the novel, when Scarlett is only 28 years old, she has been married three times, widowed twice, given birth to three children, and buried one of them.  Yet, in her dreams, she is still \\""a lost child.\\""  When asked if she thought Scarlett ever got Rhett back, Margaret Mitchell said: \\""I don't think so, but I do think she finally grew up.\\""    Melanie is the adult who masquerades in child's clothing -- and has a child's figure.  Mitchell takes pain to describe Melanie's physical appearance \\""as that of a 10-year old boy, with narrow hips and height barely coming up to Ashley's shoulders.\\""  Yet it is Melanie who has the wisdom to see Scarlett's finer qualities, her strength of character, her commitment to her promises, and her ability to survive -- wisdom that is ironically viewed by Scarlett (and others) as foolishness.  She is portrayed as foolish to be so loyal and loving to Scarlett; yet it turns out, in the end, that Scarlett's attachment to Ashley was imaginary, and it turns out in the end that Scarlett loves Melanie deeply.  She is portrayed as foolish for defending Rhett Butler so staunchly, yet her wisdom about his good qualities is thoroughly vindicated by the novel's end.  Of all the principles, it is Melanie who is the most wise -- and the most adult.  Yet her external appearance is very childlike.    Rhett is usually depicted as an adult, the black sheep of a prominent Charleston family who makes his own fortune as a blockade runner from just a $1,000 investment.  He admits, at novel's end, that he wanted to care for Scarlett, as an adult would care for a child; yet he is relentlessly mothered by Melanie, especially toward the end: she straightens him up so that he can be presentable to Scarlett after her miscarriage; and only she can convince him to consent to Bonnie's funeral.  Further, he enables Melanie's mothering throughout the novel.  She is the only person that he truly respects because, I suspect, she is a reminder to him of his own mother, a character who is rather prominent in the novel, though largely absent.  Interestingly, it is only Melanie who comes into contact with her, as she greets mourners for Bonnie in the parlor of Scarlett and Rhett's mansion.    Ashley Wilkes is the real child of the four principles, but it takes Scarlett the entire duration of the novel, more than 12 years, to realize this.  Ashley is the weakest character, the one who has failed to give up the \\""life that [he] loved,\\"" the one who depicts the charm and grace of the Old South to Scarlett -- the only time that she succumbs to the mistake of looking back.  Mitchell is very deft with this scene.  It is portrayed as a scene that exposes Ashley and Scarlett's illicit love for each other.  However, what's really being exposed here is their common dependence on the past, Ashley's being overt and Scarlett's much more deeply repressed.  By implication, it's also exposing the true nature of their attraction for each other, because they shared a common upbringing, growing up on neighboring plantations.    This scene is expertly crafted.  While Ashley and Scarlett are reminiscing about the charm and grace of their common past -- an event which culminates in their hugging in a truly platonic manner, one in which they begin to understand each other -- they are exposed to the gossip and criticism of Atlanta society.  What's being exposed here is not their unconsummated romance; it's their common reliance on living in the past.  It's fitting that they should be exposed when they're reminiscing about their common past, because that is the real force of their attraction, the real reason for their love (an ultimately childish love, by the way).  Mitchell uses this scene to expose them not to Atlanta society, but to the reader.  They're not in love with each other; they're in love with a life that is (forgive the cliche) gone with the wind.  At the end of the novel,when Scarlett realizes she truly loves Rhett, she sums up her relationship with Ashley: \\""I've lost my lover and I've gained another child.\\""    Virtually every relationship in this novel can be evaluated as child v. adult; think, for example, of Mammy, the real mother figure of the novel.  Look at Ellen and Gerald O'Hara; he was 43 when they married and she was 15; yet she mothers him, right up until her death.  Consider one of their final episodes, recounted to Scarlett in Atlanta by John Wilkes, in which Gerald wanted to fight in the war.  Ellen puts him to the test insofar as riding his horse is concerned, a test that \\""little Gerald, who barely came up to her shoulders\\"" failed miserably.  After Ellen dies, Gerald's life collapses and he is a broken man, right until his death.    Finally, there is the theme of division and reunion that appears on numerous occasions throughout the novel.  Consider how the novel starts:  Scarlett is seated on the front steps of Tara between the Tarleton twins -- a divisive force for two brothers who are otherwise as \\""alike as two bolls of cotton.\\""  The novel begins with internal and external symbols of division.  The Civil War starts.  We are introduced to Scarlett and Melanie, the two heroines who are complete opposites and, at least for Scarlett, adamantly opposed to one another.  We are introduced to Ashley and Rhett, the two heroes who are also complete opposites, at least externally, and rather opposed to one another; Ashley dislikes Rhett's blackguardism, and Rhett has contempt for Ashley's weaknesses.    Mitchell deliberately tries to convince the reader, by cleverly contrasting their external characteristics, that these characters are hopelessly divided.  Scarlett \\""hates\\"" Melanie because she is a foolish simpleton and Ashley's wife; Rhett is a symbol of the New South, and Ashley is a symbol of the Old South; Rhett is a survivor, Ashley is a victim.  Scarlett is a divisive figure in Melanie and Ashley's marriage.  Scarlett isa divisive figure in the Hamilton-Wilkes families: toward the end, she is the indirect cause of a family feud that splits the family into two separate camps.  Scarlett, herself, is a divided character - the result of an alliance between an Irish immigrant and an established aristocrat from the Savannah coast.  \\""In her face were too sharply blended the sharp features of her father, an Irish immigrant, and the more delicate features of her mother, a French aristocrat from Savannah.\\""  Mitchell has even put division on Scarlett's face -- one reason that Vivien Leigh, who as an actress utilized divided eyebrows (one up, one down) for Scarlett, was such a perfect choice for the part.  \\""She is my Scarlett,\\"" admitted Margaret Mitchell.    Division is the premise of the novel.  Reunion is its conclusion.  Everything that was divided is ultimately united by novel's end.  Melanie and Scarlett reach an understanding with each other; Scarlett comes to realize how much she loves and relies on Melanie, and comes to appreciate her strength, the \\""steel courage\\"" that has sustained her through many crises.  Indeed, the evolution of their relationship is one of the most touching and endearing aspects of the novel.  Whereas we begin the novel with Ashley depicted as the war hero whose life is lived for \\""dignity and honor\\"" and with Rhett depicted as the blackguard who is motivated only by crass selfishness, we end the novel with Ashley reduced to a helpless, purposeless victim and Rhett enhanced as a loving husband and father.  Along the way, the stark contrasts that Mitchell draws early between Rhett and Ashley yield to sympathetic comparisons.  \\""Did it ever occur to you, Scarlett, that Rhett and I are fundamentally alike?\\"" Ashley inquires toward the end.  Yet their similarities are evident -- though repressed -- from the beginning.  In a surprising confrontation with Mrs. Merriwether, Melanie defends Rhett's criticisms of the war because they mirror things her husband has written to her.  Ashley and Rhett begin the novel as divided and opposed to one another; they end united and unified as characters.  Melanie and Scarlett, likewise, begin the novel as opposed opposites and end the novel united and unified.  Division begets reunion.    This theme, division and reunion, is especially powerful when you consider the historical context of the novel.  In my view, it is no accident, but rather a careful decision on Margaret Mitchell's part, to time the action of the novel from April 1861, the start of the Civil War, the ultimate symbol of division, to September 1873, the end of Reconstruction, the ultimate symbol of reunion.  It is a breathtaking historical backdrop for a novel whose dramatic power is derived from characters experiencing division and reunion in their lives.    It is curious that Mitchell's novel has born the brunt of belittling and contemptuous literary criticism over the years.  When it debuted, it sold millions and won the Pulitzer Prize; no film, before or since, has ever been so widely anticipated as the 1939 film was.  Its massive popularity, I suspect, and Mitchell's melodramatic writing style have contributed to this contempt.  However, when one considers the thematic breadth of the novel, its impeccable structure, and the awesome scope of its narrative force, \\""Gone With the Wind\\"" is a singular and astonishing achievement.  I believe its universality, its appeal from the 10-year old to the 95-year old, is best explained by the themes of child v. adult and division v. reunion.  I also believe that it is these themes that explain why it captivates us after 71 years and will continue to captive generations to come.",2007-09-06

Throughout her childhood she heard stories of life before, during, and after the Civil War.  In the 1920s she suffered a broken ankle.  In order to pass the time, and inspired by the stories of her childhood, Mitchell began to write a book.  She did not consider herself a novelist and did not think about publication--until 1935, when she impulsively gave the ragged manuscript to a visiting publisher's representative. The rest, as they say, is history: GONE WITH THE WIND was a phenomena.  The reading public loved it; even the critics hailed it; and a celebrated film version merely added fuel to the fire.  It has been translated into a host of languages, it has never been out of print, and to this day it remains among the most widely-read novels ever written.<br /><br />In hindsight, it is obvious that Mitchell was somewhat overpraised as an artist.  She is not a writer who can complete with the likes of Jane Austen or Mark Twain, and she has a distinct tendency to write \\""on the surface\\"" rather than in depth.  But she has two great strengths, and the first of these is narrative power.  If nothing else, Mitchell was a born story teller with an instinctive grasp of what it took to make you turn the next page; at one thousand pages, GONE WITH THE WIND is a long book--but it never seems long when you are actually reading it.  Mitchell's second great strength is ability to create archetypical characters that seem to embody everything you know as well as everything you feel you should have known, and Scarlett O'Hara joins the ranks of Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, Thackery's Becky Sharp, and Tolstoi's Anna Karenina as one of the most memorable female characters in the history of literature.  As art, the novel does have faults, but it is vividly, sharply alive.  You believe in the world and the events and people that Mitchell presents.<br /><br />Social critics presently accuse Mitchell and GONE WITH THE WIND of racism.  I find it difficult to criticize a writer and a work from the past for failing to adopt the attitudes of the present; all writers bring their own day and age to the table, and Mitchell's attitudes and ideas about black people and slavery were in the American mainstream of her day.  In this sense, the book is perhaps best considered as a marker of where we once were and how far we have come since its original publication.  It is also worth noting that while GONE WITH THE WIND is set before, during, and after the Civil War, and while many of its characters are slaves or freed slaves, it is not a novel about the Civil War or about slavery.  It is about a self-centered woman of that era who is clever without being intellectual, who is remarkably hypocritical, and who can in many ways be described as morally bankrupt.  We see this world through her eyes, and since she is utterly uninterested in the causes of the war, and even less so in the myriad of moral and ethical issues that swirl around slavery, we learn very little about either in any real sense--and to further complicate matter Mitchell never implies that Scarlett, those who swirl around her, and their attitudes and actions are to admired or accepted; they simply are.<br /><br />This said, social critics do have a significant point when they note that the popularity of GONE WITH THE WIND had the effect of perpetuating the idea that slavery was \\""not all that bad\\"" long after such ideas should have been no longer tolerated.  I do indeed recommend the book--it is extremely memorable, so much so that it virtually created the genre of romantic historical fiction without every being bested by the host of novels that followed it--but I do not recommend that any one come to it without a fairly good idea of what the Old South was like in actual fact.  It is all very well to see that world through the eyes of Scarlett O'Hara for a time, but we need the ability to pull away from her point of view, and to compare it to reality, once the novel is set aside.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewert aside.

There are conversations amongst Scarlett and her family/friends regarding the Northern's erroneous assumptions about their slaves.  They claim that they would never beat their slaves nor know of anyone that would behave that way.  Of course we know that slaves were abused but there is huge denial here.  Mitchell's characters also portray the slaves as child like, and the owners justify slavery saying that the Negroes are too child like to take care of themselves.  Also remember that the men in Scarlett's lives are part of the KKK.  Mitchell sees the group as Southerners protecting their family. <br />It's astounding how much of this attitude is not commented upon.

It is a novel that has been handed down in my family for three generations -- and now I know why.    Scarlett O'Hara is a spoilt flirtacious southern belle on her father's rich plantation. All the other girls in the county hate and depise her because she has a way of getting her charming claws into their men -- ALL of the men, that is, except \\""the long suffering Mr. Wilkes.\\""    Ashley Wilkes is young, blonde, handsome -- and taken. He is destined to marry Melony Hamilton -- the only woman in the county besides Scarlett's mother who doesn't depise her (ironically enough).    Scarlett convinces herself she is in love with Ashley Wilkes, but the truth is she only wants him for the simple reason that she can not have him. Her want becomes an obsession that spans over the next four years of the Civil War and even after. Ashley turns her down in more than one entertaining love scene, one of which is over heard by none other than the the famous Rhett Butler.     Rhett Butler is smitten by Scarlett the moment he first sees her because he recognizes in her the same qualities he values in himself: he is a social outcast without clean spot on his reputation. According to the South's unwritten social laws, he is not a gentleman but a scallywag and a cad because he refused to marry a girl he'd taken out without a chaperon. But Rhett is fearless and defiant when it comes to social rules and lives a comfortable life safely outside of \\""good\\"" Southern society which means he openly associates with prostitues and therefore, knows about women's undergarments (something a man is supposed to pretend not to know about).     But Rhett's sudden and adrent spark of love for Scarlett is doused somewhat when he learns of Scarlett's apparent love for Ashley Wilkes. He then spends the greater part of the novel fruitlessly pursuing Scarlett and trying to make her forget about Ashley. He married her, saying with a laugh that he \\""can't wait all his life to catch her between husbands.\\"" But Rhett soon finds after the birth of their first child that married life with Scarlett is hell. He can't make love to Scarlett knowing that she's sighing for Ashley Wilkes, and he can't bear to sit across from her at supper anymore knowing that she wants Ashley there. And when Scarlett turns Rhett from her bed it hurts him so that he's driven to mad drinking.     And though Scarlett moons after Ashley and fantasizes about him, she slowly but surely falls in love with Rhett. But here's the twist: once Scarlett realizes her love for Rhett and runs to him to proclaim it, she finds that Rhett's deathless love has, well, died, and that he just doesn't \\""give a damn\\"" anymore.

The racist attitudes of the time, though naturally, entirely unsavory from today's point of view, existed, and denying it won't erase the facts. Mitchell WASN'T trying to make a statement of ANY kind, pro or con; she merely wrote on how things were, as opposed to how one wished they might be, or wished them to be different.  The dichotomies between black and white life are entirely realistic, and to portray them as anything otherwise would be foolhardy. The only way to know how ghastly our history was in terms of its treatment of humanity is to preserve the facts as they were, and this book, without even trying, does exactly that.<br /><br />Too, it would be a serious mistake to paint this book as an idyllic, romantic love story. Mitchell, to her credit, does not fall back on dime-store novel clich&eacute;s, and unfortunately, she is rarely accorded respect for this. Because of the movie, an entirely different, not altogether flattering, slant permeates the whole \\""Gone With The Wind\\"" phenomenon - and which debased Mitchell's intentions in the appalling Alexandra Ripley sequel.<br /><br />If everyone who saw the film had read the book, realization might be more widespread as to how they differ, and how much more complex and sharply drawn are the characters.<br /><br />Scarlett and Rhett are two unapologetic opportunists who are startlingly lacking in typical \\""storybook\\"" appeal. Instead, their \\""appeal\\"" is in how earthy and shrewd they both are, survivors by discarding public approval and approbation. In the end, both are humbled (\\""redeemed\\"" is too strong a word) by life and their chronic misunderstanding of each other - and wind up, naturally, alone. Mitchell, shrewdly enough, in a rare move of unsentimentality, does not go the \\""happily ever after\\"" route - Rhett leaves Scarlett, ruthlessly, abruptly. How could Butler, after being so shabbily treated, retain his self-respect by staying with Scarlett? All the other characters are drawn with wonderful strokes of originality and vividness - human, flawed and far more appealing than the pastel versions portrayed in the film.<br /><br />Mitchell was an incredible vernacular writer, and her skills in doing so emphasized the differences between all the cultures, classes and races. Astonishing is Mitchell's ability to combine history, social commentary and fiction with unbelievable ease; after several hours of reading, the reader may feel as though he had been in a virtual time machine, so indelibly detailed are the locales, weather, sounds and even smells.

Sequel Stunk","This classic Civil War-era romance novel won the Pulitze Prize in 1937 and was made into the classic movie audiences around the world know and love two years later. This terrific saga begins before the Civil War (which the Union won four years later, paving the way for the 14th Amendment, which ended slavery in 1865, several months after Abraham Lincoln's assassination) and ends during Reconstruction. I won't go over the plot again, as many who've either read the book or seen the movie (or both) know what it's about. Those who haven't read it, read the editor's reviews. One major difference between the book and the movie is that the book has a lot of cursing and the movie only has one swear word: \\""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.\\"" The way Rhett (Clark Gable, who won Best Actor in 1934 for the delightful screwball comedy \\""It Happened One Night\\""; review coming soon) says that to Scarlett (Vivien Leigh, in the role that won her her 1st Academy Award for Best Actress; the 2nd one was also for Best Actress in \\""A Streetcar Named Desire\\"" in 1954) makes it seem like it's not a bad word at all.

Imagine how surprised I was when I found out about the sequel, advertised on the back cover of the Large Print Edition that I borrowed countless times from my local library before buying it from \\""Doubleday Book Club\\"" (rarely do they have anything worth buying). Alexandra Ripley (who is she?) wrote this follow-up with the \\""Permission\\"" of the Mitchell Estate and look at the result. True, the story picks up where the original left off, but a twist of the supernatural (what the hell was she thinking?!!) just ruined the novel. It too was turned into a movie starring Joanna W.-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton (two-time James Bond in \\""The Living Daylights\\"" and \\""Licence To Kill\\"" [see my reviews on them]), which I don't know if it's any good.

I suppose I could use my desire to to broaden my reading scope as a reason for picking up this novel. I haven't read enough of the classics, the heavy stuff, the stuff that should have a good reason for staying around this long.         Anyway, this book was teeming with racist undertones, and it annoyed me, to say the least. I could never really get comfortable with the writing, however beautiful and applause-worthy it was, because in would come the worthless diatribes about the slaves and how dumb and shiftless and worthless they were. It's not that the book was written about times of slavery and the aftermath of the American Civil War; I understand that people in those times had their reasons and their own beliefs. (I read Queen by Alex Haley with no problem, although I will concede that Queen was written by descendant of slaves and the view would be slightly different.) But I wonder if the woman who wrote Gone With the Wind was racist--or at the very least more than mildly prejudiced--because she wrote unnecessary addendums when describing the 'darkies,' superfluous ramblings that seemed to be more her own thoughts than the thoughts of the book's characters. She wrote things like, [the slave girl] couldn't comprehend...in her little black skull, and the use of the 'n' word when something else would have sufficed. The way she described Big Sam's excitement in seeing his mistress again after the war almost made my blood run cold. I ran into a lot about how the 'good' slaves all hated the idea of being free and the 'no good free issue' slaves were the ones who, apparently, realized that they were getting a raw deal when it came to that 'peculiar institution.' Really, wanting to be equal to whites [in every way that counted] was such a preposterous idea! I get the feeling I'm overreacting, but that's what happens when you read material like that in times such as these.         Another thing that bothered me about it is that this is supposed to be the greatest love story of all time and almost eight hundred pages into the thing, Rhett and Scarlett still weren't together. He loved her--he admitted this to her at least thrice--and she didn't realize that she even really liked him, let alone loved him, until she halfway got over her Ashley Wilkes obsession.          My third problem with the book came in the form of one young Miss O'Hara. As much as I tried to remain sympathetic and understanding to Scarlett's plight and her reasonings, her behavior made it easy for me to remain unmoved while reading. While I applauded her moments of unselfishness (very few and far between), Katie Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler was a nuisance and she was one of the main reasons I walked away from this book without too much feeling. However, I did love the way Rhett was written, for reasons I cannot properly articulate because even I do not know why I liked him so much. I guess I believe he and Melanie Hamilton Wilkes were the only truly likeable people in this book.        The language was beautiful, the scenes vivid, breathtaking and all of that which is desirable when talking books. Ms. Mitchell wrote a really good book but sadly, it's not for everyone to enjoy.",2004-07-25

And i absolutely love the descriptions of the civil war background - it is sweeping, historically accurate and touching, many times. I can slip the movie in at any scene or pick up the book and spend a few hours undisturbed just lost in its language and flow.<br />All of that said, i think it is important not to forget that Mitchell has not mentioned one word against slavery in the 800+ pages she penned, slavery being the burning, heart rending issue of the time the novel was set. Every country and state goes through change, for good or bad and we lose times that were precious, sentimental, valuable - or we lose a 'land of grace and plenty' as she calls pre war Georgia.

Once I got into the story I was reading every chance I could get.

Simply a brilliant brilliant work.<br />The book is very true to the times. I have read many first hand accounts of that era, including hundreds of Slave Narratives and Margaret Mitchell told it like it was. To say this book is racist is just plain stupidity. <br />We shouldn't read history because it's just not nice, it's just not  the way we would do things, us being such enlightened souls. <BR>Waaah. Waah.<BR>How stupid. This book is about another place and time. DUH.

They are the best on the whole world&quot; It's incredible. I am not talking about the selected slave narratives telling all manner of horror. I am talking about he Federal Works project that talked to actual ex-slaves and their families.<br />As for Rhett, I had a hard time liking him. He was dashing at first but his &quot;career&quot; during the war turned me off. His fine clothes and such while people starved bothered me. <br />... But then he proposed to Scarlet and  he was so romantic and I started to really like him. I even liked him in the parlor scene when he was drunk and tortured over Scarlet's wandering heart.<br />But by the end I didn't like him much again. I thought it was really scoundrelish of him to simply say &quot;I'm tired of it, I'm tired of you&quot; Frankly my dear I don't give a damn.<br />Him and Scarlet had both sunk so low. I didn't like their long violent fights. It really pained me. When Scarlet was sick ... oh that broke my heart how Rhett cried into Mellie's skirt.<br />If only... If only ...<br />That is a very difficult part to swallow with this book ... and yet it is still a &quot;right&quot; end.<br />I loved Ashley for his Southerness and Melanie was a beautifully wrought character.

And I don't mean just the surface historical picture either.It goes so much deeper.  Scarlett is of course the central character,and to me,a metaphor for the \\""New South\\"",in that she compromises with the new circumstances in order to survive.Melanie appeared to me as a symbol of the \\""Old South\\""-but the part of it that had integrity and strength.They needed each other in order to survive,and it took Scarlett until the end of the book to realise this.Ashley is the part of the Old South that couldn't adjust.Rhett is the person who though he despised the old ways and all they stood for until age and time made him begin to realise what he had thrown away.He still had a cynicism about it,but he also had an appreciation for the charm of a time that would never be again.  As with many others,Scarlett was my favorite character in my first few readings,but I came to a new appreciation of Melanie over time. I began to see that she had a true quiet strength that Scarlett could never approach,one that didn't require her to compromise her principles and her loyalty,as Scarlett had to,in order to survive. The character of Ashley,on many further readings,doesn't appear quite as pathetic as before(though I never found him THAT pathetic in the first place).He was simply,as he tragically recognised,an anachronism in his time,a beautiful dream which evaporated under the harsh glare of a new reality.He was the part of the dream that Scarlett clung to,even as she clung to the ideal of her mother Ellen,never seeing the truth of these ideals-the honor,strength,and integrity of the dream,rather than the outward forms.This was HER tragedy-even though she was a survivor of a kind,she had to destroy all that was good in order to do so.Melanie had the true moral courage that allowed her to survive without destroying the good-to me,a much more difficult kind of survival.  I'll need to read this book so many more times before I'll feel finally understand it all,if I ever will.I understand the old story,being born and raised in the South,of the struggle to hold on to your identity and still be a part of the world around you.I understand why The War can feel like yesterday-after all, most of it was fought on the soil here,and the losers always remember longer.I think the background of Scarlett's father,Gerald O'Hara from Ireland,neatly ties into this.

Mitchell provides a fascinating depiction of the psychology of the South, which plays a critical role in Scarlett's story.  To thrive, she finds she must alienate the remnants of her former life and accept the presence of the Northern invaders.  Throughout Scarlett wrestles with her feelings for Ashley Wilkes, a noble refugee from the genteel past, and Rhett Butler, a scalawag building his fortune from the ashes of the confederacy.

This book is mainly about the difficult times for Scarlett O'Hara. The book was focused around the era of the Civil War. Gone With the Wind is a romance story about Scarlett O'Hara,her love of her homeland, Tara, and her search for love. She was jealous of Melanie Wilkes who married her cousin, Ashley, whom Scarlett desired. In the rage of Ashley marrying Melanie, Scarlett marries the first man who asks her, Melanie's brother Charles. Within 2 months Charles dies in the Civil War leaving her with a baby. She desperately tries to win over Ashley by moving in with Melanie and Melanie's aunt after Charles died. When Scarlett becomes bored with her living conditions, she goes to a fundraiser and meets Rhett Butler, a wealthy man from Georgia and he falls in love with her. But Rhett is very annoyed with the fact that Scarlett is in love with Ashley. Then tragedies start when the Civil War comes close to Georgia and Atlanta. Melanie gets pregnant and Ashley goes to war because Atlanta is attacked.  Scarlett would have to escape back home to Tara before the Yankees come. Scarlett, along with her son Wade, her servant Prissy, Melanie, and Melanie's son Beau travel to the plantation Tara, where Scarlett was born, and Scarlett finds no food, no animals, only 2 remaining servants, a dead mother, an insane father, and 2 sick sisters. In desperation to survive, Scarlett marries Rhet Butler, and has a baby girl named Ella. She realizes too late that Rhett is her true love, but Rhett is tired of being second to Ashley, and leaves Scarlett. She decides she wants to get Rhett back, and then says \\""I won't think about that today, I'll think about that tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day.\\"" I enjoyed the book a lot, and would recommend it to anyone who has a lot of time, and likes to read love stories.

How can they even suggest such a thing? The killing of civilians, the pillaging, the murder of whole families and black ex-slaves, the stealing of homes, the burning of whole towns, civil liberties taking away when the south and it's people were doing their best to start again and be part of the Union again after the war, martial law being the order of the day for over five years, the robbing of state government money, over taxation again for the South and it's people after the war and after taxes being one of primary reasons for the the war, the murder of many more man and their families for being defiant against a Government that lied to them again, and all is being condoned by people who live now in the present who say the Southern people deserved what they got for having slaves and daring to follow what the Consitution allowed? the right of session.

The story of Scarlett O'Hara and her fight to never be hungry again, her fight to never let the Yankees beat her, and her fight to keep Tara her land from the Yankees. Scarett is a role model for anyone who will do anything to survive when the time comes to keep from being poor. Whether she is spoiled, caculating, and shrewed or just plain mean she gets what she wants, just like I think she would have gotten Rhett back sooner or later. Or Rhett would have come back. He loved her too much and waited to long for her to just give her up easily. Remember how he waited till the burning of Atlanta to enlist in the Cause to save the Condfederacy, of course he would have returned back to her in the end. And for all the people who think slavery was the only issue pertaining to the civil war. Read your history. Not public school history or present history. Read real history before 1970. You'll get the history you were robbed from. Remember slavery was legal so that made it okay in the eyes of the law before the Civil War. It was legal. It didn't make it right.

Spun from the imagination and supposedly blurry, slightly realistic accounts of Margaret Mitchell and her friends (Mitchell said the characters were based on some of her acquiantances, as she grew up listening to Civil War accounts in the South), the novel took America by storm in the 30's. It was the Great Depression, a time that severely hurt the nation's economy. We were then a nation on the brink of war (sounds like our present time, does'nt it ?), World War II being just around the corner. Mitchell had written short novels that are unfortunately unknown to most readers and sold rarely in bookstores, but GWTW was her only great novel, her  magnum opus, her legacy. She took it upon herself to write the great American novel, and she managed quite well. The novel deals with the life-altering Civil War, its effects principally on the main characters, a coquettish, strong-willed, male-manipulating survivor Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara, an equally strong and slick man of ill-gotten means, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, of whom Scarlett is enamored and who is a reserved, elegant aristocrat and his wife Melanie Hamilton. The barrage of characters, from the Tarleton twins, to the comedic, gossipy Aunt Pittypat, to the slaves, including Mammy. The novel is very long, and of course, in order to truly enjoy the epic scope of the narrative, one must take time to read. A first read this novel in junior high, devouring every page, immersed in the tragedy and the triumphs that Scarlett faced during what must have been the hardest time for Americans in the nineteenth century. Similarily, the movie, in my opinion, related to the Americans of the 30's, having gone through the Depression, looking forward for resurrection and triumph despite all odds. As Scarlett's motto and unforgettable creed went, &quot;Tomorrow is another day.&quot; Themes of hope, nostalgia and unrequited love abound in this masterful story. I hope you read the novel if you have not and then view the film, rather than other way around. I saw the film first, then read the novel. You will find how DIFFERENT the book is from the movie, and how much more grandeur there is in the novel and how much more developed the characters are (i.e. Scarlett is supposed to have had children with her two husbands before her marriage to Butler). It was not difficul to imagine the characters in the novel looking and speaking as the actors did in the film - Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, etc. But if you read closely, the characters are definately Southern, bourgeois, prudish, scandalous and quite Victorian in manners.

This is not merely a love story or glorified version of a tragic historical period, but an intense treatment of much of the paradox in human nature.<br />Regarding the racial issue - I would say that the depiction of blatant racism in this book is all the more powerful because everything is told from the Southern aristocrat's point of view. The characters need to believe, and have convinced themselves, that they are benevolent and affectionate towards their slaves! Yet they refer to these same people as &quot;apes&quot; without seeing their own horrifying stance. When Melanie, supposedly the soul of kindness, tells Ashley that, if they move North, they cannot let Beau attend school and &quot;have pickaninnies in his class,&quot; it shows the horror of racism just as clearly as if the reader had seen the miserable lot of the slaves.<br />Scarlett, certainly no heroine and one with no principles who'd like merely the reputation for being a &quot;great lady,&quot; is a most intriguing character. As Margaret Mitchell makes clear in many references, we have here one who is incapable of being at all analytical. (Except for Rhett, and, to some extent, Gerald, only Mammy can see through Scarlett's facade.) The Ashley she loves is a creation of her imagination - and it is interesting that, for all that she despises Melanie, the traits Melanie has which Scarlett most derides are very much the same as those in the Ellen that she idolises.<br />The book has so many fascinating characters that one could read it ten times and still find one has only scratched the surface. Those like myself, who cannot imagine too many settings they'd like to enter less than the &quot;old South,&quot; can find it interesting to explore the situation of those who find their entire world has collapsed around them.",2001-12-18

The fact that the movie lasted over a period of years and it rarely showed a violent act towards a Black person is solid proof. The truth of the matter is that slavery in the deep south, likes places such as south carolina, was incredibly brutal and violated most human rights. The film attempted to depict slavery as a life where none of the slaves got beaten, whipped or raped, when in reality violent acts towards Black individuals was a common day occurrence. According to Frederick Douglass slaves were beaten weekly to strike fear into the other slaves. Women were raped continually over years of their lives in order to perpetuate the institution of slavery. Families were torn apart from each other due to the trading and selling of slaves. Gone With the Wind  could have done a little more justice to Black Americans by not under emphasizing the torture and pain that they endured during the 19th century.    <br />Apart from its ignorant illusion of slavery the movie does illustrate, as Mark Burgh points out, the hardships of post Civil War life in the south. Scarlett O'Hara never had to do a thing for herself before the war. By the time Sherman was done marching to the sea she had made up her mind that she was going to conform to the new northern way of life in order to survive under the new politic. A lot of people in the south had to make that change, and I think that movie does an excellent job of showing the changes in life style before and after the war",2001-11-20

Characters are well developed and constant in their portrayal of the complexities of love and life under the strain of a collapsing civilization.  Survival amidst tremendous hardships and the source of strength in the human soul are topics that the novel/movie address nicely.  However, taken in a context of reality, \\""Gone With the Wind\\"" is insulting to the reader's/viewer's intelligence and to the ancestors of Southerners, both black and white, free and slave, through its completely one-sided depiction of life in the plantation south.  Many other reviewers on this site have commented that \\""Gone With the Wind\\"" is a nice change from other books and movies in that it portrays the master/slave relationship as being affable.  The truth, however, is not so pleasant.  It is evident from the reading of historical documents that even the kindest of slaveholders did not keep their slaves as well-clothed, well-fed, and lightly worked as the O'Haras kept theirs.  Only once did the movie portray slaves doing field labor.  It never showed the slaves' living quarters, which were often less than comfortable.  The only brutality and punishment it showed was when Scarlet hit Prissy for not moving fast enough when Melanie was giving birth.  The representation of Mammy is partly accurate in that she was a jack-of-all-trades woman who cared especially for the master's children.  The other side of the \\""Mammy\\"" role however, was that on most plantations, the mammy was overworked, on-call 24 hours a day, and abused sexually and physically by the master.  Also, a mammy would have never had the authority to boss around a master's daughter like Mammy bossed around Scarlet.  For those who desire a well-written piece of fiction that takes place in a beautiful and gentile fantasy world called the Old South, I would surely recommend \\""Gone With the Wind\\"".  For those who know betterthan to believe in illusions of peace and warmth in the plantation south and who enjoy books that have at least one foot in the doorway of reality, \\""Gone With the Wind\\"" will not be on your list of favorites.",2001-11-19

I've read all the classics, and I even know some Literary Theory.  Gone With the Wind? Pul-lease, racist, sexist, revanchist trash, made popular by all the young woman dreaming of being Scarlett and having both their Rhett and Ashley.  Cheerleader fare.  Escapist.  WRONG!<br />Gone with the Wind is an American War &amp; Peace.  This is serious literature, which won the Pulitzer prize, no less.  Most people don't see past the epic plot (which isn't as cut and dried as you may think) or the love story, but this is no less than a successfull attempt to reclaim a discarded culture.  It is not about crinoline and lace, it it about the Apocalypse and how losers of the counter-revolution must learn to live in a place where all their politics, personal or civil, are demolished.  Scarlett O'Hara is popular because she is an American, driven, materialistic, sentimental and utterly ruthless.  Rhett Bulter is the tragic character of this book; the way of life and ideals he disdained are killing him, and he suffers like no one else in this post-apocalyptic landscape.  His departure at the end is an act of contrition as much as a romantic failure; he had tried to recreate the materialism of the ante-bellum world, but negeclected the spirituality (such as it is) of men like Ashley Wilkes.  Both men, the dreamer and the realist end up alone in a very sterile place.  This book is proto-feminist as well.  Scarlett survives, even as everything around her dies, but in the end, she too is alone.<br />Don't dumb this masterpiece down.  The movie fails to capture even a tenth of the depth here.

Enjoy it and remember this book was written in the 1930's.  Very different way of thinking back then.  I have read some of the reviews and I just threw my hands in the air and decided to write my review.  That is how mad I got.  Why?  Well, everytime someone decides to write a review about a book that took place during the civil war someone has to put in there two cents, about how horrible the whites treated the slaves or how horrible slavery was. Please.  Okay, yes slavery did happen.  And I don't conden it niether.  But everyday one can not escape not listening to it about the subject on t.v.(especially the Oprah show, I really think that lady spends her life talking about the subject, bitter woman, or movies, or songs, ect. ect. ect. From all I have read and seen and learned does one really believe all the plantation owners beat there slaves and killed them?  I mean would a plantation owner who paid top dollar for a slave just take him home and starve him, beat him, and have chained him and just treat him worse than a dog. I don't think so. It just not possible that all plantation owners did that.  If that really was widespread as we are lead to believe then now, then there would have been an uprising of slaves sooner then Civil War.  There would not have been any need for a Civil War if all the whites of the South then were the cruel vicious monster we have been lead to believe they were. As allways when we have a small majorit of people to tell us history (that is t.v., roots, and all them bad history channels, and magazines and supposely non-fiction books that are written with the liberal mentality), they just re-write history.  If one really wants to find out the history of the south. READ OLD BOOKS ON HISTORY!!! NOT THE NEW ONES!!!  OLD BOOKS!!!

The most amazing thing about GONE WITH THE WIND (and there are many) are the beautiful characters that Mitchell creates. I felt pain, and laughter right along with Scarlett. All the characters seemed so real to me, and I grew to love them so. Mitchell is so brave to have not made a person like Melanie as the main character, a person that everyone would love. Instead she forces the reader to fall in love with a selfish, stubborn, mean, hateful person like Scarlett. Scarlett is definetly my favorite literary figure, she is by no means a perfect person, but you see parts of yourself in her, parts that you may not want to see, and that makes her all the more real. True to form, the most interesting characters in the book are the people with more sinister sides to themselves. To compliment Scarlett, there is of course, Rhett Butler. Every episode he was in came to life, just by the addition of his witty back handed comments, and his insightfullness to realize just how unscrupulous he and others are. Every diolouge is a joy, be it anyone from Prissy, to Rhett speaking, the words fly fromt the page, and never get boring. The turns that the book takes never fail to surprise. Once I got into this book, I couldn't put it down. The most important thing to remember while reading it though, is to take the book as it is. In parts, tales of the blacks lording over the whites, and the views of slaves, are hard to swallow, and painful to read. And they are not entirely accurate. But this was written by a southerner, in a different time, about an EXTREMELY different time, so all of these things must be taken in stride, and read with caution.

Her story about coming to age just when the Civil War began and having to learn everything she was taught is of no use to her during war and after war is a must read for anyone. Her transformation into a shrewd, lying and spoiled southern belle is just about the best for any reader who loves stories based on the southern way of life. I just have to say this book is not racist and it was never intended to be. Many people just think it is because now we are bombarded into thinking blacks are the victims of society due to them having been slaves. People this is the story of Scarlett O'Hara living in times when not many black people were educated. Some blacks were but many were not as the belief back then was that blacks were just not too smart to learn. Which we now know is not true. But one thing is true and what many of us now have to understand is that many blacks who were slaves did not want to be freed. Where were they going to go and what were they going to do after being free? What did they know about this strange land being freed? How were they going to survive? They didn't know and they didn't know anything about taking the intiative of oneself instead of being told what to do. And many blacks were defending the then southern way of living. Many slaves did love there slaveowners and wanted to remain with them. Many slaves did fight on the Confederate side willingly. Even when the south did lose the war many ex-slaves did stay with they're ex-slave owners because in they're way of thinking they still belonged to them. It was a mutual love. They did die fighting believing in the Confederate way of thinking. They were not brainwashed it was just they way of living that they knew. They loved there white folk like many Mammies did love there white kids as if they were they're own children. We have to remember that the way of thinking was completely different back then. We have to remember if that way of thinking was now we would think the same way. Love knows no barriers. The love of another to another is just that. Even if it meant a slave-owner loving his slave like a slave loved his owner. Didn't God have a commandment to treat your slave with respect and to give him his seventh year free. The bad people of this story were the carpetbaggers. They caused so much damage in this country back then that the states suffered it for years because of them. They lied to the ex-slaves by telling them to vote them into office and then wanting to have nothing to do with them. As Margaret Mitchell tells in the book many blacks were put into also. I read many books about this subject and it is true. The most ignorant and hateful towards white were put into office. They saw this as a way to get back at the whites for having them in slavery. But that is not it. Many slaves saw it as revenge because of the wrong done unto them by being slaves. What the carpetbaggers did was poison the minds of the ex-slaves by telling them it was wrong and it was wrong but they made them hate the whites by telling lies about how many whites ex-slaveowners beat, torture, and rape and commit atrocities against the blacks. Okay yes it did happen. But like many stories it was embellished. Only about a one percent of the whites did own plantations. Something we dont't believe but it is true. We have been taught that all whites back then were rich and made they're riches on the backs of blacks. That's not true. If it was then there would be more blacks in this country then there are whites. WE as a people of this time know our TIME only, meaning now or present time. We are a product of the liberal public education system. I mean we don't know our history or any other countries either. We love to embellish the past, everybody now who was of voting age swear up and down that they voted for Kennedy when he was running for the presidency. That is a complete lie. So everybody who now who is black (this is excluding the newly arrived black Africans) swear up and down they came from slaves. That is a lie also. Many black families immigrated into the US after the Civil War and after the nineteen hundreds. So many black people can't say they came from slaves. What I am saying is that the Jessie Jacksons and Al Sharptons of this world have poisoned many black people of this country to the point of wanting to hurt them and keep them enslaved in hatred towards the whites of this country. We should remember the civil war but not be embittered by it.",2001-09-08

After the war Scarlett faces the challenges of poverty, loneliness and death. She ends up being married three times (and burying two of her husbands), owning her own businesses, killing a soldier (and stealing the money and goods in his pockets), and generally doing everything considered unladylike at the time.

This book - Gone With The Wind - was a runaway success; and ultimately made  into the biggest movie of its day. Alright, let's admit it, by modern  standards it's sexist, racist, overblown, and melodramatic. And it's pretty  darned brilliant. I have read this book no less than ten times!  In theory,  one ought to detest that spoiled little brazen, Scarlett O'Hara, but  Margaret Mitchell makes her into a vivid, strong human being, a woman with  spirit and the will to survive, but who was essentially immature and  spoilt. But she was fiercely protective, loyal, and someone who you were  forced to admire, even as you disliked what she was doing. She also had a  alarming propensity to fall in love with the wrong men - this was a woman  doomed to claw her way anywhere to succeed, but at the same time,  estranging herself in the eyes of her Society. But does she give up, does  she make it a tragedy? No. She gets up and keeps going, she just doesn't  let people see that she minds it very much. She is an inspiration, but she  doesn't really deserve to be. Scarlett is flawed, hideously so, but none  the less, we are forced to admire her. She IS the book. A weaker or less  flawed heroine would be irritating or just TOO unsympathetic. Her  unrequitted love is very believable, it's happened to most of us at one  time in our youth, and we never really quite shake that first infatuation  off without a rude or painful awakening.<br />The attitudes which feature in  this book, although sexist and racist to us now, were perfectly normal for  Civil War Southerners - Margaret Mitchell really understood the way people  behaved at this time, and did not make them behave out of period or in  anachronistic ways. Like Georgette Heyer and Regency England, she has a  true understanding and insight into the period she is writing about - she  LIVES it, and her people could have been alive then without unduly standing  out as unusual or unremarkable.<br />Scarlett is a rebel, but she does not go  as far as a modern author might make her heroine go. She loves her family  and her land, though she may deny it, and she is very proud. She is an  inspirational woman, a true forerunner of the power woman of the 1980s - a  sensational concept, even for the 1930s!  The clever thing is how, in such  a huge and spreading book, everything comes together. It may seem trivial  and unnecessary to discuss Aunt Pittypat's drawing room, or go into the  minutae of Scarlett's wardrobe, or to discuss events that happened a long  time ago, but believe me, it is all very important in building up a  coherent and very accurate (scarily accurate, for 1930s historical fiction  - Heyer and Mitchell, as far as I know, were the only authors at this time  who really bothered to research in depth for their &quot;lightweight&quot;  historical fiction writing.) Gone With The Wind is a masterpiece. It must  not be read with modern eyes, but as an amazing study of how people  behaved, lived, and survived throughout the Civil War in America on the  losing side.",2000-02-17

It was an  era of honest, integrated government, integrated education, integrated  workplaces, and so much more.

The character development and descriptions are very good, and Mitchell does a good job of describing the motives that drive the  characters.  I also appreciated the fact that Mitchell did not write a  typical &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending.  However, I find it  disturbing that very few reviewers noticed or commented on the extreme  racism in the book.  If you believe Mitchell's description of the KKK, you  would never know that this was a racist, terrorist organization (and still  is).  Also, according to Mitchell, only &quot;trashy&quot; black people  wanted freedom; the &quot;quality&quot; black people wanted to remain  slaves!!  These are obviously Mitchell's views of black people, and not  just the characters' views.  Mitchell took pains to write that not all  Yankees were bad and that many were ashamed of the corrupt  reconstructionist government they had to uphold.  In a biography of  Mitchell's life, she is described as refusing to attend a class with a  black student who has been admitted to her college.  I only hope that most  readers noted her obviously racist views and realize that slavery was not  as she described it.",1999-04-27

They are similar in that they are sagas involving  families whose lives are changed by war and how characters are affected by  war. Some people fall to pieces and cannot contemplate a 'new' life where  they have no place( Countess Rostova and Ashley Wilkes); while others find  a hitherto unknown inner strength (Natalia Rostov and Scarlett).      Margaret Mitchell took 10 years to write &quot;GWTW&quot;, thus starting  the book in the '20's. She drew upon the stories that she had heard as a  child from Civil War veterans and her own mother . Scarlett is the heroine  of the book and there are very few scenes (as in the film) where she does  not appear. &quot;War and Peace&quot; was also written over a long period  of time. Tolstoy's work focuses on an exhaustive cast of characters, and  places the reader in scenes domestic (&quot;peace&quot;) and foreign -the  battlefields (&quot;war&quot;). Mitchell keeps her reader confined to  Scarlett's side with third person references to battles and other factors  of war.   One could write a thesis ( as I felt I was beginning to!) on this  topic. Let's just say that both are wonderful books; &quot;War and  Peace&quot; is considered a &quot;Classic&quot;, while &quot;GWTW&quot; a  classic example of historical fiction!",1998-08-27

Scarlett O'Hara is like Becky Sharp, mostly  unlikeable, but still admirable for her gutsiness.<br />While reading the book, it began to dawn on me that most of the gush over Gone with the Wind that I'd heard was about the movie rather than the book itself.  I went to see the movie.  I was  appalled; the casting of the four main characters just didn't seem to fit.

It is an American classic because of its representation of our societies obssession with self, and I believe everyone can see at least a piece of themselves in her, which is what makes the story so compelling.
