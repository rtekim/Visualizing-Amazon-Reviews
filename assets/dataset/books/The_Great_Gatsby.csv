Its A Really Enjoyable Book To Read	Well I guess I could write a long lengthy review telling you how great this book is and how much I enjoyed it.  The problem is all those reviews have been written many times over by others.  So I can only hope to add to the well deserved praise for Scott and his great work.  I most recently read this during an afternoon in central park.  What a great way to spend an afternoon in a great city.	2015-08-30

Fitzgerald, for all his faults, really did unearth a rare and a special feature of the human mind in his study of the fictional Gatsby. The story really has little to do with its narrator, and many of the events are just Fitzgerald's biased metaphor filler. &#34;But Subaru4Life88&#34; I hear you say...&#34;the whole book is metaphor&#34;.<br /><br />Sure. I neither agree nor disagree. Haven't given it much thought as the metaphors, if they be there, are too deep for my interest. I'm more taken by his flagrant obsession with Gatsby's fixation on Daisy. He was either writing from self-experience or someone he knew well, but I think Jay Gatsby and Daisy's relationship touches on the human being's fixation with striving for perfection, the best, etc. The whole novel does really.<br /><br />This novel sparks the thoughts that life is really best lived and known in the suffering and striving, not the pleasure we always want to achieve; that an individual can become so wrapped up in someone (or everyone) else that they lose track of who they are; that we cannot look outwards for satisfaction until we comes to terms with what is really missing within.	2015-08-26

The author should have put nice people in his book who make their money honestly and treat each other nicely.  Nobody was very nice in this book!<br />3.

I never had a chance to read this when I was in High School, so I felt compelled to see all the accolades for this book.  I enjoyed the book but I did not like any of the characters.  They all seemed flawed and too sophisticated.  To best describe this book is the pursuit of The American Dream.  Wanting what you cannot have and ultimately being destroyed by it.  I take the Great Gatsby as a cautionary tale of focusing on your abilities living in reality and not in a dream world.  The book clearly attempted to make clear of the pitfalls and moral deficient of high society.  I highly recommend it as a Classic story.	2015-07-12

It is considered to be a modern classic and is Fitzgerald’s best known novel. The story is set in roaring twenties and is a wonderful portrait of the Jazz Age, complete with all the glitzy glamourful flappers, dandys and shiny cars. The story is written in first person narrative, from the point of view of character Nick Carraway – reflecting on the memories of his wealthy millionaire friend and neighbour Jay Gatsby. Carraway commences the novel with an explanation of how he has become cynical of people…but also how he considered Gatsby as an exception to the rule: “I’m inclined to reserve all judgments…after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit…Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn.” Gatsby is described as something of a man-of-mystery throughout the book; a man of property, taste and intellect. Allusions are made of Gatsby’s shady origins - cousin to the Kaiser, a German spy, a bootlegger, a military man. He reveals at one point that he went to Oxford (an Oggsford man) but doubt is cast over this factoid. Gatsby throws huge opulent parties in his luxurious ostentatious home saying “I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.” Carraway observes Gatsby but can’t understand why the man surrounds himself with people while remaining behind the scenes. The story is both a love story and a tragedy on a Shakespearean scale. Gatsby amasses his wealth in an effort to create an opportunity to recapture the heart of his lost love “Daisy Buchanan” (a married woman/ married to the wrong man). He hopes that by throwing out the welcome mat to the entire city each night, with his wild parties, Daisy might eventually just stroll through his front door. And hope is one of the major themes of this novel, along with: the difference between classes, disparity of wealth, decadence, idealism excess and adultery. One of the ultimate sorrows of the novel is when the reader realises all the interesting people, are shallow and are simply leeching off Gatsby. An age old literary formula of “the woman, the lover, and the knave” are played out in this book. Star crossed lovers are obstructed by the complexity of their situations. Fitzgerald’s prose are a bit on the flowery side for my tastes – he tends to dance around his meaning – but this is a great yarn, a great novel and a must read.hemes of this novel, along with: the difference between classes, disparity of wealth, decadence, idealism excess and adultery.

Scott Fitzgerald's short novel casts a spell on me in his painting Love, Truth, Mythology and Tragedy in words so poignant, eloquent and gorgeous that I, a mere mortal, cannot do them justice, so I must quote (though I typically prefer not to):<br /><br />“The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.”<br /><br />***<br /><br />“In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.”<br /><br />***<br /><br />“His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed like a flower and the incarnation was complete.”<br /><br />***<br /><br />“And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.<br /><br />Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning——<br /><br />So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”<br />***<br /><br />This is my favorite American novel.believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.

I ordered the book. It's quite a short read. The perspective is fresh, and timeless. It raises the question of what is the cost of living hedonistically, and does so without being a scathing critical look at those who have more than we do. I think it simply serves to entertain while at the same time making the reader stop and ponder. And that's what great literature does.	2015-06-23

Reportedly, the artwork was commissioned before the novel was published, and Fitzgerald was so impressed that he wrote the cover into the story. This classic tale of rags to riches still entertains and informs, although it was written 90 years ago, in 1925. Fitzgerald is not only a great storyteller, but he has a beautiful command of the English language. The final words of the novel adorn his tombstone:<br /><br />And so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.<br /><br />If you have never read this classic or you just want to read it again, this edition is trustworthy and easy to read.	2015-06-21

Fitzgerald’s ability to write an intricate plot that carefully places each individual character into a role on the American Dream showcases his superb writing skills and intellectual capacity. This was one of the best books I’ve read. It is often debated about whether the title of this book was literal or figuratively. I believe that when you read the book, the answer to that question is based on your opinion on Gatsby’s actions.<br /><br />Just like the American Dream, the Great Gatsby shows its readers that even when you work hard to get what you want, it doesn’t always go as planned--- but there’s always an opportunity that you can take. In this book, there are several symbols that must be acknowledge in order to gain a complete perspective of what Fitzgerald was writing. Some of those symbols include: colors (yellow, green, white, blue, etc.), time/clock, Valley of Ashes, eyes of Dr. T.J Eckleburg, location, weather and a green light. These symbols signify the life and state of America during the 1920’s. The entire book is narrated by Nick Carroway, an observant neighbor of Gatsby, who describes the lives of the cheaters, liars, manipulators, and abused.<br /><br />Fitzgerald shows us that even when everything looks good, it won’t stay good for long. Gatsby’s nostalgic lifestyle and strong determination catapults him from rags to riches. The other characters in the book help to show the frivolous lives and dreams that people of the 1920’s held.	2015-06-10

I was very bored with it and I didn't care about any of the characters whatsoever, even Gatsby. Like one of the reviewers who have this book two stars like me I would describe it as empty. &#34;Empty&#34; is how I felt in the beginning, middle, and end of this book. Sure the prose is really good and Fitzgerald has a wide vocabulary but so what? When I read a book I read for enjoyment, not for all the literary crap. I don't get how this is a classic and I don't feel is deserves to be up there with other classics like &#34;To kill a mockingbird&#34; or &#34;Of mice and men&#34; because in those stories, unlike this one, I felt real emotions throughout the story and cared about the characters in those stories. Overall I give it two stars, definitely one of my least favorite books but I've read worse.	2015-06-09

Scotts Fitzgerald, takes place in the nineteen-twenty’s. The Great Gatsby is narrated by one of the main characters Nick Carraway. Nick tells his perception of the people around him.  This story follows the truth, the riches, the love life and the death of a man named James Gatz. (Later turned Jay Gatsby) During this time women were not thought to be equal to a man. During this time women were finding themselves getting more risqu&eacute;. The Great Gatsby has a lot of examples of this. Fitzgerald has a vivid understanding of lives that are besmirched by self-indulgence are exceptionally miserable and unsatisfied. This book boils down to the most prevailing character Jay Gatsby, who is polished and world-discontented is nothing more, then a man apprehensive for love. When reading this book take in all the beautiful language. With this language you will be able to paint a depiction of what’s going one in the novel. Mature readers best cherish the language and symbolism in this novel. Readers interested in this book should be able to evaluate situations in the novel and analytically think. When you read this book be sure to keep a dictionary close by. Even though the language is beautiful it is also very challenging. For parents who are interested in purchasing this book for your child please take note, there is some racial and religious predisposition. There are also minimal blaspheming words. I enjoyed this novel and I this purchase is worth every cent.	2015-06-08

I did buy it used, but the only thing that the description said was that the binding was worn because of it being used often. Nothing about writing was mentioned.

It starts off slow but as you keep reading you see a lot of character development. Fitzgerald uses this book to write a love story based in the jazz age but doesn’t make it a happily ever after novel. He pushes the harsh reality into Gatsby’s eyes and shows how shallow some rich people can be. Daisy has an undying love for Gatsby but is too afraid to make the move of leaving Tom. The story is written in the point of view of Nick Carraway, whom I believe to have the most sense out of all the Characters of the book. During the story you see his relationship with Gatsby flourish into an obsession with Gatsby. As a reader I can never expect what each character will do. When you learn about Nick and Jordan Bakers relationship you will perceive they will get together and possibly get married. As you keep reading you realize Jordan and too selfish for Nick and Nick is too consumed with Gatsby’s life to think about her. When you learn about Tom and his affair you would assume he will eventually leave Daisy to be with Myrtle Wilson.  Fitzgerald makes each character start off very simple if not predictable but as the novel continues they each become more complex and very unpredictable. After the fight and car accident, one might believe Daisy would run away with Gatsby and get married and start a new life. That’s the farthest from the truth. The Book end with a true meaning of the novel and somewhat of an understanding of each character.	2015-06-06

He incorporates beautiful imagery and description, as well as honest narrative. The plot of this book is easy enough to understand and to follow. The characters aren't especially complex. The symbolism is easy to interpret.

That's by viewing the most recent Gatsby movie first. After seeing it and marveling at the way the excesses of the 20's were portrayed, I decided to reread the book. The combination of the two experiences were mutually reinforcing. It turns out that the movie follows the plot of the book quite accurately. In fact, many of the famous lines from the book are included in the movie. Because of that precise tracking, it was possible to focus on and appreciate more the amazing writing. No need to strain to follow the plot.  Conversely, scenes in the book are made more vivid by visualizing scenes from  the movie. For example, the movie does a fabulous job of depicting a wild party at Gatsby's mansion. Also, the casting of the actors is consistent with their role in the book.<br /><br />So, see the movie and then read or reread the book. Not the other way around.	2015-05-28

(Some of it works, some is embarrassingly bad.) The effete narrator's feckless, anomic sensibility is difficult to endure throughout the first half of the novel and then degenerates into complete despicability by the maddening moral passivity he displays as the second half plays out. He's privy to concealed instances of first manslaughter and then murder (of his supposed friend, the eponymous hero) by the rich principals and does absolutely nothing about it. I sense that the book is a &#34;classic&#34; only because American academicians - desperate to get some modern WASP into the canon - have conned themselves and generations of gullible students into making an imagined literary mountain out of this shabby, morally-stunted molehill. Oh - and don't let me forget the occasional (admittedly faint) whiffs of anti-Semitism...	2015-05-25

I guess part of my love for the novel is caused by my nostalgia to live in the roaring 20s. The characters each have different backgrounds and somehow they become more involved with each other and their lives are intertwined. As they Nick Carraway becomes involved with Gatsby, Tom, Daisy, and Jordan he learns secrets that he asked to keep, but should he? Who would it hurt more? The beholder of the secret, or the individual the secret it about? Nick is in this wedge of secrets as the book progresses. The way F. Scott Fitzgerald mixes the characters lives together is by itself amazing, but then he adds the colour of the twenties and the parties and Gatsby. He uses thorough imagery to portray Jay Gatsby’s carefree, expensive life. The novel ends with a decision: Gatsby or Tom Buchanan? There is a huge plot twist that is sad but incredible.	2015-04-27

Actually, the book was called &#34;The Rising Tide of Color against White World Supremacy,&#34; written in 1920 by a lecturer at Harvard by the name of Stoddard.<br /><br />The juxtaposition of the lawn parties with Tom's animus against &#34;The Rising Tide of Color&#34; is why The Great Gatsby is a great American novel. It certainly isn't a masterpiece because it's particularly well-written or well-structured. In fact, most of the story is self-absorbed, with the &#34;self&#34; not being terribly interesting. Nick is a Yalie on the make trying to sell bonds in New York. We've seen that before, had lunch with it many times, and weren't terribly impressed. Of course, many people love the description of the American manner and the voyeuristic view of early 20th Century American wealth. And I suppose we're supposed to draw some great moral distinction between Nick, the buttoned-down bond salesman, as against Gatsby, who is also a financier of sorts, but one who is more enterprising and vastly more successful.<br /><br />As the world evolves from American hegemony to a power structure that is more multi-polar, the tension that is at the core of The Great Gatsby is going to come alive in a way that is direct, daily and unavoidable. There is in fact a Rising Tide of Color. It's called the World, most of which originates in the Pacific and its (spiritual) tributaries from the Yalu to the Volga.  But perhaps I am losing you with this multi-polarity prattle, so I'll try to be clearer.  The morality represented by Gatsby wins.  I don't mean to say that America loves criminals, although at some level this is not untrue.  What I mean more fundamentally is that America seems to have decided consistent with the Universe that victory is beyond good and evil.<br /><br />The parties end in The Great Gatsby, and Gatsby lies in state, friendless except for Nick, who never really liked him very much. However, I don't think the real story as it unfolds in the 21st Century is going to end in such a lonely and decrepit manner.  Gatsby is great… but uncelebrated.  He is remembered… but unmourned.<br /><br />There is a Rising Tide. It is the future, and the party is only beginning.<br /><br />We… have grown stronger swimming against the tide, and our thoughts will light the way as we ready ourselves for the shore.  We abandon the past and the anguish of so much that is unforgiven.  We instead remember only five moments, each of them perfect and happy.  That will have to be enough for us.  Our consolation is that we go on.  …or something like that.Nick, who never really liked him very much.

I am a fan of symbolism and this book definitely has many symbolic characters, items, and topics.  The cover is just as pictured, not the one with the white border.  Print is decent sized as well, not too small.	2015-04-22
US	23930555	R27AEB7LGH21S0	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Too bland for my taste	I don't strongly hate this book, but I don't love it. I'm an avid reader, but not often do I find a book that leaves me with a bored apathy. If you are reading this for fun and not for a school assignment like I had to, please don't buy this book.<br />First of all, the characters didn't appeal to me at all. The characters were bland and two-dimensional, and it was hard for me to differentiate between characters. They're all vastly rich, and deeply shallow. One of the most important things about the characters is their wealth and social status. In one scene, the narrator laments over the apparently poor condition of his towels. Towels! I was hoping, from the description of the book, that the story would be more... interesting. There are a few scenes where the characters argue, but this is the only time that I felt like they were real people. Yet &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; overall contained people going to each other's mansions to drink and gossip. I thought the story might be more emotional, like a soap opera, but it seemed too bland for me.<br />Secondly, the stereotypical treatment of the wealthy. Fitzgerald seems to summarize the rich as people who spend lavishly, drink often, and lack the basic emotions or respect for things and people around them to enjoy life. For example, a funeral that no one attends. The characters aggravated me in their simplicity and ignorance. Forgive me for making assumptions, but this sounds like a political metaphor for the evils of the rich and the American Dream. It saddens me to think of how this story tainted these principles.<br />Finally, the vast amounts of crime and sin. It surprised me that this book contained multiple affairs, several murders, and a suicide. The Great Gatsby didn't seem that great; just like a man with the wealth and eloquence to be socially acceptable.<br />Overall, I found the book dull and boring, with the occasional twinge of upset over the treatment of both the characters and myself, the reader. If you want the overall message, here it is in one sentence: the rich are shallow and thin, and it is obvious that capitalism won't lead to happiness, and the American Dream is an outdated sham. I didn't agree with the themes in the book, but if you disagree with me, feel free to pick it up. Just don't say I didn't warn you.want the overall message, here it is in one sentence: the rich are shallow and thin, and it is obvious that capitalism won't lead to happiness, and the American Dream is an outdated sham.

The tragic story of Gatsby and his never ending quest to prove his worth to the shallow and vapid Daisy is relate able. Everyone has at one point or another tried to turn themselves into something they weren't for the opposite sex. It never ends well, as was the case with Gatsby. The book is a bit heavy handed with its symbolism but the way Fitzgerald creates a scene and the depth of the characters makes up for it. It's a classic tale.	2015-04-08

After not reading The Great Gatsby in high school I figured now would be better than never. One thing I loved about the book itself is how quick of a read it is, yet the amount of detail and character development in it is highly impressive. The Great Gatsby shows, although exaggerating to some extent, what love can do to a person and the possible tragedy of it too. If you haven't read it I highly recommend you do!!!	2015-04-06

It has an interesting story line but Mr. Fitzgerald takes way too long to tell it.  He includes way too much unimportant detail in practically every sentence.

Perhaps high schools considered this a great classic because an occasional dirty word is thrown in.	2015-03-30

I read it in a day (super short book if you didn't know already), and I am honestly confused by it. The first seven chapters I liked. When all of the chaos began, everything became distorted and muddled. It took me three times reading through to figure out that Gatsby had died, and after that everything just scattered. I didn't even understand the last several paragraphs. It was like Fitzgerald tried to incorporate some last-minute life lesson or something, and it didn't flow with everything else he had written. However, the greater portion of the story was well-written, intriguing, and genuinely brilliant. In conclusion, the strange closure (if you can call it that) threw me for a loop and prevented my loving this book. That is why I gave it three stars.	2015-03-17

I had a psych professor that once labelled Fitzgerald as &#34;the best writer-about-nothing,&#34; which I'd say sums up this book pretty well. The writing is striking and sticks with you, but the story itself isn't truly about anything, if that makes sense. It's a bit like the movie Metropolitan, if you add a super creepy suspense element that haunts you throughout the majority of the book and pushes you to keep turning pages. Even the plot twists though don't feel like really heart-stopping surprises, but it's an excellent book because of that spooky underbelly on the lightness of the actual dialogue and action.	2015-03-12

One of the reasons I believe this book will be preserved through this history of English literature is just that it's so wonderfully written. F. Scott Fitzgerald clearly has a lot to say about the American Dream and does so beautifully.<br /><br />On this note, I'm perhaps going to be the odd person out when I say that plot and rising action were not terribly exciting. This reason I'm not going to give it a five-star rating.	2015-03-05

Scott Fitzgerald’s greatest novel and an American classic known by all. This romantic, but cynical novel is about the wealth and lifestyle of New Yorkers during the 1920s, or Jazz Age. It deals with the aspects of class, love, and sorrow. The rich and the poor are shown to be complete opposites. For example, the rich, like Gatsby, are portrayed as vulgar and pretentious, while the poor, like Daisy, are elegant and graceful. I think Fitzgerald makes a great point by showing the rich are not always the best, which is something more people need to realize. Fitzgerald also shows not all love stories turn out perfectly. In the novel, love is not found, only the thought and dream of love is. However, sometimes chasing that dream leads to tragedy. The end of the novel is shocking, leaving the reader to feel much despair. Fitzgerald’s writing is absolutely brilliant and I would recommend The Great Gatsby to anyone. I think it is great that students everywhere are being required to read this book at some point in time. It is the most perfect novel and definitely keeps you on your toes, wanting to keep reading until you finish.	2015-02-12

Carraway as narrator provided the exact perfect pitch: more awestruck than he would admit, more moral than it was fashionable to reveal -- always objective and distanced and subtle and charming, genuinely decent and impeccably well mannered, a little dangerously smitten himself by the lovely but corrupt Jordan Baker.	2015-02-07

It's like, come on, does this book really need my seal of approval? Does anyone really give a &#34;care&#34; about what I think of a canonized and immortalized work of art? So maybe that's why when I review a &#34;classic&#34; it reads more like a journal entry than an actual review.<br /><br />In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald touches on a number of tropes that are frequently explored in high school classrooms such as the legitimacy of the American dream, economic stratification, and societal norms of the 1920s. But really what The Great Gatsby leaves its readers with is a profound melancholy, especially if they're over thirty, that their best is behind them. The ethereal visions and dreams of our forgone past loves and accomplishments float farther away as we try to frantically swim closer to them. American society itself is presented a degrading middle aged country without imagination that worships at the alter of capitalism and semi-monarchal familial reputations trapped in a cycle of womb envy.<br /><br />Fitzgerald paints a stark contrast between the painfully normal Nick Carraway, an aimless and listless product of the status quo, and Jay Gatsby's Byronic archetype who tries to fit into a world he can never fully understand. And why should he even try to understand such a broken and disingenuous system? Jay Gatsby unintentionally parodies the society's predilections with his lavish lifestyle and wild parties both meant to ultimately impress his lost love. Between Gatsby and Daisy Jay or Buchanan, the reader can only assume that two people so beautiful, genuine, and innocent being united would be far too much for the degenerating Long Island Hedonists to bear.<br /><br />So is The Great Gatsby worth reading? Don't ask me.	2015-01-29

Whether this success is earned through hard work and determination or through underhanded business is in the power of each man. F. Scott Fitzgerald, author of The Great Gatsby, demonstrates through his characters how wealth and greed make people irresponsible because it allows them to believe that they are entitled.<br />Although money can buy many things, the characters in The Great Gatsby don't realize that what they really desire is something they can't purchase. Jay Gatsby, a mid-thirties aged man who lives an extravagant life in his large, West Egg house, dreams of reliving the past with the person who is still the woman of his dreams, Daisy Fay. After coming back from the military, Gatsby buys a house across the Sound from Daisy and her new husband, Tom Buchanan. Her house is marked with a green light representing Gatsby’s goal: to have her heart once again. With the help of his newly befriended neighbor Nick Carraway, Gatsby organizes a tea with Daisy, who happens to be cousins with Nick. The get together causes strong feelings to resurface between the two, but after months of sneaking around Daisy’s husband, the two are forever separated after Gatsby is murdered by the husband of Tom’s mistress, Mr. Wilson. Gatsby was stuck in the past, and day after day he would look at the green light on Daisy’s dock imagining what could be, but reality held him back, “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past” (180). Fitzgerald paints a picture of boat trying to cross the Sound to reach the green light, but being restricted by the water’s current. As an adult Gatsby still dreams like a child, and no one attempts to tell him not all dreams are attainable. He can’t stop thinking about the past, yet Tom and Daisy are all for escaping it. Before learning about Gatsby’s death, Tom and Daisy leave town, leaving Nick with this reaction, “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy––they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...” (179). Tom and Daisy left like a tornado, hurting people in their tracks only to escape to a life where all was still okay. Had it not been for their wealth they would have had to stay in town and deal with the destruction that they had caused. But, neither with money nor time will their conscious’ be cleared of the lives they costed and hearts they broke. It was their prerogative to be irresponsible if it meant they didn't have to deal with a disaster, and after all this may have been in their vision of their own American Dream.leave town, leaving Nick with this reaction, “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy––they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...” (179).

I first read it as a teenager on Long Island during the dot com boom and bubble. The opulence and vanity of Gatsby’s guests was close to home.<br /><br />Now, just after my 30th birthday, I appreciated the book much more, especially the narrator, Nick Carraway. When he was out at the Plaza with Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, and Jordon, he realized that he had forgotten his 30th birthday. Nick’s decisions about his life, and how he is more of a passive observer than active participant in the world around him is interesting. He moves to New York, but decides to live away from the city; he’s trying to be a bond man, but doesn’t really know much about finance; he’s around parties all the time, but forgets to celebrate his own birthday.<br /><br />This is a superb novel with such rich metaphor. I am glad that I revisited it. I recommend that you dust off your old copy from high school and reread it.	2015-01-12

Set in the mid-1920s just after the war, two people with a romantic past become reunited with the Narrator’s help. It is an excellent book for those who enjoy classic romance novels.  It is a simple novel with a lavish kind of twist to it. Fitzgerald writes this novel in such a way that each end of a chapter keeps the reader hooked. Built on love and deceit the novel is a masterpiece as the reader discovers this world not through an outside narrator where the reader sees things for themselves, but through Nick Carraway’s eyes which are always up close and personal in all of the action. Definitely one of my favorite books because of how well it depicts this time frame	2015-01-06

The PaperBack Scribner copy of The Great Gatsby that I ordered the other day has made reading the book a much more pleasant experience than reading the hardcover Everbind copy I was given in school. Everbind seems to purposely make holding their books to be the most irritating experience. It takes force to keep the pages open since the cover is heavy and the books themselves are uncomfortably tall and skinny. The gawky shape and the fact that it is a school copy, which I cannot write in, encouraged me to order a softer copy of my own.<br />I’ll begin with the cover, one of the most satisfying aspects of the book. The classic uncompleted face on the dark blue background is all the more smooth and relaxing just from the touch of it. It is paper, though from running my finger across it it feels like a table -- not unlike the bedside one I put it down on when I am done reading for the night. The back of the book, which is just as smooth as the front, keeps up the color scheme of orange from the title. One of three color divided sections has a black and white profile of Fitzgerald with his back slightly turned, as if to say “It’s done” with satisfaction. And I’m sure I will be satisfied from reading this copy. The size of the book also happens to be perfect. It is not tall and thin, but it is a medium-sized naturally proportioned book. The font is also easy and comfortable to read so I’m not getting frustrated from reading one page for ten minutes because of how small it is, nor am I turning the page after every other word. Scribner’s Gatsby is wonderful and everything I want and would expect a book to provide. The only flaw: its statement “Now a Major Motion Picture” on the top. They worked so hard at making a proper book, why remind us to watch the movie instead?	2014-12-14

Yes, Nick is the narrator and the first character we are aware of, but Nick mostly narrates to us who Jay Gatsby is. It could easily be Nick Carraway's story of new experiences, big cities, love, and a mysterious man whom he met living in Rhode Island. Or it could be Jay Gatsby's story of how hope, money, love, and crime can change a man as narrated by Nick. But either way you decide to take that information, it's still a novel on its own level. Set in the 1920 New York, which is always, fun, Nick unknowing finds people with deeper meanings than expected. 'The Great Gatsby' is a novel that stands time and despite some not understanding the language, it really teaches you something: it’s great to follow your dreams but don't let it ruin you. F. Scott Fitzgerald really put together an outstanding novel with plots that each seem to make you question the motives of the characters.<br />Is it love or is it greed?	2014-12-11

I suggest reading the book before the movie. Or if you have watched the movie, you can still read the book because it is a very good book. The characters and settings that Fitzgerald sets are amazingly vivid. The novel is about a war veteran (Gatsby) who comes back from WWII and trying to find his old girlfriend (Daisy) who is now married to (Tom). Gatsby consults Nick (the narrator), his next door neighbor, and works with him to get back together with Daisy. The entire book takes place during the roaring twenties and Fitzgerald makes such exquisite references to the 1920s regarding fashion, automobiles, technology, prohibition.	2014-11-29

Fitzgerald  in his work touched on important human themes. The leitmotif here is the idea that with money you can buy the whole world.

But then he did not knew that with money he opened the way to his own death. As it turned out, all these luxurious parties were the forerunner of the end. Gatsby wanted only simple human happiness.

Now I have and am eager to see the movie.<br /><br />There are four things I want from a novel and this has all of them:<br /><br />- Richly developed characters, honestly portrayed with flaws, people we end up interested in, if not caring about. All the characters here are colorful, glamorous -- and shallow and flawed.<br /><br />- Great writing that mostly is invisible, like background music, swelling occasionally to the point where it's noticed as a pleasant surprise. F. Scott is a master at this, with a constant bed of unusual, rich phrasing and images like no one else's.<br /><br />- An engaging story.<br /><br />- A theme -- a takeaway that triggers thought for a days and weeks afterward. I see myself in these broken characters -- how I have treated wealth and being accepted, the lengths we go to find love and when that's missing, to find a level of acceptance that suffices for love.<br /><br />Overall, a must-read. (And it's not very long. Could read in a weekend.)	2014-11-26

The list of ungrateful guests at the start of chapter four has been compared to the display of naval forces in the Iliad; yet it stays and what's more, it works.  What appears episodic in Gatsby actually serve as the wheels under his yellow limousine, hurtling towards his violent destiny.  Each shedding of his assumed persona combine in an apotheosis of tall poppy syndrome, a decline and fall of a class-conscious Icarus.<br /><br />[NB: the graphic adaptation by Nicki Greenberg, rendering the characters as creatures great and small, but faithfully adhering to the novel, is well worth a look]	2014-11-26

At first, when I read a previous review of this book, I immediately agreed with that reviewer.<br /><br />He didn't like the shallow characters, so I learned a new perspective about the book because I didn't get what the point of the book was at that time.<br /><br />I decided to see the movie with Mia Farrow to better understand the book & then it definitely made more sense to me.<br /><br />Without seeing the movie, I would have not understood the different characters & how the story flowed. I didn't know what the hec the author was referring to as Dr. T.J's. Eckelburg eyes on the billboard. I don't think the author even referred to it as a billboard.<br /><br />When Gatsby was killed, I didn't know who was killed. Wilson or Gatsby. I didn't get it until I saw the movie.<br /><br />When I read the scathing review, I thought I don't want to read a book about shallow people.<br /><br />But then I thought, wait this book is an all time favorite, there has to be more to this book. Why do people like it?<br /><br />So then I looked up Spark's notes for this book and started reading summaries of what the character's actions really meant.<br /><br />I started to understand it more.<br /><br />I am a little embarrassed to say I missed the whole point of this book. But to be fair to me, English was not my 1st language so there is a lot vocabulary I didn't understand, plus I was trying to finish it pretty quick without putting much thought to it.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I feel embarrassed because even though there was vocabulary I didn't understand, how could I have missed the whole point and even the story line of this book?<br /><br />I know one reason was definitely not knowing the vocabulary but the other reason I feel was how the book was written.<br /><br />Let me ask a question to whoever read it for the very first time & nobody told you what the book was about.<br /><br />Did any of you get that Gatsby got killed in Chapter VIII? I just read the paragraph where Gatsby was laying on mattress in the pool & still don't see where the author is saying Gatsby got shot!<br /><br />Either this is an old style of writing or I need to go back to my English class & relearn how to understand the meaning of stories along with prose, symbolism, etc. (Sorry Ms. Hall)<br /><br />Since it's a classic, I still recommend for you to read it one time in your life.<br /><br />Either way, I still enjoyed learning what was the big deal of The Great Gatsby!Either this is an old style of writing or I need to go back to my English class & relearn how to understand the meaning of stories along with prose, symbolism, etc. (Sorry Ms. Hall)    Since it's a classic, I still recommend for you to read it one time in your life.

I am a high school student and for our required book clubs for school, my group chose The Great Gatsby (we were allowed to read almost any book we wanted to) due to its regained popularity from the movie. If you have seen and enjoyed the movie, or are just looking for a good book to read, I would highly recommend this one.<br /> The Great Gatsby centers around Jay Gatsby, who has spent the majority of his life making himself good enough for a girl named Daisy. He wants to recreate the love they used to have. When told that he can't repeat the past, he replies, `\\"Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can!\\"'  Once he has found success, he buys a mansion in the West Egg, across the bay from Daisy and her husband's house in the East egg. He lives there admiring the green light on the end of her dock, throwing lavish parties every weekend, hoping one day Daisy will come, but she never shows. Then, one day Nick Carraway, Daisy's second cousin, moves in next door to Gatsby, and Gatsby has a connection to his past love. Daisy and Gatsby are able to meet and rekindle their old flame, however their relationship has its complications. Their time together is far from perfect, and the end of the novel is no happily ever after.<br /> Similarly to the ending of the novel, the characters are not perfect. Fitzgerald has created character that are each flawed in their own way. By the end of the novel, I didn't love any of the characters, but I thought that made the book more realistic. Many people don't like books with an unlikeable protagonist, however in this novel I think that it is necessary. I think that the flawed characters and the interesting plot is what makes this book a classic. It is a must read for people who weren't already forced to read it in high school or want to rediscover the tale of Jay Gatsby.	2014-10-31

The novel is of his whole story, retold through the voice of eyewitness Nick Caraway. Only Mr. Caraway is aware of the true past of Gatsby's life and the strange events that are to come.<br />  The Great Gatsby is an exciting and entertaining read. F. Scott Fitzgerald takes readers back in time to the scandal, rush, and lies of the 20's party scene. True love changes with the seasons and addresses and mistresses even faster. &#34;The world was awakened at night.&#34; Affairs, alcohol and huge parties complete the look. But one man stays loyal to one young lady through it all.<br />  This novel has great value in figurative language and educational usage. There are some themes throughout, however, that are questionable for younger readers. A mature age is recommended for anyone wanting to enjoy this thrilling read.	2014-10-31

Gatsby has been in love with Daisy for many years, ever since they met just before he left for war. He wasn't able to support her so she married a man named Tom Buchanan. Gatsby spent years making his fortune and planning to win Daisy back. He enlisted the help of Nick, when Nick moved in next door, and the two men became very close friends. Gatsby's road to happiness wasn't always easy, as events took a dramatic turn leading to the tragic conclusion.<br />  I enjoyed The Great Gatsby; it was a very well written book. The author F. Scott Fitzgerald described each scene with such accuracy and emotion that it came alive in the readers mind, and evoked intense emotion. I was able to visualize every part of the book and it really helped me to get involved in the story. This book is a classic and it is pretty clear as to why. The typical love story is taken to a new obsessive level with Gatsby's intense passionate love for Daisy. The readers themselves become obsessed with this passionate love story. They are left longing for a love like that for themselves.<br />  The setting of the story also greatly contributes to the high emotions and intensity of the story. It is set in the nineteen-twenty's a time of prohibition, economic depression, and raging parties. The culture portrayed in the book is full of life and freedom; however, not really touched upon greatly in the book The Great Gatsby focuses in on the classy rich population and the extravagant parties they threw, somewhat ignoring that hardships that the rest of the U.S. was dealing with at the time. Although I think The Great Gatsby was a very well written, intoxicating book, I also think that the author could have included a few examples of people who were facing the Great Depression head on. This may have helped the reader to really understand the inequality at that point in time and even view the whole story in a new way.	2014-10-30

Interesting that it has remained so popular in an age that cries out for everything &#34;new&#34; and &#34;cutting-edge.&#34; F. Scott Fitzgerald is without doubt, one of the most amazing writers of all time. What a tragedy that he did not leave us more of his work to enjoy.<br />When I say, &#34;enjoy,&#34; I must admit that in regards to this novel that is a rather two-edged sword. It is difficult to like the main characters in this novel, since they seem so self-absorbed and without any moral compass. Yet that is what makes the work so brilliant. It somehow evokes a type of sympathy for all that could have been. I sincerely hope that as in the past, high schools and universities will continue to view this as a novel worthy of required reading.	2014-09-10

I came across this 1991 definite textually accurate edition of a classic of 20th century literature, through my grandson who had to do an essay in his junior high school year.  I had until September to get it back to the school library.<br /><br />I start with the last quote of the book, given to us by Nick Carraway:  \\"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.  It eluded us then, but that's no matter__tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther...And one fine morning___<br />So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Pursuit of Happiness\\"<br /><br />Jay Gatz on leave from his post in The Great War, wanders into Louisville, Kentucky and meet the attractive Daisy, rich, unmarried, free as a butterfly.  They fall in love.  He leaves her to fight overseas with the intention of returning with his fortune made and expecting Daisy to wait for him.<br /><br />After being discharged from his military duties, he is delayed at Oxford and returns to Louisville to find Daisy married to Tom Buchanan a very wealthy over zealous mid-westerner.<br /><br />Realizing that he has to change his vision and image of himself to win Daisy back. He makes his millions through some shady undertakings and proceeds to popularize himself by giving extravagant parties in the hope of one day seeing Daisy again. Jay Gatz changes his name to Jay Gatbsy.<br /><br />Enter Nick Carraway, cousin to Daisy.  Carraway is not living the live of the rich and famous and rents a small cottage abutting Gatsby's mansion.<br /><br />Gatsby's plan emerges as he befriends Carraway for the main purpose of using him as a pawn to get Daisy to Carraway's cottage for tea.  Gatsby and Daisy have not seen one another in 5 years.<br /><br />The romance is re-kindled and by this time Daisy and Tom have a young daughter that Gatsby is not aware of. The love triangle is in full force and Tom Buchanan for some time has had a mistress of his own.<br /><br />The story has all the elements of life in the 1920's.  The rich, the downtrodden, the moochers, romance, unfaithfulness, tragedy and the humor of watching all unfold through the eyes of Carraway.<br /><br />\\"The Party is Over\\"<br /><br />When tragedy strikes, this is when you realize how many friends you have, if any?  Who is willing to stand by you?  Who is willing to share the burdens?  Who is willing to feel your pain?  This is the true test of friendship.  This is where Gatsby has to face reality and yet, he is still looking for the silver lining through the dark clouds.s of life in the 1920's.

AVOID THIS EDITION	The Great Gatsby is a wonderful novel... that being said:<br /><br />My review is of the print and typesetting quality of this particular edition of The Great Gatsby. In one word: horrible. The pages are typeset with almost no margins, making it difficult to read as the words approach the binding of the book. There is no additional space after paragraphs, either... VERY HARD ON THE EYES<br /><br />The cover looks to have been designed on a 1990's Amiga with a low-resolution image of Leo DiCaprio stolen from a website somewhere. Pathetic. The publisher &#34;Feedbooks&#34; specializes in E-books and maybe they ought to stick to those, because they clearly know nothing about printing on paper.	2014-08-09

He was a delightful man-- all politeness and formalities yet at the same time mysterious. Nick says this of Gatsby when they first meet and I think it's an accurate description of Gatsby's character:<br /><br />&#34;He smiled understandingly-- much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four of five times in a life. It faced-- or seemed to face-- the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of that, at your best, you hoped to convey.&#34;<br /><br />One thing said about America is that you can become whatever you want to be if you only work hard enough. Gatsby attains this, granted not honestly, but attain it he does however it is all done for a singular goal: to win Daisy back. The man comes within a fingertips reach only to watch it slide out of his fingers and explode.<br /><br />&#34;The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare.&#34;<br /><br />He was an enigma, a man possessed and one doomed from the very beginning.<br /><br />Daisy Buchanan-- I wanted to like Daisy even though she was vain and naive. I saw the beauty in her character-- a woman who treated life as a song. She had a brightness about her that seemed to radiate sunlight and through her naivety she possessed a child like wisdom, which is often quite wise. She says this that struck a chord with me and turned me towards liking her:<br /><br />&#34;I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool-- that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful fool.&#34;<br /><br />However, I can't forgive her for Gatsby. She loved him, I don't deny that but she broke him and had no trouble walking away from the mess. Every time we see Daisy she is clad in white which is a fitting color for her. It portrays all the things that encompass who she is: vain, naive and thoughtless.<br /><br />&#34;They were careless people, Tom and Daisy-- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.&#34;<br /><br />Review of the Story:<br /><br />The story is not one I enjoyed particularly. I know it is the great American novel but I feel that's due to Fitzgerald's prose and not the actual story. The pacing is slow due to the constant back and forth shifts in time, making it hard to follow and honestly it felt like watching a sad story only get more and more sad with each page. It was depressing and not fun to watch play out.<br /><br />Review of the Writing:<br /><br />This. The writing is the reason why I will be recommending this book to everyone! Fitzgerald's prose is beautiful and his ability to weave in symbols and such is a skill envied by many. I particularly love this piece:<br /><br />“Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning-- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”<br /><br />His writing not only translates to today's time but exudes a vibrancy that stands out from other novels. He makes use of his fine skill and touches on several things within his short novel such as the comparison between West and East Egg. East Egg represented the eastern side of the world, the elder part where tradition is praised while West Egg represented the new world on the western side where status and money did not necessarily go hand in hand. Opportunities are what define money, not status. He also uses colors to represent several things also, the main one is the green that symbolizes money and greed. It's amazing how much he packed in this little novel but what's even more amazing is that it never once overwhelms you.<br /><br />Rating:<br /><br />While I didn't completely fall in love with this novel I have to recommend it purely for the sake of exposing you all to F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing. His beautiful prose is one that will resonate with you and leave you in awe.

This story is based in New York on the West Egg and East Egg coasts; upper-class luxury at its finest. The time period is set in the 1920s. Economic status was booming in the 1920s, and people took every opportunity to flaunt their money if they had it. Looking back on this time period the image of flapper girls, bold jewelry, slicked hair, and lots of money flow through your mind. Gatsby is known for the glorious mansion owned by this man completely alone. Although he lived alone, the people of New York completely submerged themselves into this mansion for his wild parties. The entire city would’ve killed to get to experience one of Gatsby’s ritzy parties. His reasoning and purpose behind all he does is for love.  Can a long lost love be picked up where it left off? According to Gatsby, “Can’t repeat the past?…Why of course you can!” Only reading this book will reveal the true answer behind this mystery!<br /> This book completely stole my heart, and still remains my favorite book of all time. When I first read it in high school I loved it enough to pick it up again this summer! The amount of deep romance and mystery are just what this book needed to get me completely hooked! This isn’t one of your typical “chick-flick” romance books to where you can assume what happens in the end. My favorite part about it is the fact I had no expectation of how this book was actually going to end. I was completely on my toes the whole time, especially towards the end! My favorite quote in the entire book is this,  “He looked at her the way all women want to be looked at by a man.” Every girl would want to feel a man to feel as passionate about her as he does! Makes my heart just melt.<br /> Fitzgerald did an incredible job with the language in this book. The diction was so sharp and was very intriguing because he used a lot of words that you don’t really hear too often today. It really gave me the imagination that I was living through these characters in this time period. This book has a lot of dialogue that allows you to directly connect to the characters, especially Gatsby. Because he is lead on to be so mysterious and no one seems to know any truth about him, his further conversation and reasoning with others reveals his inner self slowly but surely.<br /> Not only did I enjoy the language aspect of the book, but I also loved the fact that Fitzgerald had the book reveal Nick Carraway’s inner conscious. Nick is really the outsider in the story who seems to get involved in every dilemma one way or another. Reading the book from his perspective kind of allowed me to develop a better understanding of each of the characters. Being on the outside like Nick, as a reader, really makes you feel like you are experiencing what he is though his eyes. The way he just is infatuated with the life Gatsby leads is very intriguing, and keeps you infatuated as well! Nick really sets the tone of this story for the most part. One of  my favorite quotes from him in the story is this, “I was within and without. Simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.”  I love this quote because it really defines his character in the story, and even allows us to connect. We have all felt like outsiders at some point in our life. Life is ever changing and all you can do is go along with it as it moves on.<br /> If I had to complain about one thing, it would be how the story ended. It was a great ending due to the fact it was completely the opposite of what you think what would happen, but it wasn’t the way I had hoped it would end. You get so attached to the love story between Daisy and Jay that you are so shocked to discover the anterior motives behind these characters at the end. My point of view on these characters is just so let down because I had this “perfect” imageof them stuck in my head. I learned in this book things may never turn out how we expect them to.<br /> I would recommend reading this book more than once! Reason being is that I discovered foreshadowing that I never understood in the first place. I believe each time you read this book you will pick up new things, which is what makes the book incredible.

Nick Carraway has just moved to the city and knows almost no one.  Nick has found a place to live in the well-to-do neighborhood of West Egg.  His neighbors live in beautiful mansions with coiffed lawns while he lives in an eyesore of a home.  His new neighbor, Gatsby, is the talk of the neighborhood (if not the town).  Gatsby throws lavish parties with numerous guests that carry on through all hours of the night.<br /><br />Nick's only acquaintances are the Buchanan's, Nick's second cousin Daisy, and her husband Tom.  The Buchanan's invite Nick over to their house and introduce him to Jordan Baker, whom he takes a liking to.  They all talk quite a while and discuss nothing much, that is until the subject of Tom's mistress pops up.  Daisy is aware of Tom's mistress appears to be dealing with it by ignoring it.<br /><br />***Potential spoilers***<br />One day Nick is invited to attend one of Gatsby's infamous parties.  He runs into Jordan and they spend most of the night talking.  They also meet the elusive Mr. Gatsby himself who soon pulls Ms. Baker aside to discuss something in private with her.  Nick finds out later that Gatsby knew Daisy years ago when they dated.  Gatsby has been keeping his distance from Daisy, biding his time, but he wants to see her again.  The story focuses on the relationships between all the characters and how their decisions and lives are intertwined.<br /><br />I read this first in high school and remembered liking it, but didn't remember all the details of the book.  I remembered liking Gatsby himself and wanting him to get the girl.  I really struggled this time with the relationships that were occurring in the book.  It's hard for me to understand why people that are unhappy together will stay together and make each other miserable.<br /><br />Some quotes from the book:<br />&#34;He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly.

Jay Gatsby, the title character, was a hopeless romantic and idealistic dreamer whose positivity eventually led him to ruin. Because he made some mistakes in figuring out how to pursue happiness, he was led only to pain, and had some trouble with trying to figure out at what point it became useless to pursue his happiness. He always longed for the early days of his youth, when he and the girl he loved--Daisy Fay--were together. Sadly they grew up, and Daisy Fay became Daisy Buchanan, and Gatsby doesn't really know how to deal with the fact that she really does love her husband. But because Daisy is connected in Gatsby's mind to everything pure and wonderful about his life, he thinks the only way he can reclaim that beauty is to win her back.<br /><br />Disillusionment played a large part in this book. Nick, the narrator, wanted Jay Gatsby to be happy, and did his best to help him out despite being a realist himself. The author's depressing message appeared to be that the world is going to crap and morals are degrading all over the country, and there's not much anyone can do about it. His point was well-taken even though I don't agree with it completely. It's hard not to feel hopeless sometimes when people like Gatsby are rewarded for their positive outlook by having the rug pulled from under them.	2014-07-25

And he managed to accomplish this in the most economical great novel ever written.<br /><br />The idea of romantic love enraptures us so much so we have an entire literary genre devoted to passion. Jay Gatsby worships an idealized love for Daisy Buchanan and the upper class lifestyle she represents. The driving force of his life, from poverty to showy wealth not only springs from his hated of his impoverished early life but from his desire to possess Daisy.<br /><br />While we like to believe that ours is a classless society, we all know that's merely a pleasing illusion. Even when we manage to breakthrough to the top of the economic food chain we can't count on acceptance. The newly wealthy in the late 19th century discovered the impenetrability of the 400 and it's no different for Gatsby. Tom Buchanan, who constantly displays his superiority (in the opening with his racial prejudice, Fitzgerald's allusion to Lothrop Stoddard), regularly demeans Gatsby. In the end, class wins out, as Daisy tosses over Gatsby, a second time, for Buchanan. And we won't go into the psychological implications of Buchanan's affair with Myrtle Wilson, except to marvel at the rich vein Fitzgerald has left us for conjecture.<br /><br />While the lust for wealth isn't anything unique to America, we Americans exhibit a keen zeal for it, and a wondrous capacity for achieving it, by methods fair and foul and in-between the two poles. Jay Gatsby is hardscrabble and comes by his through bootlegging and financial legerdemain. The Buchanan's come by theirs through inheritance, the accumulation of which might have involved not a little bit of ancestral chicanery. Gatsby is nouveau flamboyant. The Buchanans, while more reserved, flaunt theirs, nonetheless.<br /><br />Fitzgerald says a lot in few words. However, he also leaves much unsaid. This invites readers to fill in the open spaces from their various perspectives. Fitzgerald's economy coupled with his astute understanding of American life are what keep [[ASIN:0743273567 The Great Gatsby]] as fresh and rewarding today as it was when published in 1925.<br /><br />First-time readers are in for a treat. Those who have read it before, or a couple of times, can always find something new in a truly remarkable novel.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1605891185 Babbit]], published in 1922, the year in which Fitzgerald set his tale, also deals with disillusionment with American life, in particular conformity and the achievement of the American dream. It comes to mind as Lewis also alludes to Lothrop Stoddard, who published [[ASIN:144007349X The Rising Tide of Color, Against White World-Supremacy (Classic Reprint)]] in 1920.

Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby on the fourth of July every year since I was twelve years old. I am very much aware that I have promised the reader a review on Henry James’s The Bostonians. However, I feel that tradition in this instance takes precedence and that James can always wait another week.<br /><br />Gatsby holds not only a unique place in the black pit that is my heart, but also in the world of the twentieth century novel. A social history of America during the 1920′s, Fitzgerald critically assesses the growing developments and the coinciding flux of values that percolated throughout the age, exploding with the inevitable defeat of man’s spiritual being by the impounding dominance of materialism. The narrative is a beautiful balance of simplicity and bounding poetics, wrapped up in the dark mysticism of possibility and the timeless allure of slow and unavoidable ruin.<br /><br />The characters are products of their context. It is through his portrayal of types and the boundaries that they may cross that Fitzgerald is able to bring to life the reality of his period. His elegant and yet brutally honest fixtures are not at the mercy of a universe that he has plucked out of the ether. Instead, they are the world and what we see exudes from their speech, actions, and the nature of their internal dichotomies. Each possesses an inner battle that reflects the age that they were created to mirror. Even Nick, who as the narrator only exists in relation to the people and story he is depicting, fights for understanding, causing him to hover in a multi-dimensional construction.<br /><br />There is the misconception that Gatsby is about the Roaring Twenties, the decade of sin and continuous partying that people partook in to overcome the catastrophic effects of the First World War. The glittery and undeniably sad actuality of this piece and time cannot be denied. However, what The Great Gatsby is truly about, where the irrevocable magic of the story extends from, is not the party scenes. It is not the mob allusions, the mansions, or the fancy cars. At its core, The Great Gatsby is about the transcendence of the human spirit, the innate connection of the individual with the universe, and its promised destruction. We witness this in Jay the moment before he kisses Daisy and then we watch as it is resigned and burned and Jay becomes in essence mortal, a demi-god who has relinquished his immortality for the physical.<br /><br />I will end this little ditty by informing my reader that Daisy is my favorite character and that she always has been. The reader can easily write her off as irritating and weak and she can be both of those things. However, that is not all of Daisy and to do so does not only comment on your own lack of empathy, but it is also an insult to Fitzgerald. Daisy is the great tragedy of the novel. To characterize her with her worst attributes is to reduce her to the mere shadow of a person, not acknowledging her as a full-bodied individual with potential. We as the reader have the privilege to see that potential rise once more from the ashes before collapsing in final defeat, submitting to the destiny that was created for her at birth by those who sought to dim the light that would continue to flicker, green across the bay, before disappearing forever into the fog.<br /><br />pageterror.wordpress.comGatsby is truly about, where the irrevocable magic of the story extends from, is not the party scenes.

It was written about the 20s and even in today's time it's still relatable and just plain amazing. The story is about a man named gatspy and his love daisy but it's told by the point of view of nick who happend to be daisys cousin and gastpys next door neighbor. The story is really about gastpys love for daisy and how all the parties that he does, everything he does really, it to get daisies attention. With the parties he has them becuase he wants her to go to one but he can't really tell her himself becuae they haven't spoken in years and also daisy is now married.  Gatspy basically does everything for her. Everything. He became rich for her so that they could be together. Becuase he was not a rich person before. The book just shows how he would do anything for her. And it's sad how when he would have parties at his house almost the whole town would go but in the end when he died no one went to his funeral. Not even daisy. Just nick went. And the movie adaptation did a really good job and portraying every emotion the the characters felt in the book. I think that it really stayed true to the book. And the sound track to the movie was just how I imagined it would be for the book. It's incredible. Especially Blythe song young and beautiful by Lana del ray. It is perfect for daisy and gastpys love	2014-07-02

Jay Gatsby builds a fortune, buys a mansion in fictional West Egg, NY, across the bay from Tom and Daisy Buchanan’s old-money mansion in East Egg.  In an effort to win back the girl he loves, Gatsby throws lavish parties, hoping Daisy will show, or at the least, that he will meet someone who knows her.  What follows is a story of wealth, marriage, excess and the romantic notion that you can repeat the past.<br /><br />Set in 1922, these characters live during the wild party atmosphere of the Roaring Twenties.  The Great Gatsby is about a time when new money moves into the old money world and about the contrasting lives of all classes, including the very poor who live in “the valley of ashes,” a desolate area between Long Island and the city.<br /><br />If you’ve never read The Great Gatsby, that’s enough to get you started.  Besides money, it’s a great story about love, romance, marriage and betrayal, with well-placed foreshadowing and a tragic plot-twist at the end.<br /><br />I hadn’t read The Great Gatsby since college and it was fun to go back and pick up on things I’m sure I missed way back then!  I think this is a great book to re-read because of the dialogue – Fitzgerald’s characters say a lot of things that mean a great deal more when you read the book a second or third time.<br /><br />Here are some of the things I liked this time:<br /><br />I like how Fitzgerald includes Jordan Baker’s character and how he suggests that Jordan has been dishonest in the past.  She seems smooth and professional and successful, but her small lies, at least regarding her golf game, still trail her, if you look closely.  Gatsby, also of questionable background, tells Nick that Jordan has a good reputation.  “Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right,” he says.<br /><br />I like all the foreshadowing with the cars and about driving and about accidents.  I like the discussions about being bad drivers and how the best way to avoid another bad driver is to pair up with a good driver.  I like the literal and symbolic parallels.<br />I love how, when Nick asks Gatsby what part of the Mid-West he’s from, he answers, “San Francisco.”  It’s a great example of showing how Gatsby is lying, rather than just saying so.<br /><br />The whole theme of past versus present and recreating the past is always a very interesting subject, because it’s emotional and romantic.  Gatsby is sure he can recreate the past, Nick isn’t so sure and Daisy, in the ultimate confrontation at The Plaza, says, “I can’t help what’s past,” crushing Gatsby’s dream.<br /><br />Nick Calloway’s strong desire to believe Gatsby, despite everything that suggests a dubious past.  When Gatsby finally explains his Oxford connection, Nick says, “I wanted to get up and slap him on the back.  I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.”<br /><br />I also like how Fitzgerald includes Meyer Wolfsheim’s character, who is based on the very real Arnold Rothstein.  (You can get an idea of what Rothstein was like by watching “Boardwalk Empire” – one of my favorite shows!)  Wolfsheim only appears a couple times, but his name comes up a lot and as the story goes on, he’s the key to knowing about Gatsby and how he’s made his money.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is a classic.  It wasn’t a success while Fitzgerald was alive. Some people love it, some don’t, and lots of high-schoolers read it in their English classes.  I enjoyed it very much and particularly liked comparing it to the movies made in 1974 and 2013.  Those movies are shockingly different, but similar in many ways.  But that’s tomorrow’s blog!<br />Here are a couple links that I found interesting:<br /><br />PBS website called The History Kitchen – an overview of Prohibition during the Roaring Twenties, The Great Gatsby, and a recipe for “The Bees Knees” cocktai<br />[...]<br /><br />Here’s something interesting about the original cover of The Great Gatsby:<br />[...]<br />The cover of the first printing of The Great Gatsby is among the most celebrated pieces of art in American literature. It depicts disembodied eyes and a mouth over a blue skyline, with images of naked women reflected in the irises. A little-known artist named Francis Cugat was commissioned to illustrate the book while Fitzgerald was in the midst of writing it. The cover was completed before the novel; Fitzgerald was so enamored with it that he told his publisher he had \\"written it into\\" the novel.  Fitzgerald's remarks about incorporating the painting into the novel led to the interpretation that the eyes are reminiscent of those of fictional optometrist Dr. T. J. Eckleburg (depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson's auto repair shop) which Fitzgerald described as \\"blue and gigantic – their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose.\\" Although this passage has some resemblance to the painting, a closer explanation can be found in the description of Daisy Buchanan as the \\"girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs.\\" Ernest Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that when Fitzgerald lent him a copy of The Great Gatsby to read, he immediately disliked the cover, but \\"Scott told me not to be put off by it, that it had to do with a billboard along a highway in Long Island that was important in the story.

With every turn of the page you will see that Fitzgerald spent many hours crafting each sentence in his novel. This is by far his most (or one of his most) polished novels, although there would have been more if he did not suffer an untimely death. And the plot of the story has almost become legendary although not surprising due to the popularization of the novel through Leo Dicaprio's big screen production. I highly recommend it not only because it is a classic American novel, but also because one can learn a lot from the insights that Fitzgerald sheds throughout the book.	2014-06-08

My favorite thing about the book was how it was narrated  by Nick Caraway. One who is not considered &#34; one of them.&#34; It gave the story more meaning because the events were described by  a more reliable character, rather than by one who may view the other characters as normal. The opinions were stated from a less biased opinion.  The book did also feel unique compared to the other books we read.  The overall meaning of the text was very deep. It made me really question and thing more about the American dream. I enjoy books that make me think, and I feel like it kept me curious and wondering the whole time. It incorporated big concepts such as love, social status, and satisfaction. it proves some misconceptions wrong, such as the common one of money bringing one happiness. Also, because there were multiple relationships going on between the different characters, the story line was deep. Nick and Gatsby, Gatsby and Daisy, Daisy and Tom, Tom and Myrtle, and so on. All of these intertwining connections made the story line complicated, and thus more interesting to read about.  Gatsby was also a different character. He is mysterious and unexpected, which helped to keep the readers anticipating  what happens next.  I enjoyed  how the  book contained several details that helped me to clearly visualize the scenes in my mind. I felt like I was in the 1920s. One thing i  did disliked about the book was the lack of suspense until the ending . It was interesting reading through the book, but it wasn't suspenseful enough. I felt myself losing interest at some points.  But all in all, The Great Gatsby  seems to me like one of those books that stick in the memories of individuals because of its dramatic ending and deep meaning.	2014-06-01

But one of the great classics it isn't.  It just isn't.<br />I rate it somewhere below Emily Dickinson's poems but above Barbara Cartland's pathetic scratchings.<br />It gets three stars simply for being unabridged and cheap enough that you won't be too put out when you find your child has covered it in pink highlighter.

US	50792655	RLVJOYGCIBS4F	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Review of The Great Gatsby by Kelly Vermandere on May 27, 2014	The Great Gatsby is a literary classic that will withstand the test of time through its uncommon rags to riches story. In the beginning of the story, F. Scott Fitzgerald illustrates the life of wealthy people living in the roaring twenties. His distinct style makes the lifestyle of Jay Gatsby seem appealing. The reader will soon realize that hidden behind the glamorous clothes, lavish parties, and flashy cars are just empty individuals. Much like the author and many people in today’s society, Jay Gatsby tries to use his pursuit of success and acceptance as a way to find happiness and revive his love with Daisy. The characters in this novel are flawed because they use dishonesty and greed in order to gain wealth. This novel is not just a tragic love story; it also shows the departure of society from the belief that the American dream is only achieved by working hard.<br /><br />This novel is significant because it made me re-evaluate my life. I began thinking about whether I am striving for a life full of money or happiness. The story of Jay Gatsby makes it clear that money can’t buy friends, happiness, or love.  I realized that everyone at some point in their life would have to decide if they are going to work towards their goals in an honest manner, or be dishonest like the characters in the story. Nick Carraway is used as the non-biased narrarator of the story who points out the dishonesty of the other characters. Unfortunately we don’t learn his story and how he became an honest man. This forces the readers to find out how to hold on to good values for themselves. The plot was excellent, but I found that the lessons I learned from the story made it unforgettable. The Great Gatsby is the type of novel that will cause readers to stay up late at night questioning how people today achieve the American dream.	2014-05-28

But stick with it.<br /><br />This is a great book, still relevant today. The book begins beautifully and after awhile I grew frustrated by the actions of some of the characters. This is as it was written to be. The behavior and lack of humanness from the Elite was a bit much to take, although quite realistic at times. The book really examines our choices in life and how some of us stick to them and other change with the wind, looking out for only their best interest.

Scott Fitzgerald.  It’s about a group of people, one specifically being Nick Carraway who gets dragged into the middle of the drama.  Nicks cousin, Daisy Buchanan is favored by two men being Jay Gatsby and Tom Buchanan.  Daisy’s best friend, Jordan Baker also follows along in the group and even begins a love interest in Nick.  My personal favorite character just so happens to be owl eyes because he’s a funny character in my opinion.  Owl eyes is my favorite guy because he just seems to funny and drunk, but I in this way he seems to be the only one who has kindness and I will explain more on this later.<br /> In the Great Gatsby, it is narrated by Nick Carraway, who is new to the area and first has dinner with Daisy, Tom, and Jordan.  The first part explains who they are, for example, tom explains how his book “The Rise of the Colored Empires” says that other races are taking over a white country.  This says that tom is extremely racist.  Daisy is with tom and even has a child with him, this is an example on even who she is as a person.  Daisy says that she hopes her child grows up to be a fool, this explains that she is arrogant, and even controlling.  Later towards the middle Gatsby throws a party and gets Jordan to ask Nick to ask Daisy to stop by Nick’s place without Tom.  Gatsby ends up fixing up Nick’s yard to display a good setting for Daisy.  Daisy and Gatsby are awkward at first but later when they are left alone they start showing a deeper relationship. Even later towards the end, Daisy runs over Myrtle and Gatsby gets the blame because tom mislead Myrtle’s husband, George Wilson.  George gets so upset he assassinates Gatsby and then himself.  Only a few people show up, but again Owl Eyes shows up to his funeral.<br /> The specific setting all the east egg is shown to be where the less rich people are.  The west egg is shown to be where the more rich people are, like where Daisy and Tom live.  Gatsby lives in the eastern egg along with Nick.  The group also goes into the city where some actual serious business happens between Tom and Gatsby.<br /> Some major conflicts are mainly based on the relationships between the ones in the group.  Gatsby was in love with Daisy even before Nick had reconnected with her.  Later Gatsby ended up separating from her and promised himself that Daisy was his true love.  After the separation between them, Tom ended up trying to steal Daisy back, and was almost winning her back.  Tome ended up finding out about the whole situation when Gatsby kisses her and he sees it.  Tome suggests that they go into the city, so that’s exactly where they went.  Daisy and Gatsby drive Tom’s car and Jordan, Tom, and Nick, took Gatsby’s yellow car.  This is important because Myrtle sees Tom in the car, so now she thinks its Rom’s car when it actually is Gatsby’s.  They get their gas and they head into the city where they all check into a hotel.  The group begins to talk and over time Gatsby and Tom begin to argue about and over Daisy.  Tom makes his point and allows Gatsby to drive Daisy home, knowing he made his point very clear.  Later, Tom, Jordan, and Nick, drove by the same gas station they did before except now it was a crime scene.  Myrtle was hit by a yellow car; George explains the car was yellow and that they hit her.  Tom also tries to explain that the car wasn’t his; he tries to get that into George’s head because Tom was the last to drive it.  Tom ends up telling George that the car was Gatsby’s.  This creates even bigger problems because George ends up going through a depression and ends up assassinating Gatsby while he’s swimming, and then kills himself.<br /> This book to me had a great impact on me because it had so much thought put into the plot.  Theauthor F. Scott Fitzgerald really did a great job with planning the story and giving so much detail to the characters.  Making the beginning, middle and end giving them all detail and a story that fits.  He gave many places on where they would go like the east egg, west egg, and the city.  He also added so much detail into the conflicts that revolved around the characters.  This book is amazing and really took me for a ride in all the conflicts and people it threw at me.  All in all, I really enjoyed this book and recommend this book to other people.author F. Scott Fitzgerald really did a great job with planning the story and giving so much detail to the characters.

F.Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is a story about self-made millionaire Jay Gatsby, who uses his vast wealth to buy his way into Long Island society.He provides parties  Most of all, Gatsby wants to win back the love of socialite Daisy Buchanan,now married to Tom Buchanan,who comes from a rich family. Calmly observing the passing parade is Nick Carraway, Gatsby's best friend,who acts as the narrator of the story.<br /><br />Fitzgerald's novel provides the reader a view about the decadence of a person brought about by materialism and the so-called American Dream.It obviously provides us a great view of the Roaring Twenties when this novel was written.Added to that,it also examines themes about love,betrayal,starting all over again and the recklessness of youth.No wonder it is a great read that many would surely enjoy and many Americans could relate to.If Jay Gatsby were alive today,he would have probably said &#34;This is a classic novel,Old Sport!!!&#34; when asked about it after reading the novel.	2014-05-13

Did anyone besides Nick have morals?<br /><br />Having never heard much about this story nor seeing the movie, everything was new and fresh to me and I was hoping for a different ending. Daisy was less likable as the story progressed, and I was actually hoping they weren't together as it neared the end.

I have to remember how much I loved this book before my English class gets into all kinds of symbolism and themes and meaning that'll make me forget there was even a story in the first place. I made that mistake with Huck Finn, but I can't make it with Gatsby; it's too good to deserve that. So here goes.<br /><br />First off: thank you, F. Scott Fitzgerald, for writing the one book in the world that can be read in a high school English class and still make bored teenagers wake up and pay attention. When I first began reading \\"The Great Gatsby\\", I cracked it open thinking I'd read a page or two just to see what it was like- and ten minutes later, my friends found me on the floor of the band room in a very uncomfortable position, still listening to Nick Carraway tell me about his flirty, empty-headed cousin Daisy, her husband Tom, who still lives in his glory days as a rugby player, and the fabulous Jordan Baker. I gobbled the book down before the rest of the class had gotten to chapter three. And boy, am I glad I did. I don't think I could take the suspense of waiting for everyone else to catch up. Who is this Gatsby fellow? How did he get money to burn so quickly? And why is he so interested in Nick and his friends?<br /><br />Chances are you know the answers to most of those, since the new movie just came out. But some of them are kickers. I thought I knew the whole plot of this story before I started, but a lot of the real plot twists wouldn't even make sense if I told you before you read it. You'll just have to wait and see like everyone else . . .<br /><br />But read the book. Please read the book. Leonardo DiCaprio can't give you the true wonder of Gatsby's famous smile, and Toby Maguire certainly won't have Nick's way (or is it Fitzgerald's?) of saying funny things in a serious way, which somehow makes them even funnier. When a car falls apart in a drunken man's hands, for example, \\"At least a dozen men . . . explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.\\" And Gatsby's guests \\"conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with an amusement park.\\" And almost every sentence is like that! It's like heaven for wordsmiths.<br /><br />You know what's really funny, though? I can't say I liked most of these characters. Daisy makes fruit flies look like professors, Tom was just an old has-been with dangerous amounts of money, and even Nick, the narrator, had too high an opinion of his own virtue. But I'm not sure we were supposed to like them. If Daisy had to be a twit, at least she was acknowledged to be so. Nick does own to some of his mistakes, if not all. But Jordan Baker, the professional golfer, was fabulous, as I've already said. And Gatsby- oh, Gatsby. He was so awkward and romantic and pathetic that I liked him in spite of myself. I imagined him with reading glasses in a couple of scenes, not because he needed them to see, but because I could so clearly see him polishing them, pushing them up on his nose, peering through them at people . . . I'll admit, I fantasized about yanking him away from Daisy and setting him up with a nice, sensible girl who would tone down the parties and make all those uninvited guests go back where they came from. What he needs is to be dragged out of the past, out of the dream with no more foundations than a castle in the air, and get his feet firmly on the ground again. But even with all that, he's fabulous, too.<br /><br />And so is the whole book. Enough babbling about Gatsby's glasses. You all probably think I'm mad, don't you? But given that Gatsby is something of a madman himself, who are you to judge? Even if I hate \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by the end of the year, I'll have the memory of loving it still.t wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.\\" And Gatsby's guests \\"conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with an amusement park.\\" And almost every sentence is like that!

This review is on my blog: http://bookchick2013.blogspot.ca/2014/02/review-great-gatsby-by-f-scott.html<br /><br />I watched the movie before I read the book. I actually had to read this book for book club and was great-full for the change of pace. The last book was over 500 pages and still took me a day to read either way, but I actually like The Great Gatsby's movie which was spot on the book. I was glad this was the book chosen for Book Club.<br /><br />I felt that Gatsby was a good character, but felt confused by him. He seemed to contradict himself in some situations but I felt he was a character developed well. He was by far one of my favourites in this book. my other favourite was probably Nick, the narrator. We knew the most about him, as it was from his point of view. I felt Nick was a good narrator as he would explain things that some audiences may not understand.<br /><br />Daisy's character seemed to be left to open in the end of the book. She was one of my least favourite characters because of the lack of love she shows for Gatsby in the end of the book and that made me lose all the respect I had for her. After seeing the ending in the movie, I had kind of hoped the book would be different but, like I said earlier the movie was spot-on.<br /><br />I was warned ahead of time I might have a hard time reading this because it was written &#34;way back when&#34; but honestly I had no problem reading it. I actually liked it more than I thought I would because it was one of the classics. I generally don't like classics for I feel it has a lack of romance, which I can't read a book without, but this one was actually really good.<br /><br />Rating: 6.9/10<br />Parental Rating: 14+	2014-04-23

It is a brilliant mix of romance and tragedy interwoven with an intricately crafted tale of the American society in the 1920s. Its engaging story, complex social themes, and memorable character portrayals have mesmerized the readers for almost a century.<br /><br />Many fiction books are merely for entertainment, but The Great Gatsby simultaneously entertains and informs its audience. It is a novel that combines the pleasures of the literary fiction with the American history. The Great Gatsby follows the  story of Daisy, her rustic husband Tom, and her wealthy former lover, Gatsby, whose mysterious personality and extravagant parties are a source of gossip. The entire story is narrated by Nick Carraway, a World War veteran who spends a summer in a rental house surrounded by the lavish mansions of his cousin Daisy. Over the course of the novel, Nick becomes caught up in the mechanism of many romantic triangles and acquires mature understanding of the life on the prosperous East Coast. The novel is set in the prosperous Long Island in 1920s, and it accurately depicts the social history of America in the roaring 20s. The era, particularly known for prosperity, jazz music, flapper culture and illegal activities is criticized by Fitzgerald in this novel.<br /><br />The engaging plot and fast paced writing excites the reader and makes it a thrilling adventure. Fitzgerald's description of rekindling of love between Daisy and Gatsby is fabulous--“His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God... Then he kissed her&#34;. It was also exciting to read about the extravagant parties &#34;where the lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun&#34; and the tension between Tom and Daisy. You can almost feel the exuberance of the parties as well as long lasting sadness due to the conflicts between the characters. The true essence of the novel comes not only from its plot, but also from its dynamic characters who handle themselves into complex situations.<br /><br />Fitzgerald uses characters as symbolic representations of the social trends in the 1920s. There are many characters, but one of the most dynamic is the title character himself-Jay Gatsby, who is the epitome of the Great American Dream. He is a self-made men who achieved the American dream of rising from the lower to upper class of the society, though by illegal means. The Great Gatsby introduces several themes that truly characterizes the American society in the 1920s. Fitzgerald portrays the roaring 20s as a decade of unprecedented prosperity, but he also describes it as a decade of decadence. The theme of social class is depicted throughout the novel which shows the development of class rivalry between “old” and “new” money due to minute differences.<br /><br />The language of the novel is accessible to both high school and college students. But, Fitzgerald's use of rhetorical devices such as symbolism could only be understood if one analyzes and reads critically. Since so many social issues are addresses in the novel, I believe this book appeals to a wide audience as many can make some personal connections with the characters and their struggles. I highly recommend this book to everyone before watching the movie.re the lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun&#34; and the tension between Tom and Daisy.

Characters are defined by their attitudes and behaviors and there is not a word used to excess.

His perception of people in general and the distortions and corruption of society gave him an entire new perspective of life and what really matters in it. Nick lived an entire summer with a false impression of the people around him, and it was only until numerous deaths that everyone’s true intentions began to show. At the end, Nick, disgusted and dismayed, leaves the East Egg, which he finds no longer attractive and moves West, never to see his “friends” again.	2014-04-01

Gatsby is one of few books that I will read over and over again. It is a classic for a reason. There are many aspects about Gatsby that ring true in today's world. People are still entitled, self-absorbed, and live an excess of life. Fitzgerald describes this falsity or a lack of reality within what is truly real, and his characters, like Tom and Daisy, are deplorable. His words are poetic, and visceral, and not many authors can write with such passion. This is Fitzgerald's magnum opus.	2014-03-31
US	39728907	RE68WO4WLJK43	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Not my type of thing	This is a book about multiple people having multiple affairs and doing other such immoral things. I did appreciate the descriptive writing style/the light that things were described in (for example &#34;her voice is money&#34;), because it gave a sort of dreamy feel to the novel. Aside from that, though, it was difficult to make myself keep reading (and I only stuck to it because I felt obligated to read it as several friends had said it was good) and I have to admit that nearer the end I sort of skimmed it, just to finish. Also, I never understood what was really so 'great' about Gatsby.<br />I'm not denying that it's a good book (it's a classic; it has to be good), I'm just saying that I can't see very much of that good in it, and that others like me might not, either.	2014-03-30

I really only knew the name and when the story was set.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Telling the story from the chosen POV seems hard to pull off, but Fitzgerald did it with ease.  The characters have depth and the scenes flow easily from one to the next.  I was impressed at how much secondary plot he was able to include in such a short work.<br /><br />I can see now why this story is often studied.  There is plenty to learn from the story itself, and  much to learn about writing, too.	2014-03-30

US	42460865	RB262A7EZATTW	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Must read	Great Gatsby is a romantic drama that takes place in the 1920s in New York City. A young man moves from Minnesota to New York to live the American dream and finds himself being impacted by an older man who comes to play a huge role in his life. This book was never required for me in high school, but with the new movie out, I thought it would be a great read. The book has many strengths that truly draw its readers in. One of those strengths is the symbolism used throughout the entire book. For example, Fitzgerald uses colors throughout his book to symbolize a variety of things. Another strength is the emotion pull it has on its readers. Fitzgerald does a great job, playing on his reader’s heart strings as he plays out the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy as well as Gatsby and Nick.  One quote in particular demonstrates this relationship between Gatsby and Nick: “He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.” Great Gatsby was an amazing book! It was enjoyable to read and something I would definitely recommend to everyone!	2014-03-22

The author uses some foreshadowing and provides some peeks backward during the book. Jay Gatsby is presented as a man of mystery who gives the most lavish parties. West Egg is a rich community where neighbors try to outdo each other in garrulous displays of wealth. Gatsby lives like a king for a time and he is the toast of the town. Underneath the grandeur, trouble is simmering. Many of the characters in the book are living in the fast lane and breaking all the rules.<br /><br />Marital relationships are not honored and many are having affairs. Tom Buchanan has a nice life with wife Daisy. The relationship has gone sour despite a child. Tom is abusive and has an affair with Myrtle Wilson. The two get in an argument and he slugs her. Buchanan has reactionary ideas about racial hierarchy and he is a villian in the book. Gatsby was Daisy's former beau and he has designs on winning her heart.<br /><br />Nick Carraway is the narrator who gets caught up in the mess. He watches the various train wrecks unfold. He is interested in a female golf pro Jordan Baker, but he is more of a passive observer in the action. Gatsby is his neighbor who confides in him and Nick gradually learns about his past. Gatsby was once a man of little means who was fortunate enough to befriend a wealthy benefactor. This gave Gatsby his start and Jay got involved in some organized crime pursuits on his way to the top.<br /><br />Gatsby had a mercurial rise and fall. He was frustrated in his attempt to get Daisy to leave Tom. Daisy ran over Tom's mistress in a sportscar. Gatsby defended her and took the hit on that rap. Mr. Wilson confronted Gatsby because he thought it was he who ran over his spouse. Jay killed Mr. Wilson and the novel ends with Gatsby losing everything.<br /><br />The story is compelling and interesting. Fitzgerald's characters were morally bankrupt while many were quite successful in material ventures. Gatsby was a brave soldier in World War I, but he did not display the same kind of character in ammassing a fortune and living in selfish hedonism. The community as whole were disillusioned. None of the social relationships are healthy. Even the hallowed bonds of matrimony were not exempt. Fitzgerald makes one question whether unbridled materialism can be fulfilling. Most of the characters are swallowed up by the excesses of the day.rld War I, but he did not display the same kind of character in ammassing a fortune and living in selfish hedonism.

From a writing standpoint, it's rather brilliant and easy to see why it's considered to be a classic, but that doesn't make it entertaining. The glimpse into the time in the 1920s was definitely well-captured, but that alone wasn't enough to make me truly like the book. It's fortunate it's so short, or else I wouldn't have finished it. As it is, I don't regret doing so, but I also cannot recommend it, unless one is simply looking for a look at life at that time in history.	2014-01-27

I didn’t find anything particularly exceptional about it, and I don’t see why it’s so great.  Not to say this is a bad novel, I just don’t find it extraordinary.  The plot is pretty pedestrian.  Gatsby has attained wealth through illegal means, makes his moves on the love of his life who married a tyrant for money, bad things happen, which ultimately lead to Gatsby’s demise.  Reading further about the novel, it is supposed to be a great representation of the excesses of the time.  Maybe so, but it’s not much better or more representative than a dozen things I have watched or read about the twenties.  Gatsby is good as a character, but many of the other characters, especially Daisy leave me ambivalent.  This was a decent novel, but the greatness of it is overstated.<br />Carl Alves – author of Reconquest: Mother Earth	2014-01-23

I just can’t get over how connected the main two male characters are in this story, even though they are adults.

This book is based off of the 1920 time period which F. Scott Fitzgerald dubbed “The Jazz Age”. The overall point of view in this novel is Nick Carraway narrating in both first and third person, presenting only what he himself observes. Nick alternates and changes in some sections where he presents events, as they appeared to him at the time. The tone of this novel was really well shown and written. The tone was Nick’s attitudes toward Gatsby and Gatsby’s story is contradictory. At times he seems to disapprove of Gatsby’s of manners and ethics, but he also admires Gatsby. Nicks charter changes in the story he goes from a new guy just moving in to Minnesota looking to continue his job to being invited to Gatsby’s party.<br /> The book overall I did like. There were just some minor things that I did not care for. I also am not a big fan of the time period the setting in the book was based off of. I am more in to the modern time period of writing. If you enjoy the earlier time period of writing style then you will definitely enjoy this book. I would recommend this book to just about anybody. F. Scott Fitzgerald did an absolute wonderful job at writing this book. I did enjoy reading this book.	2014-01-09
US	24427276	R300S8JE2TTY5P	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Read it.	The Great Gatsby is probably one of the better novels by F. Scott Fitzgerland’s is full of drama, love and a lot of excitement based in the 1920’s. I truly enjoy the descriptive ways that things were explained. It is good for anyone that doesn’t want to read a long book and it has great suspense that can keep you on the edge of your seat. Like much of Fitzgerald's prose, it is neat and well--crafted. Fitzgerald seems to have had a brilliant understanding of lives that are corrupted by greed and incredibly sad and unfulfilled. The novel is a product of its generation--with one of American literature's most powerful characters in the figure of Jay Gatsby, who is urbane and world-weary. Gatsby is really nothing more than a man desperate for love. It is a magnificent novel on every level. Fitzgerald writes about the Jazz Age in language that beautifully evokes music. He writes about a hot day in a way that almost makes you sweat. His characters are well-drawn, and the plot is engaging and fast-paced. Though this novel is possibly best appreciated by college-level readers, advanced high school students will find a lot to enjoy and discuss.	2014-01-09

It is a story about corruption, greed and the eventual and ultimate transmutation of the soul into the hands of a pandering god of lust. The Great Gatsby is a reminder to us all that real happiness has absolutely nothing to do with wealth, and that even in the sad and dismal death of Gatsby himself, we are reminded that the only true value in his life was that ephemeral dream for which he lived to fulfil and to which he was irrevocably loyal even though it still evaded him to his last dying breath.	2014-01-04

US	12435961	R29H0BH7BGJ2WI	068416325X	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A Classic	This brief novel about a hopeless, lovesick romantic, the Great Gatsby of the title, is full of all the longing, materialism, craziness, desperation, and need for acceptance you can find in American life and history, what Fitzgerald has narrator Nick Carraway refer to as “spectroscopic gayety”. Its characters have become classic American types: Tom Buchanan the rich Yale football player jerk; his wife Daisy the ultimate trophy wife in her white roadster with her green dock light and a voice full of money; Jordan Baker, the desiring and desirable miscreant golfer; and Nick Carraway the bitter narrator, who had so many advantages, who turned to the unending work of learning the bond trade but who got drawn into the life of Gatsby with devastating consequences for his own worldview, deeply divided though his reaction is to the unfolding tragedy he witnesses. Uniting them all at the endless parties he throws at his Long Island estate is Gatsby whose love is undying, whose idealism is perfect, whose faith in himself is limitless and whose love for Daisy means everything to him. His determination to repeat the past and win back the love of Daisy puts in motion a tragedy even his vast fortune can’t derail. The vision of this novel is deeply moral, but the novel is also poetic in its appreciation for what characterizes American life, its particular beauty and depravity. Add to that the regional theme of Middle Westerners living on the East coast, and the vivid setting of the the wild parties of New York, and what you have is a novel which expresses an attractive though highly critical summation of the American character.	2013-12-25

All the events in the story were so gritty and dramatic like in the West, but covered up with poise and glamour from the East. It’s not the most heart-wrenching book I ever read, but it’s certainly the most interesting. These five main characters are all so different but so connected and intertwined at the same time, like an unbroken line of understanding. I think my favorite part was how the entire story was narrated from the outside looking in. Nick Caraway is a 29 year old business man who seems very boring but is rather just shy and being boring feels safe for him. He likes his comfort zone. Gatsby however, is outlandish, extravagant, eccentric, and always charming. He has this sense that life should always be dramatic and full of amazement. He loves to live every day like it’s his last, but the sad part is he feels he needs to be wealthy to do that. Lucky for him he is, hence the wildest parties Long Island has ever seen. I like how Nick is the put together one while Gatsby seems most perfect. To me watching these two characters develop was most interesting. They basically went through the same life, just one simple and careful and the other exorbitantly and haphazardly. I compared their mannerisms and ideals, dreams and fears. Nick was the one who needed to explore life, while Gatsby needed something more down to earth. All in all, you’ll never forget a party a Jay Gatsby’s house.	2013-12-19

It goes without saying that it is one of the greatest American novels of all time. The point of view of Nick Carraway is what makes Gatsby so unique. He leads us into a world of complicated characters whose motivations are clear to everyone but themselves. The story reads as a bit of a mystery and a tragedy. The reader can't help but ask: who is Gatsby? A question that is only answered with his downfall.	2013-11-30

Though the story is well-written, I just could not bring myself to care about what happened to anyone in this novel. Some of the figurative and symbolic language is lovely and effectively used, but the characters were mostly shallow. I guess that's the point, they are selfish people who chase after riches and happiness without ever truly finding it. Daisy is initially presented as the perfect woman, as seen through the eyes of Nick and Jay. It is only as the story progresses that the reader realizes that Daisy is a user of people. She draws them in and spits them out. This story could be just as easily set in present day as the 1920's with young people grasping for wealth and popularity in place of anything meaningful in life. I suppose this timelessness is what makes it a classic, but I have read so many books that were more enjoyable.	2013-11-27

But recently I read so much about what a great book it is that I gave it another shot. I still don't understand what all the hubbub is about. It's a decent storyline but nothing particularly unique. You can read the other reviews if you want a summary of it. But if you're we're in the same boat I was, don't bother reading it again. There's a little bit of a plot twist. But then again a lot of books have plot twists. One book by a highly respected author that did live up to the hype was &#34;A Farewell to Arms&#34;.	2013-11-24

Scott Fitzgerald reveals the concepts of love, wealth, and social class. This novel had my mind in separate places at first because of the confusing text. Fitzgerald’s quality of writing made each page suspenseful and made me dig deeper into the text. This was quite an excellent novel and his writing makes me want to read more and more of his books.<br />The creative text kept me on my toes and made me want to read every single page. The book is narrated from the point of view of Nick Carraway but sometimes changed to the point of view of other characters. The book takes place in the roaring twenties at a time of prosperity and wealth. Because of Gatsby’s immense wealth, the parties he throws every Saturday make the scenes very descriptive. This book demonstrates descriptive qualities of the relevant topics during the twenties that make the time period more interesting. It shows how the people lived, acted, and the societal ways of the community.<br />The Great Gatsby was by far one of the best novels I have read. Although the text was quite confusing in the beginning, I eventually was deeply involved in the later text. There were many mysteries that the reader may have to deeply think about to further understand the text. Overall, it was a great read and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves great writing and descriptive text	2013-11-20

It was bound rather poorly, the back cover was cut too short width wise, and it's over all, rather flimsy.<br /><br />The pages are secured well, but it just looks like too much glue was used when securing all the pieces together.

Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece is written from the point of view of a narrator Nick Carraway in the 1920s. Nick has just moved to his new house in wealthy area of West Egg on Long Island. His neighbor, Jay Gatsby, appears to be a shady figure and throws huge parties every weekend in his mansion. Nick goes to lunch one day with his cousin Daisy and her husband Tom when he is introduced to a girl named Jordan with whom he becomes romantic. Some time passes and Nick receives an invitation to one of Gatsby's parties where he meets Gatsby himself and they become very friendly. Gatsby admits to Nick that he was in love with Daisy many years ago in Louisville and he wants to bring back their relationship although she is now married and asks Nick for help with getting to meet her again. Tom begins to be suspicious of his wife even though he is having an affair with Myrtle. He forces a confrontation in New York City and accuses Gatsby of doing illegal things for his fortune and sends him and Daisy back to West Egg. On the way, Gatsby and Daisy's car hits and kills Myrtle. Tom then goes to Gatsby's house and kills him and himself. Nick then ends his relationship with Jordan and moves back to the Midwest.<br /> This is no doubt The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest novels of all time and for good reason. The amount of detail that is put into every scene and every character is immeasurably perfect. This subject of writing was very critical of the time period and attempted to get a huge point across on the nature of people. Nick's nature was supposed to represent the good in people while Gatsby's was meant to be the greediness of people. Symbolism is also a big part of why the story is so important. For example, when Nick sees Gatsby reaching for the green light at the end of the dock, he is actually reaching for money and wealth represented by the color green. It also represents optimism. Another example of symbolism is the changes in weather. Rain is an indication that something bad is going to happen. For example, when Daisy and Gatsby first meet it is raining but as they get more comfortable with each other the sun comes out. Another reason that this novel is so deep is the character development. People speculate that Gatsby has gone to Oxford and that he has done other amazing things in his life and this adds to his mysteriousness. Later on, it becomes known that Gatsby is actually a college dropout from Nebraska who learned his money-making skills from the copper mogul Dan Cody. His habitual lying develops Gatsby's personality as being immoral. I would recommend this book to other readers because it provides an interesting point of view on the world through the eyes of Nick Carraway. It has a strong message about human nature and contains deep symbolism that will provides a true metaphor for ourselves.olism is the changes in weather.

US	26955693	RM4XCMZRPV8E6	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The Great Gatsby	The Great Gatsby by F.Scott Fitzgerald is the intriguing story of multi-millionaire Jay Gatsby, seen in the eyes of Nick Carraway, the narrator of the story. It is set in the Jazz Age, a time in American history when jazz music and dance became popular. The plot mainly revolves around the love-triangle between Jay Gatsby, Daisy Buchanan, and Tom Buchanan. Most of the book is focused on Gatsby's goal of getting Daisy to be his wife. His goals only end up causing him to die after a series of unfortunate events.<br /> While reading through The Great Gatsby, I could not help but feel sorry for the pitiful character of Jay Gatsby. His thoughts had become so deluded, that the only thing that he thought about was Daisy. This becomes apparent when he spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered after they had run over Myrtle. To me, Jay Gatsby embodies the hollowness of the American dream. He was rich, young, handsome, and successful, yet his dreams ended in failure.<br /> I loved how the book was set in Nick's perspective instead of any other person in the story. His position as a bystander to the plot and his down-to-earth personality really allows readers to empathize with him. It makes you feel as if you were within that time period, dealing with the problems that Nick was facing. I also loved the fact that the book in general has incredible imagery, and that each sentence is written down to the last detail. With every page that I flipped, I not only learned more about the story, but also about the environment within the story. The book gave such elaborate descriptions that it really made me feel like I was part of the story. One example of this was when Nick listed the names of all the people who came to Gatsby's house during the summer. Little to none of them had the slightest significance in the story, but it put life into the text.  All of these elements mixed together so perfectly, which made me understand why The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest classics of all-time.<br /> I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 14 with an interest in the Jazz Age, romance novels, or a combination of the two.t classics of all-time.<br /> I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 14 with an interest in the Jazz Age, romance novels, or a combination of the two.	2013-10-31

I fell in love with the movie when I saw it a few weeks ago, but I was skeptical that I would be disappointed in the comparison between the book and the film. To my surprise, they were both very similar, the film bringing the book to life. What I truly enjoyed about the book was the enchantment of the characters. They weren't necessarily personified as magical characters, but as people who have majestic personalities. The way Gatsby himself is such a hidden being for the first chapter of the book is what really kept me reading and engaged with the text. The ending was a bit of turn around, a downfall for the reader. With the way the author set the story up, the reader tends to lean towards a certain character based upon their opinion. In my case, I leaned more towards Gatsby's point of view, mostly because I loved the way he waited so long for his long-lost love. The book is a fantastic read that will keep you up at night trying to finish each chapter! I'd recommend it to anyone from age 15 and up.	2013-10-29

The book centers around the mysterious character of Jay Gatsby, as his history unfolds before your eyes you come to the conclusion that he may not be the person you think he is. The narrator, Nick Carraway, who is originally from the Midwest, is the neighbor of Gatsby (Gatsby-who throws extravagant parties), and is the person who discoveries the mysteries of Gatsby. Nick has a romance with Jordan who is a corrupt golfer. As you read Jay Gatsby is still in love with a woman from his past, Daisy. Gatsby and Daisy rekindle their love in the book and soon start an affair. The Great Gatsby is a great book for anyone to read. Author, Fitzgerald uses details that make you feel like you have been taken to a different time period. The book will put you in an emotional rollercoaster. You will dream of wanting love like the book, laugh at awkward encounters, and be shocked on nearly every page. You will be immersed with enjoyment, laughter, and sadness. I really loved the way that Fitzgerald developed the characters. I thought that the book was a good quick and easy read that will make a lasting impression in your mind.	2013-10-18

Although The Great Gatsby is thrilling and emotional it can also be a boring book at times. Many parts of the book involve a man named Nick telling a story that a person writes as he tells it. The book was fairly easy to read except for a few challenging words here and there. The book is a classic so the way people spoke when it was written is different than what we speak. The Great Gatsby is a book about a middle aged man named Jay Gatsby. Jay moved to a house next to a man named Nick, because he wanted to be close to a woman named Daisy. Gatsby and Daisy go back to about five years before when they were in love. Gatsby went to the army and then Daisy married someone else. Everything from there involves lots of parties and something so unexpected that i cannot say and that you will have to read yourself. Overall i gave The Great Gatsby a four out of five because it was a really good book that was emotional and a very thrilling read. I did not give it a five because the book can be a little boring. I recommend this book for ages 13 and above. I recommend that you read this great classic.	2013-10-13

Just like everyone else, I read this book in high school.  Just like everyone else, I didn't get much out of it back then.  I remember \\"Blah, blah, blah, Jazz Age\\" and \\"Blah, blah, blah, symbolism\\" and \\"Blah, blah, blah, foreshadowing\\".  The problem was never with this book; the problem was the way that literature was taught.  If I could have just read the book cover to cover on my own, I would have enjoyed it so much more.  So, when I was in my twenties, I did, and then bought a whole lot more Fitzgerald.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby IS about the Jazz Age.  There is strong symbolism in this book -- the green light. And there is quite a bit of foreshadowing (and foreboding) in this book -- \\"the all-seeing eyes\\".  But there is also layer upon layer of wonderful in this book.<br /><br />When I first read this book, I wasn't the least bit sympathetic toward Daisy.  Now, almost thirty years later, I do have some sympathy, but it is limited.  When I first read this book, I didn't even really think about the child, much like Gatsby doesn't.  Now, when I have a child, I kept wondering what happened to her.  And that, I think, is the genius of this book and Fitzgerald's writing.<br /><br />Like Jane Austen before him, he is excellent at portraying his times and making his character breathe by having them speak and act in a way that is so very real.  I can relate to this book at different times in my life because I can relate differently to all the characters (and symbolism) at different times in my life.  I'm older now than Daisy, Gatsby, Tom and Nick.  I can stand back and know what will happen before it does happen, and I can change nothing.  I am \\"the all-seeing eyes\\".	2013-09-28
US	18689843	R7EOFBTZ74LY0	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A truly quality piece of writing	Now that, my dear friends - is a piece of quality writing.<br /><br />*MINI REVIEW:*<br /><br />This book left me speechless - the writing style, the characters and the overall cohesiveness of the storyline was amazing and well thought-out<br /><br />We are told of the events occurring in Jay Gatsby's life from the perspective of one of his close friends Nick Carraway. I found this quite an interesting approach and perspective which suited the book well. The novel is full of vivid imagery and the language that Fitzgerald uses had me in awe with his ability to pull the reader so deeply into the story.<br /><br />This book did have a tragic end unfortunately, and things do not exactly end on a bright and rosy note. In a way Fitzgerald made everything so cleverly ironic that you come to think that really, everything ended just as it should have.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this as one of the must-reads and best literary classics of the 20th century!	2013-09-27

When I asked my sister she said it wasn't and it is a very famous book. In this book it has very good characters, a well-done plot, and good word choice. It is a fiction book that can also be classified a somewhat mystery. The story is set in the fictional town of West and East Egg, in New York. The time period is in the 20's or 30's, so there is vibrant music and attitudes.<br />  In this book you will encounter many well-planned characters. To name a few characters you will encounter Nick Carraway, Tom Buchanan, Daisy, and Jay Gatsby. All of the characters twist into the good plot that The Great Gatsby gives you.<br />  In the end this is a pretty good novel. I would recommend it to a person that likes fiction and some mysteries. I liked it enough to give it a good four stars!	2013-09-18

Scott Fitzgerald I felt compelled to read the novel.  Searching online for the best deal on a legitimate website I happened to come across amazon.com for the best deal.  For the incredible low price of six dollars and sixty-seven cents you can purchase a terrific story about a man doing everything he can to win back a long lost lover.  The book was hands down phenomenal keeping my attention to the very last sentence.  The novel was driven by symbolism, romanticism, and well written tragedy.  This novel has countless symbols and messages that explain relations between rich and poor.  The most famous message would have to be \\"rich girls don't marry poor boys\\" which is ironically found in the first movie adaption.  This movie is a perfect gift for anybody who wants to enjoy a beautifully illustrated story that shares how wealth affects the poor.  I personally think this movie has an indirect relation to the one percent and ninety percent wall street battle. The novel really focused on character development which brings you into the story.<br /> I absolutely loved reading F Scott. Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby from the first sentence to the last.  This book was so deep and emotional with I felt an unexplainable connection with the characters.  I reread the novel three times and watch the movie twice because it was just that good.  I submerged myself in tragic and romantic story about one man blinded by love willing to do anything to reconnect with a former flame.  All of my close friends and family honestly love reading this book after I recommend The Great Gatsby.  As soon as I received my online ordered novel book I couldn't put it down.  Each day my nose would be deep into the pages until I was completely finished.  Scott Fitzgerald fully grasped my attention a completely original masterpiece.  I envy F. Scott Fitzgerald for having the effort and ability to write such a perfect book that reached more than millions of people.  As you can most likely tell I very much enjoyed reading this deep and awe inspiring story and would recommend it to everyone.<br /> The Great Gatsby has received much well deserved attention in all of its movie deals, awards, and even as a reading assignment at the high school level.  This phenomenal story has received an extensive amount of attention from coast to coast.  F Scott Fitzgerald owns the title of literary genius.  Oprah Whinfrey has even read this popular book and had been chosen for her book club in the past.  This tremendous story is loved by many and enjoyed by all.  Big time actors were jumping for the chance to be a part of The Great Gatsby movie, for example the Leonardo Dicaprio.  If there are two large production movies on it you know it has to be good.  Hands down this novel is proudly recognized as one of the greatest stories ever told in American literature.<br /> The Great Gatsby is such a terrific novel for such a low price on Amazon.  This story is filled with universal messages of wealth and poverty.  This portrays how the less fortunate value and worship the rich, but the same idolization is not returned.  After tragedy strikes a two of the main characters pack their bags and leave the city without concern nor empathy.  One message conveyed that peaked my own  interest is that \\"rich girls don't marry poor boys\\".  This made me think about all the famous relationships and power couples in Hollywood .  The Great Gatsby is truly a unique story that encourage everyone to purchase.  If I had to rate this story it would get five out of five stars in my eyesthan millions of people.

It eluded us then, but that's no matter -- tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning -- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\"<br /><br />This was possibly the only novel that I've read twice: its English prose is so concise, so beautiful, so symbolic, and so dreamy that it really puts you in a good, movie-like, mode.<br /><br />And beside the beautiful prose, there are fresh colors everywhere: Daisy's \\"golden\\" hair and \\"silver\\"-ish cloth, Gatsby's pink suits, the green light and the blue one, the yellow car, the green tickets, the gold-hatted lovers, windows with reflected sunshine gold, the foamy pink and golden clouds, and it just goes on and on.<br /><br />I won't tell you it's a classic \\"must read\\", you'll have to judge that by your own. Just enjoy the quoted novel prose below, they're just beautiful, even on their own:<br /><br />Daisy's voice: \\"It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered 'Listen,' a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.\\"<br /><br />Jordan's face: \\"The last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened -- then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\\"<br /><br />The cat: \\"The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and turning my head to watch it ... fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars ... it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.\\"<br /><br />Gatsby's party: \\"The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher... The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.\\"<br /><br />Gatsby's smile and obsession with winning people over: \\"It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across 4 or 5 times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.\\"<br /><br />Great bridge: \\"Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.\\"<br /><br />Daisy: \\"'Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?' The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.\\"<br /><br />The window scene: \\"The rain was still falling,but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea. 'Look at that,' she whispered, and then after a moment: 'I'd like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.'\\"<br /><br />The rich and the poor: \\"All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air' One thing's sure and nothing's surer. The rich get richer and the poor get-- children In the meantime, in between time--\\"<br /><br />That beautiful voice: \\"Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again.

Scott Fitzgerald (1896 -- 1940) published his third novel, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" in 1925.  Although it received mixed reviews at first and did not sell well, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" soon became recognized as one of the \\"Great American Novels.\\" In terms of sales, the novel is rated #1 in Amazon's classics, and it has garnered well over 3000 Amazon reader reviews. I have recently had the opportunity to reread several great American works of fiction including Fitzgerald's novel.<br /><br />It was a fresh but difficult experience to return to this novel after many years. I remember reading it quickly and, almost surely, superficially when I was younger. While short, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" proved surprisingly dense and difficult upon rereading. With the beautiful, shimmering, and impressionistic writing comes many characters, scenes and a great deal of complexity. The book cannot be read solely as a story of the shallowness of the Jazz Age or reduced to a slogan about the failings of the American dream.<br /><br />Fitzgerald's novel is set in the summer of 1922 in Long Island, in a fictitious suburb of New York City called West Egg and in New York City itself.  There are two primary characters.  The first is the narrator, Nick Carraway, who turns 30 during the course of the work. A midwesterner and a graduate of Yale, Carraway moves to New York City following service in WW I with the aim of becoming a bond salesman. Carraway both plays a role in the story he tells and stands aloof from it. Carraway is a reliable narrator. The reader is encouraged to see him as balanced and thoughtful, much like Ishmael, the narrator of \\"Moby Dick\\".<br /><br />The other primary character is Jay Gatsby. There is a temptation to think of Gatsby as middle-aged and jaded, but he is only a few years older than Carraway and trim and athletic.  Gatsby lives in a large, ostentatious house adjacent to Carraway's small rented home in West Egg and throughs lavish parties throughout the summer attended by celebrities in which illicit liquor run freely. Rumors abound about Gatsby's past and about the sources of his wealth. These issues gradually and tellingly get revealed during the course of the novel.<br /><br />Born in poverty, young Gatsby worked hard with a determination to pull himself up.  As a young man, he fell in love with the wealthy Daisy, a distant cousin of Carraway's, but the relationship was interrupted by WW I. Daisy didn't wait for Gatsby but instead dated other men and married Tom Buchanan, a wealthy and extraordinarily boorish man, and a classmate of Carraway's at Yale.  When the Buchanan's move to a mansion in East Egg, Gatsby buys his property on West Egg and stares and dreams of his lost love, Daisy, just across the bay.<br /><br />Wealth and Daisy become conflated for Gatsby. The story, among much else, works into a triangle between Tom and Gatsby for Daisy's affection. After Fitzgerald masterfully sets the stage and develops the situation, the novel works to a tragic resolution. Through Carraway, the book meditates on the nature and shortcomings of Gatsby's version of the American dream with its pursuit of money, ostentatiousness, romance, and fixity on the past. But Gatsby with his ambition, love, and what Carraway describes as \\"an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again\\" also receives a strongly positive portrayal.  The first few pages of the novel, in which Carraway, two years after the fact, recounts his memories of Gatsby and describes the story to follow are critical to the book.  In the opening lines, Carraway recounts a lesson from his father which becomes emblematic in responding to the story of Gatsby.<br /><br />\\"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone\\" [my father] told me, \\"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages you've had.\\"<br /><br />Fitzgerald's novel offers a beautifully drawn amd precise portrayal of America during the 1920s. There is a sense of transience and life at the surface in the story, but such a life comes in contact with tragedy and depth. The novel is graceful, enigmatic and probing. The book may make an impression on young people, who are frequently force-fed it in school, but it repays revisiting, without pressure by readers later in life. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" deserves its status is one of the great works of American literature.<br /><br />Robin Friedmane portrayal of America during the 1920s.

The renewed hype on this classic made it a choice for a book club, and I'm glad it did.  My review is not based on how much I liked the characters or how wonderful the story was, but rather on how well the author wrote what he had to say. Most of the characters are not very likeable, and a couple are plain disgusting.  I spent the entire book wondering why Nick put up with Tom and Daisy, when he seemed to have so many admirable qualities, and why he stood by, even abetting, behavior he didn't believe in.<br />But the story was so thought provoking, and had so much to say about how much character matters, and how important it is to place your aspirations and future hopes on substance.  The one happy result seemed to be that Nick learned that lesson from the tragedy of his friend, Gatsby.<br />Reading the book decades after its publication also sheds light on F.Scott Fitzgerald's own short and often tragic life.	2013-08-27

It is the only book I know of that is complete: not a word should be cut, or added. It has a palpable mood in which the reader in engulfed: decadence, melancholy, longing, hope, failures, dreams, and an unflinching striving for something purer in a world that wants to drag us into its arrogant and indifferent corruption. Gatsby is THE romantic hero, and Nick the sensitive observer on whom the moral foundation of the book rests. The symbolism is simple and works unobtrusively. I love this book and have read it several times now. It is like a great painting or scene that holds in its smallest details the universal design or chaos if that be the paradox.<br />Reading some of the reviews I find people's opinions varying greatly. Some very intelligent people dislike it, even hate it while others love it, or think it good. The same can be said of not so intelligent people. As Nick puts it: \\"I was within and witout, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexaustible variety of life.\\"<br />Do not be too greatly influenced by reviews or the book's reputation, simply read it and decide for yourself. In the end considering how short the novel is, how accessible, and if nothing else(I personally think it is much more) a literary phenomenon, it is worth reading for anyone interested in novels and literature	2013-08-26

I've always wanted to read it- so when the movie came out this year, I decided it was high time I read the book before seeing the movie. I wanted to understand what all the fuss was about. Well, I'm still trying to figure that out. The Great Gatsby is a depiction of the Jazz Age and all of the opulence from that time. The characters all live in NY and Gatsby is a mysterious man who throws wild parties and is exorbitantly wealthy. The novel is a quick read that takes you on a fictional and historical journey. I think this book may have been a great work of fiction during its time, but I'm really not sure why it's still considered a classic today.	2013-08-23

I read this book for my American literature class back in collage, and I loved it so much. The whole idea of the rise of the new rich after the World War reminds me much of what has happened to Kuwait after the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait took place in the 1990. Much has changed in the status of people in society, somewhat I could relate much to the novel from what I have seen and heard of changes in Kuwait compared to what happened in America.<br /><br />The novel is very well-written and describes the crises of what people go through and what the American society went through at the time. The character of Gatsby is fascinating filled with mystery and adventure, yet at times one would sympathize with the character at time especially the beginning of his life. People at the time had to make an appearance of being rich to cope with survival in the environment of the fortunate ones.<br /><br />The green light Gastby used to see from his house at Daisy's house resembles his dream to live with her, very much associated with the \\"American Dream\\" and the \\"Green\\" land of which the first settlers in America saw.<br /><br />Much to be discussed about such a great American Novel.

I gave the book two stars because Fitzgerald's style was brilliant and he could capture the mood and setting, but there was not one character in the book that was likeable or I felt any sympathy for. Even the narrator is shallow. It is bad when the girlfriend who cheats at golf is the closest anyone in the book can come to being a sympathetic character. In places, where the endlessly boring recitation of Gatsby's history with Daisy goes on and on I found myself skimming pages, hoping that something interesting would happen. I think the author was trying to make a statement about the pathetic, useless lives and desperate attempts at finding meaning in their lives, these people suffered, but he succeeded all too well.	2013-08-21

I have been persistent in searching for its value. I first read it in high school, reread it in my thirties and just reread it again in my 50s. Each time I found it to be mostly a waste of time with the exception of some of Fitzgerald's pithy descriptions of character. There's no question that his descriptive writing can be sharp and evocative but to what end? All but one of the characters in \\"Gatsby\\" are air-headed, self-absorbed, manipulative snobs with whom - try as I have - I feel no shred of empathy. The dialogue is banal, the plot twists amount to cheesy melodrama, and the women characters are especially vapid. If the point of the book is that people with misplaced values are delusional and damaging to themselves and others, OK. If the book indeed captures a small segment of the lives of the indolent wealthy in the 1920s, OK. But the great American novel? For that, I need something with considerably more depth and, generally, a more epic canvas. [[ASIN:1470178192 Moby Dick]], [[ASIN:0143039431 The Grapes of Wrath]], [[ASIN:0446310786 To Kill a Mockingbird]] and [[ASIN:0812978188 Ragtime: A Novel]] are just a few that come to mind. One virtue of \\"Gatsby\\" is that it is short, just 180 pages. You might want to read it to see what the fuss is about. I won't be going back to it for a fourth time, that's for sure. I give it two stars for some good descriptive prose; nothing else in the book works for me.	2013-08-19

[SPOILERS perhaps, but who doesn't know at least the outlines of the plot?]<br /><br />It comes at or near the top of any list of contenders for The Great American Novel. I knew the 1974 movie with Robert Redford, and have just seen the 2013 version with the marvelous Leonardo di Caprio. So about time I actually read the book.... And the result? Absolute endorsement of its extraordinary quality, plus a few surprises.<br /><br />Quality. If I were to pick just one aspect of Fitzgerald's writing, I would say his eye for compact detail, especially when describing character. The light fading on Daisy's face \\"with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\\" Jordan Baker wearing her evening dresses like sports clothes, \\"as though she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\\" An expression that passes over Gatsby's face \\"at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words.\\" And that single gruesome detail at Myrtle's death, \\"her left breast was swinging loose like a flap,\\" marking the realization that this social comedy has been tragedy all along.<br /><br />Surprises. First that the book is so short, a mere 180 pages. Virtually everything in the recent movie is in the book, with amazingly little left out. But -- in sharp distinction to director Baz Luhrmann's extravagant camp -- how compact, one might almost say modest, is Fitzgerald's prose. The set pieces like the first party scene convey the impression of excess without ever resorting to excess in their writing. Yet the book itself is fantasy; not only does the meteoric rise of Gatsby seem impossible, but the timeline of that single summer has its own contradictions. But that is not Fitzgerald's focus; he keeps his characters borne up on airy balloons like Nick's first view of Daisy and Jordan on the white couch. Note how far underground he keeps the criminal world of the Prohibition era, upon which the whole story rests. And how unusual, how risky even, is the rear-loaded storytelling: the book begins with minimal exposition, and almost all the back-story is left to the last third.<br /><br />In that respect, I was surprised by the one extended passage not to appear in the movie at all, the 18-page coda that constitutes Chapter IX. It leaves a nasty taste, but has some interesting purposes. It shows narrator Nick Carraway much more ambivalent towards Gatsby than in either movie. It reveals him as a much colder person, observing, recording, but despising all sides equally. And, in a geographical shift, it takes us away from the wild life of the East Coast to remind us that all the major characters are Midwesterners; \\"perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common that made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\\" So which is the more real, the more admirable?<br /><br />But THE Great American Novel? What are the criteria? Top five on the Goodreads poll, after GATSBY, are TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, HUCKLEBERRY FINN, THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, and THE GRAPES OF WRATH. All five belong indisputably to their periods. Three of them (Lee, Twain, and Steinbeck) are essentially realistic works grappling with deep faults in American society; I have no trouble accepting the greatness of any of them. The Salinger is curious in that its world, that of a disaffected teenage preppie, is minute by comparison; what it speaks to is less America than the existential ennui of its Zeitgeist. The Fitzgerald, a far better book, also deals on the surface with a minute segment of society, the ultra-rich and the seekers after sensation. Yet its society is curiously fungible: the road from East Egg to Manhattan runs through the Valley of Ashes, and millionaire Tom Buchanan takes his mistress from a garage. The book is often seen as the quintessential portrait of the Jazz Age, and I agree it could only take place at that time. But as a representation of most of America in the twenties, I just don't believe it. A dream itself, it is a portrait of the American Dream and its hollowness. That is why the weary hangover of the final chapter is so important. And that is what makes it a great novel for America even today.eam itself, it is a portrait of the American Dream and its hollowness.

I am not one who would call this the greatest American novel, as many have done. And although I have read it a couple of times, I don't really like it--it's draw is somewhat like the impulse which leads me to look at an accident I really don't want to see. However, the author accomplished what he set out to do, and for that he deserves a lot of credit.<br /><br />On the negative side, there isn't one character I would like to spend an afternoon with. I found myself repeatedly thinking, \\"what a waste of a life\\". Neither Tom nor Daisy  demonstrated any compassion, sacrifice, self-control, benevolence, or any other moral sensibility. They are completely self-centered. Gatsby is slightly more sympathetic a character. He is the quintessential American--obsessed with an unrealistic view of romantic love and daydreams of undeserved wealth. I do feel sorry for him, though; he is like a lost little boy who has no idea what to do to be found.<br /><br />In the end, I would recommend this book. It can stimulate a great discussion of the \\"American dream,\\" wealth, success, consumerism, and values. So read it with a friend and enjoy sharing your thoughts about it.	2013-08-10

The tale, recounted by Jay Gatsby's neighbor and acquaintance, 29-year-old Nick Carraway, is about his two-years-prior experiences with Gatsby. Near the start of the story, Nick visits his second cousin once removed, Daisy Buchanan, who has married a tall, athletic adulterer named Tom Buchanan. The three are joined by her friend, a famous female golfer named Jordan Baker. As a bond-salesman neighbor living in a small house next to Gatsby's mansion, Carraway attends one of his extravagant parties (after hearing about him from multiple sources) and later interacts with him several times during the period of about three months beginning in July and ending in September of 1922. Anyone who knows anything about Gatsby provides some wild rumor, for example, that he killed someone during the war. Although Nick is skeptical about Gatsby's incredible backstory, over time he begins to feel something for him beyond pity and incredulousness, (maybe admiration) at the fact that he can so skillfully keep up what appears to be, at most, a complicated charade, and at least, a great stretch of the truth about his background and upbringing, which, it seems, he's done because of his desire for Daisy. Although it wouldn't be right to say much more about the plot, I'll say that I love the way the author tells the story. With really lovely descriptions and similes (and without a bunch of flowery excess), he tells it in a straightforward way, yet provides enough information about the characters, like this characterization of Gatsby by Carraway, (p 52) \\"He smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to be believed in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey,\\" to help readers see why they choose to act the way they do. What most surprised me was that I could love a story so much that is about such awful, flawed characters. The Great Gatsby is one of my all-time favorite classics.

Let me preface this review by saying that I am not the most experienced reader in the world.  However, I am only 17 years old so I have (hopefully) many more years to read and become that experienced reader.  I have always been big on books though. From Harry Potter to Eragon to Ender's Game, I have always loved to sit down and enjoy a good book, nearly as much as or even more than I like to go outside and kick the soccer ball around.  I have always been something of a free spirit, however, so reading school-assigned books has always been a big pain for me, and I usually did the SparkNotes version.  On some books, like the Scarlet Letter and The Awakening, I didn't feel as bad, but it became a habit and I missed out on fully reading books such as Catch-22 and a Tale of Two Cities (I do plan on reading those later, hopefully sooner). I did read three books in high school that I truly enjoyed, however; two of them in 10th grade and one in 11th.  I read Catcher in the Rye and Slaughterhouse-V in 10th grade, the latter being runner up to my favorite book of all time (behind Ender's Game), but why did I decide to read those? It was because my 10th grade English teacher was the greatest I ever had and challenged me to delve into these novels and discover the deeper meanings and symbolism hidden in the text.  The only book I actually read in 11th grade was, well, The Great Gatsby.  The reason I decided to read it was the sheer history behind it and the fact that it was the epitome of a 20th century classic.<br /><br />So you're probably wondering why I am telling you my entire life story in a review of this book before I even tell you why I like it.  Well, the reason is to encourage people to pick up books they may have skimmed over or simply not read in high school.  There are a million reasons to not read books in high school: the time constraints for reading are annoying, the discussions where teachers make-up instances of symbolism where you know for a FACT that the author was not thinking of it when it was written, that party you could be at instead of reading, the hours of other homework you've just been assigned, etc.  But these books are classics for a reason.  Now that I am fresh out of high school, I feel I am free of all that bologna that would prevent me from sitting down and ENJOYING the book like I did for Harry Potter, Ender's Game, etc.  Now that I've read it again after the year and a half it's been since junior year, I was able to read at my own pace and look at the characters in my own way, without having to think of how my teacher sees him in order to get the A.  The Great Gatsby is a book full of characters that you want to succeed and do well in life and get their happy ending, but at the same time Fitzgerald gives you reason to dislike them all the same.  So, if you read this book and despised it in high school, or you're like me and you liked it in high school and wanted to read it like you do all your other books, on your own time, then I highly recommend this book.thor was not thinking of it when it was written, that party you could be at instead of reading, the hours of other homework you've just been assigned, etc.  But these books are classics for a reason.

I feel like everybody read Gatsby in high school or at some point, but alas I never did.  And ironically I spent my formative years of literature - circa ages 13 to 25 - frequently immersed in that twentieth century fiction that was at its apex in the period between the two world wars, veritably gorging myself on Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, Henry Miller, William Faulkner and many other noted authors of the era.  How I missed Fitzgerald I'm not sure, but miss him I did.  And then there was the sudden brouhaha over the recent film adaptation featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, with everyone comparing the film to the book, and I actually felt a bit \\"lesser than\\" in both the literary and film arena, a place I truly do not appreciate.  I'm more comfortable reigning as an arrogant \\"book nerd\\" or \\"film geek.\\" Here I was a loser on both counts and trust me, I don't take kindly to that!<br /> A thousand miles away from this topic, Haruki Murakami novels have been my latest obsession in the fiction & literature category. I happened upon an interview with the noted novelist in which he explained why he believed Gatsby was one of the greatest twentieth century novels and why he himself translated it into Japanese to better expand its audience. I paused:  the master Murakami not only paid tribute to Gatsby, but he translated it into Japanese? Maybe it's time that I should read this book . . .<br /> One of the best things about having a fine personal library is that there's a pretty good chance you might already own the classic book you are interested in reading.  In this case, my collection indeed included a nicely bound hardcover set of Fitzgerald novels I obtained somewhere back when I was eleven or twelve, as my grandmother actively encouraged my book fetish. (Thank you Grandma! Never forget!) I plucked Gatsby off the shelves and carefully spread its unbroken binding.  It still kind of smelled like a new book, in some senses.  It was, truly, new to me. I was ready!<br />I adopted Gatsby as my bedside nightstand book, which usually means it is doomed to serve for  many months as short, casual end-of-day reading while I focus on the four or five other books I devote my early evenings to, usually the thick  nonfiction tomes that I typically have in play dayside.  But as it turned out, I read Gatsby much faster than that, in thick gulps that pushed my bedtime back and found me shifting positions as various limbs cramped up or went to sleep in an attempt to locate a spot where I could nest comfortably with a book this good.  This good!  I am compelled to repeat this because when I read great literature from this era it is much like listening to music from the `60's and early `70's: that amazingly good that it blows you away. As much as I would grant superlatives to White Stripes, Chili Peppers and Weezer tunes today, go ahead and spin a Traffic or Airplane or Zeppelin vinyl album from back in the day and be reminded that there is virtually nothing out there in 2013 to compete with that level of musical genius.  I love Murakami, but he is absolutely trumped on every level by Fitzgerald in Gatsby!<br /> It's a very simple story, actually. It lacks the complexity of a Faulkner stream of consciousness layered narrative; there's no cleverly disguised objective correlative a la Hemingway; no complicated character sketches as in Steinbeck. It is just pure and simple genius.  The protagonist is a confused innocent walking among a legion of superficial ultra-rich fools, the beautiful people of the day, many who have come into orbit around the eponymous Gatsby, who initially appears to be little more than a charlatan preying upon those who have conferred him with a star status. And yet, in only about 150 pages we learn that Gatsby is the only character other than our narrator-protagonist who has anything truly genuine in his nature. Living, as it were, in our own \\"gilded age\\" of superficial fools - Donald Trump could clearly have been a walk-on character in the novel - we are delightfully reminded that there is indeed something of more value to respect and honor in our contemporaries than simple wealth and status.<br /> The novel is pure genius, on a multiplicity of scales. Rather than bemoan the fact that I missed it in my younger days, I suppose I should be grateful to come upon it at a more mature stage in my life. If you have not read this book, I would urge you to read it now.  If you have already read it once, I would suggest that you re-read it; I know I will.n our own \\"gilded age\\" of superficial fools - Donald Trump could clearly have been a walk-on character in the novel - we are delightfully reminded that there is indeed something of more value to respect and honor in our contemporaries than simple wealth and status.<br /> The novel is pure genius, on a multiplicity of scales.

Gatsby's parties are famous, with more people stopping by than anyone could conceivably know, and it is truly the embodiment of the Roaring Twenties. Shocked that Gatsby himself is the same age as Nick, the former convinces the latter to introduce him to Nick's second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, who lives in the nearby town of East Egg with her husband, Tom. It seems that Daisy and Gatsby knew each other several years earlier, and Gatsby is eager to renew the acquaintance.<br /><br />Nick is thrown into the world of Daisy, Gatsby, Tom, and their friend, golfer Jordan Baker. Through knowing these high-flying individuals, he spends time getting drunk in apartments in New York City, helping conceal an extra-marital affair, attemps to both promote and prevent another one, and is an eyewitness to a horrible tragedy.<br /><br />As a student, the true value of the work escaped me. In some cases, teachers have the ability to hide the forest for the trees, and I was so caught up in the symbolic details of the book that I missed the story altogether. It's only in the last chapter that one can really see Fitzgerald's aim in this novel. It's not about the Roaring Twenties as such; rather, it's about the illusions that individuals offer to the world in place of who they actually are as people. When it's all said and done, Nick finds that he is one of only two people who actually knew Gatsby, the man, as opposed to the legend that lived next door.<br /><br />It's nice to come back to books that you have read before and re-discover them, and I am very glad I picked up \\"The Great Gatsby\\". I now have a new respect for Fitzgerald's writing that I don't think I was capable of as a sixteen year-old, and it's made me eager to keep reading more.It's not about the Roaring Twenties as such; rather, it's about the illusions that individuals offer to the world in place of who they actually are as people.

Not really	The Great Gatsby has been rated by generations of American high school students as \\"the great American novel\\". I believe this is because the book is mercifully short, lending itself to a quick read, with time left over for plenty of football practice. TGG is hardly a novel - more a novella. And it is hardly great. A great novel addresses profound issues of the human condition. This novella simply chronicles the unpleasant doings of some very shallow people. I wish the house had burned down, with everyone in it. There are many American novels that warrant the tag \\"great\\". TGG is not one of them. However, I would say that TGG is a very American book, obsessed as it is with wealth. To many Americans, it must come as a shock to encounter Fitzgerald's message that money can't buy you happiness. Most of us in the rest of the world know this already.	2013-07-08

I found this both charming and terribly sad.<br /><br />Fitzgerald's elegant craftsmanship with attention to detail using such economy of words was extraordinary. It was such a delight to drift off into another time as he captured the soul of Gatsby's world in the 20s. It was an interesting use of the 1st person as Nick Carraway narrated the story.<br /><br />But there was such sadness with the apparent meaningless of these characters lives. All fluff and bubble without any soul. I found I felt sorry for Gatsby, unlucky in love and seemingly wealthy from dubious commercial activities that never got fully explained. Daisy, I felt nothing for, as she came across as the most callous selfish individual, blessed with beauty and good upbringing.<br /><br />I can understand why the novel is held in such esteem by the literary world. In less than 200 pages, Fitzgerald was able to describe the folly of the hedonistic life that has even greatest prevalence today, making the novel very relatable to a modern readership.	2013-07-04

Don't get me wrong, Fitzgerald depicts Nick Carraway's mind (his ability to understand the human condition)so very well but there needed to be something more.<br />Fitzgerald does describe things in a delectably visual way but the book falls flat for me.

Fitzgerald plunges you into this glittery world; smells, sounds, tastes, all your senses awake.

Read for the first time in high school for summer reading during a very memorable summer and revisited in 2013 because of my enjoyment of Baz Lurhman's new treatment. Ironically re-reading the book takes me back to a better day, that summer in high school when, like Gatsby, so many of my dreams seemed so easily grasped, within reach and just a formality. Now as I read the book and examine all of the failures that contributed to the forgotten and broken dreams that now place me in a life I enjoy (my children and parents at least) but never envisioned or would have accepted as my future. I too wish, like Gatsby, I could just go back to the start, go back to the past. If I could just get there everything would be all right and I could re-create those dreams and re-shape my life based on that time of overwhelming hope. I shed a tear when I read the book 20 years ago, shed a tear in the movie theater and shed a tear when I re-read it.... For Gatsby and for myself. Thank you Mr Fitzgerald for what is truly a classic study of life.	2013-07-01

His story jumped around a lot and sometimes it was confusing about how these random events fit together. (I suppose this is really Fitzgerald's doing, but I feel they could be one in the same.) Beginning of chapter four lists a bunch of names for quite a few too many pages. I understand that it's supposed to show all the various types that attended Gatsby's parties, but it just seemed dreadfully boring to me. They weren't even really people, so it didn't really seem all that important. I did love picture Gatsby's parties and his huge house. Gatsby and Nick were such real people. Even though Gatsby was very mysterious about his past, his present was endearing. You could hear the emotion in his words, even if he was cool.<br /><br />There was plenty to like about this novel and I liked all those bits. There were a few slow parts though and a few parts I just didn't understand. Maybe a second read through will make things more coherent. Luckily this is a short novel, so it's one that you can stop and re-read parts of without taking a very long time to finish it. It was an enjoyable read for the most part.<br /><br />Gatsby. He was a unique fella and so in love. So crazily, stupidly in love. I feel so awful for Gatsby. He tried so hard. He felt so much. In the end things don't always work out for people who may deserve it, even when the ungrateful hordes dance in the sun. That's what I took away from this novel. Is rich people get richer, while the poor get poorer. It doesn't matter if it's money of life. There are always grateful people and ungrateful people. Dreamers and those content to have life always be the same. We need those dreamers though, otherwise we wouldn't have any inventions and still just be cavemen.<br /><br />I won't say much more; Gatsby is Gatsby. This novel is definitely worth the read, if only so you know that book that people mention now and again when they are trying to sound sophisticated. Who knows, maybe you'll love it...<br /><br />First Line:<br />\\"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind since.\\"<br /><br />Favorite Line:<br />\\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\"el is definitely worth the read, if only so you know that book that people mention now and again when they are trying to sound sophisticated.

It's amazing how one's perspective changes after 25+ years.<br /><br />The world of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan no longer exists, but the themes of dreams vs. reality, doing the wrong thing for the right reason vs. doing the right thing for the wrong reasons, etc. are universal.  Gatsby is an  unlikely hero for whom the readers heart aches.  I also relished Fitzgerald's vivid descriptions of Gatsby's lavish home and equally lavish parties.<br /><br />The authors own life was a mixture of splendor and tragedy, just like Gatsby.  I didn't know until just recently that the book was not considered a classic until it became popular among the soldiers fighting in World War II.  Fitzgerald died believing the book to be a failure and is now one of the most enduring classics in American literature.	2013-06-24

I'm pretty confident its merit has already been firmly established in American classic repertiore.  A bit embarrassingly I also  read it based on my excitement over the new Baz Luhrman film.  F. Scott would roll over in his grave I guess.  Anyway, I really enjoyed this book.  It's not lengthy and I finished it in 3 nights (and I'm no speed reader).<br /><br />This book actually brought Mad Men to my mind.  Jay Gatsby comes from a mysterious, extremely poor upbringing and goes to great lengths to become wealthy (take on a pseudonym) and delete all traces of his former life.  Sounds like another modern-day anti-hero, Don Draper.  The big difference between the two is that Gatsby does it all for the love of Daisy Buchanan while Don...well that's another story that hasn't been resolved yet.  However, Daisy may just be another trophy for Gatsby to acquire to prove to himself that he has left his desolate past behind for good.  We will never know.<br /><br />I felt this book imbued a genius commentary on rich society.  Those who aspire to be rich and try to become part of that world are chewed up and spit out, lives destroyed by those born into it, such as Tom Buchanan.  Gatsby (and most likely Don) can't survive that cold world.  A book ahead of its time, I can't believe I waited this long to read it.	2013-06-23

I could not understand it.<br /><br />I could not understand the nuances of the sentiments, the hypocrisy of relationships, the relationships of practicality. I did not understand the things that were said and the meaning of the unsaid. I did not realise that there were people who led lives without having to work, and without having any real purpose except flitting from one social engagement to another.<br /><br />All I remembered was a great big golden car that gleamed in the sun.*<br /><br />That was a long time ago. And I have been touched by the realities of life since. And now I understand.<br /><br />I understand the poignance of having a colossal dream, one that is likely to meet disappointment when faced with the realities and practicalities. Yet somehow I want the dream to be fulfilled too, for the dream's own sake, because it is still larger than all our small, mundane lives put together.<br /><br />Now that I am touched by the God of the Earth, knowing that I need to keep my feet firmly on the ground, I marvel at those who even have some semblance of a dream, a hope.<br /><br />And so, surely, now I understand why Gatsby was great. Because of his capacity for hope, for love. It was bigger than what most people could ever be or even hope to have.<br /><br />*I recall that Gatsby car was seen as a phallic symbol by some critics. But aren't ALL big, expensive, impressive cars extensions of men, and as such all are phallic to some extent?	2013-06-22

Nick Carraway, the first-person narrator of F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby (hereafter TGG), is the second, unwisely eclipsed Midwesterner to do so.  However, one is seduced, engulfed, and destroyed by the glittery but indifferent and corrupt environment, and the other manages to negotiate the same environment, reject its insubstantiality, and go back West to reorganize his priorities.  Why does Nick survive, and not Gatsby?  As TGG hints, it may be Carraway received a disproportionate \\"sense of the fundamental decencies...parceled out unequally at birth.\\" (page 2).<br /><br /> As the reader gradually learns, although Nick and Gatsby had roughly similar life trajectories encompassing World War I, college, and establishing a business, Nick seemed to have a firmer, more pragmatic, more morally philosophical familial grounding than Gatsby.  Nick shared tacit but frequent communication with his father, who left him with the seemingly ironic but actually accurate advice: \\"'Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,...just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'\\"  As Nick gradually learns, those advantages are not material or monetary, but mental, moral and psychological.  In TGG, Nick becomes more observant and insightful, but non-judgmental and even empathetic, especially to his more quixotic, money-, and status-conscious counterpart, Gatsby.<br /><br />It may be no accident that Gatsby's mansion was adjacent to Nick's more modest \\"eyesore\\" in the predominantly middle-class West Egg of Long Island.  Although Gatsby had the money to organize endless opulent galas attracting endless guests, even he was (at least subconsciously) aware - and Nick was fully aware - that he was not truly of the established upper class. Gatsby was a nouveau riche imposter - uncomfortable, artificially mannered, ignored, and mysteriously alone and distrusted.  Even after Nick accepts a rare invitation to one of Gatsby's parties (the rest of the indifferent rabble just crash it), HE doesn't recognize Gatsby until Gatsby has to announce himself. But Gatsby recognizes Nick from World War I's Third Division.  Gatsby seems relaxed in Nick's presence, reinforced by Nick's observation that \\"...there seemed to be a pleasant significance in [Nick's] having been among the last to go, as if he [Gatsby] had desired it all the time.\\" (page 53).  Gatsby even extemporaneously invites Nick to join him in his hydroplane.<br /><br />Gatsby starts to confide in Nick, not because of any Midwestern/military kinship, but because he is aware that the lost love of his life, Daisy Buchanan, is his cousin and lives across the sound from Nick in oh-so-chic East Egg, maybe within reach. He can't even ask Nick directly to arrange a meeting with Daisy; he has to do it indirectly through Nick's casual love interest Jordan Baker, the supercilious tennis player.  Gatsby has not made an initially favorable impression upon Nick; besides using Nick as a cat's-paw to woo Daisy back, Gatsby has falsely embellished about some aspects of his past (page 65), and his relationship with the gangster Meyer Wolfsheim hints at organized crime (pages 69-73).  Gatsby is not a flattering soulmate.  In contrast, Nick is a hardworking, honest bondseller and he has started an open-eyed, careful, and honest courtship with Jordan.<br /><br />At length, after many fitful, timid half-starts, Gatsby reunites with Daisy.  They were intimately involved five years ago, but Gatsby was too destitute to marry her.  Besides, he had to fight in the war.  During his absence, Daisy settled for and somewhat reluctantly married the burly brutish philanderer Tom Buchanan and somewhat grew to love him.  Gatsby shows off his ostentatious wealth and mansion to Daisy.  He seems to rekindle the passion they used to share.  If he works hard enough, and shows that he is wealthy enough, he can recapture this past fantasy love, even if Nick later warns him that in at least this case you can't go home again. (page 110)<br /><br />The truth will emerge eventually.  Like Nick, Gatsby came from humble, rural surroundings, but unlike Nick, Gatsby had \\"shiftless\\" and \\"unsuccessful\\" parents (page 98) that he was probably ashamed of and practically disowned.  Though initially industrious like Nick, working as a clam-digger, fisherman, and janitor, his chance meeting with millionaire silver prospector Dan Cody made his dreams of prosperity seem much more accessible.  Although cheated of Cody's considerable inheritance, his formative experience with him only fueled Gatsby's desire to be make it big.  All this reinforces Nick's simultaneous fascination with and repugnance of the elusive Gatsby, when he \\"had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him.\\" (page 101)<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, Gatsby's strenuously erected façade crumbles.  Gatsby replaces his servants with those unlikely to gossip about his tainted work connections. Gatsby, Nick, Jordan, and Tom all meet explosively together on a scorching hot day in a New York hotel room, where Gatsby's dream dissolves before the decadent indecisiveness of the flighty, irresponsible, spoiled ditz Daisy, who loves Gatsby, but still kinda loves the loathsome, hulking monster Tom because he can provide old money security.  Of course, the hypocritical Tom, who has cheated on Daisy with Myrtle Wilson, wife of his garage mechanic George Wilson, resents Gatsby's interest in Daisy and the insinuation that he was too stupid to know it. Furthermore, Tom taunts Gatsby with his knowledge of his sordid, illegal sales and connection to Wolfsheim. Gatsby's dream of winning Daisy away from Tom is dissolving, but still the dream stubbornly will die.  Paralleling Gatsby's sudden bleak prospects are Nick's, who \\"...was thirty.  Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a new decade...Thirty-the promise of a decade of loneliness\\" (page 135).  But like Gatsby clinging to Daisy, Nick will cling to the practical, realistic Jordan, at least for a while.<br /><br />A tragedy of errors and misunderstandings occur and things disintegrate.  The quintet leave hot New York to return home - Tom, Jordan, and Nick in Tom's coupe, Daisy and Gatsby in his yellow car.  Daisy and Gatsby leave first.  On the way back, Myrtle Wilson, falsely imprisoned in her room by cuckolded George, escapes, sees the yellow car coming, and thinking it is her lover Tom because she saw him driving it earlier, runs into the road and is killed.  Inexperienced driver Daisy was driving the car but Gatsby \\"gallantly\\" intends to take the rap.  Gatsby hides his car and skulks about the Buchanans' home, still hoping Daisy will come out to see him.  She does not.  Gatsby goes home hoping Daisy will call her.  She does not.  Oscillating between disapproval and admiration for Gatsby, Nick finally gives Gatsby the ambivalent, backhanded compliment that he is \\"worth the whole damn bunch [Tom, Daisy, Jordan] put together\\" (page 154)<br /><br />Forlornly and perhaps fatalistically, Gatsby takes a dip in the pool.  The illusion is shattered. Vengeful George Wilson, mistakenly thinking Gatsby was Myrtle's paramour or at least her killer, shoots him and then himself dead.  Only a few people attend Gatsby's funeral, and only because of Nick's efforts to scrape up some mourners.  Nick felt that he owed his counterpart Gatsby \\"that intense personal interest to which every one has some vague right at the end\\" (page 164)  With Wolfsheim's refusal to attend, Nick \\"began to have a feeling of defiance of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and [himself] against them all.\\" (page 165)<br /><br />Henry Gatz from Minnesota, at Nick's invitation, is one of the mourners.  Heis awed and impressed with Gatsby's (real or legal name James Gatz) mansion and wealth.  Henry praises Gatsby's intelligence, work ethic, and discipline, and shows Nick his daily regimen (page 173).<br />The simple father cannot be aware how such positive qualities could produce such a sad result.<br /><br />\\"After Gatsby's death the East was haunted for [Nick] like that, distorted beyond [his] eyes' power of correction.\\" (page 176)  So Nick decides to go back home.  First, he sorrowfully but probably wisely parts company with the brittle but imperious Jordan, outraged that Nick would throw her over.  Then, next, he gladly parts company with Tom, who probably fed George's misconception about Gatsby and at any rate does mourn Myrtle's death.<br /><br />Besides Gatsby, Tom and Daisy, also Midwesterners, were seduced by the East's superficial, tawdry, and sometimes criminal glitter, but are still alive, if damaged.  Gatsby was destroyed because he thought by buying into that glitter, he could win Daisy's unworthy hand.  Nick, the last Westerner, had roughly similar aspirations, but was circumspect and perceptive enough to realize through doppelganger Gatsby's noble but misguided quest that the glitter hides a void.lleling Gatsby's sudden bleak prospects are Nick's, who \\"...was thirty.  Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a new decade...Thirty-the promise of a decade of loneliness\\" (page 135).  But like Gatsby clinging to Daisy, Nick will cling to the practical, realistic Jordan, at least for a while.<br /><br />A tragedy of errors and misunderstandings occur and things disintegrate.  The quintet leave hot New York to return home - Tom, Jordan, and Nick in Tom's coupe, Daisy and Gatsby in his yellow car.  Daisy and Gatsby leave first.  On the way back, Myrtle Wilson, falsely imprisoned in her room by cuckolded George, escapes, sees the yellow car coming, and thinking it is her lover Tom because she saw him driving it earlier, runs into the road and is killed.  Inexperienced driver Daisy was driving the car but Gatsby \\"gallantly\\" intends to take the rap.  Gatsby hides his car and skulks about the Buchanans' home, still hoping Daisy will come out to see him.  She does not.  Gatsby goes home hoping Daisy will call her.  She does not.  Oscillating between disapproval and admiration for Gatsby, Nick finally gives Gatsby the ambivalent, backhanded compliment that he is \\"worth the whole damn bunch [Tom, Daisy, Jordan] put together\\" (page 154)<br /><br />Forlornly and perhaps fatalistically, Gatsby takes a dip in the pool.  The illusion is shattered. Vengeful George Wilson, mistakenly thinking Gatsby was Myrtle's paramour or at least her killer, shoots him and then himself dead.  Only a few people attend Gatsby's funeral, and only because of Nick's efforts to scrape up some mourners.  Nick felt that he owed his counterpart Gatsby \\"that intense personal interest to which every one has some vague right at the end\\" (page 164)  With Wolfsheim's refusal to attend, Nick \\"began to have a feeling of defiance of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and [himself] against them all.\\" (page 165)<br /><br />Henry Gatz from Minnesota, at Nick's invitation, is one of the mourners.  Heis awed and impressed with Gatsby's (real or legal name James Gatz) mansion and wealth.  Henry praises Gatsby's intelligence, work ethic, and discipline, and shows Nick his daily regimen (page 173).<br />The simple father cannot be aware how such positive qualities could produce such a sad result.<br /><br />\\"After Gatsby's death the East was haunted for [Nick] like that, distorted beyond [his] eyes' power of correction.\\" (page 176)  So Nick decides to go back home.  First, he sorrowfully but probably wisely parts company with the brittle but imperious Jordan, outraged that Nick would throw her over.  Then, next, he gladly parts company with Tom, who probably fed George's misconception about Gatsby and at any rate does mourn Myrtle's death.<br /><br />Besides Gatsby, Tom and Daisy, also Midwesterners, were seduced by the East's superficial, tawdry, and sometimes criminal glitter, but are still alive, if damaged.  Gatsby was destroyed because he thought by buying into that glitter, he could win Daisy's unworthy hand.  Nick, the last Westerner, had roughly similar aspirations, but was circumspect and perceptive enough to realize through doppelganger Gatsby's noble but misguided quest that the glitter hides a void.	2013-06-12

The story is narrated by a young man named Nick Carraway, who moves to the fictional Long Island town of West Egg, right next door to the lavish mansion of Jay Gatsby. Through the parties he throws, Gatsby proves to be a man who relishes extravagance, although no one is quite certain where he came from or how he made his fortune. As the narrator is slowly sucked into Gatsby's world of turbulent lavishness, Gatsby tries to show that he is motivated by something much deeper than trinkets, bobbles and shiny things. Fitzgerald's style is fresh even almost a century after it was written, and the themes and relationships he creates are as relevant today as they had been in the roaring twenties. Fitzgerald's dry wit permeates throughout as he uses the novel to criticize certain excesses of a prosperous era. Thorough elements both blunt and subtle, Fitzgerald first paints a glimmering picture that is slowly peeled away to reveal levels of dirty grime underneath. As the story comes together and careens towards its haunting conclusion, the reader begins to question even the appropriateness of the novel's title itself.	2013-06-06
US	22545785	R3T8LBLC9YRHPT	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A realistically beautiful story	This will possibly be forever embedded in my top five favorite novels of all time. I first read it in high school and fell in love with the story of Gatsby and Daisy. As I grew up and saw more of the world and learned what real life is like, I began to love this book for an entirely different reason. I love that it doesn't have a happy ending. The 1920's was about glitz and glamour but behind that mask of sparkle there was different world. It was a world of corruption, loose morals and violent crime. The country had just returned from fighting in the trenches and many a young man came back more bitter and disillusioned than the older generation had ever been. They came back attempting to grasp on to dreams that could never be won back and loves that were lost forever. The Great Gatsby exposes this gilded world to a tea. Gatsby pines for Daisy, Tom repeatedly has affairs right under Daisy's nose, Jordan is aloof, vapid and shallow and poor Nick is trusted into the middle of all of it. In the end, Fitzgerald demonstrations the tragic consequences of living in a fantasy. Call me a cynic but it is a much better ending than the ubiquitous, \\"...and they lived happily ever after.\\"	2013-06-06

Gatsby's love for Daisy has lasted for five long years since their last goodbye for the war.  Daisy married Tom and had a child, but Gatsby has never forgotten his love for her.  After purchasing a palatial home across the bay from hers, he begins to throw lavish parties. The inevitable occurs  and a summer affair ensues. The book of course, ends with all the excitement and spellbinding shocks of a great book. Fitzgerald leads the reader on an unforgetable, exciting story in this now classic with a  look at life among the Long Island rich after WWI.	2013-06-05

His life is a private Potemkin affair with a singular goal: to rekindle a lost love.<br /><br />Gatsby barely even attended those Long Island extravaganzas he hosted every Saturday night in that summer of 1922. Think of them  more as theater with an audience of one - an audience of one, that is, only in the off chance that maybe,  just maybe,  Daisy Buchanen (now married: details, details) might actually show up and be impressed.  Talk about your chick magnet.<br /><br />We might enjoy The Great Gatsby on a number of levels. In its most base and literal incarnation, we could get lost in the trappings of our own Highland Gatsby event and roll around in snob chic. On this night, this one night, we'd gather and preen and seduce one another  with our chosen area of expertise (choose: wine; food; books; carbon footprint; Ming dynasty furniture; our swell vacation in Hoboken) while we snub and sniff and sneer at those who don't share our pretensions.<br /><br />The only role already assigned in the faux-Gatsby event would be that of Nick Carraway, the reserved mid-Western transplant who, as both Gatsby's new neighbor and Daisy's cousin, has a unique perspective on this would-be mating dance and serves as the novel's narrator. Yes, that role is mine -  that's me, the reserved one, standing over there alone at the drink table looking vaguely lost.<br /><br />A deeper reading of the novel, however, would invite our attention to that elusive, wonderful, suck-the-oxygen-out-of-the-room curse called love. Or obsession.<br /><br />How bad can it get? Let's put it this way. Gatsby bought that mega-mansion on the West Egg  (the nouveau riche) island for the sole reason that it provided an unobstructed view of  the green light marking the end of Daisy's dock over there on the East Egg (old money) island. The Green Light. He'd stare. Longingly. Fantasize. Stare. The Green Light.<br /><br />We've taken a run at the obsession topic before. Our Lolita discussion (9/11/06) was all about this phenomenon of  \\"love, marked by a fierceness that so often destroys adult lives.\\"  That sex-laced road trip may be closer to what we might label today as pathology given it involved  a middle-age man and twelve-year-old Lolita but both stories seem to share the same tune.<br /><br />One common question: the distinction between the power of the illusion versus the worthiness of the underlying object.  Neither Daisy nor Lolita would seem to the \\"objective\\" reader to be worthy of the bestowed adoration. No matter. The illusion transcends the subject. Even an oil slick is iridescent when the light strikes it right. The light then shifts and yet another Country Western song is born.<br /><br />Or we can take Gatsby as allegory. The American dream - originally all about discovery, individualism, and the pursuit of happiness (per Nick Carraway's meditation) - becomes corrupted by rampant materialism just as Gatsby's dream of idealized love (when dreams had meaning) crumbles with the unworthiness of its object (America, as Daisy, devolves into Material Girl).<br /><br />Those who would write the novel off as simply good riddance to a bygone gilded era of wretched excess would do well to read the article, \\"Gatsby's Green Light Beckons a New Set of Strivers\\" (NYT, 2/18/08). The novel is now required reading at half the high schools in the country and resonates powerfully among urban adolescents, many of them first- and second-generation immigrants who are striving to ascend in 21st-century America.<br /><br />Take particular note of the reflections of Susan Morris, director of the English program at Boston Latin and who has been teaching Gatsby for 32 years, \\"They all understand what it is to strive for something . . . to want to be someone you're not, to want to achieve something that's just beyond reach, whether it's professional success or wealth or idealized love - or a 4.0 or admission to Harvard.\\" Or, to paraphrase an old perfume commercial, their obsession is our possession.<br /><br />Behold the Green Light.o want to be someone you're not, to want to achieve something that's just beyond reach, whether it's professional success or wealth or idealized love - or a 4.0 or admission to Harvard.\\" Or, to paraphrase an old perfume commercial, their obsession is our possession.<br /><br />Behold the Green Light.	2013-06-04

Scot Fitzgerald (Paperback 180 pages)	Nick Carroway lives in West Egg, Long Island.  He is a bond trader.  One day quite out of the blue, Nick is invited to his neighbor's house for a party.  Nick's neighbor is Jay Gatsby, long known in this part of Long Island for throwing the most opulent parties in the area.  At this particular party, he meets Jordan Baker, a golf pro, who is quite drunk at this party, and has taken an interest in Nick. At long last, Nick finally meets Gatsby, they trade some small talk about WW I and soon the party is over.<br /><br />But there are many parties to follow, and Nick and Gatsby become fast friends, although Nick is never sure of the origins of Gatsby's wealth, or education, or background.  Gatsby's intentions become clear enough soon enough.  He wants Nick to have a party for Daisy Buchanan, Nick's cousin, so that Gatsby can re-introduce himself to Daisy.  Daisy and Gatsby had known each other five years earlier, and Daisy didn't marry him then, because he was poor.  Five years later, Daisy is married to Tom, a big, hulking (Tom hated that description of himself) brooding former football player.  Complicating matters further, Tom is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson, wife of a local dim witted auto shop owner.<br /><br />Undeterred by the fact that the love of his life is now married, Gatsby tries to rekindle his love with Daisy, and after an awkward first meeting, Daisy is professing her love for Gatsby for all to hear, including her husband Tom.  Still the five of them, Nick, Jordan, Gatsby, Daisy and Tom strike up a clumsy acquaintance, and take a drive to New York City together.  Upon returning from that trip, something happens that changes their lives forever.  What is it?  Do Gatsby and Daisy ever get to rekindle their romance?  Does Nick find out more about the shadowy Gatsby?<br /><br />I first read this book 30 years ago.  I read it with all the enthusiasm of a teenager wanting to pass an English Lit class, which is to say not very much enthusiasm at all.  Luckily, for myself, I decided to give this book another try.  I read this book in 4 days, not only that, every time I left it, I wanted to read more of it.  The book inhabited me, like few have.  The descriptions of West Egg are lyrical, almost poetic.  The parties Gatsby threw are like some dream out of the Gilded Age, and<br />I wanted to be at those parties.<br /><br />Moreover, there are important themes discussed in these pages. The theme of love lost is one of the central themes that Fitzgerald brings to the forefront. Can a love that is lost ever be re-kindled, and if so, is it ever as good as it was the first time?  There is an answer that Fitzgerald provides, but I won't divulge it, that is part of the pleasure of reading this book.<br /><br />The theme of friendship is also examined in this book.  Nick is probably Gatsby's closest friend at the end of the book, but how well did he really know Gatsby?  Was it a friendship based on mutual admiration, or was Nick more interested in being seen at a Gatsby party, than finding out about Gatsby?  Did Nick feel used by Gatsby, so that Gatsby could meet Daisy?  Was Gatsby using Nick to meet Daisy, and not for any other purpose?  There were passages in this book that made me wonder if Nick even liked Gatsby.  That brings up a further question of who Gatsby's friends really were.  Did he have any true friends or were they all hangers-on and sycophants? Fitzgerald provides an answer to that question quite emphatically at the end of the book, but again I will not give it away.<br /><br />I cannot leave this book without some deserving criticism however.  The character of Mayer Wolfsheim is a horribly negative Jewish stereotype, and I must say, I was repulsed when I read this character, because it was such a horribly negative portrayal of a Jew, the physical description seemed to concentrate on his large nose, his other attributes seemed to be that he was a gambler, somehow involved in the Black Sox scandal, of fixing the World Series.  The image of Wolfsheim mars an otherwise wonderful book. I don't know why Fitzgerald would include it, other than to maybe reflect the anti-Semitism of the age.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby:  A great if somwhat flawed book.<br /><br />For more book and movie reviews, please visit my blog, Reviewswithatude.<br />[...]erwise wonderful book.

The book took around two weeks to get here - which isn't terrible, but it is considering how close I live to the shipping area.

I have to say as a required reading book I was skeptical on whether or not I would like it but I have to say I really did like it!<br />I finished the book before my classmates did (of course) and let me just say I have reread the ending about 10 times. Seriously, it was that stunning/good. I got kinda teary eyed too at the end but I don't want to say why cause it will ruin it!<br />Fitzgerald is an amazing writer and it's not wonder that this is a classic because the writer and the plot and the characters (and everything!) is so well thought out and amazing. When we did discussions in class for this book I was suprised at how many hidden meanings there were in the story and why Fitzgerald said that word in that one sentence.<br />Anyway the book was amazing, it kinda makes you think too! Like is the American Dream what we think it is? or is it some corrupt image that we all have in our heads? And are all people what they seem? or do we put off an exterior person and act totally different in private? And why do people do certain things when they're in love?<br />Yeah suprisingly love was a HUGE subject in this book which suprised me because I honestly had no idea what this book was about but I didn't think it was going to be about love.<br />Let me just say right now, because I don't think it will give anything away, I hated Daisy. I know, I know! A lot of people like her but I hated her in this book. If you've read this you know what I'm talking about!<br />http://www.thepaige-turner.com/2011/11/great-gatsby-by-f-scott-fitzgerald.html	2013-05-26

Instead I found the prose fuzzy and boring.  The people and the situations just didn't seem to come to life for me.  Even though the characters were shallow, the reader really doesn't get a chance to get inside their heads (which would have made them/their motives more understandable and interesting).  The writing was so unclear I had to often reread a paragraph just to make sure I 'got it'. It was drudgery to even finish such a short novel.  Even the narrator never really learns from all this; at least not in a way that he shares any epiphany with the reader.  A book such as the recent one The Paris Wife (about the first Mrs. Hemingway) much better captures the mood of the 20's.	2013-05-26
US	51847912	R1R2ZZ7KOSCP81	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	1	1	N	N	The Great Gatsby and The Dashing Daisy	This is the second time I have read The Great Gatsby [[ASIN:0743273567 The Great Gatsby]] and it will likely not be the last. The first was for the extreme pleasure that the novel yields and this most recent time was to study how Fitzgerald did it. As a writer I am constantly peeking behind the literary curtain of others writers to see how they did it; how they pulled off the fictional magic trick. In this instance it was to see how Fitzgerald levitated Daisy through this Jazz Age classic novel.<br /><br />To me, Daisy is the most interesting character in TGG and the most damning. She is infinitely complex and impossible to nail down just like the varied guests that float in and out of Gatsby's parties. Daisy drifts through rooms and people's lives as she does life. It's not a stretch to realize that Fitzgerald based her on his wife Zelda who he called \\"the first American flapper.\\" Both Daisy and Zelda were from Southern states: Kentucky and Alabama, respectively. They were unrestrained and had a thirst for living a wealthy lifestyle. For Gatsby, he was driven to bootlegging in an effort to quench this insatiable desire by Daisy. Fitzgerald took to writing novels, which after a number of years of writing them myself I can tell you of their many similarities. The difference between writing novels and bootlegging is that one can get you thrown in jail, cause you to drink heavily, and make you become associated with criminals. The other is bootlegging.<br /><br />It's easy to imagine Zelda and F. Scott flying down some New York back road in their coupe, off to partying another Jazz Age night away. Easy indeed. Fitzgerald can, after all, write a party scene like no one else in the literature. He had lots of practice in his life. In TGG the party scenes never stop, each one is bigger than the last; each gala trying to outdo the other. Still, Fitzgerald wrote even better ones in his short story collection Flappers and Philosophers that is not to be missed.<br /><br />TGG is unsurpassed in capturing the Jazz Age, one of the most wild and reckless (and fun!) periods in American history. It could only have been captured in the way that it was in TGG by a great artist who had lived it in spades. In my view Gatsby is one of the most sympathetic characters in literature. Why is he vilified? He was just a guy, like millions before and after him, trying to impress his girl. He wanted her unconditional love and never got it. Ultimately she got him killed. Daisy. The one who was guilty of vehicular homicide and love suicide. Daisy. The one Fitzgerald magically levitated like the Zelda of his own life.is unsurpassed in capturing the Jazz Age, one of the most wild and reckless (and fun!) periods in American history.

I'm sure I would have learned stuff in high school, but I feel like I'm getting more appreciation out of books like this as I get older.<br />The only thing I knew about this book before I started reading was that it was a shallow love story that ends with the girl dumping the poor, innocent guy....or something.  And yes that is the plot, but I think the story can also be about the American dream and who it's really available to.  What is the American dream? Is it just getting money and it doesn't matter how? Did we really get away from social inequality?  I hadn't really thought about any of that before reading this book.  It made me wonder what my American dream is.  Do I just want to get lots of money, a big house, and tons of stuff? Or is there more to it than that?  Without spoiling the end, I feel like Mr. Fitzgerald's opinion on the matter is that some people are born to live the American dream and some aren't - and there isn't much you can do to change it.  The fate of Daisy and Gatsby really brings that tragic idea home.<br /><br />The parties were unreal. I was drooling over the mention of all the food.  I couldn't help but imagine the Dowager Countess from Downton Abbey coming to Gatsby's house and being appalled at what Americans called \\"a dinner party.\\"  My mind was buzzing with all the practical details and sheer amount of money that it would take to feed two dinners and tons of alcohol to that many people... But the parties and glamour are just covering up the fact that most of these people are shady, immoral, hypocritical and just plain unhappy.  Especially Tom and his wife Daisy.<br /><br />I loved the writing.  It was simple, charming, and witty - an interesting contrast to the much deeper story going on.  The last line about how we can't escape from the past points out that even though as Americans we say that anyone can achieve wealth, happiness and equality, the truth is we keep getting sucked into the rules of the past.<br /><br />The only thing I thought was overdone was the symbolic Eye Doctor bilboard in the ash valley. Don't let the symbolic Eye Doctor Ad/God's Judgement fall on you on the way out.<br /><br />Overall, a novel that got me really thinking about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the context of a beautiful, tragic, and romantic story.ericans we say that anyone can achieve wealth, happiness and equality, the truth is we keep getting sucked into the rules of the past.<br /><br />The only thing I thought was overdone was the symbolic Eye Doctor bilboard in the ash valley.

They could have put Robert Redford or Leo on the cover.  Yes, this has been on my list since the &#34;F-Stop Fitzgerald&#34; section of the Cerebus graphic novels.  And with the new movie coming out I figured I better read it before I saw the movie.  My daughter actually had the idea a few months earlier and I put of actually reading it until the week before the movie.  Fortunately it is a short and easy  read.<br /><br />Overall I liked the book and loved a few &#34;pre-post-modern&#34; sections in it.  Although I enjoyed it I must have missed the literary significance of a book about a stalker.<br /><br />Oh, and not spoil anything but I found the Robert Redford movie a much more accurate portrayal of the book and characters than the new movie.  That said, I still enjoyed the new movie (Leo was great; I didn't like Spidermand-Nick).	2013-05-23

A large proportion of the reviews come from readers who identify themselves as re-readers of the work.<br /><br />That includes me.<br /><br />My comments are for anyone considering a second reading of this most durable of American novels.<br /><br />When I opened up The Great Gatsby once again, this time in middle age, I was impressed by how triumphantly the novel belongs to the wide, ongoing current of American literature. The well-read Fitzgerald took seriously literature's calling and his own role within its tradition. And since its publication in 1925, Gatsby has exerted a gravitational pull on American literature.<br /><br />Readers returning to this book after an absence of decades are apt to notice how much it has served as a source of ideas and inspiration to subsequent American writers. The book is amazing on its own merits, of course, but there's additional pleasure in store for the seasoned reader as you spot affinities and influences based on your own reading history. Among the authors I believe The Great Gatsby influenced are Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, J.D. Salinger, and John Updike. This aspect of Fitzgerald's achievement was totally lost on me back in high school.<br /><br />When Daisy castigates Tom as \\"a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen,\\" chances are good you'll be reminded of the tension between Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski. When Nick, organizing the funeral, utters two devastating words -- \\"Nobody came\\" -- you may think of Willy Loman's widow, Linda, at the end of \\"Death of a Salesman,\\" expressing her pained confusion: \\"Why didn't anybody come? Where are all the people he knew? Maybe they blame him.\\" Then there's the bit of magic when Fitzgerald, in the opening chapter, transforms a ringing telephone into a living character capable of disordering a marriage -- an audacity I'm guessing John Updike was aware of and decided to pay homage to in his short story on the subject of adultery, \\"Your Lover Just Called,\\" found in the 1972 collection, \\"Museums & Women and Other Stories\\" (out of print; the story is now available in [[ASIN:0307271765 The Maples Stories (Everyman's Library Pocket Classics)]]).<br /><br />I was surprised to find the Gatsby's imprint on \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" (1952). There's a kinship, I think, between Holden and Nick Carraway, who, while older (29 going on 30), is in many ways just as unanchored as Holden, or Huck Finn for that matter. Each is a person whose moral education is not yet complete, each is a persona still in formation.<br /><br />Both \\"Catcher\\" and \\"Gatsby\\" use the framing device of a narrator who has escaped the scene of an intensely personal experience -- one that has run them down physically and emotionally. What Nick describes as his summer of \\"riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart\\" could, with some tailoring, fit the days Holden describes to us as \\"this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas\\". Both characters, now in recovery, convey their tales from a safe distance: Nick is \\"back home\\" in the middle west; Holden is in a California sanitarium, about to go back home. At the end of their stories Holden and Nick engage in virtually identical, small, symbolic acts in an attempt to rid their world of indecency: Holden erases an obscene graffiti in the stairwell of his sister Phoebe's school; Nick scrapes away an obscene word that a truant scrawled on the steps of his friend Gatsby's mansion.<br /><br />Fitzgerald himself was a self-described \\"enthusiastic worshipper\\" of T.S. Eliot, and if Eliot's poetry pleases you, there is pleasure to be had in discovering the impact of his verse throughout The Great Gatsby. Nick Carraway's character and behavior fits the mold of the narrator of \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.\\" Nick is glad to be of use to Daisy and Gatsby, and his attachment to Gatsby may well be described as that of an attendant Lord, one whose actions are deferential, politic, cautious, a bit obtuse. In the end Nick recognizes himself as, maybe, the Fool. I believe some details and incidents in the novel are loosely borrowed from \\"Prufrock.\\" For example, its easy to view Nick's perambulation of Manhattan in Chapter 3 (\\"At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others--poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows\\") to be a variation on Prufrock's habit of wandering at dusk through narrow streets to watch lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows. Prufrock's seaside romantic fantasy becomes Nick's street-side daydream; in both cases their yearnings are unrequited, since Prufrock's imagined mermaids will not sing to him, and Nick's elusive girls \\"fade through a door into warm darkness.\\"<br /><br />Yet the essential lessons of The Great Gatsby are of a different category, beyond the driving theme of nostalgia, and so much more than the colossal vitality of Gatsby's illusion. Otherwise, why would its final sentence -- \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past\\" -- have become inseparably bound to our vision of America? One of the rewards of re-reading the novel is to discover how carefully, how relentlessly, the author prepares us for this final revelation.k is glad to be of use to Daisy and Gatsby, and his attachment to Gatsby may well be described as that of an attendant Lord, one whose actions are deferential, politic, cautious, a bit obtuse.

Although it is quite the tragedy on the surface, this novel has it's own enchanting way of leaving you with a sense of hope by the end. There are several pockets of wonderful scenes that mesmerize the reader, allowing you to indulge in all the magnificence of the roaring 20s. There is something unquestionably satisfying about Gatsby's love story; his motives ignited by his twisted past and kept alive by his unknowing neighbor, all set on the backdrop of a rebellious, carefree America, make \\"The Great Gatsby\\" a must read. Generally, this is a novel that most of us read in high school once, but I highly recommend revisiting it sometime in the future. Just as Carraway points out, you can't relive the past exactly, and that is precisely why rereading this book is a must. Each return to this read brings out different aspects of the story, allowing for varying interpretations. This novel is jam packed with symbols in the classiest of ways, making for an exciting read with new revelations awaiting every reopening. Every time it comes off the shelf, there is something newly dynamic about the way Gatsby carries himself, and the way Nick Carraway tries to analyze him. While the novel is titled \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" it is really the story of the lonely Nick Carraway experiencing a pivotal time in his life, but through the medium of his ostentatious neighbor's disposition. Even after the characters and their relationships with each other have exhausted you, there is so much to visualize in the setting. Fitzgerald does a great job capturing the racy and adventurous nature of the early twenties. The larger-than-life parties and exclusive venues that the scenes of this novel are held in whisk you away to a time when everyone is celebrating. Drawn into the culture of underground wealth and bootlegging, mixed in with high-class societies, this novel is a great exchange of reality for a taste of opulence and drama. Gatsby's seemingly glamorous life is the perfect filter through which to experience one of the greatest time periods our nation has experienced.f opulence and drama.

Tears streaming down my face I read the last chapter and knew that this book was always meant to be my favorite. Beautifully written and penned during one of the most exhilarating times in history, it captured mind and soul instantly. Few things that I have come across in life have been able to capture such a tragic and gorgeous snapshot of love. Love like it was portrayed through the character of Jay Gatsby I believe to be exceedingly rare. Most of us feel that rose-colored feeling at least once in our lives (if not more). It is in our inability to cling to that pure love that we fall short of the passion that Gatsby embodied. Even Daisy so in love at first with Jay fell away. Life has a way of coming in and crushing it out: with money, with pride, with time, with things. It is a feeling indeed too true for us to understand to completely and too strong for us to grasp for very long. Extraordinary indeed, then that Gatsby could do that very thing - hold on to that authentic, bright, untainted love even through all the years. The main character- an observer- touched on the reason briefly in the very first chapter...\\"it was an extraordinary gift for hope\\". I would encourage anyone to read this book if only to glimpse for a few short hours into what the rest of us lack in extremity...tremendous hope and  untarnished love.	2013-05-19

The characters and setting are described in good detail so that the reader is able to enter the 1920's at ease. I originally believed that this was a love story of Jay Gatsby reclaiming his love, Daisy Buchanan, doing whatever it took to have her back. However, Fitzgerald keeps things interesting with plot twists that include adultery, identity confusion and tragic deaths. While in the beginning, I was hoping that there would be a happy ending for Gatsby; my view began to change as Daisy's true identity unraveled. I was surprised to see Daisy's alliance change back to her cheating and abusive husband, after finding out that Gatsby was \\"new money\\" and had become wealthy from bootlegging alcohol. She's proven to be a shallow, allowing the lethal accident of her husband's mistress to be blamed on Gatsby, even though she was responsible. Fitzgerald made Nick into a great character, having him be level-headed and aware of the atrocities around him. As the reader, I appreciated having a character that had similar thoughts as me: that I was disgusted with the nonchalant attitude of Daisy after she had killed a woman and broken a heart. This isn't just a love story, but a novel that focuses on the American Dream and Gatsby's was living a life that revolved around Daisy. He had been raised with humble beginnings but after meeting Daisy, he realized the only way of winning her heart would be through money. Despite the immoral ways he achieves his wealth, as a reader, you appreciate his determination and drive to succeed. Overall, Fitzgerald wrote a timeless classic that is appreciated by readers everywhere.  It's truly an accomplishment for a writer if people are still raving about their book even when it's nearly 90 years later.	2013-05-17

It's about ten years since my first reading and I can't remember why I didn't like it back then, but it may have had something to do with the fact that it's quite a depressing story.<br /><br />Now I appreciate the subtleties of it a bit more and I can see that it's an attack on the concept of the American dream which Jay Gatsby buys into hook, line and sinker. My interpretation was helped by a review I read of Baz Luhrmann's film. Sadly it seems Luhrmann has been as seduced by the glitz and glamour as Gatsby himself and missed the whole point of the story, but I digress.<br /><br />Daisy represents the world of wealth and privilege Gatsby desperately wants to be part of, and he thinks that if he can possess her then he will have fulfilled his heart's desire (it reminds me a lot of Henry James' The American in this sense). Never mind that Daisy is shallow, frivolous and spoilt, because it's not really the woman he loves, and he makes this clear when he tells Nick her voice sounds like money. She is the first truly wealthy person he has come in close contact with and her money casts a spell over him that leads to his undoing.<br /><br />Gatsby sells his soul to make enough money to win Daisy over and the extent of his corruption and naivet&eacute; is tragically clear at the end when none of the people who were so happy to partake of his hospitality can be bothered attending his funeral. Daisy doesn't even call or send flowers. Gatsby is just collateral damage to them, a victim of the selfish, ruthless world he yearned to be a part of.<br /><br />The writing in the book is deceptively simple because it's poetic and even enchanting at times in its descriptions. He captures the essence of the jazz era so well that I felt like I was at the boozy parties, breathing the smoky air and watching everyone get drunker and more debauched. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it's made me want to go back and re-read some of the books I've dismissed in the past because your perspective can change dramatically over time.to go back and re-read some of the books I've dismissed in the past because your perspective can change dramatically over time.	2013-05-16

The narration by Nick Carroway gives the story some distance from Gatsby and the other characters.  His pursuit of Daisy Buchanan ends tragically, with the husband of the accident victim blaming Gatsby for her death.  He then shots Gatsby in his swimming pool.  The writing by Fitzgerald is of a very high quality, and standard.  The character of Gatsby is a bit of an enigma.  He gains wealth in order to try and rekindle his relationship to Daisy, who is married to a thug.  Although the parties at Gatsby's house are glamorous and decadent, the novel is really a warning about the consequences of the love of wealth and status on society.  Daisy will not leave her husband because she does not want to sacrifice her status and access to wealth.  I particularly liked the last 50 pages or so of the novel.  There is a number of passages that contain great writing.  The ending was very sad, but it was in keeping with the story.  I will always remember reading this book for another reason.  Just before I read about Gatsby's death, I heard about someone close to a member of my family, who had been unjustly murdered.  We had seen him only months before.  It obviously made reading about Gatsby's death more painful.  I suppose it is just one of life's coincidences.	2013-05-16

Eliot, they have measured out their lives in coffee spoons.  All the tragedies are of their own making and not especially interesting.<br /><br />The writing, perhaps stellar in its day, seems stilted and sometimes unnecessarily convoluted now.

Fitzgerald pails in comparison to writers like George Orwell, John Irving, or Kurt Vonigut who don't feel the need to fill their books with unnecessary over description. George Orwell said if a word can be cut out, always cut it out. Writing should be written how you talk and should come across easily. Fitzgerald's abuse of description goes too far and neither makes him a genius or a good writer as many have elevated him to such levels. All it does is make his writing more tedious to read than a google user agreement. On top of that, his characters are shallow and without any real substance and the story overall couldn't be more boring. Fitzgerald's entire life's work is utter garbage.	2013-05-14

Seeing the movie, helped me form a better foundation for the story. One of the things i couldn't understand was why i hated Daisy and desperately wished Jordan would pair up with Gatsby instead. Having this idea i thought it was due to me not understanding the plot fully. There is no comparrision to my comprehension of when i was in middle school to now. The way i would describe Gatsby, \\"self-adbsorbed, obsessive borderline almost paranoid\\" a very complex individual whose only reason to continue his pursuit is for a love that he holds on a pedestal with no regards to time, and changes. In his mind, Daisy is the same which is quite the opposite. Daisy as i would describe her \\"coward, self-centered, paternally absent.\\" It was made clear throughout the story that very little interest was shown to her daughter much less anything or anyone that would not fit in her perfect world. Having no problems, leaving Gatsby to his fate, and scared at the time of what her fate would be if she decided to leave with him she stayed with Tom. Jordan was nothing more if not spectacular in this triangle. Nick, was a friend that many wish to have. Tom, in short was Tom. He is who is, not much disappointment. Unlike Gatsby who at one point i got desperate enough, that i wanted to tell him to move on from this air-headed bimbo. Seeing his child-like expressions whenever she would come near almost like candy made me disturbed. I feel sorry for Gatsby, if i pity him yes. I feel sorry for Daisy forever being told and reigned of his path and future by an alpha male too scared to independent and brave.	2013-05-13

Fitzgerald said the rich were different from us,yes,said Hemingway, they have more money. Fitzgerald had written about the lives of the rich, and now he remained associated with them.In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write \\"something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.\\" That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became The Great Gatsby, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. \\"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--\\" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.Gatsby is a flawed hero in his devotion and the vitality of his illusion,his capacity for hope. Fitzgerald allows us to invest him with mystery through the narrator Nick Carroway.Gatsby's faithful to his love for Daisy and his idea he can win her.\\"Only Gatsby turned out alright in the end\\",the only character operating according to a code.The Buchanans are the villains disappearing into their money.Nick returns to the mid-west.<br /><br />Fitzgerald was inspired by the sensuous poetry of Keats,so the novel works because of its brevity,the restrained extravagance of its style.He writes well about the romantic mind and the aspirations of the American Dream,his life a symbol of the Jazz Age. The Great Gatsby with great economy sums up an epoch.He utilises symbolism that he'd learned from Henry James,so there's talk of Old World and New World,Old Money and New Money,the `green light' of Gatsby's aspirations,'boats beating against the current'.The tone of elegy was from Eliot's Waste Land,the artist was the only contemporary link with an age of gold,with the artist suffering the violence of the modern world,coming out of service in the war.Poverty is described by the `valley of ashes' where the Wilsons live over the garage,a couple who figure largely in Gatsby's fate.The central idea is that we started from scratch and can start again from scratch in life.The prose glints with epigrammatic ease and splendour of language,so the reader's imagination lights up whole paragraphs.Beautiful descriptions of trains in Nick's youth,the weather,Gatsby's parties,the litany of lists,names.What the book sets up especially is the West vs.East theme of escape from history,the unspoiled past, the impeccable past of nostalgia, not a snowflake out of place. We look at it from the perspective of a remorseless East-ernising which appears to be synonymous with the movement of history itself.<br /><br />The story is told by Nick Carroway,a dealer in bonds,a humble neighbour of Gatsby.Gatsby thinks getting rich in the class-ridden world he lived in-will get him Daisy,but it's not enough.Money didn't buy class,there was a difference between old money and new money,but Gatsby can't tell the difference.

My English teacher, of course, objected and gave me a lecture on what a great classic the novel was.  Nevertheless, and to his credit, I received an A on the report for my analysis and effort.  30 some years later, my view that The Great Gatsby is a trashy novel gets even stronger.  Philosophically shallow, socially disoriented,<br />the story centers around caricatures which seem to have jumped out of a collections of melodramatic soap operas.<br /><br />F Scott Fitzgerald really belonged to Hollywood. If he were younger, or had lived longer, he would have turned out some episodes for Dallas and Knots Landing.  Many people might be disappointed, but Fitzgerald was no James Joyce or Henry James - not even in the league of Hemingway.	2013-05-12

It delivers an interesting take on the 1920s through a beautifully written prose and an interesting plot. My only quarrel is that some of the characters seemed to exist for the sole reason of advancing the plot. I also felt that even the main characters were not developed enough, at least to my own taste. I can understand, but not fully accept the high esteem, in which people hold this novel. Overall, it’s a well written novel, but not a great one.	2013-05-12

Like Fitzgerald's contemporary, Hemingway, his book reflects the aimlessness for those in the lost generation. Amidst a dizzying spin of parties and drinking, the true nature of man is unearthed. Through delusions, plotting, and scheming, the chap's in this book reveal that in the wake of world war I, the abandonment of the search of meaning and goodness threw out all the best of humanity. They all live in a pointless amoral world, where nothing new arises except the next party. The novel also shows the great evil and corrupting power of both jealousy and wealth, two of the most dangerous things in the universe. The novel displays the carelessness and indifference that wealth brings while showing how the cancer of jealousy and past desire can manipulate the future into a fantasy world. It also shows the hypocritical nature of those who harp on traditional values as an excuse for injustice and engage in hypocrisy. Ultimately, the Great Gatsby is a tale of a generation that had lost there way in a a dizzying mix of indifference, lust, and greed.<br /><br />This is a fantastic story, when it is read by those who search for it's meaning. Recommended to any reader of the classics.	2013-05-10

You know, it's really easy to review a book that nobody has read. People will take what I say (undoubtedly with a grain of salt) and make the decision to read or not. Upon finishing the book, my words will be long forgotten and therefore not really subject to any close scrutiny. But then you pick up a book that everybody and their mama (literally) have read and it's a tad more daunting of a task. So allow me to ramble on this way for a few paragraphs without actually saying anything of substance. OK? No? Damnit.<br /><br />For being a reasonably short novel, The Great Gatsby really is quite a bear of a book. I remember first reading Gatsby in high school and spending countless classes going over all the symbolism and other such literary devices that are peppered through the novel. This time however, I took the approach of enjoyment reading. Though I did pause to reflect on certain passages (and yes, I even remembered some of that symbolism), I was certainly aware that many of the book's subtleties were soaring far above my head.<br /><br />But despite missing some of what made Gatsby...well, Gatsby - I really did enjoy the read. Fitzgerald brings such life not only to his characters, but also to the setting. And I definitely was able to better understand the plot line this time around. As incredibly suave and savvy as I was as a 15 year old (I absolutely was not), I don't believe I fully understood the whole american-dream-gone-wrong theme. Gatsby was a much darker novel that I remembered - and I kind of loved discovering that for myself.	2013-05-09

The American Dream... making a name for yourself, chasing money, morality, relationships, good and evil - it's all there in Gatsby and still in our society today.

To suggest it is the greatest American novel of all time says something about the judgement of reviewers or the poor quality of American literature. I suspect the former. We have this ongoing relationship between Gatsby and his neighbour, which never seems to go anywhere really. And then there is Daisy. Then death and it's over. I read it as an e-book and that may had something to do with it. Perhaps a paperback version may be assisted with engagement. I sensed that the electronic version seemed to have something missing. Actually there was a point where I thought pages were MIA as the sentences did not follow through on to the next page. By that stage I was losing patience with the book anyway.	2013-05-08

I first read it over 30 years ago and loved it from the first reading. I've read it every few years ever since. If I could write like anyone, it would be F. Scott Fitzgerald.<br /><br />The whole package doesn't quite come together in Fitzgerald's other novels, but this book is close to perfect. The language is lovely and lyrical. The ideas are thought-provoking. As I get older, each time I reread it different passages speak to me. The characters are well drawn. The narrator is authentic. This is one of the greatest American novels ever written. It tells an unavoidable melancholy truth.<br /><br />This time I listened to the excellent audio version read by Frank Muller.<br /><br />On a side note: I loved The Great Gatsby movie starring Robert Redford when it came out in 1974. It started my continuing admiration for Sam Waterston. I do not have high hopes for the new version. Whether you see the movie or not, whether you see the movie and like it or dislike it, read the book.	2013-05-08

I only bought it because I knew I would need a lot of reading material while I was recovering from my bunionectomy (details of which I'll get to in a minute) and because I like romance.  Big mistake.<br /><br />O.K. the first red flag was that this book isn't part of any series.  In my experience if a book isn't part of a series it probably didn't turn out too well and the author probably didn't really know what he was doing.  I'm sorry, but if something's good people want more, you know?  Like Fiddle Faddle (5 Stars!)  Or Vicodin.<br /><br />The second red flag happens real early.  In my copy this happens on page 6 but I use a pretty big font, so it might be different for you.  Anyway the main guy, Nick?, Ned? says he had a dog until it ran away.  Does he tell us what kind of dog?  No.  Does Ned contact the SPCA?  Make posters?  No, he goes to his neighbor's mansion for more cocktails.  If a writer hates dogs it's pretty hard for me to care about his story or his characters.  I know it was supposed to be \\"the roaring 40's\\" and everything, but IMHO every character in this book needed to find a good church with a regular AA meeting in the basement.  You might think I'm being overly sensitive (or you're a cat person like my evil step-sister) but the thing is I was in the middle of exploring just how much this author hates dogs when the terrible trauma happened to Sprinkles.  MY DOG.<br /><br />See because of my surgery procedure (which also corrected my hammer toe condition ouchy-ouch!) I knew I wasn't going to be able to take Sprinkles out very much.  So I bought him a new rubber toy to play with cause he gets pretty wound up and will start chewing the paneling off the walls if he's not let outside at least once a day.  I got him an \\"Extra-Large Purple Pimple Bone with Bell\\".  It looked fun but I should have done more research.  I would tell you to check out my review for this appalling product, but I haven't posted it yet since I'm still waiting to get an email back from the personal injury attorney I contacted on Sprinkle's behalf.<br /><br />What happened was Sprinkles was being a very good doggy, gnawing on the pimple bone and throwing it in the air just like he was supposed to when suddenly I realized I wasn't hearing the bell anymore.<br /><br />You can imagine my horror when I picked up my little baby and gave him a gentle shake.  Sprinkles jingled!  And it wasn't his collar.  (He had swallowed the bell!!)<br /><br />Total panic.  Okay, he was breathing fine and didn't seem at all effected, but believe me, intestinal blockage is a serious emergency.<br /><br />However not everyone knows this - an example of this kind of ignorance would be my two \\"so-called friends\\" who were \\"unavailable\\" to help me.  Also my step-sister (she's actually my real sister but I call her my step-sister because she's evil) who said she had done me enough favors since she drove me home from Dr. Schmuger's after my bunionectomy and I vomited in her car - which I explained at the time was a perfectly natural reaction to five hours of twilight anesthesia.  Anyway, long story short guess who had to rush Sprinkles (and his pet carrier) to the vet on the bus?  On crutches!<br /><br />Well, I limped down to the bus stop okay, but then I found out they'd changed all the bus numbers! The 16 is now a 37L or 38F and runs about every hour and a half.  And then to transfer downtown I had to take the 11 which is now the 18A.  Then the driver didn't want to let me on with Sprinkles and I had to explain that he was experiencing an emergency colonic obstruction and if he wanted my dog to just die on his stupid folding bus bench he should just say so.  The driver finally let us on, but then he had the gall to say - and this is a direct quote, \\"Alright, somebody give the crazy b with the crutches one of the gimp seats!\\"  I was so infuriated I forgot to get the driver's name, but I've written a letter to the transportation authority with a very thorough description.  I'm guessing they've gotten complaints from others about this man and they should be able to match it up pretty easily.  I'm actually sure this will happen because I also included a sketch - I can be quite an artist when I'm enraged.<br /><br />At this point some of you may be wondering why I went all the way across town to ZooMergency when Dr. Paws is closer.  If you're one of those people I would urge you check out my 2008 blog post \\"Christmas with Sarcoptic Mange\\" to see why I will never be going back to Dr. Paws!<br /><br />BTW, typo alert! Gayety?  I think I know how to spell \\"gaiety\\" - too bad this author doesn't.<br /><br />Anyway, I hobble into ZooMergency and of course even though I called ahead I still had to wait.<br /><br />Fortunately I had my Kindle with me, unfortunately I was still reading this book.<br /><br />Dear Mr. F. Scott, There are no \\"yachts\\" in Lake Superior.  I've been to this Lake with my relatives.  It's freezing, you can't even get up to your knees without shivering and needing to pee.  And the only boats they have on it are big barges filled with taconite balls.  I doubt this writer ever spent any time in Minnesota and was only using the location because people think the midwest is full of moral people or something, which if you go by my relatives is a misguided notion for sure.<br /><br />I actually couldn't concentrate on the book that well because of all the cat hair in the waiting room.  Sprinkles is terribly allergic to cats and every time my poor baby sneezed the bell would ding and I'd get upset all over again.<br /><br />If you're someone who thinks that's amusing then you're probably the Creep in the waiting room with the boa constrictor that kept sticking its head out of its bag to stare at my sweet little defenseless dog.  Attention Creep, constantly fondling the head of your snake and cooing \\"Easy, Carmine, that's not the dinner bell,\\" gets pretty old after 75 minutes.<br /><br />And then when they finally called us in we got stuck with some intern doctor.  How hard can it be to figure out what's wrong?  Here's the chewed-up purple pimple bone, shake Sprinkles, two plus two, right?  No, he wanted to run up the bill with x-rays.<br /><br />$496.27 later he announces that - \\"The bell looks pretty small, he can probably just pass it.\\"  Well if he'd just asked me how big the bell was I could have told of him, I didn't need to spend five hundred smackers.  And then right after that he had the nerve to ask, \\"What do you usually feed him? He looks like he could lose a few pounds.\\"  Sprinkles is half Cockeranian!!  Of course he gains weight easily - he's also part Schnoodle  and curly hair can often give the illusion that someone is fat.  I learned this last year when I let that horrible \\"beautician\\" at Shear Joy talk me into a perm.  I'm sure Shear Joy is out of business now so I don't need to mention her name, but just in case it isn't I can tell you she's the anorexic one with the ring in her nose.<br /><br />So anyway, then this same \\"veterinarian\\" tries to talk me into a ridiculously expensive prescription. Like I told him, \\"Thanks for your expert advice, but why would I spend $45 on doggy laxatives when I can just go home and cook up a pound of bacon?\\"<br /><br />And ZooMergency, if you think you can just ignore your customers when they dispute blatant overcharges I would suggest you scroll over to your yelp page and see what a certain \\"insane\\" customer has to say about the way a certain \\"Dr.\\" Miguel Woo treats his patients.<br /><br />After that ordeal we managed to make it home and here's the good news: I probably lost five pounds after hopping on my crutches for 20 blocks when the 37F failed to arrive.  And the bad news?  I discovered my armpits had broken out in hives.<br /><br />I'm no stranger to treating fungal infections, but unfortunately due to my bunion dressings I couldn't take a neck-deep bath in Quaker Oats and Maple Sugar like I usually do.Basically I just had to go \\"topless\\" and suffer.<br /><br />Oh and here's a tip - if you're going to be cooking a lot of bacon while semi-nude I would suggest using a low flame - you'll be happier.<br /><br />After I fed Sprinkles the drippings (his absolute favorite - and he never remembers there's a price to pay) I got back to the Great Gatsby.  I wasn't going to even finish the book but I read the part where the Mertle character gets an Airedale and I wanted to see what happens to it.  But here's the thing Spoiler! they never tell you!<br /><br />As for the rest of the book I have to say I agree with the tenth-grader who said the book made him want to take a nap every three pages.  Only in my case it wasn't \\"nap\\" it was \\"scratch the suppurating sores in my armpits like a baboon.\\"<br /><br />It was a long night - thank heavens for Vicodin!  If I could review Vicodin I would give it four stars.  I'd like to give it five stars, but one side effect is that it tends to give me a pinchy cramp just below my bellybutton after I've eaten bacon.<br /><br />And in case you're wondering, Sprinkles' story has a much better ending than this \\"novel\\".<br /><br />After eight trips to the backyard (I'm sure my nosy neighbors were curious why I was running outside half-naked with a flashlight and chopsticks all night - not that it's any of their business) I finally, FINALLY found the bell shining in the moonlight.

US	35621683	R1OFOSFNUMLT4K	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The Great Gatsby - Discipline of Craftsmanship	The Great Gatsby, along with Gone with the Wind and The Grapes of Wrath achieved something quite rare in the world of literature. They all defined an era of American history.<br /><br />In the case of The Great Gatsby, one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, it defined the America of the 1920s. Published in 1925, this book has never gone out of print. What makes this book live on for so long? Why is it still taught in the classroom? Why does it not appear to be dated?<br /><br />The answer is the carefully constructed prose that fills each and every page of the book. It reads like a piece of music. It is lyrical in both tone and substance. It is also about the romance of power and money. This resonates today and will never go out of style.<br /><br />The story is told in the third person. The narrator, Nick Caraway is a young clerk at a banking firm who has moved from the Midwest to NY to try his hand at making it big. He has rented a small cottage in a fashionable village of Long Island, called \\"West Egg\\" in the novel. This location, a place of quiet natural allure and the other village called \\"East Egg\\" is reminiscent of the North Shore villages of Long Island, Kings Point and Sands Point, respectively.<br /><br />His neighbor is and is not a contrast to the mellow, self-effacing Caraway. Just next door, separated by a vast lawn of carefully cut grass, is the estate of Jay Gatsby, a shy self-invented tycoon of sorts, who throws lavish parties on the lawn, never shows his face to many people and who secretly Caraway admires for his incredible success. It is summer, and this is the setting for a majority of the novel.<br /><br />In a way, it is also partly autobiographical. Fitzgerald came from the Midwest as does Nick Caraway, the narrator. And since Fitzgerald was writing about his contemporaries of the present day in the 1920s, it is worth noting that he knew at least partly of the kind of life that is so richly described in this book.<br /><br />Gatsby is a powerful man with few friends but many associates who help him get things done. Soon after, Gatsby invites Caraway over to one of the parties and is introduced to him. There is a purpose for this. Nick is the cousin of the other main character, Daisy Buchanan, whom Gatsby was engaged to years earlier. Gatsby's main purpose is to rekindle the romance with Daisy by asking Nick to ask Daisy to come over to Caraway's cottage so Gatsby can meet her there. Kind of convoluted but it is fascinating how Fitzgerald's natural talent at storytelling and his keen eye for dialogue and descriptiveness is what makes the novel endearing, even if the characters themselves are not.<br /><br />For example, this is a passage that describes how Nick feels about Daisy's singing.<br />\\"Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\\"<br /><br />Another passage describes an early encounter between Gatsby and Daisy, years before. \\"His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lip's touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.\\"<br /><br />Daisy Buchanan is by nature a very loving person, who speaks from the heart, but she is selfish and immature but without a streak of meanness. Her husband, Tom Buchanan is very well to do. He rides horses and is very aggressive in his likes and dislikes. He is also condescending and interrupts Daisy when she is speaking so he can have his say.The characters in this novel are fast living and afraid as they approach middle age and they are all disillusioned about life. Idle gossip is the norm as the characters swelter in the heat of summer.<br /><br />This novel appeals to both men and women because in every scene men and women figure prominently. There is nothing is this novel that is archaic or that would even give the impression that it's about the 1920s. It is to Fitzgerald's talent and sheer hard work of rewriting until it was right that every scene is suggestive of thought and mood by characters that at the core are superficial and ignorant of anything beyond their pursuits. They want to have a good time regardless of consequences. They can be wild and sassy beasts, full of rage and bliss.<br /><br />Gatsby is a wealthy private man with romantic speculation. Caraway on his lunch hour walks down Fifth Avenue and imagines himself as boyfriend to the various women who pass by, living a better life, maybe a life like Gatsby's.<br /><br />There is the need to be accepted by improving one's social position; afraid of going to the poor house. It is the wariness of inventing one's self to fit in that is dramatized every so subtly on every page; a desire to belong to that special group of snobs but never really trusting any of them. The morale of the story is that money and position do not last.

I read it originally as a junior in high school and remember REALLY enjoying it.  Since the movie is coming out in a few days, I decided to reread it.  It was NOT as good as I remember and is, in fact, more of a cautionary tale than anything else.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A LOVE STORY.<br /><br />I know the previews for the movie make it out to be so, but it is not.  Don't be fooled!  Nick Carraway is our narrator and he does a lovely job or presenting the story of the Great Gatsby to us.<br /><br />This book is a fascinating glimpse into the era of the 1920s, but I'm not sure I'd read it again (though I have already read it more than once).  It's sad, and there's not much to like about any of the main characters - even Nick.  But the second to last chapter will leave your head spinning!	2013-05-05

I make it a point to read it each year in early summer, when I imagine the book begins.<br /><br />One curious thing about the book is that I cannot picture it as anything but a period piece.

Seriously, with out a doubt the first few pages of this so called classic are nothing but soliloquies. The author, Fitzgerald, kills any dramatic tension by boring the reader with needless ruminations about the POV's father and way overdone turns of abstract narrative.<br />Although the plot and characterizations are novel, this book could easily be reduced to half its pages.

The plot of the novel is such that Fitzgerald could  really write a great novel, but he only used this to ramble about his depressing love and life story. Since he was a loser, he took revenge by writing it in the most boring style and language. I had to force myself to finish this nonsense of a \\"classic novel\\". This is a novel that has been made \\"classic\\" by forcing poor school children to read it. The ideas like \\"American Dream\\", \\"Emptiness\\" and \\"shallowness\\" of Americans might be exiting ideas in the era this novel was written. We have been reading about and experiencing those things all our lives,even in the daily news. Those ideas are deplorable and depressing, but not fresh. I wish Amazon has an option for \\"Zero Star\\" rating which would absolutely fit this waste of paper and ink. God forgive you for torturing us with this piece of sh**, Fitzgerald!	2013-04-25

Whenever I mentioned I was reading it to friends, they all said something along the lines of \\"That is one of my favorites.  You are going to love it.\\"  Sadly, I did not.<br /><br />Sure, the writing style was truly impressive.  Fitzgerald really has a way with words.<br /><br />And, admittedly, the storyline is interesting.  When Nick Carraway rents a small house on Long Island in 1922, he quickly gets drawn into the shady lives of his wealthy neighbors, including the mysterious Jay Gatsby who lives in the lavish mansion right next door.  In my humble opinion, the plot read like a juicy tabloid magazine about affluent socialites.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the book, I think the reason I didn't love it is that I didn't really care for any of the characters.  Deceit, arrogance, entitlement, infidelity . . . none of them really conducted themselves in a respectable manner.  The narrator, Nick, was benign enough, but he struck me as relatively colorless.  He merely served as the observer of the scrupleless folks around him.<br /><br />Despite these shortcomings, I can still genuinely recommend that you read the book.  It's a notable American classic, a quick and easy read, and you really should read it before you go see the new movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio this month.  So read it and enjoy it.  Just don't blame me if you don't love it.	2013-04-21

Of course, this may be true, but reading it again (this time for unbiased pleasure rather than have it forced upon me by an over-analytical teacher) I've realized that it's more than this. This is a story of power, wealth, corruption and love. Now you may yell at me, \\"Isn't that proof of the American Dream?\\" Well, yes and no. Contrary to popular media beliefs, wealth does not directly lead to corruption (and vice-versa.) As with everything, life outcomes are different person to person, as we are not some standardized machine walking about the earth. The Declaration of Independence (in which The American Dream is derived from,) says that all men are created equal; although we may have been created equal, we grow into individualized personalities. This could probably open a whole nature vs. nurture debate, but I won't get into that. The Great Gatsby is also an example of the Marxist views on materialism and morality. In this case, a little farm boy named Jimmy Gatz works himself up the society ladder to become Jay Gatsby, and through his wealth, he obtained power. Through corruption, he reached for love.<br /><br />Love did not reach back.<br /><br />\\"So we drove on towards death through the cooling twilight.\\"<br />(653)<br /><br />Gatsby's vainglory and vanity in his wealth became the deadly sin personified. He did everything to look important and to have his name attached to high society. Throwing lavish parties for people he didn't even know, and doing dealings with people who didn't care about him, all deconstructed to pride and materialism. Impressing Daisy was a major influence for him; a promiscuous woman who in all eventuality didn't give a care in the world for him. Staring and dreaming upon that little green light across the bay; green which symbolizes rebirth (not to mention envy.) Gatsby changed for Daisy, back and forth, trying to recapture a beloved part of his past.<br /><br />\\"He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.\\"<br />(636)<br /><br />As for my reaction to The Great Gatsby, just as when I read it almost ten years ago, I love it. Well, I love the storyline aspect because it showed a prideful and vulnerable human being tarnished and destroyed by the very things he loved. I admit that by the time I was finished with the book I basically disliked everyone in the book; Daisy and Tom, because of the obvious; Nick Carraway (the narrator) because he reintroduced Daisy and Gatsby; and Gatsby because of his blissful ignorance. It is the reasons why I dislike the characters that made me love the story. I also found it interesting that Daisy and Gatsby, supposedly the only sober people in the book, were the most depraved, and somehow the mix of the two became a volatile piece of destruction. Gatsby surrounded himself with the false hope of friends and love, only to be left alone and unloved.<br /><br />\\"No - Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\\"<br />(564)<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those unhappy with life and needing an influential tale of human nature, high society disadvantages and love. Other works in which the same American Dream concept that I have more recently read are Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck and The Buddha in the Attic by Julie Otsuka.<br /><br />-------------<br />First Line: \\"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.\\" (563)<br /><br />Last Line:\\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" (683)<br />-------------<br />Quotes:<br /><br />\\"People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away.\\" (586)<br /><br />\\"In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.\\" (588)<br /><br />\\"It's a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people.

I feel insulted for some reason. Maybe it's because I know I'll have to explain myself.  I'll have to distinguish myself from intellectually shallow people who prefer a good football game to a good book. I'll have to list the great works I do respect. Sometimes, I too am convinced that some folks out there are just intellectually dishonest. Whenever the topic of literature arises, I brace for the eventual discovery and judgment of my tastes and intelligence.  I don't like &#34;Crime and Punishment&#34;.  I think the prose are disjointed and nonsensical.  The motivation of raskolnikov bewilderding.  Yawn.<br /><br />That being said.  Far too many people I know and respect absolutely love the book.  It happens to top most favorites lists.  I guess I'm just out of the loop on that one.  Unfortunately for you (1 star reviewers), you're out of the loop on this one.<br /><br />I breezed through this book in a day, and found it to be just as engrossing as any modern pop fiction novel.  Most of the negative reviews I have read had to do with the reader's negative reaction to the &#34;shallow&#34;, &#34;selfish&#34;, etc. characters.  The reviewers also seemed disappointed in the lack of character development. There were a few other points made, but these two seemed to be the most frequent and so these are the two ill address.<br /><br />Perhaps, with all of your wisdom and experience, people like the characters of this novel would repel you instantly.  Maybe daisy's charms would float right over you, or Jay's enthusiasm for living would grate your nerves.  I've read some 5 star reviews that also highlight the shallowness of the characters, but see it as a criticism of 1920's society.  I'm afraid I don't see it that way.  I guess because maybe I know these people in real life.  They're broken and empty, but not any less human than anyone else.  My point is, you might not like them instinctively, but they are not invalid straw men.  Poor character development?  Why?  Because there isn't a character arc?  Most people don't change in real life.  From the outside, it's easy to judge daisy's weakness, Jay's misplaced dreams, etc.  But how different are these people from any of us?<br /><br />Most of us Americans live better than 90% of the planet.  We live better than 99.9999...% of any human in the history of our species.  How would the true have nots see us?  Divorcing at an astronomical rate.  Complaining that our steaks cost too much, that our gas is too much, 40 hour work weeks, plane delays, tv commercials... You get the point.  How shallow are we?  Daisy isn't any different than a lot of women I know.  Trapped between pragmatism and romance.  For the feminists, George Wilson is a pretty familiar modern husband.

Hopefully I didn't wander too far off topic., but not any less human than anyone else.  My point is, you might not like them instinctively, but they are not invalid straw men.  Poor character development?  Why?  Because there isn't a character arc?  Most people don't change in real life.  From the outside, it's easy to judge daisy's weakness, Jay's misplaced dreams, etc.  But how different are these people from any of us?<br /><br />Most of us Americans live better than 90% of the planet.  We live better than 99.9999...% of any human in the history of our species.  How would the true have nots see us?  Divorcing at an astronomical rate.  Complaining that our steaks cost too much, that our gas is too much, 40 hour work weeks, plane delays, tv commercials... You get the point.  How shallow are we?  Daisy isn't any different than a lot of women I know.  Trapped between pragmatism and romance.  For the feminists, George Wilson is a pretty familiar modern husband.  Jay Gatsby is the American dream actualized.  The quickest path from destitution to opulence, fast and loose.<br /><br />I could keep going, but I've just been killing time in the waiting room at the hospitals.  Now, it's time to go.

Having never read it, and only knowing it by name and nothing else, I can say it's definitely different from what I expected. Not sure what I was expecting, but I wasn't expecting a love story. It is really a love story after all. With that in mind, I'm glad I read it, but I don't know if I would say it's \\"the great American novel\\" though. Maybe for it's time it was, but not sure I could honestly say that now (though I also can't say what the \\"great American novel\\" is as I've never put a lot of thought into it).<br /><br />This book is great for it's size. It's paced well, and it's easy to get into. It's a good book, and while it might not be \\"the great American novel\\" (in my eyes), it's definitely an American classic that should be read by all. It's a great example of how to tell a good story without being long winded.	2013-04-11

Nearly one hundred years after it was written, it has become a GREAT book.<br /><br />Not a long book, it's barely 50,000 words. This is the closest thing to a \\"prose poem\\" as exists.<br /><br />Sure, the incidents in the book are from the \\"Jazz Age\\".  But the book is about<br />'making it' in America.  Faking it until you make it.  Or don't.  Or in the case of Tom Buchanan, wealthy, athletically gifted, outwardly a success, but a total failure as a human being.<br /><br />The movies that have been made from the book have been failures. They focus on what can be marketed, advertised: the wild parties, the drinking, the wealth.  The Baz Luhrmann movie will be even more Baroque.<br /><br />What people miss is the austerity, the simplicity, of the narrative. And the storyline. Fitzgeralds ability to paint with words. The reflections of the narrator, Nick Carraway. He sets the tone, tells the tale, and illustrates the moral. For ultimately, this is a moral tale.<br /><br />The ending begins:<br /><br />\\"One of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. . . . When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again.\\"<br /><br />Nick has returned home.  He's looking back on events.<br /><br />The last six or seven pages in this novel are so exceptionally well written they rank with a few of the most famous soliloquies in Shakespeare.<br /><br />\\"So we beat on...\\"<br /><br />One man, reflecting on the lessons of life.	2013-04-10

Other volumes use pictures of Daisy or Gatsby on their covers. This version features the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg staring over East and West Egg, crying due to the moral decay of the aristocracy and the unreachable American dream. Before attempting to understand Fitzgerald's intense symbolism, one should research a little about the life and culture of the roaring 20s. This book is an American treasure and should be read at all.	2013-03-20

The book has a moderately interesting plot and even a philosophical insight. It seems to me that the meaning of the story is that people oftentimes try to recapture some of their past in the future but, of course, it always evades them.

It's a book for thought, not for thrill or plot, but for symbol, character, and author's purpose.  Like I said , I read this in the context of an eleventh grade english class :)	2013-03-09

His prose is so pure, polished, smooth and poignant, as expressed in the famous last sentence, &#34;So we beat on, boats agaisnt the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past&#34;.  The book leaves you with almost physical sensation of despair and the awe of beauty at the same time, and I believe that  a book that can generate both cerebral and visceral reactions in readers shows the power of good literature.	2013-03-07

I believe that this book is a definite must read for quite a few reasons: The intricate relationship between Jay Gatsby and Daisy Fay Buchanan, the excellent  representation of 1920's America, the absolute mastery of the pen that F. Scott Fitzgerald seems to have, and many more.<br />The book follows Nick Carraway, a man from Minnesota who moves to New York and moves in next to a wealthy man who goes by the name of Jay Gatsby. Nick leaves home one evening for dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom, an old classmate of Nick's from Yale. Daisy and Tom introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, a beautiful woman that Nick has a romantic relationship with. Eventually Nick is invited to one of Gatsby's parties and it is there that much is revealed about Gatsby's relation to the story.<br />In short, I think this book is something that anyone should read if they get the opportunity.<br />-GriffynB	2013-03-06

The tales of extravagant parties at the great mansion of Jay Gatsby is told with awe by the narrator as he himself becomes involved in the high life style of Mr. Gatsby.<br /> Nick Carraway, we find out is a bond salesman working in New York City and living in a small house close by to Gatsby's mansion who comes from the Midwest.  The Midwest is also the home of our hero Mr. Gatsby.  However as the story unfolds no one seems to really know Gatsby.  In fact of his main party extravagances, there seems to be many guests who arrive without invitation and in fact have never seen or associated with the gracious guest.<br /> Nick's second cousin also lives in the niche of Long Island which is fictitiously called East Egg.  It becomes apparent that Daisy Buchanan is an old heart throb of Jay Gatsby whom she met prior to Gatsby going off to war.  The story revolves around Nick and Jay gallivanting around Long Island and New York City where Nick becomes involved with a girlfriend Jordan Baker and Gatsby becomes ruinously involved with Daisy's husband Thomas Buchanan.<br /> Along with this continuous scenario we never find out the source of Gatsby's wealth and we find out that the his entr&eacute;e of servants have been replaced by rather dubious characters at the time that Gatsby is in full battle with the Daisy's husband as the summer season on Long Island is fading into early Autumn.<br /> Not only is the season fading by Gatsby's hold on his old heart throb is slipping tenuously by a thread with an automobile accident in nearby Queens.  The strange enigma of a man who no one seems to know heads straight for a tragedy on Long Island, and in the end it seems if all that had happened never really happened at all.  It was as if it was all a Long Island's rich man's dream played out by Midwesterners one and all into an American Tragedy.terners one and all into an American Tragedy.	2013-03-02

Well, here's how they did it: The print is so small as to be unreadable, in addition to the ink's being so light that it is grey instead of black. The pages are not even numbered!

US	22944137	R34I5DLXRRDWOP	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	4	1	1	N	N	7/10 - It's ok	Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Recently I reread The Great Gatsby because I had some free time and it's been a few years since I read it back in high school. When I originally read The Great Gatsby I wasn't overly impressed by it, but I thought maybe it was because I was in high school. However, to my surprise, my opinion hasn't changed much. I wanted to like it, but the end result was just ok.<br /><br />The \\"main\\" character of the novel is a man named Nick Carraway. I put main in quotes because up until the end of the book his role, in my opinion, is pretty insignificant. Sure, he narrates the book and he arranges the tea meeting with Gatsby and Daisy, his cousin, but the character honestly feels like an empty vessel. One that you want to like because he's supposed to be the main character, but someone who feels genuinely unimportant. The same can be said about pretty much all the characters in the book. Gatsby, for instance, is probably the most likable. Everything he does he does because of his love for Daisy. Essentially the entire story is about Gatsby, but Fitzgerald doesn't take the time to properly flesh out his character, or any of the other characters for that matter. I think most of my distaste for the novel came from Fitzgerald's approach to writing.<br /><br />The novel is most enjoyable when we are going through the main story, but Fitzgerald constantly ruins the flow by having flashbacks right in the middle of the action. Towards the end of the book he starts switching back and forth so much that I found it difficult to follow along at first. Now these flashbacks are technically important because they give the reader some more insight into the characters, but they all seemed to be placed at the most inopportune time. Plus, Fitzgerald's style of writing during these sections changes dramatically from engaging to extremely dull.<br /><br />My biggest complaint has to be the way Fitzgerald structures his sentences. Maybe this was the way to write back then, but in today's world it's extremely uncomfortable. It isn't smooth and it isn't easy on the eyes. Instead of saying, \\"My favorite colors are blue, yellow, green, and red.\\" Fitzgerald would put, \\"My favorite colors are blue and yellow and green and red.\\" In case you don't believe me here's an excerpt from page 40: \\"By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums.\\" It's like the man never learned how to properly use a comma. Couple that with his insistent need to hyphenate everything, \\"to-night, to-morrow, good-by\\", and you're bound to leave a chapter with a headache or two. Lastly, Fitzgerald found it necessary to include an overabundance of similes and metaphors that felt both forced and unnatural. It's not a huge gripe like the commas or the hyphenations, but it's still there.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is relatively short, only 180 pages long, and you could probably finish it in one sitting if you don't have any other obligations to attend to. However, I think this is what ultimately ruins the experience. Some books can pull off a short page count, but others, like this one, cannot. Had Fitzgerald stuck in the present and not gone off on tangents of the past it would have been fine, but ultimately these flashbacks ruin any chance of fleshing out the characters or properly building up the story so that you actually feel something at the story's climax.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7/10 - I know this is considered a literary classic, and for its time I'm sure it was groundbreaking, but in today's world it's simply mediocre. Nothing about the novel is necessarily terrible, and I never felt the need to close it, but I just feel like the story wasn't given the time it deserved to fully develop into something amazing.is was the way to write back then, but in today's world it's extremely uncomfortable.

The book is short and barely has any character development.  You don't route for anyone nor really care about finding about anybody's back story - including Gatsby himself.  The book does do an ok job of portraying that \\"rich, post-World War I, 1920s era apathy generation\\" but the problem with portraying apathy is that your readers are going to be apathetic.  There is one part of the book that has some \\"action\\" in it but it's so shoe horned in for the sole purpose of rapping up the story that it's almost unbelievable.  For those that poo-poo Twilight for \\"stalker\\" type mentality of Edward, you have the same behavior in Gatsby as well.  I was very underwhelmed and feel sorry for the countless public school students who had to suffer through this book.  The one positive thing I can say is that it wasn't as boring as \\"Wuthering Heights\\". Final Grade - F	2013-02-27

So long, in fact, that I can't remember my first impressions of it. So we're stuck here with my impressions from the re-read:<br /><br />Gatsby, you fool. You're smart enough to pull yourself out of poverty and desperation (albeit perhaps not in the most legal way, but one takes what one can get) and then waste it all on a silly girl? How are we supposed to feel any sympathy for that? My guess is that we're not.<br /><br />Fitzgerald was one of the Lost Generation, so we have to expect a lot of pointless stuff here. That's not to say it's not interesting - on the contrary, it's a regular soap opera: love affairs, cheating, lying, crime, rich people, etc and so on. He clearly disdained the idle rich and this novel showcases that. Yet as much as Gatsby, Tom and Daisy irritate (especially Daisy, as we never really get to know her at all), they also fascinate, something I believe Fitzgerald was disdainful of.<br /><br />The most fascinating character, in my opinion, is found in Myrtle Wilson, the poor wife of a garage-owner who longs to escape her existence. Although Fitzgerald devotes far more time to Daisy, it is Myrtle who is complex and compelling in every way. If nothing else, you should read the book just to get a glimpse of her.<br /><br />The book, of course, is a tragedy. Or is it? Tragic events certainly happen, but it is difficult to feel any sense of sorrow or compassion for them.<br /><br />With the movie coming out, I would suggest you read this one if you missed it during your primary education years. At only 160 pages or so, it's a short read and worth your time if only so you can poke fun at the inaccuracies/exaggerations in the upcoming movie and talk about what Fitzgerald himself would have thought of the production. ;)	2013-02-15
US	18155466	R14PN227XH55BB	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	4	0	0	N	N	The Great Gatsby	The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a fantastic novel of the Jazz age that mostly describes the differences and struggles between various social classes.  After reading this book, I can see the fantastic connection between the original cover art and the conflict of emotions within The Great Gatsby. The title itself connects perfectly with the character of Jay Gatsby; he is truly The Great Gatsby.<br /><br />The story within this modernist novel is the story of Nick Carraway, a young man of the midwest. Carraway moves to New York during the summer of 1922. Nick visits his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom. From the visit with them on, Nick's life only becomes more and more chaotic. The layer that covered the infidelity and chaos of those in this book is suddenly peeled back. I really enjoyed the dramatic element of this novel simply because the drama keeps the book riveting. However, the amount of infidelity in this book portrays that perhaps the author could not think of another way to keep things alluring.<br /><br />Fitzgerald is a very eloquent author. His words seem to undulate across the pages as they flow together. I had to read some lines multiple times to truly get the meaning, but I did not mind because in diong that one recieves a deeper connection with the text. All in all, I recommend The Great Gatsby to anyone who enjoys a good dramatic novel.	2013-02-13

As another reviewer mentioned, it is even better to read later in life, even if you read it back in school, it will 'land' differently now.<br /><br />The story is timeless and very American. The self created master of the universe, still looking out and coveting from his gilded perch.<br /><br />We live in a world full of greedy strivers and wannabes, grasping for success at all costs and often achieving it; who create their identities out of whole cloth, and who we then look up to admiringly, unaware of any seedy backstory.<br /><br />This book is as contemporary now as it was almost 90 years ago when it was written, and probably will continue to be, so long as humans continue to be the greedy schemers they have been to date!<br /><br />And it is written so beautifully. Fitzgerald would be enjoying his renaissance and he deserves it, as his own life was as full of tragedy as it was glitter and praise.	2013-02-11

The novel I was assigned to read in high school, then came back years later to my young adult self. Only then did I realize the true brilliance of this book.<br /><br />At the heart of the story, lies the deep infatuation of Jay Gatsby for Daisy Fay Buchanan. But more importantly is the setting and the idea of the American dream in the 1920's.<br /><br />Five years before the tale began, the lovers had moved in different directions. Daisy had married Tom Buchanan to accommodate her life of luxury, while Gatsby earned a mysterious fortune. Nick Carraway then begins to narrate the tale and is responsible for bringing the two lovers together.<br /><br />All these characters are thrown together in a story of hypocracy, parties, bantering dialogue, and the idea that money conquers all.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is a classic that has earned it's place on my favorites list and will be read over and over again.	2013-01-08

Which was probably just as well. Because like the vast of majority of the classics of English language literature, such a book is way beyond the comprehension of the twentieth or twenty first century teenager. And so, a complete waste of a good book.  After only a brief look at reviews of this novel on Good Reads or Amazon it is glaringly obvious that readers either passionately adore it or hate it with a frightening fervour - and for most it was compulsory school reading.  Now take a look at the trailer for the Baz Luhrmann film due to be released in May of this year. It brings the novel to life in such a way that no high school English teacher could ever have done! And perhaps nowadays that is how we perceive a 'Classic' novel such as this. Filmed five times previously only shows how truly timeless the novel is, and how each generation tweaks it for current relevance.<br /><br />This novel is so timeless it has been compared to a Greek tragedy with its classic love triangle - Gatsby, Daisy and Tom; secondary but essential characters who tip the balance into madness - George and Myrtle Wilson; and the Chorus - Nick Carraway who is a distant cousin of Daisy and becomes Gatsby's neighbour for the summer. Into this mix are thrown and stirred the greed, ambition and hedonism of the very rich in 1920s America. And above all perhaps boredom - these people have so little point to their lives, are so self absorbed, and have so little purpose that it is no wonder trouble results. Be careful what you wish for...<br /><br />There is little point in doing a plot summary as the story is so well known and the plot is so accessible via the Net. But you don't read a book just for the plot. At just 190 pages, this is a short 'Classic' read, written with such vividness you can feel the heat of the New York summer, the cool lushness of Long Island, the despair in Gatsby's heart, the emptiness in Daisy. With the doorstops that nowadays pass for 'Classic' novels, it is a true joy to read something written with such finesse and restraint. It may not be rewarding reading for a teenager but for an adult, most definitely.hat nowadays pass for 'Classic' novels, it is a true joy to read something written with such finesse and restraint.

I had a rich uncle, who lived near the rich and famous, but he didn't live in a mansion like the Gatsby's. However, like Nick carraway, the narrator in this novel, I was awestruck by the wealth, my uncle's way of life and the rich and famous.<br />I loved the movie that was based on this novel, and found the book to be delightful reading. F. Scott Fitzgerald did a great job of bringing to life the characters in his novel and making them have flaws like everyone has from time to time. I have heard the jazz age was a wonderful time in lots of ways and this novel brings the way of that world into our minds, hearts and fascination. I imagine our lives would be very mundane without great writers like this. I hope everyone explores this classic tale.<br /><br />Jeannie Walker Award Winning Author of \\"Fighting the Devil\\" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder	2013-01-01
US	45737654	R23ZIFFN5XPSZL	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Made me a better person	Whenever this book is discussed, the american dream and the jazz age are the first things to be mentioned. I never understood this because, for me, the emotional core of the novel is understanding the extent to which men are willing to fabricate and chase illusions. This slim beast of a novel allows us to walk in the shoes of a man determined to recreate the past and shape reality to his wishes. Everything Jay Gatsby does is designed to win back his love, but time, social status, and reality stand between him and his dreams. By empathizing with Jay Gatsby, we understand our own desires to recapture the past and our own tendencies to objectify the people we cared about. It is for this reason that this is a great piece of literature worthy of reading and rereading.<br /><br />For those out there who find the characters unsympathetic, please note that the same negative traits found in the characters are the same traits we all have. Gatsby, Daisy, etc... are not supposed to be role models, they're supposed to highlight our own desires and flaws. While we might not find them euphoric to be around, we certainly learn more about ourselves by being with them. And besides, I actually like Gatsby.<br /><br />Also, Fitzgerald writes with abundant wit and sarcasm that is truly charming.	2013-01-01

Ah...<br /><br />The fact is that Gatsby deserves its consideration as a Great American Novel.  It's fascinating in language, story, and scope (as well as, you know, meaning), and it's like as American as possible.  Unlike many other modernist American novels, it actually explores America in America from an American perspective.  Like, it doesn't take place in Europe and it isn't about America compared to Europe.  It is actually able to comment on American aristocracy as it is because of this, not as it is in comparison to other societies.  So, seriously on the 'America' part of 'Great American Novel' is what I mean.<br /><br />I actually feel hesitant to write a review on it.  Everything that needs to be said about The Great Gatsby is is the book.  Everything I could write has been explained better by Fitzgerald.  This is by no means a bad thing (check out my rating, come on), and in fact it's a great achievement.  Fitzgerald managed to embody the modernist idea of an artwork that stands for itself, by no means an easy task.  This is a book that must be read.	2012-12-31

Fitzgerald seems to assume (rightly it would seem) that the mere evocation of fantastic  wealth (shiny automobiles, lavish parties etc) will be fantastically interesting to his readers. A triumph of content over style if you ask me! Admittedly there are a few very brilliant passages, but overall I find the book's much-vaunted prose to be like iridescent steam, vapid and affected. There is precious little complexity of thought, and more of what I would call `sentiment' than genuine emotion. The symbolism is laughably trite (to take just 3 examples : the green light on Daisy's side of the bay, characters in white, and - last but not least - the celebrated « Valley of Ashes » (Oh come on now ! Give us break!)). The characterization struck me as hollow, and the dialogue stilted and unnatural. Very rarely was I able to hear real men and women.

Although written in 1922, this book is very far ahead of its time as today, many Yale grads decide to go into high finance similar to Nick's decision to learn about the bond business in New York.

I came into `The Great Gatsby' knowing it was a classic (and highly regarded as one of the greatest pieces of literature) and that I should read it bit also knowing that the 1974 film adaptation (which I did see) was awful and tainted my interest in the novel.  Knowing that rabid fans of the book also hated the film helped convince me to take it off the shelf (I've owned it for a few years) and read it.<br /><br />So glad that I did.<br /><br />Having previously read Fitzgerald's short story collection which contained `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button', I was familiar with his writing style (detailed yet easy on the intake) and immediately took to this novel.  The way that Fitzgerald paints these characters and their situations and the `Jazz Age' itself is so wonderfully astute and captivating at every turn.  This is a short yet very rich story, filling nearly 200 pages with beautifully delicate character development (enough mystery to make these people intoxicating as opposed to merely fascinating) and an engaging plot that completes itself in the most unexpected and yet tragically beautiful way imaginable (yes, I knew the ending thanks to the film, but it feels so much more `complete' here).<br /><br />The meaning behind the pursuit at play here is remarkable, and the way that the story's conclusion truly embeds itself in relevance, even today, is unexpected yet welcome.<br /><br />The story told is that of Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire who moves nearby his sweetheart of yesteryear, Daisy, who is now a mother and married to a wealthy man with a downtrodden mistress on the side.  Daisy and Gatsby were torn apart by social circles and the war, and while he was fighting for his country she was being swept off her feet by Tom Buchanan.  The novel is narrated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's neighbor and trusted confidant.  Through his friendship, both Gatsby and Daisy reunite and Nick is torn between his friendship with Gatsby and his knowledge of not only Daisy's love for him but also of her husband Tom's indiscretions.<br /><br />Beautifully fleshed out and `whole', this classic earns that title with every word.

Scott Fitzgerald composed his 3rd and most renown novel, The Great Gatsby, when wanting to write a new and exciting book. A romantic tragedy of a man and a women who are in love but life and money gets in the way. Set in the jazz age in Long Island, NY,  a man name Gatsby has made him self a fun and exciting persona. Throwing grand parties for people every weekend just so people would like him, but they liked his money more than Gatsby himself. This character he made is fake. He throws parties because he used to be poor and it's the only way to attract the love of his life, the married Daisy, to his home. Daisy is a rich woman and he wants her to leave her spouse,Tom, for him. I would give this book a 3 out of 5 stars. I had read this book a few years ago and did not understand the main theme of the  book. This time around I realized the theme was greed, and doing useless things for a spark of pleasure. Fitzgerald who had lived in so many places around the world really understood the hardships of peoples lives during the jazz age. It had a lot of information for 180 pages and is a good book to read when you are over 15 years of age but it can be a little dull at times, or at least for me anyways.	2012-12-08

The premise is decent enough and may have even been more original when he wrote it.  But the fact is he wrote it quickly, across the ocean from his editor (no e-mail or faxes in those days), and the book apparently didn't even get edited appropriately before publication (Fitzgerald was already a success by the time he wrote this).<br /><br />The result is something barely fleshed out beyond your basic plot outline.  This is just the bare bones, no character development, no real insight into what is happening, just a string of events that come to what Fitzgerald must have thought was a shocking conclusion (although you aren't entirely sure how you got there - we don't really know how Daisy made her decision).  The ride is great though.  Page after page of poorly edited text that reads like stream of consciousness, first draft writing as opposed to a finished work.  I swear at least once he used a word that isn't even a word.  It was so unintelligable that in certain editions (before they went back to previous Fitzgerald drafts and corrected the mistake) a simple grammatical error meant that you could think Daisy was pregnant before marrying Tom.  Such a small error actually dramatically changes how you interpret the key plotline of the book.<br /><br />This book actually was not a smashing success upon publication, nor immediately after Fitzgerald's death.  No, it became popular in the 1950s as America became obsessed with class differences and simultaneously fascinated and envious of the wealthy.  This was the first novel in that space by pure happenstance because there wasn't much interest in the subject when Fitzgerald wrote it.  So being first to market in public schools eager to stoke class differences, it was widely used in schools and took off from there.<br /><br />Utterly skippable.  The best thing you can say about it is that for only 150 pages of your time, you too can claim to have read a classic novel.too can claim to have read a classic novel.	2012-12-03

It has many beautifully written, poetic passages, and Gatsby's demise retains an ineffable sadness that moved me in the final pages. The absence of mourners at his funeral was particularly poignant. Fitzgerald's theme of pursuing an incompletely realized dream is universal, with the corollary that if one's timing is off, the dream may forever remain out of reach. Add to this a crushing irony: in order to win Daisy, Gatsby strove to make himself a member of her wealthy Long Island society, but she is shallow and frivolous and her husband is brutish and racist. The others in their group show no loyalty to Gatsby, the man who'd thrown them lavish parties, by deserting him in death.<br /><br />I'll comment briefly on the poetic nature of Fitzgerald's prose. He uses two metaphors involving water that are linked inextricably to the action of the novel. At the beginning of the story, the narrator, Nick, notes that \\"Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes...\\" comparing conduct to an edifice that can be built on a solid base (\\"hard rock\\") or a tenuous one (\\"wet marshes\\"). Foreshadowing is at work here as Gatsby's springboard into affluent society turns out to be a yacht in a dangerously shallow mooring. Unfortunately, Gatsby is floating in his pool at the end when he is shot to death. The novel concludes with another \\"wet\\" metaphor in the justly famous line \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" Humans are boats struggling to row into the future, while all the while carried backward by Time's river. Figures of speech are only effective if they complement the surrounding language and action.<br /><br />Another vivid display of language occurs at the beginning of Chapter III with a 2 1/2 page description of the preparations for and beginning of a typical Gatsby party. \\"On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.\\" Later, the narrator notes, \\"The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.\\" A milieu built on the \\"wet marshes\\" indeed.inst salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.\\" Later, the narrator notes, \\"The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.\\" A milieu built on the \\"wet marshes\\" indeed.	2012-11-23

IMHO it is one of the great American novels, and one of the best American novels to tell the story of a particular class of people in any era out there.  In this case, the era is The Roaring Twenties and the class of people that the novel deals with is the extremely wealthy.  It was definitely an interesting era and \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is the novel that stands tall above all the other novels to deal with this subject matter.<br />Jay Gatsby is a man of mystery and intrigue.  Women fall at his feet.  He supposedly went to Oxford.  He hangs out with the man who fixed the 1919 Chicago White Sox World Series.  Nobody really knows how he makes his money or how he made his fortune, but he apparently started from scratch.  He throws outlandish parties that all sorts of rich and famous people who do not know him come to.  People clamor to be on the list to his parties but do not know him.<br />These people are portrayed as shallow, brittle, vain.  They have come by their money, but they care not whom the victims are along the road or in the path ahead.  Just so they can hold on to their claim to fame.  Anything, so that they can maintain their lifestyle.  Society is disposable, people come and go, they live and die.  It really does not have anything to do with them, does it darling?<br />What happens in the novel is really of no concern, also.  This is profound, but it makes \\"Gatsby\\" the novel that it is.  \\"Gatsby\\" is the first book in \\"The Big Read\\" for Wichita, KS. this year (2012).  The contest for it is to re-write the ending in so-many-words-or-less.  This, too is very interesting, because the novel could have a number of differnt endings.  It makes one wonder how many possible endings F. Scott Fitzgerald had.<br /><br />Cam	2012-11-22

When I read it years ago in high school, I didn't care for it. Actually, I hated it. But after seeing that title pop up over and over again among lists of the greatest novels, I wanted to try it again. Did I like it any more the second time around? Nope.<br /><br />First, there is the language. Most people will tell you that that is what they love about the book, that The Great Gatsby is the prime example of exquisite and beautiful language. Maybe it works for you, but reading Fitzgerald's words leaves me scratching my head wondering, \\"What is he trying to say?\\"<br /><br />Let's take a relatively unimportant line from Chapter 1 as an example. Fitzgerald writes, \\"Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.\\" Okay, what does that mean? I get the second half of the sentence - that the narrator doesn't care how one's conduct, i.e., one's behavior, is founded - that it doesn't matter whether you were brought up with great advantages or if you were brought up without them. But why hard rock? Why wet marshes? What does that mean? Hard rock? Wet marshes? Maybe you have a great answer for me, and I'm just not getting it. That's entirely plausible. But without a straight answer, I'm just left struggling. And this happens all over the place in this novel - words that conjure up images that float in the sky without any meaning to ground them.<br /><br />Second, there are the wholly unlikeable characters. What more needs to be said? The characters are wholly unlikeable. All of them.<br /><br />Third, through the narrator Nick Carraway, we are treated to a love/hate relationship with the wealthy class of the time period. We are to be in love, in awe, and in constant fascination with this one percent (to use today's language) for no reason other than the fact that they have lots of money. We are to be envious of and hopelessly attracted to high society. And although Fitzgerald paints these one percent characters as wholly unlikeable, he falls short of actually condemning their behavior. It's not a scathing satire. In the end, you still see the glimmers of attraction. And this, I cannot stand. I cannot stand the pathetic fawning over of the one percent. Cue eye roll. Get a backbone and find some self-worth. Please.<br /><br />Why two stars instead of one? My hatred of this novel bordered on obsession. I kept wondering why I disliked it so much. Those thoughts kept churning and churning in my head.

The Great Gatsby was chosen by a book club I belonged to. I had originally read it in high school (over 10 years ago), but at the time I thought it was so utterly boring that I couldn't keep up so I had no idea what was happening. I didn't remember anything except for the Green Light. Reading it now was definitely a different experience.<br /><br />I thought many of the characters were very shallow. Tom, Daisy, Jordan, even Gatsby. They were lounging rich folk with too much time and money on their hands. Even before I found out that this was set in a hot Long Island summer, i felt like they were so lazy. During the story NOT MUCH HAPPENS. A lot is revealed about the characters, but action wise, not much.<br /><br />We find out that Gatsby, is NOT so great, that Gatsby and Daisy loved each other at some point, we see a lot of drunk driving, and lavish parties, and the beautiful glitzy life of Roaring Twenties young rich Americans. We see no self-control, or depth.<br /><br />Even Nick Carroway, the narrator, turns out to be a VOID of a character. Rather then someone who takes action, he is the one whom actions happens to. He gets invited to a party, so he goes. He walks into a room and people talk to him, and he doesn't say much in return. People ask favors of him, but he never asks anything. He seems to be dully OKAY with everything, and have no strive for anything. He is a vessel through which secrets are revealed and are passed on, but he has no secrets of his own.<br /><br />Skimming the book after I read it, I see a lot of foreshadowing (which of course I had no idea when reading it the first time). For example, when Nick came to Tom and Daisy's house, and Daisy was lethargic and not talking to anyone until Nick mentioned he lived next door to Gatsby, then she started speaking. Also, when he was at the party, he heard rumors of Gatsby being a bootlegger, and later this also revealed to be true. A green light, for \\"go.\\"<br /><br />What this book does is splendidly, in flowery descriptive language, capture a snapshot of one sector of society during the 20's.

So much of what happened was so minute that its easily missed by teenagers. This book can really only be absorbed by adult readers.

Tim Robbins was a very good reader. They even threw in snippets of Jazz in the beginning and end of every disk, which was a nice touch. Of course, I also took out the hard copy from the library, which I skimmed for comparison.<br /><br />At the book discussion we all agreed that we would have liked to see two things: 1.

I usually review the books I read here, but since this book is closing in on being 100 years old, is required reading in many American AP high school English courses and most likely everything that could possibly be said about it by the human race, positive and negative, has been said by reviewers of higher importance than I, I thought it would be silly to review it.<br /><br />But here's this: I liked it. I liked it quite a lot. As much as I read, it's almost absurd that I hadn't gotten to this one sooner, but I'm glad I read it at this age because I almost surely wouldn't have appreciated it in it's fullness if I'd read it in high school.<br /><br />My wife recently read it for the second time (and she loves it), and though our taste in books is usually pretty far from similar, she insisted I really ought to give it a whirl. I was in the mood for something older and in the modern classic realm, so here we are.<br /><br />I have to say it went by fast. I mean, it's a short novel; less than 200 pages. But I daresay once things get cooking (once Gatsby actually enters the novel, basically), it's almost written in a jumpy, quick-moving way. Sure, there are moments of quiet beauty and reminiscence, but the party scenes are perfect depictions of swirling chaos from loud-mouthed, gossipy rich people from the perspective of a man who largely keeps to himself. I love how well the tone of the dialogue encapsulates the time period and suggests that most of the folks were talking just to hear their own voices, responding with answers that had nothing to do with the previous speaker, and no one really listened and no one really cared (again I'm referring primarily to the rich folks at the parties... not necessarily Gatsby or the other main characters, though Daisy shows some hints of this high-living arrogance).<br /><br />This is getting dangerously close to a review (MAY IT NEVER BE, GAINES!!), so I'll wrap up. I reckon this is a novel with layers; something short and rich that reveals more good stuff every time you re-read it. That being said, I'm fairly certain I'll revisit this book somewhere down the road.kon this is a novel with layers; something short and rich that reveals more good stuff every time you re-read it.

Everyone should experience the world of Fitzgerald's writing.<br /> Fitzgerald created the characters with distinct personalities. He lets the reader feel strong sympathy for each character. In contrast, some readers may believe the characters are too exaggerated and seem unrealistic such as Daisy Buchanan. However, I believe exaggerated parts are necessary for the interesting plot.<br />Jay Gatsby could be announced as one of the main characters. His perseverance to love one girl for a long time is very admiring. However, his dream of reuniting with Daisy crushes when he comes back and sees her with another successful man. When the reader finds out of his struggle, the reader starts feeling sympathy for him and realizes that money cannot solve everything. It is depressing to see Gatsby hold on to the past, thinking he could re-live it. Gatsby's idealistic characteristic as well as his wrongful idea of money buying happiness wins favors from his audience as well as myself and teaches us a real life lesson.<br />The theme that money does not buy happiness is clearly apparent. Gatsby's character progression portrays how money cannot always bring the most desired, finding happiness. He thought prosperity could get him what he wanted, a common mistake that people in the modern society uphold. Many of us think money is all you need, that fortune could bring us joy in this money-oriented society. Wealth could bring us happiness to a certain extent; it cannot buy values that can only be obtained through experience. When he comes back as a prosperous man, he is shocked by the fact that his absence had caused Daisy to be with another man.<br /> The story was full of ups, downs and un-expectancies with an irony, which kept the reader wanting to continue on to the next page. Everyone who has read the book already could happily agree that it is hard to find a stopping point due to its intensity revolving around the characters and the stories they create.

The great Gatsby is written in manner that is relatable to the reader.  The first time I read The Great Gatsby I was in high school. I found it to be a great masterpiece that I couldn't cope with putting down. (I even cried at the end...which never happens). I read It again as I entered college and it blew my mind away. It was pure magic and left me astonished by the language and the bittersweet romance of the hopeful but desperate Jay Gatsby vying for the affection of a married woman but his one and only true love.  It seems like every time I reread this novel, I find another flawless element that always keeps me wanting to read even though I already know what happens.<br />I recommend The Great Gatsby for all high school students because high school is a time in your life that one starts to find true deception in everyday life that can be very relatable while reading this novel. High school is a time where deception is laden and you have to find out who you really are and identify what is fake and what is real. Also, when you re read this this book at a later point in your life, you will find different elements every time that will inspire you to pick up this book many more times throughout your lifetime.	2012-10-25

While books like \\"Harry Potter\\" or even \\"Lord of the Rings\\" may be a fine entertainment, in the end they are just a collection of ingeniously crafted plot points with relateable and entertaining characters. There is nothing wrong with this, people need and enjoy pap, but sometimes it's good to have a book or even a film challenge you to think about things more deeply.<br /><br />For any high schoolers \\"forced\\" to read this, let me say this. You will not \\"get\\" this book. This is not due to any intellectual or moral deficiency. A 17-year old Steven Hawking or Einstein would fare no better. This is not because the book is even slightly difficult to read, comprehend, or follow. On the contrary, the book is an easy read that does not have difficult language or elaborate plot intricacies. Many of you might still like and enjoy the book highly, I know I did in high school. Many will intellectually understand the themes or symbollism, because they are not complex, in fact they are very simple and straightforward, which is what makes this novel so great.

I felt like the novel was too boring, and dull. It was really hard to get into. This novel is about a man named Nick that lives next to Gatsby, who throws parties at his mansion every Saturday. He then befriends Gatsby. In the beginning of the novel, it was confusing when Tom showed Nick, his mistress. I felt like nothing really actually happened in the book. There wasn't really a plot. This book is supposed to be a reflection of the 1920s, but doesn't really exude it. The 1920s was fun and exciting, and this novel was not. Also the actual writing was way too eloquent and he used lots of big words, that was distracting from the actual plot. His writing was way to flowery, which made it unenjoyable. This book was just basically about affairs. I also didn't like how Nick was narrating it, because he wasn't a sole part of the plot. He was just there; nothing important. I don't understand why this is a classic...	2012-10-18

Prior to starting this novel, I was convinced I had read it some time in school while I was growing up.  Throughout my public school education, we had read a variety of classics from Steinbeck, Dickens, Hemingway, Miller, etc.  So I really thought I had read this one along the way.  After a couple of paragraphs, I realized that I hadn't, because I think I would have remembered the different feel this one seems to have from most classic American literature.<br /><br />The length of the novel alone is enough to show you that it's not quite the same as some of those other novels.  Fitzgerald seemed to have more of a sense of what to cut out and what to include than some of his contemporaries, because at no point during this reading did I sit and think \\"Will you just get ON with it?!?\\"  I'm sad to say that I have done that with plenty of other authors, so I was a bit worried I'd have that reaction when going through The Great Gatsby.  I very happily enjoyed this novel and hope to read more of Fitzgerald's work in the future.<br /><br />The book itself is the tragic tale of our title character, Jay Gatsby.  Having never been satisfied with the life he came from, Gatsby invents a new self and goes about trying to find the person he wants to be.  Along the way, he meets Daisy, who becomes the big driving force in his life.  I think in today's day and age, we might call Gatsby a stalker - he's obsessive and goes so far as to buy his house in Long Island because of his ability to see Daisy's across the way.  While this would seem creepy if we were telling it from a modern perspective, it strikes me as being rather sad.  Gatsby goes from only knowing he wants to make money, to knowing he wants to make money for Daisy.  At one point during the story, he even says that he decided doing things was less important than telling Daisy about all the things he wanted to do.  It's really a sad case of lost boy syndrome, in my book.<br /><br />Something that really stuck out to me throughout the book was that people seemed to want to be around Gatsby, but no one necessarily seems to like him, going so far as to spread random rumors about how he acquired his fortune and what his past was like.  This theme carries through to the end when we learn that our narrator, Nick Carraway, is the only one who is truly there for Gatsby in his time of need.  While Gatsby isn't a model citizen, he doesn't seem all that scandalous to me, and certainly doesn't deserve the rumor mongering that follows him throughout the course of the novel.  Maybe it's just the fact that I'm looking at it from a modern perspective, so his actions don't seem any worse than things we see on TV on a daily basis.<br /><br />I picked this book up for Banned Books Week, and found it rather amusing when I was investigating the reasoning behind the banning of this book.  It was basically for language and some mild sexual content, which is just ridiculous.  I certainly didn't see any bad language when reading it, and the only references to sex were along the lines of \\"so and so left the room for awhile\\".  Again, maybe it's a more modern perspective, but those things are just silly.  I'm totally against the banning of books anyway, so I guess I've got a skewed perspective twice over.<br /><br />The only questionable thing for me is really the behavior of Daisy's husband, Tom Buchanan.  I found Tom to be annoying, as arrogant as he is described, and a bigot to top it off.  It's made worse by the knowledge that men like Tom did exist, and to an extent they still do.  Still, that's no reason to ban a book, it's just a reason to dislike Tom and root for Gatsby.<br /><br />I really would be curious to see what kind of things Fitzgerald would have come up with if he lived in our time.  It's a shame we lost him all too soon, because I think he has a unique voice and I would have liked to see more from him.ghout the book was that people seemed to want to be around Gatsby, but no one necessarily seems to like him, going so far as to spread random rumors about how he acquired his fortune and what his past was like.

This is one of the great American novels. It is is not a very long book, but it truly captures the time, and upper crust New York life. The characters are wonderful and the plot moves quickly. There are references to many things that happened in the 20's and issues of the time. The ending was pretty anticlimactic as well.	2012-10-10

The mysterious Gatsby looms over the lethargic beginning, but as he comes into focus the novel becomes enthralling. The mysterious Gatsby is at first depicted as a wealthy, powerful man, but shocking irony reveals the truth. Gatsby's love for Daisy has driven him to an extravagant lifestyle. Gatsby, once portrayed as the wealthiest and most powerful man in New York, was nothing more than a hopeless romantic. Gatsby is further berated - Daisy's wife, Tom, accuses Gatsby of criminal activities and involvement. Nonetheless, Gatsby and Daisy still meet privately on several occasions, and Gatsby's ornate portrayal of Daisy is not fulfilled. Over the years, Gatsby has exalted Daisy with his immense wealth and imagination.<br /><br /> The overarching theme throughout the novel is exactly that mentioned above.  Gatsby's exalting of Daisy has turned her into nothing more than a possession in his mind.  This can be paralleled to the American Dream, the desire for success, prosperity, wealth, and a family. Gatsby can never have Daisy because of his immense wealth, an ironic cynical idea that was likely portrayed since this novel was written in the midst of the Great Depression. Another theme parodies the constant quest for money in America. The upper class, repented by Gatsby, is motivated by greed and desire. On the surface, the upper class appear superior an powerful, but in reality they are so desperate that they seek wealth to fill the hole in their personal American Dream.<br /><br />Overall, the Great Gatsby is a timeless classic, brilliantly written on multiple levels. The entire storyline brilliantly parallels and satires the quest for wealth, needs, and desires. F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is elegant yet precise. As previously mentioned, the beginning, though lethargic and descriptive, is still intriguing. At first, the verbose details may seem extraneous, but it proves to be a great beginning to an amazing novel.be a great beginning to an amazing novel.	2012-10-08

Perhaps because I'm not American, this novel wasn't on any lists when I studied English in high school and university. Just as well; I mightn't have appreciated it then.<br /><br />It's understandable that The Great Gatsby would be taught; it's damned good. It's tight, compact, linear, and practically every sentence is a work of art. I bought the audio book and listened to it twice. Then I picked up the novel and read it in a couple of days. It's excellent; there's no way around it. It's also rather different from Tender is the Night, also good, perhaps more evolved, but not nearly as flash or impactful.<br /><br />If someone employed Fitzgerald's style today, their prose would likely be labeled too ornate. A shame, because it's poetic and powerfully descriptive.<br /><br />Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World	2012-10-06

The thing that this book brings out more than anything is the idea that the rich gained their power and notoriety through some type of moral superiority.  That is completely trashed in this book.<br /><br />First of all, Tom Buchannan is the most unctuous character in this book, if not all literature.  He is the picture of the eastern establishment rich kid who had everything given to him.  And he is a leach to his wife and skulks around with Myrtle.<br /><br />Daisy and Gatsby are also pathetic characters.  The thrust of the novel is also important in that it brings to light the fact that money and vast riches cannot bring happiness.  We still see that today.  The 1920s and the Jazz Age were the beginning of the era of conspicuous consumption and while Gatsby throws weekend long parties, he almost never partakes in them, and he is rather quite miserable.<br /><br />The ending of the book, not to give spoilers, demonstrates the conceit of the era.  A seminal work of American Fiction.	2012-09-26

I read this when I was high school, but didn't get my own copy of the book until later years. I thought it was an interesting read. To read about the main character and how it was possible to redefine or recreate yourself and try to persuade the world around you to accept this new definition was amazing to read. Then to mix in a love story with Jay Gatsby and his love for Ms. Daisy Buchanan was a good read as well. Overall, I enjoyed reading this novel.

There's no disputing why people still read this great American novel, and I was moved this time around more than ever. I originally read this work in college, and only mildly \\"got it\\". Actually, I wondered what the fuss was all about, but maturity brings wisdom and reading this now, in middle age, makes all the difference. Actually, in today's terms, Gatsby is the 1 per cent. (Need I say, this read couldn't be more apt due to one of the presidential candidates?) The prototype could not be better. Both Gatsby and his wife, Daisy are so shallow, not minding the eventual fate that meets them.  Of course, Nick Carraway is a great witness to that demise. Written in the 1920's, it proves classics remain this way for a reason: good story matters. Good characters matter. Only so many books today meet the test.	2012-09-20

They may be able to understand all the words, but I really don't think most teenagers can truly understand the meaning behind the beautiful word choices Fitzgerald made.  I for one, did not and I just loved this book the second time around.  Life experiences make it easier to see Daisy and Gatsby for what they truly are, very shallow people.  I think only Tom shockingly looks good in this book.  He recognizes his life for what it is.  When I was young, I really thought Tom was a bad guy.

Scott Fitzgerald tells us the life story of a Mr. Jay Gatsby. However, don't expect the narrator, Nick Carraway, to tell everything up front, he leaves plenty of room for the imagination.  The Great Gatsby is filled with dramatic love triangles and the ever-present truth looming over Gatsby. Keep in mind the central theme of not everything is always as it seems.<br /> Written in 1924, The Great Gatsby is one of America's most recognized literary works of art. F. Scott Fitzgerald has eternalized the glory of the \\"roaring twenties\\" and has captivated his audience for over 85 years. The \\"roaring twenties\\" plays host to the Prohibition movement and creates an air of hysterics among the characters. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote five novels and over twenty short stories. His works have been translated into many other languages and continue to be adapted into plays, films, and other forms of entertainment.<br /> Fitzgerald presents this short novel in a way that leaves the audience wondering about the truth behind every single character. Each character has his or her own agenda and rarely forgets who number one is. Don't be fooled by the brevity of this novel, it is packed to the brim with double meanings and truths to be discovered. The Great Gatsby breathes life into the past and makes you want to be a part of it. The way Fitzgerald describes Mr. Gatsby's parties makes you wish you were there to experience such a fun and never ending night. In a way, it perfectly describes the themes of love throughout the novel, fun, seemingly never ending, and yet never turning out the way you thought they would. The glitz and the glamour that is present throughout the novel would make anyone want to crash one of Mr. Gatsby's parties.<br /> What is truly remarkable is that Fitzgerald manages to make a love story into a suspense novel by always making Gatsby have to be a half step in front of the truth. A \\"truth\\" that Gatsby weaves so intricately, even he second-guesses it. I would have to say that my favorite aspect of this novel is that Fitzgerald never tells a scene with all the information up front. This novel really makes you think and recall information in order to keep up with the story line.<br /> I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys having to put together a puzzle without knowing the bigger picture. The Great Gatsby is commonly used in high school curriculums across the United States, but is a novel that everyone should read with or without a requirement attached. This novel is intriguing, lively and full of entertainment. The only draw back is that it is extremely short for a novel. I feel that it could have been expanded a great deal, but who am I to argue with F. Scott Fitzgerald and the story lengths that made money in his time. Overall, I would agree with the masses that this is literary classic. Make sure to watch out for the fifth film adaption of The Great Gatsby in 2013, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway.ses it.

Gatsby is that rarest of Americans, a rags-to-riches self-made man. He worked his way up from poverty. But he isn't happy. Why? Because he did it all for Daisy, and yet the web of American society (a supposedly classless place) prevents him from ever having her. Thus he is tragic. Gatsby may be amoral, but why is he so? He was born poor but ambitious and then he became successful and it killed him. The very top is out of reach, even if you get there. It's a fool's game. If Gatsby were set in today's world he might aspire to be a Donald Trump-like character. The tragedy (and farce) of our society, which Fitzgerald realizes, is that Donald Trump was born rich.<br /><br />People who read this novel as a love story are missing the point. Gatsby is not in love, he is infatuated with Daisy because of what she represents. Many people confuse this with love (in literature and in life) but that is a terrible mistake.	2012-08-28

There is no other Fitzgerald. In many ways, the same can be said of The Great Gatsby. It is an hauntingly beautiful novel. Yet, it is a very sad novel. For, it reveals the fickle nature---of the human race. In the beginning, Mr. Gatsby is greatly taken with Miss Daisy. Yet,---what he neglects to realize is the fact that the attention that Miss Daisy is projecting towards him---is simply a form of self admiration, whereby---she is the center of attention: Almost as if, she is standing in the midst of a chamber full of mirrors. The surrounding mirrors are the men which are encircling her: Projecting back to her the great and beautiful image of herself. She sees it,---reflected in their eyes. She feels it,---reflected in their mannerism. Mr. Gatsby is but one of the many admirers---just one of the mirrors. Yet, for the moment, that image which he projects back to her is the one which is the most pleasing to her---that is,---for the moment. However, sadly, Mr. Gatsby feels as if he is not worthy of her. He walks away---from her, from all that she represents, and all that which---he madly yearns for. For years, he does---whatever he deems to be necessary---in order to rise up to her level of, what he believes to be, her existence. He arrives at a point where he feels that he is now in a position to consider himself her equal. He is now good enough for her. He strives for wealth and power, because he correlates wealth and power---with Miss Daisy Buchanan. Yet, what he fails to understand is that Miss Daisy Buchanan is not good enough for him. He has been faithful to her, but she has not been faithful to him. What he fails to understand is the fact that she is indeed married to the right person---Mr. Tom Buchanan. For, just the way that he is boorish and unkind on the outside,---so is she---in the inside. He is a reflection of her. But, alas, it is well hidden behind the soft looks and the gentle demeanor. Tom Buchanan portrays the physical aspects of the characteristics which they both share---in one way or another. This is why they came together, and this is why they stay together. She is a fickle woman. Yet, she is not weak. She knows exactly as to what she is doing. The destroyed lives of men have no meaning to her as long as the image in the mirror continues to be. It is the image which must survive. At the end, she is just as much responsible for the tragedy. At one point, Mr. Gatsby states, \\"Her voice is full of money.\\" It is as if he is saying---she represents all that I have strived to achieve, and have wanted. Again and again, he tries to prove himself to Daisy---that he is indeed good enough for her, but what he fails to understand is the fact that the quest was not worth it,---because she was not worth it. It is indeed a very sad testament to human nature, yet it is so very true. This is why, this book lives on and on. The world has not changed much. There still exists many a Daisy Buchanans and Tom Buchanans. Sadly,---there are also many Mr. Gatsbys---trying desperately to prove themselves to the fickle Daisys of the world.

But Gatsby isn't all he seems and when Nick introduces him to his married cousin Daisy and her husband Tom Buchanan, their fatal company will reveal to Nick the sordid and black-hearted side to the American Dream.<br /><br />What to say about this book that's not been said before? Should there be a superlative limit for this novel? And where should someone start? Well, I read this book several years ago and decided to re-read it recently to see if the novel was as good as I remembered, as clever and well written, as fun and as sad, and with a beating heart still behind it; and I was glad to find that it still did.<br /><br />Nick Carraway is a brilliant narrator, flawed and biased, yet all-seeing out of all the characters; we see Gatsby as a charming personality at first and then slowly and subtly see the flaws in his character, see through the lies that go into the creation of his persona and the darkness beneath. We see Daisy and Tom as a sad married couple - Daisy full of regret yet unable to leave because of her love of Tom's money and Tom with his numerous infidelities and foul temper showing how the rich can live a life free of consequence.<br /><br />The book contains many images of startling beauty such as Gatsby's glittering parties wearing his pink tuxedo, the green light from Daisy's window in the night, the decayed ruins of Gatsby's mansion, the decadent empty Buchanan household - and the stench of squandered privilege, crime and death that accompanies it all.<br /><br />The writing is of the highest quality, each sentence perfectly written and filled with layers making up rich paragraphs and textured pages - it's not hard to see why Fitzgerald is canonised and celebrated when the writing in \\"Gatsby\\" is this good. But that's not to say that it's unreadable to people looking for a good read - it's perfectly approachable, understandable, and fun. The scenes are so full of life and action that it's as compelling to read purely for its story of doomed love between Gatsby and Daisy. The scene between Gatsby, Daisy and Tom is as explosive to read the first time as it is to re-read it again and again.<br /><br />But because the writing is so good, the story so layered and full of symbols with a strong theme and message, it's no wonder this book has had untold numbers of books and papers written about its complexities and nuances - how truly magnificent a work of art it is. I won't go into the various themes and sub-texts as this review will turn into a sprawling mini-book of its own but suffice it to say Fitzgerald explores the theme of how wealth in America means the rich can do what they want to the poor and the law can't touch you if you have cash, with a wry and precise eye that still has relevance nearly a century after it was written.<br /><br />And why is Gatsby great? Because he is the embodiment of the American Dream - a working class boy who became rich; a self-made man, yet his pursuit of riches and love were all illusions in the end. Riches come and go and love can be fickle and deceitful. In the end, Gatsby represents the poor to Daisy and Tom's rich, and like the poor paying for the sins of the rich, Gatsby too must pay the ultimate price for attempting to join their ranks.<br /><br />\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a haunting, bitter, and powerful novel of America's elite and their excesses, a damning yet beautiful work of art that captures perfectly an era and a class through wonderfully realised characters in an unforgettable story. A modern tragedy that's of its time but for all time, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" continues to enchantreaders and earn and re-earn its status as a Great American Novel. If you've never read this masterpiece, let me be the first to introduce you to Mr Jay Gatsby - he'll take it from here.readers and earn and re-earn its status as a Great American Novel.

I don't think I am capable of putting to words what I thought of this novel.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is a jazzy tale that takes place in 1920's America and revolves around seven characters: Jay Gatsby, impeccable host with a past unknown to many, in love with naive, superficial and materialistic Daisy Buchanan. Daisy, in turn, married herself to Tom Buchanan for the sole purpose of continuing to lead a life of privilege. Tom is an egotistic, adulterer, whose latest mistress is none other than the mechanic's wife, Myrtle Wilson. The mechanic, George Wilson, is good friends with Tom, and is none the wiser about this affair. Jordan Baker, a golfer and Daisy's friend, is aware of everything that's happening, and brings in narrator, and neighbour of Gatsby, Nick Carraway into the picture.<br /><br />In a strange turn of events, Nick becomes a close friend and confidante of Gatsby. Gatsby is now a very wealthy man who lives in a mansion and holds daily parties that go on until the early hours of the morning, in the hopes that one day, Daisy would walk in through the doors. With Nick's help, Daisy and Jay meet again, and the romance is instantly rekindled. However, in The Great Gatsby, it isn't a matter of all's well that ends well.<br /><br />This story really makes me sad. A very charming man, Jay Gatsby wanted nothing more in this world than to be with Daisy. Daisy on the other hand is torn between wanting love, and wanting to remain with Tom and her comfortable existence. I wasn't very surprised with the ending, as I saw it coming. But I was surprised at the reaction of all the people that surrounded Gatsby, and angry at quite a few of them.<br /><br />Definitely a must-read. A classic by all means, a timeless tragic tale that has and always will capture the hearts of readers.	2012-07-14

It may be hard to interpret, but once you understand it, it is one of the greatest American novels every written.

The writing is stunningly beautiful and whole paragraphs deserve to be savored again and again. Yet the story is bluntly sad and tragic. It's a story about chasing after elusive dreams -- once you seem to have reached these them, they evaporate. Fitzgerald packs a lot of punch, style, and tragedy into less than 200 pages. I loved traveling back to New York in the 1920s and spending some time peering into these character's lives. I also just loved reading the words of an absolutely brilliant writer.	2012-06-08

Jay Gatsby is this rich, mysterious man who throws infamous parties on Long Island during the 1920's. He appears to have everything he wants but what he really wants, is Daisy Buchanan. Daisy slipped through his fingers once before, and now she lives just across from his mansion with her husband, Tom. When Nick Caraway rents a home nearby, Gatsby accepts him into his circle with the hopes of luring Daisy back to him. For you see, Daisy is Nick's cousin.<br /><br />Oh, to be rich and young in the 1920's! At its core, this is a love story and has been called one of the greatest American novels of our time and I can certainly see why. It's gorgeously done and Gatsby is a character that stays with you, long after finishing the novel. He's complex and just mysterious enough for you to understand everyone's infatuation with him. Everyone except Daisy who continually reminds him of what he used to be.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is a beautifully rendered masterpiece and should be read and enjoyed by many.	2012-06-07

I'd give it negative infinity stars if i could.<br /><br />This era is not boring, but this author is! There is no possibility off me ever caring about the characters, the reliance on symbolism and the intense feeling of \\"I'm writing something important! Pay attention damn you, and how dare you not like my work!\\" In the place of true character and plot development makes this book so dull that I feel the only thing it's good for is inspiring the sandman.<br /><br />The prose is mediocre at best, contrary to popular opinion of 5 star reviewers, one can be smart and still hate this book. No, I don't read goosebumps, never could get into them.<br />If anything, this book is twilight without the vampires, which by the way is an equally horrendous affront to intelligent readers.<br />My favorite books tend to be fantasy or sci-fi, though I did like Huckleberry Finn, Tuesdays with Morrie, and found deadline by Chris Crutcher insightful, and enjoyable.<br /><br />I don't need a book about the treachery of stupid rich people who are only friends because of money, back stabbing at the slightest perceived insult, masked by story of foolish lust which resulted in a mediocre affair, it's beyond dull, it's an insult to writing. And I already know that humans freed from pursuit of basic needs, and without some balance or check, devolve into petty, egotistical, self-absorbed jerks.<br /><br />If this book is a classic because it's a story about choosing ones friends wisely then fails miserably, if it's about the stupidity of lust and affairs and their danger, then again, it fails to adequately convey the point to young adults who are required to read this and draw such conclusions without the necessary insight or life experience to read between the lines and dullness of the fictional tale of foolishness woven here.<br /><br />There are authors who have managed to convey such points much more eloquently, clearly, and in far more interesting ways. At this point history itself would be able to convey such points in a superior fashion and with greater frequency. Hah, stories in the old-testament bible about Saul, David, and Solomon would convey the point better.<br /><br />If you read James Cleavland's review of this crime against the united states and humanity in general i think he may have hit a few reason why i dislike this book so much. http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C16SDV4PXLR4/teresting ways.

Having read numerous spoilers over the years (Gatsby is, after all, everywhere) and having just finished two depressingly weary previous novels of Fitzgerald, I was braced for another unredemptive drag through the dust with yet another hoard of hard-drinking, adulterous characters. And, in essence, that's exactly what it is. But there's more to this one than just that. I wasn't more than a chapter in before I could tell this was something different from anything else Fitzgerald had done. It's lighter, less self-indulgent, and as a result a much more piquant and incisive study of character and culture. A large part of its difference is the narrative voice, which is thankfully far away from the Avery and Anthony of his earlier novels. For once, we have a basically decent character objectively observing the crumbling of the immoral rich. It's not a book I would enjoy reading over and over again, but there is a magic here that makes me understand why it is so beloved.	2012-05-05

I think it might be the first assigned classic literature novel that I made me to read beyond the assigned pages (ok, maybe Of Mice and Men had the same effect too.)<br />I particularly adore the Nick Carraway. Even if he is a rather passive character who seems to get dragged everywhere by Tom, Jordan, and Gatsby. He comes off as someone trustworthy and humble. I admit I get frustrated with his passiveness at times; somestimes I just want him to slap the characters, but I guess that would be acting out of character. For a guy that only knew Gatsby for three months yet held a funeral for him, and is aware that he was used as a pawn to get close to Daisy, Nick is admirable. There couldn't have been a more perfect narrator.<br /><br />Gatsby is beyond redeeming. He is a friendly, likable character, but it is apparent that he is a desperate mess behind his overwhelming wealth. He is clearly deluded by the idea of having Daisy and social status, even when Daisy is clearly a mess herself. I'm not sure what he even sees in her, but I suppose his undying love makes him likable, albeit frustrating.<br /><br />I'm not sure how Daisy can murder someone and not be terrified. I imagined her as a girly girl who gets scared easily, but to kill someone and not feel immense guilt...I have my reservations.	2012-04-19

After seeing it on all of the \\"Best of\\" lists and being told that it was inexcusable to have not finished it already, I took three days and read it.  And it is great.<br /><br />The story itself is intriguing and beautifully-told.  Fitzgerald had a \\"pretty\\" (for lack of a better word) style of writing -- the way he worded things in this book just read so well.  The story is simple (as it must be in a >200 page novel), but every word is used to great effect.<br /><br />The symbolism is perhaps more what I am left with, however, after reading this novel.  As Nick Carraway (perhaps, the only \\"good\\" character in the novel) loses his innocence on his 30th birthday, it seemed to be a commentary as to the end of the 1920s -- the end, in many ways, of American innocence.  And Gatsby's tale, the mystery behind his rise, the inevitability of his fall, all shrouded in rich parties and mansions -- they aptly reflect the decedent materialism that often comes with success but leaves one empty and incomplete.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is a wonderful novel that I highly recommend.	2012-03-03

It's all about ritzy partying, about the things that happen to people who party a lot. That's the great American dream -- sappy unrequited love before and after partying. I can't understand why it's revered in American literature. It doesn't have anything to offer but a melodramatic peek at the lives of very shallow characters. The characters sounded as if they were culled straight out of Beverly Hills 90210: The Jazz Age Version. The prose is masterfully done, but the story is just pathetic.	2012-02-20

There also many other symbolisms in this story for things such as God and distance.<br />All things considered this is a great book it has a very good plot, lesson and the writing style, length, realism, etc. are superb.

That we never get a true picture of Gatsby or Gatz, is perhaps the strength of the novel as a modernist text, in the way it sets questions about identity and the construction of it in place.	2012-02-10

I know that I was supposed to read this in high school, but can't remember if I did or not. Regardless, I finally picked up another copy and read it again. There is not much else to say about this timeless American masterpiece. The writing is stunningly good, the symbolism is inspiring, and the characters are sympathetic despite their gross materialism and hollowness. This book resonates as much with our own time period as the Jazz Age that it is set in.<br /><br />On the surface, this is a book that tells the story of a tragic love story. Simmering just below the surface, the novel is a first-class commentary on the hollowness of the pursuit of money and things. Gatsby is at once admirable and pathetic, rich and the poorest of men. Finding purpose beyond the material world is the only thing that can differentiate us and him.<br /><br />If you read this in high school and remember not liking it, try it again. Books that are force fed often taste bad going down no matter how good they are. This is a great book and one that I will read again and again over the years. Highly, Highly Recommended.	2012-01-17

What a great photo, although I can't quite picture any of the females in this book dressed so sedately--well, maybe Jordan.  Yes, Jordan would wear this outfit.  I also bought this edition because it is just the book--no intro, no preface, no notes, and thank the book gods who watch over us for NO readers club discussion ideas!  Just The Great Gatsby as Fitzgerald wrote it.  So much action in such a short book.<br /><br />And what was so great about the Jazz Age, the Roaring Twenties, getting dressed up and getting drunk?  The first time I read this book, many years ago, I was completely caught off-guard and not expecting the violence so what a shock it was and I remember feeling like I had mistakenly read a few pages of Erskine Caldwell, and even now I feel like re-reading God's Little Acre.  \\"Ain't we got fun\\"?  I don't think so.  I feel like I have been peeking in Gatsby's windows here, and it doesn't look like fun to me.<br /><br />And speaking of Gatsby, the character, just what was so Great about him?

As the myth goes, no one provides the correct answer until the arrival of Oedipus, whose response of man reflects the stages of human life.  The irony of a riddle is that its answer is crystal clear after its revelation.  The answer is right in front of us, but often it takes a great work of art such as the story of Oedipus or in this case The Great Gatsby to help us understand our humanity.<br /><br />Many of my millennial students sigh or complain when they recount their first experience with The Great Gatsby.  \\"It was forced upon us.  My teacher kept saying how great this novel was, but she never explained why other than it depicted the Jazz Age.\\"  Neither Oedipus nor prophet, I have provided some reasons as to why this novel deserves a second look from today's youth.<br /><br />As many have already mentioned, The Great Gatsby's narration is the voice of America.  Post-modernist critics may object to that statement, considering that Nick Caraway, a young white Army veteran, comes from a well-to-do Midwestern family.  While Nick differs both physically and geographically from most of my students, his voice speaks for Americans not so much for what he says but rather by what he doesn't.  Nick listens.  Confused yet excited by the \\"bright lights\\" of New York, he nonetheless is attractive to the main characters because of his honesty, integrity, and kindness, traits one would find in a counselor or a religious leader.  Though confidential, the dramatic irony is that we receive a first-hand-account of the attitudes and actions of America's \\"gods and goddesses,\\" much in the same manner we encounter the tragic flaws of the keepers of Mt. Olympus.  Shining a light on the closed world of the rich and famous is titillating to almost everyone.<br /><br />Another aspect of this novel that is overlooked is its length.  Depending on the edition, the length does not exceed 235 pages (my edition is 182 pages), a major accomplishment considering its literary output.  Published in 1925, Gatsby shines because Fitzgerald had learned from the failure of his play The Vegetable that Americans crave descriptive yet efficient writing that can be read in a day or two.  Fitzgerald accomplished his goal, and like any great dramatic or cinematic feature, his audience--with some assistance--is able to digest the purpose or meaning of the story itself.  The length of the text is appropriate for any student, but what is gleaned may depend on the stage of an American's life.  Note, my previous statement is not contingent upon age; rather, it is my observation that Americans form deeper opinions about the American Dream based on their experiences in pursuit of the American Dream.  This is the last idea I would like to explore in the next paragraph.<br /><br />The topic that is of central concern to this novel, and one in which makes this novel worthy of merit, I tend to believe, is Fitzgerald's criticism of the American Dream.  This may be a generational shift, but many of Generation X males measured their worth based on their ability to become \\"self-made\\" millionaires through Ben Franklin's proverbial (yet ironic) schedule of hard work and dedication.  The Dream (dream?) worked in stages: Young man falls in love with blonde goddess who comes from a renowned (wealthy) family; next, he begins his Arthurian quest to woo her by demonstrating his valor in battle.  Returning, he whisks her off her feet, marrying, and then carrying her on a white horse to her castle.  There, he consummates his marriage with his fertile wife, leading to their first-born son, who can carry the name for generations.  The only catch is that the Dream takes money--lots of it.<br /><br />For my generation, this was the single greatest fear that men encountered: failing to achieve the Dream.  There was no other option, and because of it, thatis why Gatsby, a penniless veteran, perverts the means of achieving the Dream by entering the world of wolves known as the criminal economy.  Like the narrator, we disagree with Gatsby's decision, but we can sympathize, especially for returning veterans who often struggle to find gainful employment.  Nick understands this point better than anyone because he comes from a \\"connected\\" family similar to what Tom, Daisy, and Jordan have.  Who today has a family who can fund one of their children for an entire year to find himself in New York?  While no one likes to use the word \\"victim\\" to describe any group today, the fact remains that players such as Wolfsheim, Tom, Daisy, and the party goers exploit Gatsby's ambitions for their own personal illusions.<br /><br />Looking at the narration, the terseness yet beauty of the text, and the overarching theme of the American Dream, one cannot help but reexamine this literary pearl, as readers did of course after Fitzgerald's death.  In the past, much of the discussion regarding this novel has focused on the following questions: Has the green, flickering light known as the American Dream passed?  Have more Americans resorted to \\"questionable\\" practices in order to obtain the Dream?  These are reasonable questions for my generation, but for a younger post-Socialist generation, their next question may not pertain to finances nor social status but rather personal identity.  Before another generation reads Gatsby, maybe they should ask the following question: How do I define the American Dream?  It might be too post-modern for my generation to swallow, but millennial Americans must now find happiness on their own terms in a world that we have not left better than our parents did for us.  The old definition of the American Dream killed Gatsby; it would only be too prudent to steer a different path, for our children and for what remains of our time on Earth.

Eliot. And try as I might not to wax rhapsodic about this greatest of novels, I am overtaken and undone! I recently saw the theatrical innovation based on \\"Gatsby,\\" \\"Gatz,\\" and was struck anew by its transcendent beauty and also by the freshness and fascination of its narrative. The voice of Nick Carroway is a beautiful one, moral, full of world-weary sympathy, and always astutely tuned in to the voices of the grubby characters around him. You hear it and you feel as soon it as begins, and reading it is no less haunting than hearing it aloud on stage. Fitzgerald--and Nick, too--- are unerring in their understanding of Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, Jordan's, all their their sordid badness masquerading as glamor, all their innate incapacity for happiness,their fragility, sadness and their brutality. Finally, I love his clarity about the tragic self-delusion that is America. Fitzgerald may have been glamor-struck himself as a young man but he sees through it as surely as Proust his own snobbery. I wish folk would not teach it as a high school book unless they are true devotees; teaching it at a less than fever-pitch enthusiasm will surely kill off its beauty. And what could be more beautiful than its last few sentences, its only equal Proust's own last sentence in \\"Swann's Way\\"!	2011-12-04

Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY is the tale of an aloof narrator caught up in adultery and murder in a 1920s America flush with new money. The novel has been touted as a mirror of its age, a meditation on the loss of a basic humanity in the midst of economic prosperity, and even the summit of American prose writing in the 20th century.<br /><br />In fact, I must confess that I find THE GREAT GATSBY a sometimes tiresome soap opera that never manages to make that leap to great novel. The novel can be read to the end, and even often enjoyed. There's a decent bit of humour, and clearly some elements have been original enough to sink into the public consciousness. However, those elements that are so often referenced -- Gatsby's unrequited love, Nick's disgust with what he sees -- always sound more profound when detached from the actual text with its contrived turns, unrealistic dialogue and the occasional (and generally unsuccessful) try at poetic metaphor.<br /><br />All in all, THE GREAT GATSBY belongs in that list of books one must read to be an informed person, but for which one should steel oneself for the disappointment that may come.	2011-11-28

The first time I read it was in high school and I couldn't fully appreciate or understand it.  Then as an Education major in college, I taught it to my students when I did my student teaching and had to know every nuance about it.  What do I love so much?  Mostly Nick Carroway's narration and the way Fitzgerald describes things as the writer.  He uses such rich imagery that you can just picture the scenes and characters in your mind.  And yes, all of the characters are shallow and mostly immoral, except for Nick, the narrator.  To me, this is a story about love, longing for something you want so badly and will do anything to have, how money doesn't buy happiness or fulfillment if you don't have love, how people will use others for money, and how money can ruin people.  It's also an interesting portrait of the east coast and rich people during the 20's.  Every time I read it, I get so lost in the descriptions of Daisy, Gatsby, Jordan, Gatsby's parties and the guests at his parties, the sprawling mansions, etc.  Overall it's a very romantic book about wanting something you can't have - and then getting it only to have it not fully meet your expectations.  I will admit, the ending is depressing and sometimes I stop reading before the book ends because it's just not pleasant.  But this will still go down as my favorite book of all time.	2011-11-12

Still....all the hoopla about it being the \\"classic\\" American novel and it being made into no less than FIVE films with another on the way in 2012...I thought there HAS to be something great about it.<br /><br />WRONG.<br /><br />I never though a 150-page book could take so long to read.  This isn't so much a story as it feels like an outline for a story.  The book is SLOW and Fitzgerald's writing style is SO over-wrought and flowery that it really, really gets in the way of moving the plot (wait, was there a plot?) along.  None of the characters are likeable.  There was NO ONE to root for, therefore there was no emotional investment in this story.  In the end, it's a VERY thin love triangle between rich, superficial people.  That's it.<br /><br />It's also told through Nick's character, who is completely irrelevant to the story.  He's only there to narrate it.  Why do we need him?  It's more effective to SHOW us what's going on rather than have Nick feed us all the details AFTER the fact.  That device provides NO drama, suspense or anything else.  In fact, you could remove Nick's whole character from the book and it would lose nothing.  That's how inconsequential his character is.  It only serves to separate us further from the characters and a story that are already pretty thin and distant.<br /><br />Wow.  This book is a D+ at best.  I'm shocked this is what people think of as a classic.	2011-10-28
US	24064251	R2KJCFAMYGLYKV	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A rich story	\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of the most exquisite books I have ever read to date that deals with most if not all aspects of love and the challenges of life. There is so much to learn especially for us in this modern world where so many people use the word \\"love\\" without really knowing what it truly means. The author is so descriptive that I sometimes felt as if I was in the story. He made it easy for readers to penetrate the souls of the characters and relate to their lives.<br /><br />The character development is prodigious, while prose is outstanding. I felt as much for Gatsby as I have for the other characters. He always had high aspirations, but his dreams were taken away from him by the fact he had to fight a war, and he could never be the same again after that war. Gatsby's ambition is to have his former love, who is now married to an unfaithful husband, a quest that saw outstanding twist and turns in the story to make it the great read we have heard so much about. Disciples of Fortune,with a similar theme, is another inspirational book that I read with The Great Gatsby  for the month. This book is truly inspirational for everyone irrespective of race, gender, age or occupation.	2011-10-03

I have to say that I was not as blown away this time as I have been in the past, but it is still a great book, a classic, a stellar example of the Great American Novel.  It is also a very teachable book, with many interesting points for readers - the glamor, the romance, the wealth, the dreaming and longing for somebody to love.  But what struck me hardest this time was that the book is primarily about loss and illusion and defeat.  Gatsby, as great as he was, did not get what he wanted.  He may have even wanted something that could never have existed for him.  It is a deeply disillusioned book, with a bleak view of romance.  In this story, unlike in Wharton's \\"The Age of Innocence\\", true romance does stand a chance against the crushing weight of social pressure.  In fact, despite all the romancing that is going on, there does not seem to be much real love between any of the characters, except for Gatsby's obsessive love for Daisy (she responds to the power of his passion and personality, but how does she really feel?), and the camraderie between Gatsby and the narrator.<br /><br />The whole story is as fascinating to me as it ever was.  'Fitzgerald was capable of writing some of the most graceful and beguiling prose that anyone has written.  And the character of Gatsby, that embodiment of American dreaming, that rags to riches guy, that smooth gangster with a naïve and loving heart - he was probably FSF's greatest creation, and one of the greatest creations in American literature.	2011-09-26

Scott Fitzgerald's \\"Great Gatsby\\" dispels the myth of the American Dream.  If you want to read a rags-to-riches story with a happy ending, you had better read something by Jackie Collins. Jay Gatsby is a tragic antihero who rises from humble beginnings to flamboyant riches while chasing a single dream. Nick, the narrator, describes Gatsby as having an \\"extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in another person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.\\" If money cold by everything, then Gatsby would have been the most fortunate of men. Unfortunately, his dream became an illusion. On Gatsby's deathbed, Nick ponders that Gatsby \\"paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.\\" The reality of the situation is that Gatsby is a man in love. His life was a concerted effort focused solely on winning Daisy back: acquiring wealth, buying the house across the bay, throwing his lavish parties, and befriending Nick.<br /><br />Gatsby is tragic because he, like everyone else, suffered from loneliness and wanted to experience authentic caring. He thought he found that in Daisy. He spent his life building wealth, mostly illicitly, in a misguided scheme to bring Daisy to him. Money was not his end but the means to his end. The people with money, represented by Tom and Daisy, do not care about authenticity or love: \\"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smash up things and creatures and then retreat back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up their mess for them.\\"  In a classically tragic ending, death is abundant. Not just people, but dreams. Gatsby's image of Daisy that Gatsby built up is now completely dead. The reality fails to live up to his expectations.  The reality of the situation is that Gatsby was a man in love with an image.  While Gatsby concentrated all of his life on winning Daisy back, the nouveau riche could not see  beyond their own enjoyment. Told with an eye for cynicism, The Great Gatsby is an American classic and beautifully written; any group of lines can be extracted and appreciated on their own merits. The message of the Great Gatsby is just as poignant today as it was in the Jazz age.entrated all of his life on winning Daisy back, the nouveau riche could not see  beyond their own enjoyment.

A quick scan of a sample of reviews shows this to have been widely read by school children from the USA. Hence the focus perhaps on its meaning for greater Americana, that love of country through literature, pride and patriotism through a rendering of one of the grossest periods in the history of large decadent societies. I found it a very ordinary novel with thin shallow characters set in a context that countries like the Philippines or Bolivia would be made to wear with shame: corrupt, tarnished, cruel, trashy. Yet because it's the USA we are repeatedly told about the book's accurate depiction of a significant period of history (or words to that effect).<br /><br />Yes, I agree with other reviewers that he could write good descriptive prose. But who can't? (I mean, I hasten to add, among worthy recognised writers.) That alone, great literature does not make. But this thing has Americans seduced, especially their literati. There is no hint that Fitzgerald was an intellectual, or that he delved into very complex areas of personal psychology abutting an overpowering government, economy and social structure. He seems merely to have liked to live, with and without Zelda, the kind of life he almost extolls here.<br /><br />Not enough for me I'm afraid. I only bought the thing because at the fin de siecle it was rated in one of those lists of 20th century literature at #2. Mind you, the judges were all Anglo-Americans and almost all the 100 finalist novels - apart from an odd few like Marquez's 100 Years of Solitude, were from USA or UK.<br /><br />To me it is very ordinary. 3 begrudging stars.	2011-09-07

The characters have no development,  are barely two dimensional, do stupid things for no reason and face no consequences for their veniality.<br /><br />This books is the literary equivalent of being stuck in a window seat on a airplane for 14 hours next to a drunken, smelly creep with bad breath and smelly gas who talks at your for the whole flight about his pointless job.

It's worth tracking the character development time and time again in order to better understand inter-and-intra-personal dilemmas.  Fickle Daisy, egotistical Tom, and detached Jay allow a close up view of people that are in reality much different from their superficial appearance.  Reading The Great Gatsby has trained me to recognize facades, and penetrate them, to realize better relationships with people I might otherwise have misunderstood.  Much is made of the colors in the book, the environs, and the historical context, but I've found the greatest value in trying to relate to characters whose actions and images are polar.  A good test of whether or not you've penetrated the facade is if the characters' actions start to seem logical from their standpoint.  It took a second read for me to get to that point.	2011-09-01

Francis Scott Fitzgerald<br /><br />The Great Gatsby<br /><br />Penguin Popular Classics, Paperback, 1994.<br />12mo. 188 pp.<br /><br />First published in 1926.<br /><br />===========================================<br /><br />Fed up with reading numerous reviews extolling Francis Scott Fitzgerald's ''The Great Gatsby'', I finally decided to read that book, no doubt additionally stimulated by its shortness. Now I wonder what all the fuss is about - for the novel has been a major disappointment. If this is one of the pinnacles of the American literature - and I keep hearing it is - I shudder to think what some of the lower peaks must be.<br /><br />Whether I was prejudiced against the novel by its classical status, or sceptical about it because of the huge amount of praise conferred on it, or simply had too high expectations, is hard to say. But I surmise I might kinda exclude the first two possibilities - for there is a precedent for a classic which I was both prejudiced against and sceptical about, but which I enjoyed quite a lot and which made me an ardent fan of its author (or authoress, because I am speaking of Jane Austen and ''Pride and Prejudice''). As for the high expectations, if one doesn't have them about the classics, what is there to have them about? Certainly, no one is obliged to like any book under the classical label, but I certainly think everyone should give a good deal of time and attention to the classics. The fact that they were first published many decades ago and the reading public, generation after generation, has found them valuable enough to keep them in print is a good enough recommendation. It fills me with respect and awe; sadly, they are not always reflected in the works themselves. ''The Great Gatsby'', alas, only proved again what a wonderful series Penguin Popular Classics is: it gives me the excellent opportunity to acquire at a really cheap price classics that simply don't worth more. As far as I am concerned of course.<br /><br />To start with, the story is good enough for a mediocre novelette, but it is hardly remarkable, much less compelling, and surely unworthy of a novel: Gatsby is fooling around with an old girlfriend of his and that's just about all - until an ill-conceived and badly paced series of dramatic events lead the reader to a lurid end out of the blue. What is much worse than the inanity of the story - which is not so rare a thing after all - is the fact that it is simply very poorly written. It is well beyond me how such prose can be described as ''beautiful'', as I so often hear it described; to me it seems convoluted and laboured, ungraceful and heavy, from time to time bursting with affectation and odious sentimentality. The worst thing of all is that the florid, hideously purple language often completely parts with lucidity. Indeed there are moments when I am left perfectly at sea what at all happens or what the characters are talking about. Nor is the dialogue much better, though sometimes it is remarkably dramatic and meaningful. On the whole, the book certainly is readable, but I was neither entertained by it, nor sorry when I finished it. Nor do I have any intention of re-reading it - I do that only with books which have succeeded to give me a unique and valuable experience.<br /><br />As for the characters, they don't fare much better. The narrator, Nick Carraway, is the only one who shows some hints of depth, complexity and charm. One of the book's major flaws is that Nick is far more interesting a character than Gatsby himself. Certainly Mr Carraway doesn't suffer from modesty:<br /><br />''Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.''<br /><br />Well, neither with the other characters nor with his readers is he as honest as he wishes he would be, but at all events he tries really hard to be - which is highly commendable. We are given to understand that he is poor, so he naturally has nothing but scorn and contempt for the rich. This only makes him more acute observer, which in turn makes a fine combination with his sharp tongue. The sarcasm of Nick Carraway virtually pervades the whole story and leaves no doubt about his opinion of the wealthy. It is often not a little amusing but it is rather unfortunate that the narrator should harp on it so much; every third sentence it gets quite tedious indeed. Moreover, Mr Carraway is not exactly a skillful narrator: few times does he turn to Gatsby's past but he invariably fails to say much that is less confused than the numerous rumours flying over Gatsby's mansion; except that he didn't earn a single cent of his fabulous wealth but inherited it all - which only makes Gatsby less and less compelling, if that's possible.<br /><br />It is Nick Carraway, too, who is there to make some sense of Gatsby's otherwise perfectly incoherent behaviour and singularly boring character. The only sign of greatness that can be ascribed to Jay Gatsby, as far as I can see, is that he is an exception of the rule: much as Nick despises the rich strata of the society, and disapproves of the man who ''represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn'', he cannot help but being attracted to him. But what is this attraction founded on? That, I confess, remains a mystery to me. For Jay Gatsby is as boring a character as there ever was one. There is somebody there, perhaps some fascinating hint of contradictory nature as well, but we are never given anything more than lots of ''old sport'' stuff together with a strange mixture of an urbane, aloof host of the most glittering parties on the East coast of America and incoherent, infantile and devoid of simple common sense man who is head over heels in love with one Daisy. And who on earth is Daisy? Nothing more than a silly girl with one-track mind and affected manner that borders on the incredible. Her pathetic cries in the beginning ''Sophisticated -- God, I'm sophisticated!'' are just too ridiculous to be amusing. Nor is her husband, Tom Buchanan, any less dull and lacking anything that might be called appealing, though in general he is much better drawn; as a matter of fact, he is perhaps the most complete character in the novel after Nick Carraway which, in a way, makes Tom fascinating, if by no means likeable. Jordan Baker, with whom Nick had something of an affair, so sketchy and insubstantial that it might have been spared to the reader, together with Mr and Mrs Wilson, surprisingly shadowy characters given their crucial part in the story, only complete a list of dramatis personae more poorly presented than many a mediocre play can offer.<br /><br />I surmise what makes ''The Great Gatsby'' a classic is its vivid representation of the so called Jazz Age, term invented by Fitzgerald himself as I am given to understand. He is certainly at his best describing monstrously expensive parties full of monstrously wealthy people whose ultimate goal is to get perfectly drank and to talk the most stupendous crap one can possibly imagine. Nick's devastating tongue has a feast here all right. The emptiness and the decadence of an era in which one of the most popular waltzes could be named ''Three o'clock in the Morning'' is vividly described, with a degree of verisimilitude which Mr Fitzgerald should certainly be given credit for. But I have two rather simple questions: 1) is this Jazz Age, or whatever name one might wish to call it, worth the trouble to write and read whole novels about?; and 2) can the Jazz Age in this particular case, evocative as it is, compensate for uninteresting story, flat characters and indifferent narrative?<br /><br />This has been my first encounter with the work of Francis Scott Fitzgerald and I am not at all sure that it won't be the last one as well. For my part, despite charming moment here and there, the best thing about ''The Great Gatsby'' remains its short length. A classic it maywell be.

It is a very simple story in terms of plot, but it's a very complex game of riddle as for its protagonist. There is, in my opinion, a subtle game between what's obvious and superficial and what's hidden and more deep, that's were the novel caught me.<br /><br />I'm a bit surprise that so many reviewers define the characters as to be shallow. Sure, most of them are maybe one-dimensional, but that again plays with Gatsby being so complicated. Because this is the essence of the book as I see it: Gatsby might be a superficial man in his ways and his attitudes, still he feels there's something more deep and worthwhile in life and he thinks he found it in Daisy. And so he pursues his dream to grasp that deeper, most important of thing with what means he has. Which are shallow things, the things he has around him, which dwell in his world and people around him consider valuable.<br /><br />This is what I liked in this novel. Both Gatsby and Carraway feel there is more to life than what they see around them, but unfortunately our means to achieve that deepness - that happiness, if you will - are inadequate, most of the time.	2011-07-04

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.<br />  \\"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,\\" he told me, \\"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.\\"<br />  He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.<br /><br />And so begins The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. But what--I can hear you asking--What does the \\"F\\" stand for?<br /><br />F. Scott Fitzgerald's full name was actually Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, as he was distantly related to the famous author of The Star Spangled Banner, the national anthem of The United States of America. He is famous for writing The Great Gatsby, a prime example of \\"the Great American Novel\\" that all writers aspire to. It is the kind of book you are made to feel that you should read. And it is true, that you should read The Great Gatsby. But it's also true that you will probably enjoy it, and that is the main reason why you should read The Great Gatsby. It is a great book that can be studied and analyzed in college literature classes, but it is also a fun book, not too long, that tells a good story and tells it well.<br /><br />Gatsby is a millionaire who throws fabulous parties. No one knows where he really came from or how he got his money, but he bought a mansion where he \\"dispensed starlight to casual moths\\" for some as yet unknown purpose. Written in 1925, just before the stock market crash of 1929 that began the Great Depression, Fitzgerald is prescient. Did he know that the glitz and glamor of The Jazz Age and The Roarin' 20's was a house of cards built on a foundation of sand--mixophorically speaking? That it could all be washed away in an instant?<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is the subject of the book, but it is told from the point of view of Nick Carraway, the narrator. Nick doesn't say that much out loud. He is kind of an introvert. But his inner voice is exceptionally rich and poetic. If he has a flaw, it is that he judges everyone around him, though he begins his narrative by telling us that his father told him not to criticize others who may not have had the advantages he has had. He then proceeds to judge and criticize everyone. He is like a male Judge Judy. That is the fun of the book. If he wasn't judgemental it would be very boring. Nick Carraway considers himself to be one of the few honest men around. If he thinks he doesn't judge others, that as a consquence of his father's words he's \\"inclined to reserve all judgements\\" then he is certainly not being honest--with himself.<br /><br />Nick judges all before him, almost like the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.<br /><br />The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic--their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles that pass over a non-existent nose.<br /><br />Though they are not the eyes of God, but merely an advertisement for an eye doctor, they brood over the dreary landscape nonetheless, like Nick Carraway also broods. He judges Jordan Baker, a female golfer not above moving her golf ball to a better position or telling little white lies, but only when it is absolutely convenient. He judges the hoards who flock to Gatsby's parties. He judges Klipspringer, who spends so much time at Gatsby's parties that he is called \\"the boarder.\\" He judges George B. Wilson and his wife Myrtle, and he judges Tom Buchanan.<br /><br />Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this man Goddard?<br /><br />Nick Carraway presents the evidence on Tom Buchanan's character, and we don't even have to hear him read the verdict to know what it is. Daisy, his wife, is a little harder to pin down, but later Gatsby provides him a clue. Nick thinks Daisy's voice is indiscreet and full of a certain jen se qua<br /><br />  \\"Her voice is full of money,\\" he said suddenly.<br />  That was it. I'd never understood before.

What amazed me is how so many of Fitzgerald's phrasings remained with me during that time.  It was like the story and the characters were timeless.  My perspective on some of the individuals, however, did change.  As a younger person, I saw Daisy as a more innocent actor in the final tragedy.  As an older person, I recognize her silent complicity in evil.  Years ago, I also saw Nick as naive.  This time, I recognized that, in many ways, he grows throughout the story and becomes a good man.<br /><br />This is the first book in my lifetime that I've re-read.  Based on the experience, I imagine I'll be doing it again and again with books I read as a younger person.	2011-06-05

Scott Fitzgerald is a book told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a humble character from the Midwest who finds himself surrounded by a wealthy crowd of people. Nick lives across Jay Gatsby, a mysterious figure who surrounds himself with extravagancies and people he considers extravagant. Gatsby's idea is to rekindle his romantic relationship with Daisy Buchanan, who's since married Tom Buchanan. Nick reintroduces Daisy to Gatsby. Gatsby's relationship with Daisy is based off of a lie and they never get back together. Daisy stays with Tom. Gatsby's killed in the end by a delusional widower.<br /> What \\"The Great Gatsby\\" does best is captures the fickleness of upper-class society. Gatsby who was not born into money adores Daisy for her popularity and money. Gatsby lies to Daisy and tells her he's rich. Not content with himself, Gatsby's idea is to become rich so that Daisy will continue to love him when they're reunited. Fitzgerald succeeds in telling the story from Nick's point of view. Nick is intrigued by the glamor that surrounds him in New York, but never submits to the notion that money will provide him with happiness. Nicks quiet demeanor allows for Gatsby to go about his wasteful spending uninterrupted. When Nick finds Gatsby hiding in a bush outside of Daisy mansion, the hollowness of the upper-class is put subtly into perspective. Together, Tom, Daisy, and Gatsby create a very comedic dynamic. The three are all so rich that they're bored and their meaningless pursuits lead them ironically into some of the most primitive confrontations.<br /> \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is simple to read and this style compliments the characters the book is written about intelligently. There is nothing solid behind the glitter that cloaks Gatsby's life. By the time Gatsby dies, it feels about right, because by the end of the book, it's clear he's nothing \\"great\\". Fitzgerald does an excellent job of keeping the novel moderately paced, as the story feels that it does all characters involved justice.all characters involved justice.	2011-05-17

It was well done and an easy read even after all this time.<br /><br />The tale is told by the neighbor of Gatsby.  It is a twisted tale of adultery and adoration.  Some say it is the quintessential American novel.  Gatsby's neighbor tell us of Gatsby's quest to win a married woman's, Daisy's, heart.  Daisy struggles with a husband who cheats on her with another woman and she married him for money.  The whole tale ends in a tragedy not unlike a Greek play.<br /><br />The tale was an easy and quick read and fairly engaging.  Fitzgerald does an excellent job describing the era and the surroundings, making everything easy for the reader to picture.<br /><br />The story quickly gets twisted and complicated with various characters involved with other characters that they aren't supposed to be with.  The tragic ending is strangely ironic and suiting of all the selfish characters present.<br /><br />I can understand how some might root for Gatsby and Daisy and their supposed quest for true love; but personally I found all of the characters to be selfish, shallow and deserving of what they got in the end.  This tale truly shows an era of American decadence.<br /><br />Overall a decent read and I am glad that I read this.  I loved the ironic symmetry of the story, but didn't really enjoy any of the characters much.  The story is paced well, has great description throughout, and is engaging.  I wouldn't run out and read everything by Fitzgerald based on this book, but I enjoyed this book and am glad I can say I finally read this.	2011-03-27

I concede  that I am rating this from a scale of expectations; and on that scale, its rates only an okay.  Like many, from time to time, I go back and pick up a \\"classic\\" to see what it is I missed the first time around. I was without a new read this particular weekend and picked up \\"The Great Gatsby\\" off of my daughter's required reading shelf of books from high school.<br /><br />Well, in comparison to other such deservedly vaunted works (\\"Moby Dick\\" is my second favorite book in a lifetime on such a re-reading),  this one did not measure up.  It was not just the ennui (although it was primarily that) that seemed to envelop one and all the characters (sparing only Nick, who I am guessing was the author's own self reflecting on his world), there also seemed to be evidence of an odd lack of discipline in spots. There were a couple of passages where the author seemed to have forgotten in whose voice he was speaking.  In others, time and space are confused.<br /><br />(And, its only a minor complaint  that Fitzgerald can't seem to stop using the work \\"murmur\\" to describe virtually every other audible  utterance. Was this intentional?; I am not sure but it did strike me a bit lazy).<br /><br /> But my biggest complaint was the lack of any inspirational bottom.  Perhaps, indeed this was Fitzgerald's own experience, and I would have to guess in many ways it must have been.  But while I have read many a novel full of misanthropes and other desperate souls, this is one of the few that are thought of as \\"great\\" in which virtually everyone seems to be lost or desperate, or, as to most of them,  just so plain self-orbital, that one is left without some glimmer of hope. On reflection, aside from the pitiable Mr. Wilson, Jordan Baker (despite her tendency to lie and cheat) was perhaps the only character that  elicited genuine  empathy at the end of things- an insecure soul who had allowed herself to be finally vulnerable to her feelings for Nick only to be let down by his withdrawal from her, when he finally retreated from  the ennui of the East. Only she seemed \\"human\\" in a way that one could understand or tolerate.<br /><br />A friend once laughed at me for describing Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road\\" as a hopeful novel.  Yet despite a  post-apocalyptic world full of survivalist desperation,  there was at its core a message of the hope of delivering a next generation into a world with the faintest  glimmer of new awakening in it.  In Gatsby, in contrast,  the only child  in the novel is revealed briefly as an  ornament for her mother's parlor gathering, and then  ushered away for her parents to get on with the  party. And, the author ends the book with a despairing description of human  hope as being washed away with the sands of time.<br /><br />I have to admit Fitzgerald could set a stage for dramatic, and sometimes emotionally gripping moments, although the scenes sometimes (too often it seemed) bordered on melodrama. The characters, were, for the most part, richly rendered and he was able, at times,  to make them make me laugh. Indeed, the symbolism of the settings he described was wonderfully rendered. In these respects, I can admire the flourish of his writing.<br /><br />And as for my disappointment with the substance, that may well have been the product of a gifted writer (and that much is clear) working in that gilded age after the  Industrial Revolution and before the Great Depression.<br /><br />BUT,\\"the great American novel\\" (of which there are many) should some, for this reader, offer some source of inspiration or at least enlightenment.

I don't read the classics that often, so I wouldn't know. But anyway, I've heard of this one all my life, and watched part of the movie a couple times, I think. The other day, it so happened I was in the mood for literary fiction, and already having an armchair historian's interest in the 1920s, I waded in.<br /><br />Story-wise, I didn't quite know what to expect. Turns out, the plot is an age-old standard about a poor boy's devotion to a privileged girl. Thrown into the mix is a rags-to-riches theme, a couple intersecting love triangles, the futility of material ambitions, the disease of wealth and much analytical fodder for social anthropologists.<br /><br />Gatsby is great, as I see it, only in his heroic determination in conquering the world (well, financially conquering a significant piece of it, anyway) to win the heart of the narrator's cousin, Daisy. Daisy is one of those girls who is fun and bubbly at casual social events, held at arm's distance. Under her attractive surface, however, is a shallow, vapid conformist hardly worth the efforts Gatsby has labored at to ascend to her snobby caste. Daisy's hypocritical two-timing blowhard husband is even less likable. Though Gatsby has amassed his wealth by extra-legal means, he was by far the most sympathetic character for me, even without the poignant destiny.<br /><br />I don't know if this was considered light reading in 1925, but today Fitzgerald's prose would befuddle all but the most literate. Not to say he meanders into introspective tedium as James Jones did 30 years later. Fitzgerald reminds me of Victorian-era authors who spent considerable time spelling out their observations of subtle human nuances/intuiting/speculating about the cognitive patterns they translated to. It's actually enjoyable, and didn't tax my 21st Century attention span too often. It was obvious, however, that F. Scott's favorite word was \\"vitality.\\"<br /><br />There is a murder, of sorts, in this novel, but the mystery that makes it worthwhile is the title character.ery that makes it worthwhile is the title character.	2011-03-07

If you are not sure whether you should buy it, YOU SHOULD. F Scott Fitzgerald is my #1 favorite author. He knows how to display a scene so vividly that's unlike most authors. His books can render much emotion in a small way. This book is the presentation of pitiable people and displays people in a realistic light-people with flaws and worries, not characters that do one bad thing and that's it, or  characters that are all angel or all villain. The whole book is rather sad in my opinion. Nothing seems to be particularly happy or motivating and then ends on a tragic note. Yet Fitzgerald weaves a web around the reader that makes him want to continue with the rainy-day feeling and leaves you with a sad/wonderful/bittersweet/memorable book.<br /><br />And that is how it is.	2011-02-20

The decadence and callousness of the characters make them hard to like, but riveting as well. The lyricism of the language is not to be found in many authors today. Gatsby, for all his failings, still may be the most likable of the cast of characters because he does realize there is a world outside himself. A tragic tale beautifully told. It will be a challenging read for most contemporary readers, but it is well worth the effort.	2011-02-11

After completing a few chapters my worries were swayed and I realized that this book would become one of my favorites. The story follows Nick Carraway around New York and his interactions with the citizens of this pretentious society mainly Tom, Daisy, and Jay Gatsby. One aspect of what makes The Great Gatsby such an excellent and timeless novel is the character development. Gatsby's character is mainly developed through interactions with Nick and Nick's descriptions and opinions of him. Also, Fitzgerald's prose and syntax come off naturally and help the flow of the novel and the accessibility of it as a whole. The tale of unrequited love and the yearning to live in the past was very identifiable to me which in return made the novel overall more appealing. Upon rereading The Great Gatsby, this time purely for pleasure, the story and the characters overall felt more real and deeper. It seems that this is one of those novels that every time you read it again it gets better and better. I have now read The Great Gatsby about four or five times and it never loses its appeal or meaning through re-readings. Isn't that what a timeless novel should do? If that's the case, then The Great Gatsby is definitely a classic novel not only because it fits the formula, but also because it's full of superb writing and characters. It's the perfect novel for someone who is unhappy with their present state or someone who loves a person but they do not feel the same way, or if you just want a well developed story that will change the way you look at things. Overall it's an excellent story that everyone should read at some point because we all of the tendency to want to relive the past and can learn the pitfall of this from none other than Jay Gatsby himself.	2011-02-10

The reason for this comparison is because of the abundance of symbolism and tiny snippets of important information throughout the book.  In my opinion you would have to read this book a few times to get a really good sense of the complexity of the story because each time through the book you will find many things you missed the last time.  However, I find this style of writing a little annoying because I am not one that usually goes back to read a book again, so for this book I was left confused.  The Great Gatsby possesses many lessons on life and how to achieve goals and therefore, an American classic on the American Dream.	2011-02-03

But Gatsby kept tearing at my heart.  Morally, he had some issues, but I do admire his honesty to himself.  I do recommend the novel to anyone who enjoys the era of the twenties and a character who fails to see the flaws in the one he thinks he loves.	2011-02-01

Certainly set in an unusual time for the setting of a novel - the jazz age apparently - the time after the Great War, but before the Great Depression. It's odd for an author to focus on a time not automatically associated with great strife and suffering.<br /><br />Or so I thought. What struck me most about Gatsby was Fitzgerald's portrayal of opulence was filled with this desperate hopelessness and lack of morality, a theme which carried right up to the end of the novel.<br /><br />I'm no great literature connoisseur, however to me the balance of Gatsby was a little rushed. Almost everything about the setting and the characters of the novel were well set up. Our narrator Nick's earnest disposition, his friend Tom's darkness and Gatsby's mad optimism. However when the action truly started in felt like it was all over in a second.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I will say the Great Gatsby has a unique flavour to it, quite unlike anything you will read today, and in a market where literature seems to mean languishing for endless pages over every detail, a novel where we as readers are thrown about in sudden events makes for pretty compelling reading.	2011-01-09

I read it for the first time after college, and hated it. Now, 10 years later I have read it half a dozen times, and find it to be a richer and richer experience every time.<br />Fitzgerald was a talented writer, and there are times that the prose in this text is breathtakingly good. But that is not what makes this novel stand out as one of the greatest pieces of truly American literature. Rather it is the eternal optimism, sometimes misplaced, of Gatsby (and some of the other characters) that keeps calling to the reader long after the last page. Fitzgerald wrote a book that speaks to the American ideals and persona, and he did it in the guise of a love story. There is no better description of the indefatigable American spirit than the last page of this novel. It is literary perfection, and even if the book that preceded it was not incredible it would be worth the price.<br />I won't rehash plot points here, but I will say that in Gatsby, Daisy, Jordan Baker, and the amazingly well drawn Tom Buchanan, Fitzgerald created a cast of characters that will long reign as one of the most recognizable in the canon of American Lit. I recently reread this novel for a book club, and it is no coincidence that despite the many varied reactions to the book, everyone agreed that Tom stood out. We all knew a Tom in our lives. It speaks to Fitzgerald's honesty as a writer that one of the least likable characters in the text is one of the novel's standouts.<br />Don't read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" because you have to. Read it because you want to. And then put it aside and live a few more years of life. Then come back to it. You will be amazed what you will find in its pages that you did not find before.	2010-11-26

The first two chapters didn't really get me into the book, and I found myself feeling awkward as I followed a seemingly pointless beginning. But, trust me, it's worth it. The book took off and left me gasping for air. The Great Gatsby is truly a modern day tragedy, and a very well written one at that. As the story progresses, you get drawn into the conflicts and the characters. You feel bad for some characters, feel angry at others, and become all the more attached to the words that Fitzgerald has written. This is a book that, once it takes off, you cannot put down. Not that it's intense, but that it's involving. It's depressing, but amazing at the same time. Truly a masterpiece of literature that everyone should read at least once!	2010-11-23

If you are a teacher, please save the children and assign them a more interesting book. For those reading for pleasure, I recommend skipping this poorly written book. The characters are cartoons.

That quote sums up the book for me.<br /><br />I don't think I would have appreciated this book as a young person. Now, however, I understand the folly of chasing castles in the sky. In Gatsby you see a man who could have done so much but wasted his precious life chasing an illusion. Daisy embodied everything he thought he wanted: beauty, wealth, and a name. Yet we see (and I don't think Gatsby ever understood) that it was all a mirage. For all of their wealth and breeding, Daisy and Tom were vapid, shallow, cruel people who deserved each other.<br />Anyone unfortunate enough to enter their sphere would be crushed and cast aside.	2010-11-20

Scott Fitzgerald's brilliant novel, The Great Gatsby, when I was in high school.  I was captivated by the lush, lyrical prose that was such a distinctive characteristic of the novel.  I think that Fitzgerald has given us a searing, powerful take on the rich dilettantes of the 1920's.  He slowly and skillfully reveals the shallowness and callousness of these people, as they manipulate and deceive everyone.  It seems that Fitzgerald's heroines were always reincarnations of his real wife, Zelda.  It is clear that Gatsby has hopelessly romanticized the superficial and hollow Daisy Buchanan.  He has elevated her to a pedestal that she does not in any way deserve.  Yet he is determined to pursue her and his dreams, at all costs.<br /><br />Fitzgerald is unmatched when it comes to character studies.  He has used his own real life experience among the elite, to peel away the beautiful artifice and show us the truly ugly, heartless soul inside these people.  Daisy and Tom are unhappy and unfulfilled people.  Tom uses Myrtle to escape from the boredom and inanity of Daisy.  He could care less if it all turns out badly.  Consequences, morality and decency are not qualities that one finds in the likes of Tom and Daisy.  They take what they want and try to steal moments of happiness at the expense of the humanity of those who are manipulated and played like chess pieces.  Life is a game to them, a game to be played out in grand style and if someone gets crushed in the process, so be it.<br /><br />Fitzgerald finds his own voice in his narrator, the conscientious and astute Nick Carraway.  He is the observer, watching the carnage and emotional wreckage unfold before his eyes.  Through him, we see the horror of what Tom and Daisy do to those who have the misfortune to those who cross their path.  Initially, Nick is enchanted to be in their company, but by the end as he surveys the tragedy and destruction that has been wrought, he is repelled and wants only to put as much distance as he can between himself and these monsters.  Fitzgerald's own ideas and thoughts are expressed through Nick.  It's a masterful way of illuminating the reader.  Nick is the moral compass in this novel.  He sees the truth, the ugly reality of what makes up the rich and famous, their lack of character, their emptiness, their need to lose themselves.  In the end we feel the way he does.  The beauty and lavishness of the lives of these people are just a brittle exterior, covering up the hideousness that lies underneath.<br /><br />As I read this novel again, years later and much older, it has taken on a whole other dimension.  I have enough life experience now to truly appreciate the dark and sinister reality that can lie behind beauty and wealth.  It is now a richer experience, because Fitzgerald's novel is timeless.  He provided a stinging, harsh critique of the kind of people he knew all too well, of an era, a time in which people satisfied their greediness at the expense of others.  The book can never become outdated, because what it says about people who have too much money and time on their hands with too little humanity, applies to generations through the years.<br /><br />This is a seminal work, a beautifully crafted tale about a time that was captured forever in these richly drawn characters.  Fitzgerald had the most distinctive style of writing I have ever experienced.  No one else has ever even come close to his genius.  He can dissect and carve out the essence of his characters using the most lovely prose. His descriptive phrases still leave me breathless.  I am only sorry that he died prematurely in 1940 at the too young age of 44, thereby depriving us of the privilege of reading more of his magnificent writing.

But it is more than that; it cuts deep into the pitfalls of the Jazz Age: that easily gotten money is easily parted with, that money can buy everything. It is interesting to know that Fitzgerald wrote this book in the middle and at the height of the roaring 20s, portentous of the house of cards that was about to crumble in the next decade. The writing in this book has a liquid, even luminous quality to it, and it is quite remarkable that after more than 80 years it still has a degree of modernity and it does not feel antiquated at all.	2010-09-30

This classic American novel is the story of Jay Gatsby, that fabulously wealthy Long Island party giver, as related by his less affluent neighbor Nick Carraway.  Written in 1925 at the height of the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby expertly captures the 1920s and all its excesses.<br />As Nick Carraway begins this intriguing tale wherein wealth and gayety mask underlying tragedy, Gatsby is presented as an enigmatic character. No one really seems to know who Gatsby is or where he obtained his fortune.  Because of that knowledge vacuum, multiple  myths concerning the man circulate, growing more fantastic with each telling.<br />But ultimately, Nick and the reader learn that Gatsby is a mere mortal whose inner life is a less than satisfying one and whose moment in the sun is destined to be short-lived.

The industrial age must of been a sight to behold. The author does an adequate job of detailing the age and the times of West Egg. Although the lavishness and splendor of the many parties that took place in West Egg were nicely detailed, I found the imagery somewhat sparse and lacking detail at times. The author does a great job of portraying his characters and their morals but for some reason I didn't find this in itself to capture my attention. The story line was so-so in my opinion and could of been better. But in the end, this novel was worth the read.

In retrospect, I think I was an idiot. Reading it ten years later was a truly amazing experience. Fitzgerald lays down some stunning prose and brings a lavish era of American history to life. I was struck with how that culture of excess in the 1920s seemed eerily similar to the mid 2000s. . . and right before another crash, nonetheless. Great book. If you tried to read it once and failed, try again. You won't regret it.	2010-08-23

The Great Gatsby is less about the American Dream and more about the death of a dream; a dream one holds in one's heart, for such an inexplicably long time, that it becomes something more than a dream, something ineffable and austere. Like the previous sentence, this book is permeated with ambiguous phrasings and sentimental, other-worldly prose - that is to say, Fitzgerald has a certain writing style, and chooses to imbue his novel with a certain unabashed romanticism.<br /><br />Most peoples critiques of the characters are incomplete. Sure, they have money, and that might make them frivolous or careless to a certain extent, but they all have depth and breadth. The characters only seem overtly despondent because we view them through the eyes of the narrator, a person who seems somewhat detached from things, as he should be, as the novel is essentially his recollection of events. The net effect is that the novel achieves sort of a dream-like quality. The most likable of the characters is the novels name-sake, Gatsby. I read somewhere that the original editor/publisher of the book had Fitzgerald omit much of Gatsby's biography - I would have liked to know more about Gatsby. That's the great trick of the novel, the reader wants to know more about Gatsby, and when his identity and his character is revealed, it can seem anti-climatic; but when we discover why Gatsby has amassed his wealth, created his persona, and built his estate in a certain place, we realize his true intentions, and recognize them as being the best of humanity, even if they are naive and romantic notions flush with sentimentality.<br /><br />The plot to the novel is interesting and includes one or two twists that make it feel like an urban legend.<br /><br />The main sticking point of the novel (for me) is that wealth does not create happiness, nor is it a means to an end. The wealthy face all the same problems, regrets, and insecurities as everyone else, with the added burden of having money.<br /><br />The novel is a relatively short, enjoyable read, poetic and sublime. An excellent addition to anyone's general library. Recommended.short, enjoyable read, poetic and sublime. An excellent addition to anyone's general library. Recommended.	2010-08-17

Though at the time he wrote The Great Gatsby he could not have foreseen the economic and cultural crisis approaching in 1929, he is clearly suspicious and wary of the culture surrounding him, and the tone of this book expresses that he expects evil will come of it. His characters put their faith and their trust in unstable things- wealth, social superiority, commercialism, the power of culture- and their typical american idealism and ambition makes them reach too far for things they don't have, and they end up losing what they did have. Fitzgerald's narrator, Nick Carraway, is ambitious, but is not blinded by the glamour and excess of the society surrounding him. Nick is the only character who is actually grieved by the tragedies which befall the other characters, because he alone values human compassion above society and ambition. From a Christian perspective, this book shows what happens to culture and the individuals who make up that culture when Christian ambition and even basic humanity are sacrificed for social greed.	2010-08-17

This classic tale tells the story of Gatsby, a self-made man and his doomed love for a married woman he'd met prior to her marriage. The narrator is Nick Carraway who lives next door to Gatsby on Long Island and is present for all the major moments in the affairs of his friends.<br />It seemed odd to me that these people wanted Nick to witness their sordid conversations and assignations. The author seems to want to give Nick a romance of his own, but Nick's relationship with Jordan is never fleshed out. The focus is on Gatsby, a person I both disdained of and championed. He is rich and throws huge parties, but the people around him are hangers on who know nothing of him and enjoy spreading rumors about him in his home, while also eating his food and drinking his beverages. He cares nothing for these people and is only having the parties in order to draw his love to him. Sadly, when he needs them, these people do not come and he is alone.<br />This is another classic which I found myself disappointed in. I expect that for books to become classics, there must be something remarkable about them, but I didn't find much to remark on with this book. It was not as difficult to adjust to the cadence and style of writing of this author and this era than other classics I've read.	2010-08-12

As technology increased in parts of the world, people's necessities began to adapt and change. In America, the basic necessities of food and water are available on every block of the street and are taken for granted; therefore our necessity in an American life became money. Although the concept is hard to believe that money is anywhere close to being as important as food or water, it has to be understood to know the role of consumerism. Back in the mid 1700s, people in North America focused on their crops because their goal was to feed themselves and a family if they had one. In the twenty- first century, America has satisfied hunger at a very cheap rate and has encouraged Americans with a new goal. Since most Americans do not struggle for food, we are not trying to satisfy our physical living life, but our spiritual life. The spiritual life is our mindset on happiness, our wants and what makes us feel \\"good\\". Therefore, with the excess money people have after rent or payment on homes and food, most people invests it on materials, either to decorate their home, the equipments needed in their hobby, or a car for transportation. Again, because America is more advanced than other countries, it is necessary for us to possess excess materials not needed for the physical life, but for the spiritual life of desire, and happiness.<br />Even if consumerism is unneeded to a person, it is unavoidable. Grocery stores not only have foods and snacks, but clothes, flowers and office supplies. Also, the idea of a new school year means new clothes and looks. Another example is marriage, buying dresses, tuxedos, service, a ring and a legal contract. Commercialism also plays a big role for expanding consumerism, such as ads on the back of store receipts and search engines on the internet. Another reason why consumption in material is still here, although some people believe it is the key to corruption is because majority wants or desires it. Each material is designed to be produce because people have been demanding it. Some will still disagree, but when there are enough people taking interest in a certain material, some company will produce it to make a profit on their own.<br />Back in history, the thirteen colonies were not happy with the king interrupting in individual businesses, and still after two hundred and fifty years the United States of America are not happy with the effects of capitalism. There are reasons to have a bad impression on it, such as the production of trash, greed, and class distinctions, but as a whole America is a successful country to be named the land of opportunities. Our needs and wants have created diversity of positions in the educational, medical, business and science field.<br />Another favorite author is Fitzgerald, who depicts money and materials as faults of corruption in Americans. Gatsby is the only gentlemen who is wealthy that proves some dignity and respect of the true feelings of love. He had depended on materialism on his whole life, seeking his desire for daisy. Wealthy, brutal, and powerful; Tom abuses his power of status to deceive a poor mechanic Mr. Wilson to get to his wife, Myrtle. He also depends on consumerism to be at the status he is.<br />One of the important materials in this novel is cars. Myrtle represented the corrupted people who obsessed over materials and wealth, which ironically ended her life. This is all too true in our nation, when people just become in debt, because they could not control their desire in useless materials.<br />It is ironic how our very desirable consumerism in American life, will one day drive our society crashing to the ground. Whether it be a nuclear war over the last gallons of gasoline, or the pollution created from the excess trash of products, consumerism will run the American country to the peak until it will fill up all the wants and desires from the spiritual life.k until it will fill up all the wants and desires from the spiritual life.	2010-04-27

The first page of the story is devoted to Fitzgerald's trying to convince the reader that Nick is a reliable narrator (\\"I'm inclined to reserve all judgements\\" -- how many people go around saying things like that, and would you believe them if they did?).  For the rest of the story he has to arrange for Nick to be everybody's confidante and present at all the crucial scenes, even when his friends are committing adultery: he's there when Gatsby shows his girlfriend his shirt collection; he's there when Tom punches HIS girlfriend in the nose; he's there at the fatal auto accident, and it's awkward that he's not there when Gatsby gets shot.<br /><br />Then there are the story's underlying assumptions.  Fitzgerald assumes that his (1930 WASP) audience will favor the old-rich Buchanans and dislike the newly-rich Gatsby, then tries to convince them otherwise.  If you don't have that bias in the first place, a lot of the novel is a waste.  And Fitzgerald doesn't seem to realize that Nick is old-boy-network too -- his bond-selling job is apparently so easy that he hardly ever mentions it.<br /><br />Then there's the 1930s racism.  To present a really contemptuous picutre of the New Rich, he describes a car of rich African-Americans.  And to hint at Gatsby's shady background, Fitzgerald brings in a Jewish racketeer  (who, of course, describes his scams to Nick in detail - see paragraph 2).<br /><br />The purpose of all this is to teach Nick something -- that rich people can be jerks, I guess.  Not that Nick does anything with the lesson, except write the novel.	2010-04-23

Before the depression, people had fun and would dance carelessly in the night to big bands and fox trot. Gatsby was an interesting character who had sort of a charm to him, and it just shows how during the 20s, not many people cared about affairs, racism, nor drinking.

I submit that people that say these things have never read Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby.\\"<br /><br />But if the beautiful sentences were simply that, the book would not work on the deeper level that gripped me within a couple pages.  There has been criticism of, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" that its overly romantic but I think the book is tapping into something more than that.  It embodies and presents the American yearning for identity which is part wealth, part status, part beauty and part awe.  This yearning goes beyond anything attainable and into the dangerous realm of self-delusion to which even someone as strong and decent as Gatsby succumbs.<br /><br />Gatsby isn't a tragic hero because want he seeks isn't monumental - the adulterous love of Daisy but the way he pursues her is heroic because it consumes his whole life.  Everything he is and does is aimed at gaining access to the social strata in which she lives.  And the novel shows that elite society to be superficial, empty and thoughtless but Gatsby can't see that because he is so consumed with obtaining Daisy.<br /><br />And someone could write an entire dissertation (and probably several people have) on the role of the automobile in Great Gatsby.  When the book was written in 1923-24, the automobile was just on its way to becoming mainstream.  They weren't a luxury but neither had they yet become commonplace.  Fitzgerald was able to see the car not just as a symbol of his character's reckless disregard but as embodying both the rush to freedom and the ugly ruin of American life.  The ash heaps and haunting eyes staring out from of the Dr. T.J. Eeckleburg billboard is where autos refill and where a pedestrian is run over by Gatsby's car.  The automobile allowed the characters impulsively decide to drive to New Yok City for drinks they don't even consume but to do so they must travel through industrial and commercial blight.

In brief, the Doppler effect addresses the perceived frequency of waves, such as a fire truck's siren, by taking into account the actual frequency, and the relative speeds of the source of the sound, and the observer. So too with books; your opinion is so often determined by your particular circumstances, perhaps rushing towards the source, or enjoying the lengthening perspective that life in its fullness can provide. Unlike so many of the now familiar 1-star reviews, written by students forced to read the book as an assignment, I first read this book, of my own free will, more or less, when I was in Vietnam, some 40 plus years ago. When you are living in a bunker, the whining of the rich, and their self-induced troubles, does not go down well, and if Amazon had existed then, the best I could have mustered would have been a 2-star rating.<br /><br />But a friend chided me into undertaking a second read.  And I found a finely crafted novel, yes, concerning the rich, primarily; set in the early years of the \\"Roaring 20's.\\" The story is told through the voice of Ned Carraway, standing in that proverbial inertial reference frame, a migrant from the Mid-West, attempting to scratch a living by selling bonds on Wall Street, and living in modest circumstances on Long Island. The book's essential theme is lost love, or more precisely, lost opportunities in courtship, and involves the title character, Jay Gatsby (n&eacute; Jimmy Gatz), and his desire for Tom Buchanan's wife, Daisy, whom he had briefly known before her marriage. She requites, for sure. The \\"minor characters\\" do their share of suffering. There is plenty of philandering all around, and a somewhat predictable Greek tragedy denouement.<br /><br />Fitzgerald tells his story well, and it is relatively fast-paced and dense. There are sufficient insights to maintain the interest. Tom exudes much of the stupidity and bigotry that so often goes with wealth. Consider the following statement: \\"...Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they'll throw everything overboard, and have intermarriage between black and white.\\" At another point, Fitzgerald says of Tom: \\"As for Tom, the fact that he `had some woman in New York' was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his preemptory heart.\\"<br /><br />But the primary focus is on Gatsby. And therein were some problems. Somerset Maugham did the \\"obsession with a woman\\" thing to perfection. Fitzgerald's explanation of Gatsby's obsession was substantially weaker.

I think, due to my procrastination, I had to do so just a few days before a paper on some aspect of it was due.  Can't remember what the topic was, but I know I turned it in late and Dr. Johnson was not pleased.  I got a \\"C,\\" I think. Now, 25 years later, I read it again at the suggestion of Robert Girardi, author of several books and a collection of short stories (\\"A Vaudeville of Devils,\\" which I liked very much - a shameless plug).<br /><br />Wow.  Did I even read this book then?  I must have done so quickly and without much attention because it was a very good novel.  A bit slow at the beginning, but as I learned about the characters and their connections to one another, I had to keep reading to see how it would all end.  Tragically, by the way.  And you see it coming, though I wasn't expecting to end as tragically as it did.  Don't read further if you don't want to know what happens...<br /><br />So many people lying, living in a dream world: Gatsby, holding on to a past love/infatuation, believing he can re-create it years later, with a new name, a false front and all the trappings of a cultured, wealthy young man (actually gained through criminal activity);  Daisy, aware of her husband's affair with someone, yet not confronting him, and engaging in an affair of her own with Gatsby that is really doomed from the start; Myrtle, who thinks Tom loves her more than his wife, but that illusion is \\"crushed\\" along with her nose; the guests of Gatsby, attending his parties only to get drunk and have some fun, most not knowing their host and not caring if they don't, parties only held so Gatsby can see Daisy again.  And then there's Nick Carraway, the narrator, a self-described \\"honest man\\" who fails to confront these illusions with the truth.  He doesn't tell his cousin Daisy about the details of her husband Tom's affair.  Shouldn't he have, out of love for her?  And he never really confronts Gatsby about his fantasy about re-connecting with Daisy, the long-lost love of his youth.  Couldn't he have \\"talked some sense into him,\\" again, if he really cared about Gatsby?  And when they all have it out at the hotel in NYC, why doesn't Nick call Tom on the carpet about his second life with Myrtle, as Tom is attacking Gatsby for his affair with Daisy?  Finally, Nick could have told Wilson the truth about Myrtle and Tom after the accident, so Wilson's rage and desire for revenge would have not been misplaced.  He could also have told the police that it was Daisy, not Gatsby, who was driving the car, and that it was Tom that was having an affair with Wilson's wife.  Tom and Daisy make off like bandits, though not without scars, the illusion of their marriage apparently safe and sound; Myrtle and Wilson and Gatsby all experience the ultimate fantasy killer, death.  Even Gatsby's dad is allowed to believe that he had a good boy, a smart boy, a successful boy.  And Nick doesn't shatter his illusion.  Out of compassion?  Fear?  Indifference?  Speak up Nick; have some courage.  You're \\"one of the most honest people you know.\\"  So tell the truth to the people around you and maybe you can help them face reality and have better, honest lives, even if the price is the death of their fantasies and pretense. Your silence helped kill these people, in a way.<br /><br />My two cents.  Dr. Johnson, are you out there?  I read it for real this time. What do you think?

The novel focuses on the lives of young and shallow rich people .Nick Carraway is the narrator who provides the perspective and the main focus is on the title character Jay Gatsby who is fabulously wealthy. Gatsby invites many people to his grand parties but none of them are his friends as future developments in the novel show.He has a fake life which he creates to win the hand of Daisy Buchanan, a woman he loved in hiss youth but could not obtain because of his poverty.Gatsby gains wealth in illegal and immoral ways and when he has an affair with Daisy,her husband investigates Gatsby's past and exposes him destroying the affair and eventually destroying Gatsby.The novel is how wealth without character is worthless pleasure without purpose is worthless and using money to buy friends without developing ones relationships so that friendship is not dependent on money is also a worthless way to live. Fitzgerald clearly sees the pointlessness of the young and wealthy of his era who live primarily off the inheritance from their parents but  his life in many ways would end up becoming like those he criticized partly because of the unstable alcoholic he married who enticed him to join in her self destructive lifestyle.After Gatsby, Fitzgerald's writing declined but the magnificent dialogue and descriptive phrasing plus his keen and compelling insight into the hollowness of a live driven by wealth and the desire for pleasure make this a great American novel	2009-11-16

The first twenty pages represent the smoothest prose to be found in a modern novel, and introduces the ideal narrator, Nick Carroway, truthful, dryly humorous, accepting, nonjudgmentall, kind, modest, and likable. The story moves along briskly, though not big on magniloquent ideas. Rather, the story is a chronicle. It etches in stone the Jazz Age, with all its superfluities, excesses, and bubbly froth. It has every American theme--the nostalgic look backwards to aristocracy, the striving for success, the have's and have nots, the intersection of the old and new, the loss of hope for those who can't keep up with their dreams, and the bumptious, hyperactive quality that supposedly characterizes our country.  There is rarely a paragraph that does not have wit, poignancy, and the eye of the narrator  registers all with a detached discernment. Indeed, the overarching consciousness and morality of Nick Carroway may be the best part of this great novel. Through Carroway, the action of the novel moves along, giving a moral ascendancy to all the sordid and comic activities he views. The novel is uniquely evocative, rousing in the reader feelings of humor, sadness and regret that only the best art can, so that the reader himself experiences a sense of yearning for all that has passed, for the romanced past, just like the protagonist, who seek vainly to regain it. And the last lines of the novel are amongst the most poignant ever written. Damon LaBarbera, PhD	2009-10-21

I read Great Gatsby back in Junior High and my only real memories were that it was boring and the characters were unloveable/unredeemable.<br /><br />Finally getting around to re-reading it with more literature behind me, I have a much different take.  While still not a favorite read of mine, I found it more entertaining than I remember and I actually came away engaged in the story and the characters.<br /><br />Reading it this time, I was more distinctly aware of the prohibition era in which these characters were revolving and the extent to which that directed some of their actions.  The drinking/partying took on a new aspect.  It also gave me a greater perception into Gatsby's character and his relation to society as a whole and the society he was trying to 'break into' (Daisy's).<br /><br />There was still plenty of superficiality to the characters...but that doesn't mean these characters are flat.  On the contrary, I saw a lot more depth this time around than in my early teens.  I was very impressed by the way Fitzgerald added so much depth to these characters while at the same time providing them with so little substance.<br /><br />I enjoyed looking more closely at the interactions between Gatsby and Daisy and the way the various relationships worked.  Now that I've actually dated and married, I viewed the relationships in a different light and could better understand the tension, jealousy and hypocritical behavior going on.<br /><br />I would like to have seen more development of the pseudo-relationship between Nick and Jordan, but I think leaving it vague throughout and then ending it abruptly allows for more in-depth thinking than if Nick and Jordan had happily escaped the tragedy surrounding them.<br /><br />I seem to remember there being significant discussion about the East/West geography in my Junior High English class...but reading it this time, I just didn't see that as a main motif.  Sure, we had \\"West Egg\\" and \\"East Egg\\" and various New York parties and excursions.  But when you get down to it, the East/West thing didn't work...partly because all of the main characters are just transplanted anyway (they all came from the west/midwest) and partly because the culture around them felt contrived anyway rather than some high culture that would be representative of the \\"true culture\\" of established Eastern money or whatever.<br /><br />I had forgotten some of the details of the climax and the ending and so was a little taken off guard when everything unraveled.  Parts of the climax scenes felt a little rushed or underdeveloped, but still provided a satisfying turn of events to the story arc, even if the end of the book left me a little unsettled (which is part of the intent, I believe).<br /><br />My initial rating from my Junior High memories was 2 out of 5 stars.  With a more mature perspective on reading and having read a whole lot more and learned a whole lot more, I can give a better rating and say that I can see now why this book is held up as a classic.  It's not the action packed thriller or adventure novel that I may have wanted as a young teenager, but it is a thought provoking and engaging narrative exploring class and relationships in a turbulent world.<br /><br />****<br />4 starshe East/West thing didn't work...partly because all of the main characters are just transplanted anyway (they all came from the west/midwest) and partly because the culture around them felt contrived anyway rather than some high culture that would be representative of the \\"true culture\\" of established Eastern money or whatever.

I find myself going back to it, rereading passages and discovering something new each time.  I found the book totally relevant to our time; apparently decadence and ignorance are timeless human qualities. ; )<br /><br />As for the characters, they are tremendously engaging and presented in an un-heavyhanded way by Fitzgerald.  They are almost like puzzles to be solved by the reader, in our own personal way.<br /><br />I myself have mixed feelings for them all.  I don't trust any of them; least of all Nick, who as narrator definitely has an advantage in shaping our opinions of the other characters.  His \\"are you or aren't you\\" engaged status is revealed at the beginning of the book, and led me to immediately take his musings with a grain of salt.  His treatment of Jordan smacks of milque-toast-style hypocrisy as well.  Consequently, his \\"you're better than all of them\\" claim to Gatsby doesn't win me over; I found Gatsby to be a rather unlikable and shallow fellow.  Gatsby was clearly in over his head in courting Daisy, but continued to do it, full throttle.  Real love, or pie-in-the-sky hubris?  He admitted that the fact that Daisy was desired by so many other men made him want her even more.  This, and his inability to accept that Daisy may have loved Tom at some point hints that he is not really a man in love with a real woman, but rather a shallow twit infatuated with an ideal.  And to think, that having money is all that matters, and not how one makes it. . . again, is Gatsby a scoundrel, or just naive?<br /><br />I only wish the book could have been longer and more fleshed out, but its streamlined approach seems to be exactly what the author intended.	2009-05-07

Widely regarded as a masterpiece, The Great Gatsby takes advantage of the claim as a marketing tool in a way of generating sales. But honestly, the book is just not that darn interesting. It lacks feelings, emotions, and realism, but F. Scott Fitzgerald does well in making his characters appear as robotic, unfeeling, and uninteresting. The most surprising thing about the book is how Jay Gatsby appears to be smaller than life. Had he been portrayed as a legendary figure, my opinion of the book can have been much dramatically different. Rather, he is an ordinary guy who happens to have money.<br /><br />Anyhow, if I have to suggest a much better book that deals with the same themes as The Great Gatsby does, it is easily The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe. The Great Gatsby is dated in its details as they are also lacking of description whereas in The Bonfire of the Vanities (A Man in Full isn't too far off either) is more relevant to our times and is more true to how the society works. I can almost taste it as if I am there, but in The Great Gatsby, it is difficult to follow the course of action at times. It can be the writing itself, but let's be honest, no matter how many revisions it will take, The Great Gatsby is not that interesting. It is an accurate description of the Roaring Twenties, but let's face it: it is a dated era.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I was forced to read the book during high school and found nothing of substance. The second time I read it for pleasure during college, I still found nothing of substance. And now, I read it again for pleasure and still found absolutely nothing of substance.<br /><br />I want to make a comment about two things in the book. Every time Jay Gatsby calls Nick \\"old sport,\\" I cringe. When Nick (a narrator whom I hate) suddenly says, \\"I just remembered that today's my birthday,\\" it is probably the worst moment of the book. It's just so stupidly random and so stupidly stupid. Even Sam Waterston is forced to have a Keanu Reeves moment by quoting the line. One part in the book where Jay Gatsby throws his clothes in the air, Daisy Buchanan exclaims about how beautiful the shirts are. Immediately, I flashback to Mia Farrow's over-the-top performance and wonder if I can get a glittering glass ball and whirl it above her. All in all, The Great Gatsby continues to be overrated.upidly random and so stupidly stupid. Even Sam Waterston is forced to have a Keanu Reeves moment by quoting the line.

I had read The Great Gatsby for the first time in high school, and if I didn't have to read it again in college, I would've said: it's over-rated, it's boring..blah blah, I didn't know how to read literature! I strongly believe that everyone who rated this classic novel below a 3 stars didn't fully grasp the symbolism in the characters, the location (East/West Egg, Dr. T's Eyes), the green light or the meaning of any of the relationships. It's a really quick read, 180 pages, you can do it in one day...but read with much concentration! Go back to your college days and remember that legendary authors, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, crafts his work so that NOTHING is written by mistake. The setting, the colors, the dialogue, they all have an underlying meaning.<br />I would also recommend reading a little biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald before reading \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" because then you'll know that it's somewhat autobiographical, being that he is from the Midwest and he was a solider.<br />Overall, reading The Great Gatsby requires immense concentration and an understanding of literature/symbolism. If you do some prior research, then you'll realize WHY it is a classic.<br /><br />And don't just skip the book and watch the movie (with Robert Redford), because the book is MUCH MUCH better.	2009-04-09

The novel itself is near perfection.  In this Fitzgerald is a genius.  Using as few words as possible, Fitzgerald has richly constructed a story as fitting of the American experience in 2009 as it was during the Jazz age--all glitz and glitter, pomp and circumstance based on thin air, imorality, and chimeric dreams. The Great Gatsby as a novel is a great achievement.  As a story, it is bankrupt.	2009-03-31
US	52239554	R3IC1KZH43ZIEE	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Still relevant today	I have been slowly and fitfully working my way through the classic novels I last read in high school and college, in order to enjoy them without a term paper or final exam hanging over my head. In rereading The Great Gatsby, I was less concerned with the symbolic meaning of the gigantic eyes of T. J. Ecklesburg and more struck by the alien landscape of the ash field those eyes looked down upon. I was less worried about what the green light at the end of Daisy's dock meant exactly and just knocked down by the image of romantic futility painted by Gatsby waving his arms at that dock. In other words, I was more open to the experience of the novel as a great story, rather than great literature. I feel like Daisy and Tom, with their vapid shallowness and complete lack of compassion for other people, are as relevant representations of our culture today as they were of Fitzgerald's then. The American dream is still a powerful and myth that has not yet been debunked, and Gatsby could have been as easily victimized by it in the early 21st century as he was in the premiere age of the nouveau riche. The mark of a true classic is not that it is still being taught in college classrooms, but that it is still a recognizable and moving story decades after it was written.	2009-03-29

I had remembered the main storyline but had forgotten what a good read the book can be.  Fitzgerald provides a nicely written, not overly long or multifaceted story that is full of complexity and insight into America in the 1920s (and in some ways today).<br /><br />Everyone's life in the story seems to be based on or involves a lie (Tom and Daisy in their marriage, Daisy in her role in the death of Myrtle, Jordon's success in her profession, Myrtle and Wilson in their marriage, Meyer Wolfsheim's notoriety, and of course Gatsby in his whole being).  Even Myrtle's sister Catherine, a minor character, lies when arriving at the site of her sister's death.  All of these lies exist under the ever vigilant eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg, though no one seems to have any reservation about being watched.  Nick, our narrator, claims he is one of the few honest people he has ever known.  Yet he is complacent and allows the lies to occur and, in some cases, is an actual accomplice in the carrying forth of many of the lies.  Does this make him a liar, or worse.<br /><br />Though ultimately a story, or statement, about 1920's America the story contains a timeless theme, true wealth can correct a lot of wrongs.  Tom and Daisy left a horrible trail behind them.  Their wealth will allow them to move forward with little to no impact.  While many of the others are not poor they lack the means, financially and mentally, to move forward the way Toms and Daisy's wealth allows them to do.<br /><br />Was Jay Gatsby great as supposed in the title, I don't know.  Nick seemed to have been converted to believing so at the end after despising him earlier.  Better than the whole lot he states.  But can some who is completely a fabrication be great?  The obvious answer is yes as we have seen it through the ages but I don't know about Gatsby.<br /><br />Enjoy the book.  It's a great read that has multiple layers.yers.	2009-03-22

Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" This short but poignant novel paints a beautiful but macabre portrait of a period dripping in character, scandal, and self-involvement. Entirely unforgiving, Fitzgerald is faithful to his ideas and opinions, and shows no fear in humanizing his subjects. This is a novel that I am sure I will return to again and again.	2009-03-17

Scott Fitzgerald had high hopes for \\"The Great Gatsby\\" when it was published in 1925 -that were dashed by a tepid reception. The novel didn't have much critical support until the 1940s. Perhaps, in its own age, it hit too close to home with too much venom. Perhaps the Roaring Twenties, when liquor and money flowed freely, are romanticized in retrospect, and the novel's prevalence of casual dialogue gets more respect now. H.L. Mencken called it a \\"glorified anecdote\\", and, indeed, that is how \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is presented. The narrator recalls an experience he had among friends a couple of years earlier. As a story, there isn't much to it. It is how characters perceive one another, how they wish to be perceived, and the simpler and indifferent reality that comment on an age, as well as on the immutable social nature of humans.<br /><br />Nick Carraway, a man of prominent family who came East to do something vague with bonds, narrates the tale. Nick took a modest house on Long Island, next door to a magnificent mansion owned by Jay Gatsby, a man whom no one knows anything about, except that he throws magnificent parties with all manner of glamorous people in attendance, constantly, which people like just fine. Across the bay, Nick's second cousin Daisy Buchanan lives with her husband Tom, and it is at their home that Nick meets a professional golfer named Jordan Baker, whom he doesn't respect much but takes up with all the same. It is through a series of social gatherings that we get to know this group of people and that Nick eventually becomes friendly with his mysterious neighbor, Mr. Gatsby, who has plans to reclaim his long-lost love: Daisy Buchanan.<br /><br />It struck me that the prose is not very literary for a pre-War novel. The story unfolds in scenes and through dialogue. But it has a merciful brevity that I associate with that era. The lack of extraneous detail and background earned my admiration. Fitzgerald focuses on the interactions of the characters and ignores what goes on in between. This is one slice of their lives, the bitter slice that Nick remembers. It's interesting that it is Gatsby who evokes the readers' sympathy, even though we know little about him and Nick disapproves, though holds a begrudging admiration, of him. Amid the hypocrisy, ambition, and shallowness of these Jazz Age bon vivants, Gatsby is confident is his ability to re-do the past. But when Nick concludes that \\"we beat on...borne back ceaselessly into the past\\", he speaks of himself as much as of Gatsby.hat goes on in between.

US	20613043	R1BM34B7JLTRFM	0141023430	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	0	0	N	N	More relevant than ever.	Although it is widely regarded as a novel about the delusiveness of the American dream, 'the Great Gatsby' is relevant to any post-modern time and place. The concept is such: people's desires and aspirations are, more often than not, founded in nothing but their own head. As, in this novel, Jay Gatsby pursues his first love, Daisy. He works his way out of the lower-class and, through crooked business, becomes wildly wealthy.  Gatsby buys a large mansion on Long Island, directly across the water from Daisy and her new husband's, and throws fabulous parties for the socialites of New York in order to garner Daisy's attention. Even after discovering Daisy to be married, he never questions whether she still loves him, and he begins to pursue her, inevitably starting an affair.<br /> Gatsby is not in love with the real Daisy, he is in love with the idea of Daisy. He believes in the American dream that he can accomplish anything and does in fact accomplish great feats. But his dream is inflexible and not open to discussion. He is in love with a figment of his imagination; the dream of the beautiful young girl he fell in love with as a child. He clings to the hopes and dreams of his childhood which leads to  inevitable tragedy. Although Daisy does care about Gatsby, she is essentially an unfeeling narcissistic person who cares more about her image and social standing than anything Gatsby could ever offer. Hardly the angelic creature that Gatsby so idealized throughout his life. Even after having these facts shoved in his face, Gatsby refuses to believe:<br /><br /> \\"Can't repeat the past?\\" he cried incredulously. \\"Why of course you can!\\"<br /><br /> If you were to change a few specifics and locales, 'The Great Gatsby' could easily pass for a novel of our time. In fact, Fitzgerald is one of the first to so eloquently characterize a person like Gatsby; someone whose entire life is so completely a product of their society.	2009-03-11

I'd always heard of it but never actually read it so I'm glad we had to read it in english. The thing I enjoy most in a book is it's description, I like feeling like I'm actually there in the room with a character, and in Gatsby I was able to do just that. I love how detailed he is in describing the different locations they travel to and the people they meet.<br />  I liked how it exposed the corruption and manipulation that comes with the power of money. Well not to say that all people with large amounts of money are corrupt, because Fitzgeralds clearly showed that even Myrtle who was poor and lived in a shabby home can be just the same as the rich and spoiled. It just goes to show that money can make anybody do crazy and dumb things. Like Tom and Daisy for example, they're infinity for excitement lead to the death of three people and yet they were able to back away clean of any remorse because of there status in society. Also there is George who was the most innocent of them all but because of Tom and Daisy's carelessness was driven to become a \\"madman\\".	2008-12-31

Fitzgerald from the start is extremely descriptive yet brief and poetic. What I find so very impressive about this book is it's ability to make you understand the depths of both the 1920's and the place this story has in it; yet the story and themes are not just easy to relate to, they are fresh even after 90 years. I am an actor and while reading the last 4-5 pages I found myself reading aloud from the book because the conclusion and final thoughts of the character telling the story are written in a profound way; one that makes me feel they should be spoken so that the meaning won't be lost.	2008-12-11

Another tale by a sad author about pathetic rich folk in the 1920's. I suppose the story is worth reading just to lay claim to that fact, for boasting purposes.

No matter how many times I go back and re-read this book (that I was first introduced to as a sophomore in high school), it never fails to take me to a different time and place.<br /><br />I love the descriptions of the lazy and decadent ways of these characters and the struggle Nick Carroway has to be a part of them.  I love the scandals that are around every curve.  But, most of all, I love the easy-going manner of Gatsby himself.  He's quite possibly the greatest character in all of American literature and I feel that, often times, he's the least appreciated too.<br /><br />I've heard many say that this novel is \\"too slow\\" or \\"too descriptive\\".

Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.\\"	2008-11-09

It remains the most accessible of the classics. I can't recall enjoying re reading a book more. Just a delight. Every chapter, every page, is luminous and heart breaking.<br /><br />  I returned to the book, haunted in many ways, not so much by Gatsby as by Carraway, the narrator, who happens to be in the perfect position to observe the Gatsby/Daisy Buchanan love story, as a relative of Daisy and a neighbor of Gatsby's.<br /><br />  It was his sense of being an outsider looking in, or being more observer than participant in events, with which I most cloely identified.

It is hard not to draw some similarities between Fitzgerald's best work and the way his own life ended.  Without going thru the plot, this is all american story about difference between old money and new money.  Not all rich are created equal.  It is also a story of obsessive love that will not let go.  Can a man love so much that getting rich in order to be close to the woman of his dreams can consume his entire life?  How much does it take for a person to understand that one cannot live in the past?  Love story is set in it's moment, time and place.  Once any one of the components is not there, love is not the same or there is none at all left.  And then of course, there is pure love and there is recklessness - way of using people and there emotions as means of reassuring ourselves - with always disasterous outcomes.

Daisy seemed hardly worth all the trouble Gatsby took, and for that matter, neither did entry into her world. She was a cipher. The use of a narrator to connect the various characters was interesting; how could the book have been written otherwise? But at times the plot felt contrived, as with the switching of cars and an accident, and the symbolism around the valley of ashes seemed heavy-handed. Other than the passive narrator, the people lacked even a small degree of self-awareness. The one who seemed the least conflicted and most sure of himself was the brutal, self-centered Tom.<br /><br />It was the lesser details in this novel that were enjoyed most. A montage at the end of the second chapter in which the drunken narrator moved from an elevator, to a bedroom, to Penn Station. How Gatsby's smile affected those who saw it. A mansion housing a library of books with their pages uncut. The vapidity of a man who tried to act out his limited idea of the good life but had little of interest to say and thought San Francisco was in the Middle West. Dogged efforts at self-improvement linked to shallow goals. A shady character eating with \\"ferocious delicacy.\\" The way Daisy conveyed her love for a character in just a few words said lightly in front of her husband. The class disdain someone like Tom felt for the main character -- he couldn't be an Oxford man because he wore a pink suit. The gust of hot shrubbery from Central Park wafting through the upper windows of the Plaza Hotel. The author's description of how it felt to reach 30.

Unlike many novels with a great deal of hype latched to them, Gatsby lives up to its reputation in every blessed way.  Perhaps part of the staying power and widespread appeal of this work is that it and its author were nearly forgotten.  This powerful work was hardly read for more than 25 years, and now it is widely assumed to be one of the greatest works of American fiction in the 20th century. It earned its kingdom through dark years. From amnesia to aggrandizement shows that behind the swirl of its reputation is a powerfully complete artistic vision.  Like all great work, Gatsby can be read on many levels: as a critique of the shifting American psyche, as a critique of the pitfalls of capitalism, as a time capsule of the roaring 20's... each reading brings new surprises.  Perhaps the most refreshing reading is the uniqueness of the language.  Fitzgerald here created prose masterpiece.  Every sentence is finely wrought and cleverly designed, like jewels in an exquisite setting. He created, as he stated, a consciously artistic achievement.	2008-07-08

Aside from making a powerful statement about the so called \\"American Dream,\\" this novel is brilliantly written.

The novel starts off with a dull beginning but soon develops into what is known as one of the greatest written novels during the First World War. In the Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald uses the theme of importance of social class along with money status to show that Mr. Jay Gatsby is a symbol for the average American during the 1920s. The story is narrated by Nick Carraway who is a young lad living in West Egg, Long Island. Next to him lives the infamous Jay Gatsby who falls in love with a taken woman. Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan had met five years earlier and had fallen in love but unfortunately Jay left and was not able to contact Daisy for some time. After waiting for five long years Daisy decides to marry Tom who is one of Nick's friends from college. Sooner or later Gatsby and Daisy meet up again at Nick's house and fall in love all over again. Nick ends up being caught in a love tangle when he finds out that not only are Daisy and Gatsby having an affair but also that Tom has an affair with Myrtle Wilson. In the end three people end up dead due to the entanglement, but it is made clear that Daisy's choice to stay with Tom is solely based upon the recently found news that Gatsby was actually a poor man who inherited money. This then ties in the theme of \\"money does matter\\" and the downfall of the American society due to a shortage of money in the 1920s seen on pages 40-41. I recommend this book to those who are interested in reading twisted romance novels with a little rising action thrown in.	2008-06-05

This generation was no longer content to stay in the small towns and cities that their families had lived in for generations.  The young men did not want to enter into the family business and settle down with a suitable young woman from nearby.  The young women were not content to stay in their parents' house and wait, they wanted out in the world to 'do something'.<br /><br />The story is told, not through the eyes of Gatsby but through those of Nick, a young man from the midwest who has settled in New York to learn the bond game.  By chance he has rented a house on Long Island for the summer, a small cottage stuck among much grander mansions and, again by chance, across an inlet from a cousin, Daisy and her husband Tom, who, also by chance Nick had known slightly in college.  Also by chance, Nick's neighbor, the mysterious Gatsby had been one of Daisy's many suitors before she had settled down with Tom.  Nick soon finds himself swept into the glittering, glamorous world of Gatsby and Daisy and Tom.  He is made an unwilling witness to Tom's infidelity, the one sided romance of Gatsby and Daisy and finally to the tragic results of it all.<br /><br />THE GREAT GATSBY is a very American story, one that depicts the American restlessness, the desire to be more, better, different from all that has come before.  As with many books that are assigned reading this one is often forced on an audience that is too young to appreciate it.  Like many others I hated this novel when I first read it (I was an 18 year old college freshman) but found that it stuck with me, unlike many other assigned books, long after the final exam.  Over the years I have read it several times and each time discovered something new, a different aspect of the novel becoming the 'point' of the story.<br /><br />This is one everyone really should read at least once, perferably a couple times, in their lives.d read at least once, perferably a couple times, in their lives.	2008-06-03

While many consider it to be the finest of American novels, I personally didn't find it to rank quite that high.  It is however a very good book, and although I somehow did not read the book until my 30's, I can understand why it is so widely required in many high school and college courses.<br /><br />Mr. Fitzgerald paints a vivid picture of the \\"Jazz Age\\" of the 1920's and most of the book is centered on New York City and Long Island's North Shore.  I found a lot of parallels to today throughout the book.  The Great Gatsby gives a detailed development of how the never ending quest for material objects and riches can corrupt someone to their soul if a proper grounding in what is truly is important isn't present.<br /><br />Mr. Fitzgerald also provides excellent character development; creating characters that can be rooted for and loathed at the same time.  In the end it is shown how shallow pursuits can lead to a road of destruction and dismay.	2008-06-03

In this book you will find mystery, excitement, rule-breaking, parties, and shady characters that surprise you with every turn- all of which I was not expecting when I began this book. F. Scott Fitzgerald added these elements in a 1920's setting- an era in which there were many social changes. The main theme presented in this book- you can't relive the past- is relevent even today. We all live in the here-and-now- what's in the past is in the past for a reason, and trying to alter that will cause problems for many people- as you will find in The Great Gatsby. We can all get something out of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, no matter your age!	2008-05-16

The story of love lost, found and lost again, the beautiful language will touch the heart and mind.  It's amazing how simple things were back when Fitzgerald wrote this - the book isn't very long, and it speaks of so much: love, jealousy, tolerance, sacrifice, abuse, the inability to admit fault or appreciate what you have, the very essence of the American dream to become who you want to be.<br /><br />This book is like an old black and white movie where men were men.  It's entertaining, but the author allows you to think for yourself and draw your own opinions rather than spoon-feeding you a story with the desire to sway your judgment toward his own.  I was really amazed at how the writing captured my attention and imagination so thoroughly that a couple of written lines could produce the graphic images of a horrific car accident in my mind's eye.<br /><br />This is truly a thinking man's book and a must read.	2008-04-09

Zelda was beginning to show signs of mental deterioration and infidelity, and his cavorting and hell-raising left behind a wake of bad reputation in the social set he used to party hearty with. He was a bit old for such shenanigans to be tolerated anymore.<br /><br />This is reflected in The Great Gatsby. What is also reflected, and refined, is the paradox of an American trying to live to the ideal vested in the grail known as the American Dream. Fitzgerald was indeed talented and lucky as a young writer, but he was also undisciplined and still seeking to \\"prove himself.\\"<br /><br />It is refreshing, upon perhaps my third read in about 10 years, to realize that none of the characters are meant to be likable. They all have shadows and weaknesses of character. Though the narrator tries to portray himself as an innocent; an outsider, he is culpable as much as Tom Buchanan for the events following the climax of the book. This is important, and had I realized it earlier, it would've served me as I passed through the ages exhibited by the characters in the book.<br /><br />As with America itself, there may be ugliness, indifference, and malice in some Americans. They are, after all, people. Yet people love America  despite these bad apples. Their affection more to do with what America means...what it meant to stand for. what it has hoped to be from its inception.<br /><br />Hope carries the dream. Hope endures even beyond what others would deem \\"reasonable.\\" Hope transcends age.<br />Hope is Gatsby's specialty.<br /><br />Read this book and feel for yourself the quality Fitzgerald describes as \\"vitality,\\" and never take it for granted again.	2008-03-25

I read this book after having known the plot and ending, through another novel, The Double Bind by Chris Bohjalian.  I figured it sounded interesting and thought I would read it for myself.  Having known the ending didn't make for the most exciting read, but it was good.  More than that, it was more about what the novel represented and did not say.<br /><br />I won't go through the plot.  The 1920's were a fascenating time and this novel helped capture that.  While it was also written during this period, it had very much a sound and tone of an older novel which did take a little getting used to.  Overall, I'd describe it as a little more bland or plain spoken that what you might read today.  The character development was done with finess and the story was brought along to the conclusion masterfully.  Towards the end you just wanted to skip through to see how it would end.<br /><br />Overall it's a tragic tale.  There's a lot of tragedy in the book, however it's interesting how the author choses to present this to us, in a matter of fact way.  What really resonates with me is the topic of the past and how some of us are prisoners of it.  And how often a first love, may be your only true love.  The notion that maybe you can recapture this one day, is something I think many can relate to.  Great novel, I'm glad I decided to finally get around to reading this classic.	2008-02-19

Also, the fact that anyone would rank this book next to Faulkner, Woolf, Joyce, etc. offends me deeply.  But that is your opinion, and you have every right to it.<br />As many have said, this book is immature.  It takes a fairly basic outline (long-lost love, people cheating on spouses, an \\"outsider\\" comes in and has no true responsibilities) and throws in some symbolism that any high school student could conjure and then acts pretentious (which is probably why so many people like it, because they think it makes them look good).  And that is all.  I know that many people claim that was how it was in the 1920s, but please, no other piece of \\"literature\\" I have ever read has come off so shallow.<br />But back to those who act like not appreciating it means that you do not know much about reading.  That is just inconsiderate.  I truly hate this book, but if you like it, fine, I'll argue with you about it (and the fact that I've had to read three times now for school as an English major means I know quite a bit about it) until I faint.  However, this does not mean that I will write you off and not listen to any of your other opinions.  Because once someone did this to me when I told them I truly disliked \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and then they sarcastically asked what my favorite book was, expecting me to say something in popular fiction like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  And, at the time, it was \\"Crime and Punishment\\" from my Russian Literature course.  Furthermore, if this book is The Great American Novel, then American Literature is pathetic when standing next to most other countries, including Russia.	2008-02-12

We are not bound by our accidents of birth.  He also captured one of the sad truths:  too many people spend their lives chasing an illusion.  In Gatsby's case, it was the illuions of the happiness that comes from being in the \\"moneyed\\" class.  If Fitzgerald were writing today, I would bet that Gatsby would be chasing celebrity culture, equally pointless and equally seductive to so many.  The developing friendship between Nick and Gatsby is interesting to watch, as Gatsby at first tries to ingratiate himself with his money, and then realizes he doesn't have to and finally opens up to have a real friend.  When Nick informs Gatsby that he is worth the lot of the rich put together, it is a culmination of something real, not the illusion.  The book captuers the roaring 20's well, but can also translate easily into our time.  It is justifiably considered a classic.	2008-02-10

US	28402900	RMUQ4OILMXIKL	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	1	1	N	N	You can never go back!	Did you ever want to go back? Back to those great times? That's what Gatsby wanted to do but he additionally wanted to CHANGE THE RULES too!<br /><br />This work is told from the perspective of a third party about a determined man, Gatsby, who fails to secure an early love, a vain immature gal, Daisy, and now that he's hit the big time and has become a high-roller, he wants his Daisy back (even though he never had her to begin with) -- and he's willing to go to any extreme to OWN her.<br /><br />The setting is the 20s, a period of excess and near social insanity in New York City in particular. Gatsby puts his plan into place and things go fine for awhile in that Daisy responds quickly to his overtures. But what Gatsby never figured on is that Daisy is a mile wide and an inch thick. She RE-responds to her husband's overtures to come back, albeit this act is spurred on by a personal tragedy and the death of a near-innocent.<br /><br />Gatsby, in the meantime, has inadvertently set into motion a chain of events over which he no longer exerts control and, ultimately, it leads to his demise.<br /><br />This book is arguably Fitzgerald's best work and it's bulging with symbolism and metaphor. It's a book that is set apart from most others of the period and now is thus referred to as \\"literature\\" -- quite the professionally written novel.<br /><br />It's not for everybody but if you're up for reading some great prose, you love scandal, and don't mind all the subtle ethical lessons that accompany the work, then this one is probably for you.<br /><br />Tom Wolf wrote a very similar work which was all about having rotten friends and the parallel excesses of a much more contemporary period, if you're interested: [[ASIN:0553381342 The Bonfire of the Vanities]]	2007-12-14

And it is a touch boring.  But other than that it's a great book, especially considering that the author was only 29 years old when it was published.  It flawlessly captures the excesses of the roaring 1920s in the Hamptons of Long Island, through a group of characters who are each distinct and not easy to forget.  The description of the wasteland surrounding the shop of the mechanic, George Wilson, is a very interesting way to contrast the lavishness of the Hamptons.  And there actually is a fair amount of action in the plot that intensifies the psychological aspects of the story.

I know you've heard it before: allow me to join in praising it.<br />The first thing I'd like to point out is Fitzgerald's brilliant use of symbolism. The cars, the colors, various characters' glasses... these aren't just trivial things, you know. Pay close attention to them.<br />Anyway, the next thing I'd like to discuss is the character of Gatsby himself. A very intriguing figure. In fact, he's a bit of an enigma to me in that I have no definite opinion on whether or not I admire him. My opinion on the other characters is clear-cut (I mostly dislike them, other than Nick - which I believe was Fitzgerald's intention, to portray the rich as shallow and irresponsible - another thing that comes off brilliantly). But Gatsby... I'm not sure on Gatsby. I have to salute him for sticking with his dream for so long, in spite of its hopelessness, but the ends of said dream would have resulted in disaster for all parties involved, and his motives would be questionable. Gatsby is charismatic, well-read, determined, and intelligent; he is also greedy, self-absorbed, and stuck in the past. In other words, very human. And that's the most intriguing part of his character: when the end comes, I am unsure whether or not I feel Gatsby deserved his fate. Something to ponder. I like books that make me think deeply, and this is one of them.<br />As for Fitzgerald's language, let us say he has total mastery over it. I knew he was a phenomenal writer from reading a collection of his short stories before I picked up Gatsby, but nothing could prepare me for what this book would present. Fitzgerald was a very, very talented writer, and there's a fine reason why he is widely considered one of the best. Books don't get much better.<br />As an attack on the fast, hard lifestyles of the wealthy (something Fitzgerald himself knew a lot about), and as a meditation on how time's passage can ruin lives, this is equally brilliant. Easily one of the best books I've ever read. Every character is fully fleshed out, even seemingly (but only seemingly!) trivial characters like Old Owl Eyes; the symbolism is perfect, the language is stunning, and the book is just the right length. I can think of no criticisms.best books I've ever read.

US	13586941	REP5KPLVBEX9V	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Fantastic	Most classics fall into one of two traps. The first: thick, tedious prose, tiny font, 800 pages of 18th, 19th century drama. The second: a theme so blatant it sits beating the reader on the head, neglecting the fact that stories still have things called a story. Most fall into one of those two situations--thick or preachy.<br /><br />Not Gatsby. Oh no. Gatsby falls into neither classic trap. You can read it in a day and enjoy yourself doing it. Actually, you can read it in a few hours and enjoy yourself just as much as if you were rereading The Hobbit or Harry Potter. Then, once you've finished, you look back and see, to your wonderment, how powerful and deep The Great Gatsby really is.<br /><br />And that is only part of Fitzgerald's success.<br /><br />The entire work is highly precise. Every word has its reason for being there. None are wasted. The themes are embedded in precise locations so as not to jump out at the reader and consequently distract them from the story.<br /><br />Speaking of the story, Fitzgerald does what many classical novelists fail to do--tell one. Fitzgerald told a story about this man, Gatsby, who invented himself. As a result, he told a story about following dreams, and ambition, and living life, and viewing life, and carelessness. But he told the story about Gatsby, and the people around him, first.<br /><br />In that way, he avoided theme device, and plot devices, and made for an impeccable, enjoyable, thought-provoking read. Thus, five stars from me for the best classic I have ever read, The Great Gatsby.	2007-08-18

It seems that most times when books are assigned reading students are not always in a place where they can appreciate a novel. However, this true classic was one I could not put down! The language was brilliant and the characters well-developed and interesting.<br /><br />The story basically revolves around Daisy and Jay Gatsby, two people who met when they were very young at the close of WWI and fell in love. Unfortunately, Gatsby did not have the wealth that Daisy required for marriage and she married Tom Buchannan, a man obscenely wealthy - and spoiled to boot! Gatsby, rejected and heartbroken, invents himself anew and aquires the fortune he feels he needs to win Daisy. But he never acknowledges that time moves on and people change - and Daisy wasn't the woman he thought she was.<br /><br />None of the charcters in this book are very likeable, with the possible exception of the narrator. All are spoiled, rootless, careless, inconsiderate, and unconcerned with the consequences of their actions. Yet, all are tragic figures as well, and deeply unsettled.<br /><br />Reading through this novel, it is hard not to imagine F. Scott Fitzgerald isn't writing about himself or people he knew. It is hard not to place Zelda in the role of Daisy. And this makes the characters come to life in a huge way. It is so easy to become swept up in this story, to be on Long Island that summer in 1922, to be at the parties at Gatsby's house. A beautiful, tragic, and certainly classic novel!	2007-07-03

They both go over the interesting characters that at some point merge to become a conflicting story of right and wrong. Wait, isn't that the main storyline for almost all books. I guess they seemed more alike since I read them back to back. Well, The Great Gatsby did seem to be on the verge of all of the modern convienences of the 1920's. I wonder if changing cultures brings about different thoughts on the definition of a classic book. This book was a so-so read and wasn't real captivating.

When I read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" a few years ago I confess that I didn't really care for it very much.  This summer I gave it another chance, and I'm glad that I did because it has given me a whole new perspective on the classic novel.  Reading it as an eighteen-year old, I was annoyed by how the book seems to be a frivolous glimpse into the foibles of frivolous characters living in the fashionable society of 1920s New York.  Reading it as a twenty-five year old, however, made me catch on to what those seemingly frivolous characters are meant to represent and how their fates seem to make a bleak statement about the future of the American dream, and of society in general.  Other reviews have delved into Gatsby's themes pretty well, so I will spare you from yet another interpretation; what I will implore readers to do is this: for those of you who have disliked Gatsby in the past, give it another chance and look closer this time.  You might be surprised by what you see.  For those of you who are going to be reading Gatsby for the first time, soak it in - don't just give this book a distracted look-through at the beach.

The tragic story of Jay Gatsby exemplifies the flawed aspects of the American dream, warning readers even from modern day of the danger and sacrifice demanded from the pursuit of the American Dream. And because we are a growing society still pursuing financial success in most matters, the book applied and will apply in the near future.	2007-06-12

This story is completely tragic, as it explores the moral gaps between the old wealth, the new wealth, and the poverty.

A portrayal of the glamour and superficiality of the Roaring `20s, The Great Gatsby focuses on the tragic love story between millionaire Jay Gatsby and young beauty Daisy Buchanan. Narrated by Daisy's cousin, Nick Carraway, the first half of the tale traces Gatsby's past--how he met Daisy, left to serve overseas, and how she married harsh but practical Tom Buchanan in the meantime. The book traces this event as the inspiration for Gatsby's wealth: we witness his numerous, lavish parties thrown in vain attempt to attract the attention of Daisy, who lives in a different sector of New York. He resents the fact that Daisy feared marrying him due to his financial status. We learn that he obtains his money through shady means, thus underscoring the values of a goal-oriented society. Gatsby, with the help of Nick, is eventually reunited with Daisy, yet Tom grows suspicious of their close relationship, leading to Gatsby's tragic demise.<br /><br /> Throughout the novel, the reader sees the extravagance and excessiveness of Gatsby through his reckless lifestyle, yet as we look closer we see a certain emptiness pervading it. For example, although he lives in a gigantic mansion, only a few people live with him. At his funeral, only four people show up, and Daisy is not included in that number.<br /><br /> F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby in order to illustrate the American dream as a vain, empty journey without progress, exposing the tragic flaws of an achievement-oriented society. Fitzgerald is essentially criticizing society's tendency to concentrate on the goals, rather than the new experiences and learning we ought to gain from the journey. Thus, he asserts that the entire point of the American dream--freedom, individualism, and the pursuit of happiness--has been lost to the new cynicism, extravagance, and greed that now characterize it. Gatsby, though a seemingly friendly and gracious individual, undergoes his downfall due to his lack of integrity in his pursuit of wealth.<br /><br /> We can see that The Great Gatsby mirrors Fitzgerald's own tragic love story with his lover, Zelda. In his state of disillusionment after losing Zelda, Fitzgerald wrote the book in order to emphasize the decline of the American dream; Gatsby's willingness to cheat and swindle his way to riches marks a shift in the American dream in the 1920s from integrity and individualism to extravagance and greed. Though he tried to hide his past from Daisy, it eventually caught up to him, establishing another of the book's themes: the inescapability of the past.<br /><br /> Although this novel does not make for the most entertaining or action-packed read, I completely recommend it to everyone. The characters, in truth, are not at all likeable, yet this is exactly what Fitzgerald was aiming for: flawed individuals. From first-hand accounts, he has tremendous insight into the faults of humans in a goal-oriented society. There is also abundant symbolism, allowing for a very in-depth analysis of the novel's purposes.

Perhaps not as significantly in recent years, but it is still an important facet of our culture. It is the idea that everyone and anyone can attain prosperity and wealth in this country, even if you are penniless. This dream, however, does not hold as validity as it used to. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald sharply criticizes a materialistic society by juxtaposing the lavish lifestyle of Gatsby and the more commonplace existence of the character of Nick, illustrating the decline of the American Dream.<br /><br />Along with his current extravagant living arrangements, Gatsby's original rise to fortune also contributes to Fitzgerald's social criticism. Gatsby is first introduced as what may seem to be the paragon of American prosperity--living in complete and utter opulence. However, as the novel progresses, it is revealed that Gatsby, in an attempt to win the heart of Daisy, had become prosperous by bootlegging alcohol and by trading stolen securities. Prosperity is the epitome of what the American Dream can amount to, and, while most accomplish their objectives through hard work and integrity, Gatsby illegally finds his way around to immediately gain that elite status. Fitzgerald illustrates Gatsby's illegal rise to fortune as a reflection of the American mindset of that time, sharply criticizing society of cheating its way towards fortune. Nick advocates Fitzgerald's beliefs of American society through his judgment of the higher class. Nick is always the bystander of the social scene, as he is Gatsby's neighbor and watches the festivities from his own home, suggesting him to be more of the everyman than the decorated man. It is Nick who notices the socialites are ruthless in their undertakings to attain fortune, and it is also Nick who criticizes them for it, asserting that it is their doing that the American Dream has diminished in integrity. Gatsby and Nick both characterize the common American mindset of the 1920s. Where Gatsby is depicted as the end result, however, Nick is more of the everyman who judges socialites for their lavish behavior and ultimately exposes the decline in the integrity of the American Dream.<br /><br />F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is often dubbed as the great American novel and has been considered a classic for many generations. After reading it, I can surely see why. Many of the books that we are required to read for school are easily dull and hard to interpret. The Great Gatsby, however, is an interesting read and more importantly, it is interesting to read again and again. While it can easily be deemed a period piece, reflecting upon 1920s society, the major theme of the novel can greatly be relevant to today's materialistic culture.

Gatsby believed that by becoming rich he could solve all his problems, but that only made him more somber with his already tainted life.<br /><br />Gatsby had been living a tough life of rejection and decided to turn to the one thing he thought would help--money--and poured his life's ambitions into procuring that. He became so dependent on this solution that he would go to any means necessary to become rich. Gatsby would devote the next five years of his life to cheating and scheming his way to the top. He began illegal drug sales to generate more profit. His riches were gained by no honest means and represent a life of lying and shortcuts. That is no way to go about happiness. Happiness can only be achieved if one actually makes it for themselves. They cannot rely on material possessions to create that for them. Being truly happy takes effort, and that is something Gatsby does not know how to give. Taking the easy way out will never lead to any blissful ending.<br /><br />Gatsby has to learn that lesson the hard way as his riches begin to worsen his life, not better it, and people take advantage of him and only want him for his money. Gatsby feels lonely in this world as he begins his new life as an elite \\"business man\\" so he invites people over to his house to enjoy his money with him. He soon realizes that spending time and money on strangers does not make him any better off than before his riches. His money can only make others happy, not himself. Those people who he begins to believe are his friends do not care about him in the least bit; they only want him so that they can enjoy the same luxuries as he does. These people that spend all hours of the night at Gatsby's house do not appreciate him enough to come to his own funeral. No one cares about him except his father and neighbor. Having money does not make Gatsby happy and it will not make any one else happy.

I'm sure at one point in the history of American Literature this could have been seen as a clever and biting indictment of the upper crust of society, but reading it in 2007 exposes it as only another variety of the boring 19th century society fiction in the same vein as Austen, Bronte, etc.	2007-06-07

It is a book history buffs might enjoy as much as those seeking simple entertainment, because [[ASIN:1570034559 Fitzgerald]] set out to write a story of the times in which he lived--The Roaring Twenties. Accuracy in contemporaneous fiction is challenging, because historical elements were included, such as the World Series debacle of 1919, and everyone's a critic!<br /><br />Fitzgerald sought to make it an extraordinary work, only part of which he accomplished by sketching a larger than life character, Jay Gatsby. Fitzgerald's first novel was published when he was only 24, still wet with a commitment to excellence that is available only to the young--not that more mature souls aren't allowed excellence, but no one has it in his or her own mind as much as those who've been less knocked about by sorrow, misfortune or tedium.<br /><br />\\"The Authorized Text\\" adds to the pleasure of reading, because [[ASIN:1570031444 Bruccoli]] presents some of Fitzgerald's own words on the novel as well as on writing in general, such as \\"An author ought to write for the youth of his generation, the critics of the next, and the schoolmasters of ever afterward.\\" Two out of three isn't bad. The youth of his generation were too busy living the life Fitzgerald described to be bothered with reading about it.<br /><br />This version also opens a peephole to common paperback publishing by tracing some of the errors that crept into the work over time. Corrections were made by comparing various editions to the galleys, which contained Fitzgerald's hand-written edits and rewrites, some of them notably more difficult to decipher than others, yet vast improvements to an already splendid tale.<br /><br />Finally, two more points stand out from reading this authorized edition. Fitzgerald's editor, Maxwell Perkins (Scribners), absolutely gushed over the manuscript, [[ASIN:0684815621 \\"I think the novel is a wonder.\\"]] As effusive as Perkins was, he was not totally so. \\"You are right in feeling there is a certain slight sagging in chapters six and seven...\\" and \\"Gatsby is somewhat vague.\\" Perkins went on for pages about Fitzgerald's treatment of Gatsby and his wealth, simultaneously accusing the author of saying too little and too much. Bruccoli calls Perkins a genius, so his critique may in fact be brilliant. Even so, they're both talking about the greatest book of one of the greatest writers of all time. All writers should take heart. [[ASIN:0684815621 The ONLY THING THAT COUNTS: The Ernest Hemingway/Maxwell Perkins Correspondence]]<br /><br />Gatsby was a legend in his time. Only in his own mind? He did, after all, make himself up as Fitzgerald squeezed him out of his pen. And part of the greatness lies somewhere between knowing what is true and what we only wish were so. In Fitzgerald's own words, \\"That's the whole burden of this novel--the loss of those illusions that give such color to the world so that you don't care whether things are true or false as long as they partake of the magical glory.\\"<br /><br />For me, \\"the magical glory\\" showed itself by racing me to the next page, though I wanted to linger over the words, and then too soon I finished the race, and there was no more Great Gatsby to read.

Scott Fitzgerald was an important novelistic voice of the Jazz Age in post World War I America. Certainly nobody has chronicled the end of the age of American innocence signaled by the Jazz Age better than Fitzgerald.<br /><br />Fitzgerald certainly was not the only voice of that age but the voice that best exemplified the tensions between the mores of `old wealth' and the emerging sources of `new wealth' that were produced by the huge amount of money available, mainly through government contracts,  as result of the war or riches gained through the illegal liquor trade. That is the sociological underpinning that drives Fitzgerald's work.<br /><br />There is no better example of those tensions than Jay Gatsby.  If nothing else it is a dramatic enactment of the strivings of the new money to `make it' in the world of high society, one way or another. And what better way to do that than in the age old tradition of buying one's way into that society through marriage. This is the modern American version of that story.<br /><br />And the story itself? One Jay Gatsby, the former Jimmy Ganz, freshly reinventing himself after indeterminate service in the American military in World War I  and loaded with cash from questionable financial resources, attempts to win, or rather re-win the affections of one Daisy Buchanan his vision of the perfect life companion and exemplar of the `old money' crowd that he wishes to crash. One little complication, however, gets in the way. She has found herself married to a brutish but very wealthy member of that `old money' crowd. Gatsby's lavish but fumbling attempts to lure her away from the high society of Long Island, then the summer watering hole of the `old money', forms the core of the story.<br /><br />Gatsby's trial and tribulations on the way as narrated by Nick Carroway (and Gatsby's somewhat unwitting accomplice in the Daisy matter) keeps the story line going until the final deadly ending. The morale- the very rich are indeed very different from you or I. Moreover, someone else will always have to pick up the messes they have made for themselves. They merely move on.  This may serve as a cautionary tale for that time and possibly today.<br /><br />A word on literary merits. According to the inevitable changes in literary fashion as well as literary politics Fitzgerald, for long a leading figure in the canon of American literature, has been somewhat eclipsed by other more post-modernist trends. While I firmly believe that the Western canon is in dire need of expansion to include `third world', woman and minority voices Fitzgerald's literary merits stand on their own. His tightly- crafted story line, his sense of language and the flat-out fact that that he knew the subject matter that formed the basis of his expositions merit renewed consideration by today's reader.<br /><br />Simply put, if you want to understand part of what was going on in America in the 1920's before the Great Crash of 1929 then you simply have to read the man. If nothing else read the last few pages of Gatsby. If there is a better literary expression of the promise of America as seem by the early Dutch settlers of New York as the last best hope of civilization and the failure of that promise at the hands of the `robber barons' and their descendents I have not read it.very rich are indeed very different from you or I.

Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) lived fast, achieved success early, and then descended into a ferocious alcoholism from which he never emerged.  His literary star was already in decline when he published THE GREAT GATSBY in 1925.  Although the book had admirers, critical reception was lukewarm and public interest was virtually nonexistent.  At the time of his death Fitzgerald and his works were regarded as trivial relics of an era noted for its superficiality; it would not be until the late 1940s that both critics and readers began to re-discover and re-assess them.<br /><br />THE GREAT GATSBY has often been described as \\"the great American novel.\\"  In some ways this is unfortunate, for it has resulted in the academic world's force-feeding of the novel to exactly those least likely to have any appreciation of the work: high school and college students, who most often lack the maturity required to grasp the nature of the work.  It is short but remarkably complex and requires skills of critical analysis that seldom arrive short of thirty years experience.<br /><br />On the surface the story is not unique.  Nick Carraway, a well-to-do young man from the midwest, has come to New York to learn the bond business.  He takes a small house and afterward discovers that his cousin Daisy, now married to Tom Bucchanan, lives directly across the bay.  A visit to their luxurious home introduces Nick to professional golfer Jordan Baker, an attractive woman in which Nick is soon interested; it also alerts him to the fact that Daisy is disillusioned in her marriage to Tom, who for all his wealth and social status is limited in his views of the world and more than a little brutish in his habits.<br /><br />Nick is only casually interested in Daisy, Tom, and Jordan, but he is soon propelled into constant contact with all three through his own neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a mysterious yet charismatic man whose chief occupation seems to be staging parties.  After some little time, Nick learns that Gatsby knew Daisy before her marriage, and indeed his parties are set forth as bait, an attempt to lure Tom and Daisy to his home on the less fashionable side of the bay.  For Gatsby loves Daisy, and his memory of their romance has propelled him to fame and riches, all in an attempt to bring her to his side.  Through Nick, Gatsby arranges to meet Daisy once more, and the lost love blooms anew.<br /><br />Or does it?  THE GREAT GATSBY never allows us entry into Daisy as a person; we are never privy to her thoughts but are instead required to see her through the eyes of those around her, and the way in which we read her changes according to the people and circumstances involved.  As the novel climaxes Nick and Gatsby and we ourselves do at last understand both her and Tom and the others of their kind, but the understanding comes too late to avert the three deaths and profound disillusionment that conclude the book.<br /><br />Like most great novels, THE GREAT GATSBY is about a great many things, but it is perhaps most particularly about America's drift into a terrible sort of materialism in which human beings become less valued for their humanity than for what--and in a very real sense--who they own.  Almost everything the characters of the novel do, say, or plan is done \\"for show.\\"  Gatsby's parties and his car, Jordan's golf competitions, Tom's mistress, Daisy's child, Nick's job are masks that conceal the screaming emptiness of a world in which what you have has become more important than who you are.  \\"What shall we do with ourselves this afternoon?\\" Daisy asks at one point in the novel.  \\"And the day after that, and the next thirty years?\\"  Who would you be if you had only yourself?  Would you still be what your possessions seemed to indicate--or would you be a different person, perhaps better or perhaps worse?<br /><br />Although THE GREAT GATSBY has always been admired for the cool, languid beauty of Fitzgerald's language, many felt the core statements of the novel were rendered largely irrelevant by the Great Depression and World War II.  But like Gatsby's memories, which he himself cannot lay to rest, the book has a way of resurfacing in our minds in a remarkably disquieting sort of way, again and again with each generation.  The great literary diamond of the Deco age still glitters, and it does so all the more in the face of the \\"on demand\\" confused consumerism that has arisen in the internet age.  We know it should not be like this, and we wish it were not so, but we expect someone else to deal with it--or, as Fitzgerald writes with such profound clarity near the end of the novel, we, in this most American of American novels, are a people prone to smashing up things and creatures and then retreating back into our money and vast carelessness.  We prefer to let other people clean up the mess we have made.<br /><br />A brilliant work.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewertements of the novel were rendered largely irrelevant by the Great Depression and World War II.

One part trenchant social commentary, one part Dominick Dunne-like pot boiler, it's a rich, creamy, yet damning work you can savor page after page, perhaps the most taut piece of fiction ever written. Five Stars for language.<br /><br />The expositions on past as shaky prologue to future and of holding onto dreams too long until they inevitably go up in smoke, of materialism and greed, of class and of postwar disillusion - we've seen these elsewhere, sometimes told better.<br /><br />Fitzgerald's close seems an overly harsh indictment of The American Dream, obviously forged from the many unsympathetic characters of his story and the zeitgeist of the period. It does little to suggest that those who eschew the excesses that litter the landscape of Gatsby's world may be able to successfully build on their pasts and create a successful future - meeting and marrying a spouse grounded in Midwestern virtues, raising well-adjusted children, finding more intrinsic value in honest work, and for the most part looking back on their past with general contentedness.<br /><br />Five stars for exquisite storytelling; four stars for a period piece about classism and excess that will exist as long as civilization does.	2007-04-01

It's got romance, suspense, wit, humor, and of course, the story's not over until someone dies fighting for love. The Great Gatsby really is a page turner. In fact, I became so absorbed into the book that I would not realize that an hour has gone by before my eyes. yes, it's THAT good.<br /><br />The story is simple, really. A man from humble beginnings, Gatsby, meets his wealthy mentor, and when he dies, Gatsby inherits his fortune. He then goes south and meets a southern debutante, Daisy, from a prominent southern family, and they fall in love. Gatsby is then called off to war, during which time Daisy goes off and marries Tom. That's all the background you need to know, since revealing any more would spoil the delightfully disturbing ending for you.<br /><br />This novel truly personifies one man's quest for the American Dream, even if it is a bit obsessive complusive. Hats off to Fitzgerald for doing such a thorough job of exploring the depths of each character and making them all relate in the end. His unique writing style, including numerous repetitions of symbols, is what adds to his flare. For those of us who are a bit impatient, don't worry, this is perfect for you. Fitzgerald explores all the aspects of a major storyline with as few words as possible, allowing the characters to speak for themselves. As you read this, you can almost picture the motion picture that it would make, thus making the book simply that much better to read.<br /><br />i would recommend this book to anyone who is literate.	2007-03-30

Yes, sit down with a blank sheet of paper, and a box of crayons and sketch the following scenes: chapter one when Daisy and Jordan are sitting among the French windows, chapter two with the description of the Valley of the Ashes, and chapter three with the description of Gatsby's house.  As you read continue to notice the way that colors and sunlight play a dominate role in the book.<br /><br />Third, read chapter 7 in one stretch and if possible assign roles to each speaker.  I argue that this chapter is pretty much self-contained and could be considered a novella within the novel.  There is more action, irony, and plain literary fun in these 50 odd pages than most longer novels.<br /><br />Fourth, if you still don't get the novel, AND if you are being forced to read this book for high school English, pick it up again once you turn 30 and have had life jade you a bit.  I, too, didn't really get it until I hit 30 and could identify with Nick's thinning hair and ever diminishing list of single men to hang out with as we all speed onward towards death in the cooling twilight.	2007-03-20

Fitzgerald's prose is flawless, arrestingly beautiful at times.  This may be a quick, easy read (fewer than 200 pages) but don't be fooled - despite its relatively thin binding, there is a lot going on in The Great Gatsby.  This is a complex and tragic novel, ripe with irony.<br /><br />I was surprised to find relatively few reviews posted for this novel (which is widely considered one of the best novels -if not THE best novel- of the 20th Century).  I suspect the fact that the novel is something of a `downer' has thwarted its mass appeal.  The Great Gatsby tells us that you can't recapture the past no matter how hard you try, that dreams and aspirations are doomed to failure, and that the morally bankrupt, self indulgent privileged class will inevitably prevail at the expense of others.<br /><br />Despite its grim message, the Great Gatsby is well worth reading (or re-reading if you were forced to read it in high school).  While it may not be the best novel of the 20th Century, it's still pretty great.	2007-02-08

I dismissed this novel back in high school as one of those indisputable books that safely sits above the reach of criticism-- a novel readers are obligated to admire because of its untouchable 'classic' status. As it turns out, it is a legitimate classic, and I consider it to be one of the best books I've ever read.<br /><br />I won't dispute the fact that Fitzgerald's racism sneaks into the novel, but we have to accept that the pseudoscientific basis for that racism was a part of the times (and an aristocratic trend to boot). Beneath that trivial detail there is a sea of worth to be gleaned from The Great Gatsby. It addresses a very human (and perennially American) desire to return to better and happier times of the past, and a feeling that very much embodies the 20s.<br /><br />The modern reader should have little trouble discerning the distasteful qualities (which appropriately only appear in Tom); racism certainly isn't condoned with any validity here. The same goes for other great American writers of the time like H.P. Lovecraft.<br /><br />So, give it a shot sometime when you aren't forced to appreciate it.	2007-02-07

Aside from being traditional bourgie literature about the convoluted drama of rich people and not-rich-enough people, it makes several displays of Fitzgerald's attendant racism; not only in his caricatures of blacks and Jews, but in his character Tom's discussion of the excellent \\"scientific\\" book he is reading, \\"The Rise of the Colored Empires\\" by  Goddard, a thinly veiled reference to \\"The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy\\" by Stoddard. One could dismiss this as Tom's racism and not a reflection of Fitzgerald if it were not for Fitzgerald's constant stereotyping of blacks as clowning, ill-spoken servants. One could add a taste for highly inappropriate adjectives such as \\"niggerish feet\\" and \\"noisy niggery street fairs\\" in his other works.<br /><br />One may ask, if this is a Great American Novel, which America are we speaking of? Certainly, Fitzgerald's sentiments were shared by many people in his time, but I would like to think that we are progressing as a nation. We should be able to acknowledge both the literary merits of this novel (although I, myself, am hard-pressed to find them) and it's place in a long history of literature steeped in subtle and not-so-subtle white supremacy.	2007-02-02

The second read, in my early twenties, was magic -- I drank it in a night, awed by the grace of the language, and particularly swept up in the sad romance of it: gauche, hopeful Jay Gatsby, arms and dreams wide as he stared across the Sound at the green light at the end of Daisy's dock.<br /><br />This third time was the best, the purest, and if you haven't read it for a while, I urge you to pick it up again. It's truly a masterpiece, painting the whole American mess in vivid colors and flawless perspective without wasting a stroke. The best part, the deftest, is that Fitzgerald makes everyone culpable, from philandering elitist Tom Buchanan to passive narrator Nick Carraway.

Perhaps its greatest strength lies in the sheer magic of the writing. Fitzgerald spins sentences of such wonder, such clarity and honesty, that we are left to do nothing else but shake our head in amazement. Jay Gatsby may be a great mystery, he may be the Great American Dream personified, but if he sparkles, then the novel itself shines.<br /><br />Nick Carraway has decided, at twenty-nine to 'go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man.' By chance, he finds a cheap house, a 'weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month' that is nestled amongst the huge mansions of the rich. He doesn't know it to begin with, but he is neighbours with Jay Gatsby, The Great Gatsby.<br /><br />Gatsby holds parties on the weekends, grand affairs of cocktails and party dresses, his house filled to the rafters with people, some invited, most not. He is endlessly hospitable, allowing his alcohol to be drunk, his food to be consumed, his pool, his books, his home - they are open to his guests. Guests, not friends.<br /><br />He is a mystery. Nobody knows why he has these parties, though everyone attends. Just as nobody knows how he made his money, or who he really is. Gatsby, when he enters Nick's world, refers to him and everyone as 'old sport', a distancing technique that is prevalent throughout the novel. 'It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.'<br /><br />But he is not completely unknowable, though the romantic beliefs about him are accurately held. No, Gatsby is more and less than the stories that surround him. He is in love, his mansion lies directly across from that of Nick's cousin, Daisy, an old flame he cannot let go. At her jetty a green light winks across the water, and it is this that Gatsby watches on lonely nights, nights which are filled with people who mean nothing, or nights he spends alone.<br /><br />Gatsby is mysterious and alluring while he remains unknown. When his love for Daisy is revealed, he becomes more known and less ethereal, his character growing from an enigma into a person. It adds warmth and humility to his personality, and is something beautiful. 'He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths - so that he could 'come over' some afternoon to a stranger's garden.'<br /><br />But it is when Daisy 'becomes his' that Gatsby's character loses its shine and lowers to the ground. He is now a normal man, with the same strengths and weaknesses as everyone else. Perhaps there are more weaknesses - it is hard to consider cuckolding Tom Buchanan an admirable quality. Gatsby represents the dull, ordinary routine of a dream realised, that failed glow of actualised fantasy.<br /><br />Nick's presence in the story has its own plot, but it runs adjacent to Gatsby. Perhaps Fitzgerald's greatest inspiration was to make Nick a 'supposer', to remove Gatsby from the immediacy of intimate narration and make him the refracted imaginings of Nick. 'I am one of the few honest people I have ever known', Nick says of himself. But Gatsby isn't honest, so how can an honest man understand someone's whose life is built on fantasy and deceit? More importantly, can an honest man understand someone who exists - has created himself - out of a love that has fallen into the past? He can't, which is what makes Gatsby, and Nick, so interesting.<br /><br />Gatsby's love lies in the past. Fitzgerald refrains from sentimentalizing Gatsby as a younger man, but it is evident from the text that the sadness of his - our? - lives comes from an unwillingness to leave the past and live for today, or better yet, the future. Gatsby is sad and melancholy, a friendless man who wants a friend, an unloved man who wants to be loved. But can a man who only looks backward expect love or friendship in people that necessarily live in the now? He can expect it, but it won't happen. Romantic, yes. Fulfilled, never.<br /><br />Fitzgerald's writing is beautiful, both understated and grandiose, mellifluous in its gentle rhythms. 'On the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.'<br /><br />It is worth noting the quality of Tony Tanner's introduction in the Penguin Classic edition. He goes to some length to show that part of what makes The Great Gatsby such 'A classic, perhaps the supreme American novel' is what Fitzgerald cut out of the piece, not so much what he left in. He analyses passages in the first draft and their remains in the completed piece - it becomes clear that Gatsby can survive only as a mystery, with as little exposition as possible. So many times, what Fitzgerald cut was explanatory dialogue or comments from Gatsby, which would have dramatically weakened the piece. We cannot and should not know Gatsby, even when he becomes 'known' and explained by the text. He must remain a cipher, such that we can impress upon his impressionable facade anything at all that we wish. I say facade, because we cannot probe deeper into what Gatsby is. The Great American dream? Perhaps - but what is he, even with that?

It was much better reading it as an adult, as one generally has a much better perspective on answering/understanding concepts of lust vs. love, desire/drive for material aquisitions and what importance it has in life.  There are multitudes of discussion questions regarding this novel available on the internet, worth considering. I believe that our club's discussion of this book offered many different opinions, making it one our more intersting ones.  Also, worth reading about F. Scott Fitzgerald's biography and seeing parallelisms between his life and the story. The book is relatively a quick read and maintains your interest.

It's our Manifest Destiny. Gatsby knew that then. And, we know it now.<br /><br />Much like today, in the America of 1925 all things were possible. The country, having only recently been born yet again following its latest Baptism of Fire, was in its second or third childhood. As in previous reincarnations, progress was fast. The USA was now the most powerful country in the world. Women could vote. Negroes were driving their own cars. Radio, much like the printing press before it and the Internet after it, was providing access to whole new classes of people. Farmers in Iowa.  Pennsylvania Coal Miners. Cowboys. Truckers. They all wanted their piece of the pie. And the pie was growing like wildfire. The stock market was setting record highs on a daily basis. Fully a third of the population was new immigrants. Joe Kennedy, the son of an Irish immigrant, was making his fortune running scotch into the US through Canada. Italian immigrant, Al Capone was getting even richer selling bootleg booze made right here in the good old USA. These newcomers proved that it was possible to get rich overnight. If they could do it, anyone could do it. Why, a poor man could even aspire to becoming president of the USA. Old Abe proved it was possible. In America, a man like Gatsby, if he had enough money, could even win over a Daisy Buchanan. It was possible.	2006-11-24

Gatsby fell in love with Daisy, a wealthy young woman, when he was placed at Louisiana as a soldier. However, due to his poorness, he let Daisy go. Gatsby does not give up on her and becomes rich through the job of bootlegging. Knowing that Daisy lives at East Egg, Gatsby moves to West Egg where he can watch her without suspicion. However, Daisy is married to a wealthy guy named Tom Buchanon. Still, Gatsby holds party every Saturday, hoping someday Daisy will come to the party and realize Gatsby's wealth. He gets the chance when Nick, the narrator of the story, moves next door to him. Nick is the cousin of Daisy. By acquainting Nick and doing favors to him, Gatsby is able to meet Daisy through Nick. Daisy, impressed by Gatsby's success, falls in love with him again. However, as Tom finds out about this affair, a dilemma occurs. Fitzgerald illustrates through this book that while people seek wealth as the only route to gaining one's desires, wealth ironically destroys the portals to happiness. The plot of the book is easy to follow, and Fitzgerald effectively portrays the corrupt side of 1920s, when the Unites States was prospering and everything seemed to be perfect.	2006-11-07

Scott Fitzgerald explores the perils of optimism in The Great Gatsby, which points out that although optimism sustains one's drive for life, the hope of a bright future may be devastating as it often requires the need to revive one's past, a difficult task that often generates misery when one's memories cannot be recreated. Fitzgerald portrays this message through America's famous Jazz Age set in the 1920's, as Jay Gatsby, a self-made man, rises from poverty to become one of the richest men in a fabricated town, West Egg. Despite his new role in society, Gatsby fails to achieve the only dream he has- regaining his ex-lover, Daisy Buchanan's love. Despite the two lovers' past intimate relationship, Daisy represents society's artificiality as she dismisses Gatsby's love to retain her husband, Tom, and cling onto Tom's noble name. This allows her to automatically achieve a protective seal of respect in society, which comes with Tom's last name, and therefore, does not need to be earned through hard work. Gatsby's tragic ending symbolizes not only the frailty of America's desire for true happiness and social equality, as seen through the fact that even Gatsby's wealth cannot overcome society's critical view of his poor roots. Fitzgerald thus explores the deep meaning of life and society through his creation of Great Gatsby, a man great only because of his rise from poverty, but tragic and pathetic to the noble, who accept only those with \\"royal blood.\\" The Great Gatsby is a timeless literary achievement because of its skillful and universal observation of human nature, but may prove to be depressing to those who enjoy comedy and \\"happily ever after\\" endings, as Gatsby ends up being far from normal people's view of \\"great\\".	2006-11-07

Scott Fitzgerald expresses his idea of being great as Nick Carraway arrives to the West Egg to experience the new life in the city. After adapting to this new world, Nick is acquainted with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan; his cousin's husband, Tom Buchanan and his cousin's friend, Jordan Baker. Nick quickly realizes that his new acquaintances have been negatively influenced by wealth. Then Nick is introduced to the extremely wealthy, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby had already shown signs of generosity as he gladly accepted anyone to his elaborate parties. Gatsby was a mysterious, yet composed man which appealed to Nick. Nick felt safe around Gatsby and grows close to him, only to be caught in between a love conflict characterized with dishonesty, disloyalty, and overall debauchery. The events that follow all lead downhill as it eventually results to violence. The reader witnesses the human corruption in The Great Gatsby as Fitzgerald effectively warns the reader of the doomed outcome that results to those who rapaciously seek money. The characteristics between the country life and city life are distinguished by Fitzgerald as Nick journeys from the comfortable country to the rapid pace city life and eventually illustrates that to be considered \\"Great\\" is to focus on a certain goal rather than being distracted by greed of wealth. During Nick's time living the fast life of the city, Fitzgerald not only warns the readers, but the readers are also able to observe the attributes that make a \\"Great\\" man.	2006-11-07

Glasses click gently together, while men in black ties and women in luxurious dresses drown away life's problem under the elaborate mansion. In the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the story depicts the Jazz Age in the 1920s, while it revolves around the drama in the East and West Egg Village. Jay Gatsby, a self-made man, is hopelessly enchanted by the beautiful and married, Daisy Buchanan. Holding on to bittersweet memories, Gatsby hopes to rekindle the flame between them five years ago. As he desperately holds on to a lost dream, corruption and deception wiggles into the life of the upper classes.<br /><br /> Set in the 1920s, Fitzgerald gives the reader a deeper understanding of the conditions and fast paced lifestyle of the Jazz Age. In a descriptive and easy to read manner, he guides the reader that one can have everything in the world, but true happiness lies within things that are not tangible. Masterfully Fitzgerald displays this through Jay Gatsby, whose obsession and only happiness lies blindly with the conceited Daisy. Without holding back, Fitzgerald explains the flawed nature that exists in every human being rich or poor. The story is filled with symbolism and unique imagery of the glamorous Jazz Age. The Great Gatsby is an instant classic and respectable piece of literature because of its refreshing viewpoint about the flawed American Dream, which illusion and chaos spur from.	2006-11-06

Fitzgerald paints really amazing pictures with his words.<br /><br />However, this book was much more powerful when I read it again as an adult. For me, the theme of the book was that you can't escape your past, and you have to be careful what you wish for in your future. It really drives home the point that you can't depend on other people for your happiness. You just don't know when one of those solid people that you trust turns out to be one of the shallow people instead.<br /><br />This book is a tragedy, and it seems more powerful than the Greek tragedies I've read. In Greek tragedy, so much of what happens seems to happen as a whim of the gods and there is nothing anyone can do to escape their fate. Fate takes control for Gatsby, but he doesn't have the gods to blame. It makes it a much more tragic story.<br /><br />I strongly recommend reading this book, even if (or maybe especially if) you've read it before. It's a much more powerful book to read once you've been in the position to have lost some of your dreams, to see the shallowness of the real world outside of high school or college.	2006-11-05

He was \\"great\\" only in a delusive sense.  Thus the title of Fitzgerald's celebrated novel is ironic, and that is something to keep in mind when reading it.<br /><br />But Gatsby is seen as a step above the tony East Egg society that lived in their plush estates across the Long Island sound from his nouveau riche mansion--at least that is the revelation that narrator Nick Carraway eventually comes to as we learn from his famous line, \\"They're a rotten crowd.  You're worth the whole dam bunch put together.\\"<br /><br />It is ironic and proper that Daisy Buchanan, the wispy, languid and privileged beauty escapes blame for the tragedy near the end of the novel.  It is her class that had always escaped blame, that had always lived on in its narrow-minded, greedy luxury.  We can see their class--the Buchanans and their crowd--as Eloi-like children of the robber barons. Although Gatsby was dishonest and a criminal at least he had some gumption.  And in the end we see he had some sense of integrity and courage as well.<br /><br />He is \\"great\\" then as compared to the listless, privileged people who had inherited much of the vast wealth that this young nation had accumulated during the westward expansion following the Civil War.  Gatsby's failing and the failure in general of the rich was that they knew not what to do with their leisure and privilege.  Gatsby threw lavish parties and affected an air of mystery while the Buchanans indulged in racist and class war philosophies while they pursued adulterous affairs and the mind-numbing qualities of drunkenness.<br /><br />When I first read this as a young man I thought it was a rather mediocre novel.  The infidelities that so drove the story were commonplace to me at a time past mid-century, and I really missed the deep irony that Fitzgerald intended.  The Great Gatsby was not \\"great,\\" that much was obvious; but that he was great relative to the Buchanan crowd was what I missed.  He serves not only as the \\"up from poverty\\" character so often seen in Jazz Age and depression novels, but he is a more deeply realized character.  Not a brutal man like most bootleg operatives, instead he is almost a dilettante bootlegger, yet a hugely successful one, so much so that hardly any of the details of his business now occupy him; indeed one of the reasons that I mistook his character upon a first reading is that the actual reality of the lifestyle of those who fed the speakeasies is not in the novel.  Fitzgerald was more interested in the social life of the degenerates and how they looked upon social climbers like Jay Gatsby.<br /><br />Nick the modest narrator is in-between.  An educated man of the upper middle class, a graduate of Yale, he represents the objectifying device in the novel.  We see everything through his eyes and through his sensibilities.  Initially in ambivalent admiration of both his cousin Daisy and Gatsby, Nick eventually becomes disillusioned with their differing but shallow lifestyles and their shallow values while he comes to realize that while Gatsby is a cut above, he is still a man with a tragically limited vision.<br /><br />In short, The Great Gatsby is an indictment of the Jazz Age and its easy money mentality with attendant moral corruption.  Perhaps this is why it did not sell well when it was published in 1925--the jazz agers were not interested in self-portraits--but now has become a stable of American literature, and certainly Fitzgerald's most read and most celebrated novel.<br /><br />Fitzgerald the man may have borne witness to the excesses of the Roaring Twenties but he did not learn its lessons.

Fitzgerald produced by this publisher; the other three being The Last Tycoon, This Side of Paradise, and Tender is the Night.  The Great Gatsby is of course, the most famous of them all, and probably one of the most famous novels of American literature.  Written before the economic growth post WWII brought riches to everyone, this book provided the American masses an in-depth glimpse of the lives and loves of the rich and famous.  The book here revolves around Nick, his friend Jay Gatsby, the love of Gatsby's life, Daisy, and her shallow husband Tom.  Gatsby rose from poverty to become incredibly rich thru means both scrupolous and not, and then spends his thoughts and energies pining after the beautiful Daisy.  Every aspect of his life is devoted to enriching himself and/or his stature in the Long Island community he has transplanted himself into.  All for naught are his efforts as the book ends.<br /><br />This book did not begin that American literary genre of books that critique the rich, but coming out at a similar time as Veblein's \\"Theory of the Leisure Class\\" this book is the perfect fictional complement to Veblein's nonfiction account of the rich and their vices.  Here, in these pages we see the sins of alcoholism, adultery, pride, arrogance, jealousy, shallowness, and irresponsibility that are allowed by a wealthy lifestyle where much idle time allows for many dishonest thoughts.  At first unpopular, this book eventually became the mainstay of classrooms that it now is.  Hollywood and modern American literature has mimicked the themes and often storylines of this novel; think soap operas, the Kennedys, and Danielle Steele novels.  Overall, the book is a classic, worth reading and having, though it does not get this reviewer's vote as the best book of American literature.	2006-09-26

Scott Fitzgerald (1896 to 1940).  It takes place during \\"The Jazz Age,\\" a term Fitzgerald actually coined.  This period of the early-to-mid-1920s \\"was an age of miracles...an age of art...an age of excess, and...an age of satire.\\"<br /><br />The novel is about Jay Gatsby (whose actual name was James Gatz), a newly wealthy Midwesterner-turned-Easterner who orders his life around one desire: to be reunited with Daisy Fay (she's now married and known as Daisy Buchanan), the love he lost five years earlier.  His quest for the American Dream leads him from poverty to wealth and then into the arms of his beloved.  By the end of the novel, we get to see the ugly side of the American Dream.<br /><br />There are many socially insightful themes evident in the story. Some include (1) wealth (a key theme), (2) superficiality and shallowness (3) selfishness (4) materialism (5) societal expectation (6) societal stratification (7) immorality and (8) appearances.<br /><br />Something else that this novel is known for is its \\"breathtaking lyricism.\\"  As a writer, Fitzgerald is very sensory-orientated.  Here is one small example of his fantastic writing found throughout the novel:<br /><br />\\"He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in a many-colored disarray.  While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple green and lavender and faint orange and monograms of Indian blue.  Suddenly with a strained sound Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.\\"<br /><br />This particular book includes other relevant information and insight about the novel and its author.  The most helpful for me were the \\"explanatory notes\\" that explained key terms in the novel.  Here is an example:<br /><br />\\"West Egg/East Egg: The fictionalized geography of [this novel] was based on the actual geography of Long Island and the borough of Queens.

The Great Gatsby is less than 200 pages long in most editions, yet it contains so much of Fitzgerald's outlook on the world around him. The novel's portrayal of the emptiness, brutality and meanness of the \\"Jazz Age\\" has made it one of the most famous English language books of the 20th century. It is so packed with ideas that every reviewer has a different opinion on the themes of the book, as well as the main point. The best thing is to read it for yourself, it only takes a few hours.<br /><br />Essentially the book is about a few meagre happenings narrated by Nick, an outsider to the world of upper class suburban New York. He encounters crime, infidelity, tragedy and an obsessive desire for keeping up pretences; but it is the deeper motivations of characters such as Gatsby, Tom and Daisy that are most fascinating.<br /><br />The book is very visual, possibly because the large number of movies about this era make it easy to visualise the settings in a rich manner. And although it has a sense of nostalgia for the past, I did not find myself nostalgic for the bygone era at all. Fitzgerald pulled one of the great nihilistic pieces of the century.	2006-08-07

Scott Fitzgerald's standard-setting Jazz Age novel since it was required reading for most of us in high school. However, if you come back to it as a full-fledged adult, you'll find that the story still resonates but more like a just-polished cameo piece from a forgotten time. At the core of the book is the elaborate infatuation Jay Gatsby has for Daisy Fay Buchanan, a love story portrayed with both a languid pall and a fatalistic urgency. But the broader context of the setting and the irreconcilable nature of the American dream in the 1920's is what give the novel its true gravitas.<br /><br />Much of this is eloquently articulated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's modest Long Island neighbor who becomes his most trusted confidante. Nick is responsible for reuniting the lovers who both have come to different points in their lives five years after their aborted romance. Now a solitary figure in his luxurious mansion, Gatsby is a newly wealthy man who accumulated his fortunes through dubious means. Daisy, on the other hand, has always led a life of privilege and could not let love stand in the way of her comfortable existence. She married Tom Buchanan for that sole purpose. With Gatsby's ambition spurred by his love for Daisy, he rekindles his romance with Daisy, as Tom carries on carelessly with an auto mechanic's grasping wife. Nick himself gets caught up in the jet set trappings and has a relationship with Jordan Baker, a young golf pro.<br /><br />These characters are inevitably led on a collision course that exposes the hypocrisy of the rich, the falsity of a love undeserving and the transience of individuals on this earth. The strength of Fitzgerald's treatment comes from the lyrical prose he provides to illuminate these themes. Not a word is wasted, and the author's economical handling of such a potentially complex plot is a technique I wish were more frequently replicated today. Most of all, I simply enjoy the book because it does not portend a greater significance eighty years later. It is a classic tale that provides vibrancy and texture to a bygone era.

Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel, \\"The Great Gatsby\\", is narrated by the passive Nick Carrraway, who has recently settled into the West Egg section of Long Island, a decidedly less prestigious area than its East Egg counterpart.  He has come to find his way in New York and to make his name known in the bond business. Nick's story, however, is not so much about himself as it is about his new neighbor, the mysterious Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gaudy mansion next door and hosts wild weekly parties to all of New York's upper crust.  When Nick is brought into this fast-paced world, he must reexamine himself and the world he lives in.<br /><br />The novel is a classic examination of what it means to be a success the American Dream.  As secrets unfold about the mythologized Gatsby, we discover that he has reinvented himself into the persona that he is, and that he is a man who is tormented by an idealistic vision of the woman he loves, and his desire to capture that woman for himself.<br /><br />Written in 1922, the novel is both a tragedy and a scathing indictment of the time of decadence that preceded the immediate economic upheaval and crash of 1929.  Although it is situated very much in the context of the 20s and New York, it serves as a timeless story of a man's dream and the sometimes impossibility of those dreams.	2006-06-25

The story revolves around a summer spent in a resort community outside of NYC, and the lavish lifestyle of the title character.  While the characters have few redeeming qualities and Fitzgerald's stinging critque of the upper classes is off-putting to some, it remains a classic for a reason: like it or not, admit it or not, we  are all to some extent like Jay Gatsby: inventions and reinventions of ourselves.<br /><br />On a more superficial level, Fitzgerald does a tremendous job of recreating a picture in time and, for a brief moment, allowing us to visit that time and place.  Highly recommended.	2006-06-21

I find it disheartening reading the reviews here that pan the book because the characters are not \\"noble\\" or possibly engage in illegal activities to make their money. Hint...we are not supposed to like them. Nobility in novels is done to death at any rate.<br />The book represents the death of a dream. The American dream at that, and I suppose that makes it difficult for some to embrace.

Scott Fitzgerald's cynical take on the decline of the American Dream in the 1920s. Instead of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, Fitzgerald believed that Americans had become obsessed with the desire to accumulate great personal wealth, and that desire corrupted them. In \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" the title character tries to impress his lost love, Daisy, by throwing extravagant parties at his Long Island home every Saturday night. The reason why Daisy and Gatsby never got together in the first place was because they came from two very different social classes, which is why Gatsby eventually resorted to a life of crime in order to make enough money to capture Daisy's affections. Unfortunately for Gatsby, Daisy is nothing like the amazing woman he has built her up to be: she is selfish and shallow until the very end, and her actions ultimately end up costing Gatsby everything.<br /><br />The book is narrated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's next-door neighbor. At first Nick is drawn in by all the glitz and glamour that the New York lifestyle has to offer, but eventually he becomes disgusted by the behavior of this so-called \\"elite\\" group of people. Nick also becomes involved with Jordan, a friend of Daisy's who comes across as being beautiful and charming one minute and then cold and unfeeling the next. In a way, Nick sometimes acts as Fitzgerald's voice in this novel, describing his bitterness about the lack of morality that is plaguing the nation. At the end of the novel, Nick has become so disenchanted by everything he has witnessed in New York over the course of a single summer that he decides to return to his home state of Minnesota, where life is much simpler and moral values are much more intact.<br /><br />I think \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is just as relevant to today's world as it was when it was originally published. Fitzgerald's readers will have a lot to contemplate after they finish this book.	2006-06-14

Fitzgerald's main message seems to be that those individuals who think big and dream big will eventually be crushed by their headstrong romantic ambitions, and that golden memories from the past--no matter how achingly seductive and promising in retrospect--can never be recaptured.<br /><br />How depressing!  What high schooler wants to be exposed to these dreadful (if true) life lessons, especially so early in life?<br /><br />Therein lies the rub.  \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a benchmark work of American literature that is primarily read by youngsters who are too young to appreciate it, and it is ignored by oldsters who might truly connect with it because they, in their old age, dismiss the novel as some sort of stale required reading for adolescents.<br /><br />But let's now look at what the two groups might like, and then dislike, about this fascinating 1925 novel.<br /><br />LIKES OF THE HIGH-SCHOOL CAFETERIA CROWD:<br /><br />1.) It's a short read.<br />2.) It's a famous work written by a famous author.<br />3.) It's a clear, clean, tidy read.<br />4.) It offers little complexity or contradiction (at least on a superficial level).<br />5.) Nick Carroway is cool, and Jay Gatsby is REALLY cool.<br />6.) Fitzgerald's gifts of description are amazing, especially those of the Gatsby mansion and its parties.<br />6.) The book's mini-lessons are tidy, potted plants: (a.) money is bad; (b.) it sucks being the outsider; (c.) pay attention while driving, lest you mow down a mistress; (d.) don't bother Googling your ex-girlfriend and buying a big house across the bay from her big house.<br /><br />DISLIKES OF THE HIGH-SCHOOL CAFETERIA CROWD:<br /><br />1.) Nick Carroway's narration is a little too suav&eacute; and complex for its own good.<br />2.) The last quarter of the text, sort of a crime novel spelled out, doesn't match the epic grandeur of the first three-quarters of the book.<br />3.) Except for a few parties, one DUI, and one murder/suicide, nothing happens over nearly 200 pages of text.<br /><br />LIKES OF THE RETIREMENT-COMMUNITY CAFETERIA CROWD:<br /><br />1.) It's a short read.<br />2.) Nick Carroway's narration is agreeably suav&eacute; and complex.<br />3.) Scores and scores of textual passages in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" are arrestingly beautiful in their imagery, simplicity, and lyricism.<br />4.) The oldsters know good-hearted, hard-charging successful people who eventually crashed and burned, just like Gatsby did.<br />5.) The oldsters like looking back gauzily and wistfully on the splendor and health of their youth, no matter how things actually turned out.<br />6.) The bastards win out at the end of \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" just like in real life.<br /><br />DISLIKES OF THE RETIREMENT-COMMUNITY CAFETERIA CROWD:<br /><br />1.) The last quarter of the text, sort of a crime novel spelled out, doesn't match the epic grandeur of the first three-quarters of the book.<br />2.) The pivotal automobile accident is just a tiny bit forced and convenient.  (See for example p. 151 of the 1995 Scribner paperback edition--how can Daisy swerve to pass an ONCOMING car on a two-lane street?  If the approaching car is ONCOMING, there is no need to swerve--just to keep driving straight.)<br />3.) Why did Gatsby let himself be killed by the raving George Wilson?  Wouldn't Gatsby, who purposely ordered his car with the damaged fender to be entombed in his estate's garage, get the hell out of Dodge?  (Tom and Daisy did.)  Are we meant to believe he gave up on life because, after one bad afternoon and a car accident caused by Daisy, he would give up on five years' worth of empire-building and let himself be assassinated?<br />4.) Overall, the book doesn't quite fit together seamlessly.  It fails to be perfectly harmonious, internally and thematically.<br /><br />In sum, this is a masterpiece stuck uncomfortably between two places: the hearts and minds of the young, who have not yet lived long enough to endorse the timeless truths of the novel's grim central message, and the hearts and minds of the old, who might indeed recognize the value of its teachings, but skip over the text because they consider it to be fodder for juvenile minds.<br /><br />The text's tragic inability to succeed in one or the other camp reminds us of two similar and heartbreaking failures: of Jay Gatsby, who had all the material goods and all the street cred, but still died young, broken, and alone; and of F. Scott Fitzgerald, who was perhaps the most naturally gifted author America ever produced, but still died young, broken, and alone.endorse the timeless truths of the novel's grim central message, and the hearts and minds of the old, who might indeed recognize the value of its teachings, but skip over the text because they consider it to be fodder for juvenile minds.

He can't stand the thought of mixed relationships, \\"next thing they'll have intermarriage between blacks and whites\\" (p.137).  Oddly enough Fitzgerald gives Tom that line to describe the significance of the suspected extra marital affair between his wife Daisy and Gatsby.  Was he inferring that becuz Gatsby was not a European white (Tom refers to himself and his crowd as Nordics) he was doomed to fall?<br /><br />Tom's a avid reader of white power literature alluding to the authors as \\"scientists\\".  He warns everyone that 'coloured' races will take over if left unchecked.  Airheaded Daisy (the rich and of course white object of Gatsby's affection) agrees, remarking admiringly, \\"Tom's..very profound\\".<br /><br />Tom also chooses the underdog to conduct an illicit affair--his mechanic's wife, Myrtle.  Of course Tom goes unpunished for his adulterous behaviour while Myrtle is killed in a hit and run, courtesy of Daisy, who also gets off unscathed.  Gatsby takes the fall for her.<br /><br />James Gatz is of course a Jewish name, which Gatsby changed in his late teens showing his own shame for his ethnicity.  Of course the shifty Jewish criminal, Mr. Wolfsheim has a poor command of the English language.  Nick, the narrator mocks his versions of \\"Oggsford\\" for Oxford and \\"goneggtion\\" for connection.<br /><br />At the end the poorest people are wiped out, the mechanic and his cheating wife (for whom Tom sheds a hypocritical crocodile tear).  Narrator Nick refers to the mechanic's death as \\"the holocaust\\".<br /><br />Can't say I enjoyed this novel, Gatsby fell in foolish love with a high-maintenance, forbidden woman because she was white, full of money and the fineries that went with it.  It wasn't a pure love story.

I deleted that review, and now, six years later, returning to the book, and reading it in one sitting, I have come to an entirely new conclusion.  After literally hundreds of books, from Hemingway to Faulkner, to Joyce and Woolf, to Kerouac and Heller, the poetics of this book, of Fitzgerald's writing, is to be marvelled and enjoyed.<br /><br />The story of Jay Gatsby, told through the eyes of Nick Carraway is a wonderful experience that every American, nay I say, every human being should experience.  This is a text of utter beauty, filled with the poetry of life in it's lines.  It moves us forward into the realization of the failure of the American Dream.  It is a tragedy, it is a romance, it is a story of class, it is the story of an American soul seeking both victory and redemption.  The writing erupts from the page like sparks from sparklers, each page burning with radiant descriptions, powerful imagery, and insight that you wish was constant in the literature of today.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is a timeless novel, capable of being enjoyed by anyone, black or white, rich or poor, American or European or Asian.  It is a novel that goes beyond that of a moment in history, and becomes a part of the soul.  It captures more than the heart of man, but the heart of life itself.

US	18727912	RJWX6GREDEHX6	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A Timeless Classic	The Great Gatsby (1925) by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a well-written fictitious book about the lives of people living in America during the 1920s.  Fitzgerald wrote this book in the 1920s, and some believe he modeled many of the events after his wife who longed for the lifestyle of the financially prosperous people of the time.  This book is representative of many issues in the roaring twenties like alcoholism, racism, adultery, and many more, although they are somewhat exaggerated.  Fitzgerald does an excellent job of writing about the settings and gives readers a great concept of the situations and feelings of characters.  I believe that Fitzgerald's main theme of the book is while many desire the American Dream of easy, quick money and measuring success and happiness only with material wealth, eventually they realize this perfect dream is ultimately unattainable.  In this speech, I am going to give a brief summary of the book, give my evaluation of the book and compare it to two reviews from Amazon.com in order to help you understand my thesis.  While The Great Gatsby is a fiction novel that tells of the lives of fantasy characters in the twenties, Fitzgerald has done a great job predicting and describing the happenings of what we now know to be the truth of the roaring twenties and are vastly applicable to many eras of time.<br /><br />  The Great Gatsby focuses on the extravagant lifestyles of a group of Ivy-League graduates in the 1920s.  Nick, the narrator, always finds himself in the middle of his friends' problems.  Being caught in between the secrets and controversies of those around him is not something that he is comfortable with by any means.  The issues that his friends are facing eventually climax and their elaborate lives begin to crumble.<br /><br />  Fitzgerald does many things to help the reader understand the happenings in the book's sequence of events.  This book at first glance seems to be almost a childish book because of its large print and lack of hundreds of pages, but as one reviewer points out in her review, in order to understand this short book one needs to read it with a fine-toothed comb.  I completely agree with Emma because in different parts throughout the book, he uses weather, colors and many other things to help describe the feelings in a setting.  Like in Gatsby and Daisy's reunion during the pouring rain at Nick's house, which shows the awkwardness between them, but their love rekindles just as the rain stops and the sun begins to peak through the clouds.  Gatsby's white flannel suit that he wears in their reunion represents his image of innocence and purity.<br /><br />  Fitzgerald writes of the problems of these characters as if he is looking back on the 1920s.  He brings the topics of alcoholism, Gatsby's bootlegging, Tom's racism, the common adultery in the group, wealth prejudice prevalent in the book, and many other issues almost as if he knew these things were going to be major issues in the twenties.  Or are these issues universal with humankind throughout time?  With some thought, one can see that the characters of this book can be compared to many people who live extravagant lifestyles today and throughout history.  Thinking about the issues presented in this book can bestow the idea that this book is not only relevant to the 1920s, but possibly the entirety of humankind.  However, another reviewer disagrees with me, presenting the idea that this book should have only been printed in a 1920's newspaper because of its unimaginative storyline and irrelevance to any period other than the twenties.  After reading his review, I found that he should read the previous review that I mentioned and analyze the themes and details that this novel offers and possibly recognize that although a little more exaggerated, this novel is comparatively applicable to today.<br /><br />  In conclusion, The Great Gatsby tells of the problems of fictional characters in the 1920s, but I believe it can be compared with people at any point in time.  This shows that Fitzgerald did a great job writing this book because people today and people fifty years from now can read this book and in some way be able to identify with it.

With a little critical reading, one can find Fitzgerald's main ideas and the concepts of The Great Gatsby.

Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope\\" (5-6). F. Scott Fitzgerald opens The Great Gatsby with Nick's commentary to define his purpose for The Great Gatsby: no one can't judge others; he can only allow the different arguments of a situation to lead to a point of cognitive dissonance, define his hopes, and strengthen him as a person. Some view The Great Gatsby as a love story about Fitzgerald and Zelda, his wife, through Gatsby and Daisy's relationship, while others dig deeper to find underlying controversial issues of bisexuality through Gatsby and Dan Cody's relationship. These were just tactics Fitzgerald uses to bring the reader to a point of cognitive dissonance so he will discover his deepest hopes and unshakable beliefs. Great pieces of literature use such tactics.<br /><br /> Set in the suburbs of New York City, The Great Gatsby tells Nick Carraway's story of the quirky character Jay Gatsby. It focuses upon Gatsby's love and pursuit of Daisy Buchanan, while reflecting upon his detour relationship with Dan Cody. From beginning to end balanced evidence for each relationship allows presents the reader to ponder Gatsby's personal life and intentions, with a choice of focusing on the obvious and judging what is right or wrong or weighing the different arguments to determine personal hopes.<br /><br /> One reviewer claims that The Great Gatsby is a love story modeled after Fitzgerald and Zelda's marriage, especially through Daisy and Gatsby's relationship. Gatsby and Daisy's past was electric. When young, they were so engrossed in each other that Daisy didn't notice Jordan Baker five feet away! Ms. Baker describes it as romantic how Gatsby looked at Daisy. This reviewer's argument that the novel was a pure love story is logical but too obvious to be Fitzgerald's purpose for writing the novel. Another reviewer questions the intentions of Gatsby's \\"youthful relationship\\" with Dan Cody and suggests that Gatsby may be bisexual. Gatsby and Dan Cody's first meeting was electric, also. Gatsby smiled and Cody found him \\"quick and extravagantly ambitious\\" (106). Cody bought him expensive clothes and even included him in his will. This \\"arrangement,\\" as he called it, might have lasted indefinitely; that is, until Cody's wife stepped in. This is a more sophisticated, intuitive suggestion but still not Fitzgerald's purpose for writing the novel. Fitzgerald provides supporting evidence for both relationships to prevent the reader from knowing exactly how Gatsby feels; to prevent the reader from making a judgment. Every great writer uses similar tactics of weighing arguments with limited information to push the reader to a greater level of understanding. For example, George Orwell's 1984 weighs unattached versus emotional sex; Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter weighs parental obligations versus social status; Shakespeare's Othello weighs fate versus decisions; John Cheever's \\"Enormous Radio\\" weighs privacy versus safety. Each presents arguments concerning judgment and hope to lead the reader to a point of cognitive dissonance and relate it to his personal life, learning that he is unable to make a polar judgement about another person's life.  Fitzgerald is exemplifying that the reader can't make forthright judgements about Gatsby's personal relationships, especially his sexual preference; the reader can only weigh each argument with his personal hopes and determine what is best for himself.<br /><br /> Sure, Fitzgerald could have used his marriage as a model for the novel, and clear evidence supports that Gatsby has bisexual tendencies. Neither of these was Fitzgerald's purpose for writing the novel.  Every great writer uses these tactics in for a greater purpose. Any writer could attack social issues or write a love story, but it takes a great author to change a reader's life.t Gatsby may be bisexual. Gatsby and Dan Cody's first meeting was electric, also.

US	18723656	R9W5L2WTAZ3SM	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	3	2	11	N	N	Gatsby Who?	In The Great Gatsby, a book considered to be  a true classic of American literature,  F. Scott Fitzgerald examines the theme of aspiration in America during an era known as the  Roaring Twenties.  Jay Gatsby, the hero in Fitzgerald's novel, embodies every aspect of the  American Dream,  fancy houses, flashy cars, and glamorous parties. Yet, his attempt to obtain true love is the cause of his downfall. Fitzgerald uses this novel as a satirical attempt to unveil the truth behind this so-called glamorous time period. Although I felt that Fitzgerald was successful in creating an interesting plot, his execution causes the story to seem slow and it leaves his characters well underdeveloped.<br /><br /> Fitzgerald uses this novel as an expression of his views of the nineteenth century. The Great Gatsby is narrated by Nick Carraway. Fitzgerald uses Nick to interweave his characters, but according to Sashee \\"he did not do much to give a true insight on the feelings of each person,\\" which leaves the characters unfinished. Another reader, Shalom Freedman says \\"Fitzgerald's remarkable ability to create or capture an atmosphere, a feeling of time, of a special kind of American world.\\" Fitzgerald spends too much time creating a sense of place in his novel, that he has left my imagination wondering about the characters. Novels of tragedy are supposed to contain something that tears at the readers emotions and this novel failed to do that in many ways. In a sense the characters were extremely one dimensional and I am only able to grasp the surface of each characters personality. The deaths of Mr. Wilson, Myrtle Wilson, and Gatsby had no major effect on my feelings, because Fitzgerald did not shape the characters into memorable characters, that drew emotion from his audience.<br /><br /> Another problem that I encountered was Fitzgerald's slow and dismal writing style. Fitzgerald's style focused on the details of every scene, for example when Fitzgerald lists the pages of \\"important people\\" that attend Gatsby's parties, he loses my attention. By adding unnecessary details to simple scenes throughout the story, Fitzgerald postpones both the climax and ending of the novel. These are two pivotal points for readers. Sashee finds that \\"although the plot might be fascinating enough to keep some readers going others may find the general story far too detailed and at some parts boring.\\" Fitzgerald's story contains minimal surprises, even the climax is hard to distinguish from the rest of the novel. Anticipating the ending might motivate some readers to plow through this novel, but they should not have to wait until the end of the book for it to become interesting. In contrast to what some may think, this novel is not a work that according to Freedman,  \\"simply holds its readers in a very special charm and grace.\\"<br /><br /> Fitzgerald allows readers insight to the atmosphere of the nineteenth century, as he captures \\"a feeling of time.\\" Yet, he fails to understand the concept... time. The Great Gatsby is a classic story of achievement and aspiration, but wordy pages, a slow climax, and ending  make it a hard read.that attend Gatsby's parties, he loses my attention.

Having enjoyed Deborah MacGillivray's three short stories in The No Law Against Love anthology, I expected to enjoy her debut novel, A Restless Knight. I loved this book!<br />Tamlyn is the Scots heroine. Julian, the Black Dragon, is the English hero. Edward I is the king who sends Challon north to claim Tamlyn and her lands.<br /><br />Forget pre-conceived notions of what may come.<br />From the beginning page you are drawn into this story, the author weaving a tale of love and Scot's magic. The characters of Tamlyn and Julian are fleshed out into people you care about. They behave and think realistically and believably, their story plausible. They face trials and doubts, but love and truth triumph. It is truly a love story, a novel you don't want to end.<br /><br />This book is a keeper, one I'll read over and over. I will be pre-ordering Debrorah MacGillivray's coming books. My only complaint is we have to wait until October 2006 for her next in this series.We have a naughty phrase for such women these days: an attention whore.  She cannot truly feel for someone else, nor can she ever accept responsibility for the tragedy that she causes. To admit to any responsibility would be to admit that she is capable of doing wrong: an impossibility in her mind. She is not a tragic character because she is not truly a real human being. <br /> <br />Gatsby's life-- and death-- is the tragedy. While Gatsby lives and dies nobly for his love and his idealism, in a sense it is a wasted death becaue such love and idealism were misplaced from the start. We forgive him, we suffer for him, and we love him for it, though.  <br /> <br />If your heart did not break for Gatsby, young reader, then you are like Daisy: you were incapable of grasping the depth and the purpose of his life and his love. Don't feel bad.  As the psycho-experts will surely remind you in ten or twenty years, it's not your fault. Like Daisy, you are only the product of your class and your age.	2006-04-04

Fitzgerald is considered to be an important early 20th century American writer. I bought and read Fitzgerald's five major novels (\\"This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and the Damned, The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night, and The Last Tycoon\\") plus one book of short stories plus the biography \\"Some Sort of Epic Grandeur\\" by Matthew Broccoli.<br /><br />His first major novel, \\"This Side of Paradise,\\" along with \\"Gatsby\\" and \\"Tender is the Night\\" are considered to be great novels, and I enjoyed the reads. The other two have serious flaws. Interestingly, the Bloomsbury Guide does not rate any of the five well known Fitzgerald novels as masterpieces. His best or most complicated work is \\"Tender is the Night,\\" but it is less well known than \\"Gatsby\\" which became a successful film.<br /><br />Fitzgerald wrote about half a dozen novels and over 100 short stories between approximately 1917 and 1940. The short stories were done largely to make money to support his life style. In later years, he worked on a number of Hollywood film scripts. He died poor in Hollywood in 1940 at an age of just 44, leaving an insurance policy as his main asset.<br /><br />Riding on the success of \\"This Side of Paradise,\\" Fitzgerald created the rambling  novel \\"The Beautiful and the Damned.\\" That novel has good prose but is a step down from his first novel. It was not a commercial success. Fitzgerald wrote the next novel - \\"Gatsby\\" - with an eye on creating another commercial best seller.<br /><br />\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a much shorter novel than his prior two: just half the length. It is compact, polished, and contains beautiful prose. It is written largely in the first person by a young man who describes the life of his neighbour \\"Gatsby\\" on New York's long Island. It takes place during a warm New York summer, and like many other Fitzgerald works, there is a fascination with wealthy Americans. The story reflects some of the elements of the author's own life, and accordingly the protagonists have advanced in age to people in their twenties and thirties - no longer recent university graduates as in his prior two novels - and they are roughly the same age as the author.<br /><br />This is Fitzgerald's shortest and his most polished novel. Some think it is not as good as the more elaborate \\"Tender is the Night\\" or his breakout novel \\"This Side of Paradise.\\"<br /><br />This is an excellent but short read.in their twenties and thirties - no longer recent university graduates as in his prior two novels - and they are roughly the same age as the author.

The searching spirits, striving for what they may never, spiritually, attain in this world, where self-delusion motivates, social tendencies can seem shallow. Friendships; empathy amid the cold but natural human tendencies. Incorruptible dreams amid corruption. The quality of character questioned. Observant, non-participatory narration, depicts the beauty, the waste, the prejudices and insecurity, fragility; time passing.<br /><br />It's indeed a deep book; many shades. Honest, romantic, beautiful, sorrowful. Emptiness found in the richest vistas. It has a resigned tone, but with affection for the failing of Gatsby, confronting the dream that has died, and is always dying. It's a Greek Tragedy really.<br /><br />I can't get the actor Robert Redford out of my head for Gatsby, because he was just the perfect casting for this bygone age. If u like this classic, u'll like the slower Brideshead Revisited by Eveleyn Waugh, and Donna Tartt's more recent, student classic The Secret History.	2006-04-01

Honestly, I admit that Fitzgerald utilized figurative language and symbolism quite successfully. I truly enjoyed some of his satire and hidden meanings. You could analyze this book for years if you wanted to.<br /><br />The problem is that there are no truly noble characters to encourage a reader. All the characters seem to be involved in shady activities. The absence of a role model disturbs me and makes me wonder why the book is required reading at so many schools. (Some people have suggested that Nick is the sole moral person in the book; however, his willingness to aid in other's schemes seems to prove otherwise.)<br /><br />Here's my advice: To those who have to read it - read it, keep a good attitude, and take lots of notes. To those who want to read it- only read it if you don't mind reading about crazy lifestyles and love affairs.<br /><br />Happy reading!	2006-03-26

Then I read it again many years later (when I came to live on Long Island) and only then fully appreciated.<br /><br />It is pointless to try to re-tell the plot here, because the complicated character of Gatsby (a truly American self-made man who never forgot his love, but with a secret in his past) and the simplicity and shallowness of Daisy and Tom are revealed in a sequence of events that has to be uncovered step by step.<br /><br />And still I feel that Fitzgerald caught without any mistake or hesitation the atmosphere of that time in America between wars, the people who could be either fully aware or careless and childish. A marvelous achievement, a cult book for many people, myself included.	2006-03-23

US	49699601	R3K9JIEA3SX845	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	3	2	6	N	N	Short and Sweet	`The Great Gatsby' is a novel that attempts to probe into the heart of the American Dream. Implicit in its portrayal of the subject, the novel uncovers the pragmatism and the callous indifference that characterize the thinking of the individuals of the society then. Through the lucid writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald, we see the lofty ambitions of Gatsby and Daisy being played out. Gatsby, in order to get close to Daisy and propel himself to a higher social stratum, lied to her about his background. Daisy, on the other hand, took to Gatsby because of his stint at Oxford.<br /><br /> The American society of the 1920s saw a steady rise in prosperity of the nation and the standard of the living of the people. It was a period of hedonism and extravagance, with the Americans `believing in the green light' and striving to `run faster, stretch out their arms farther' to reach out for their `orgastic future'.<br /><br />The novel is short and sweet, but it did not resonate very well with me. Perhaps the author positioned himself too remotely and distantly from the story, resulting in a failure to present a more impactful depiction of the `Jazz Age'. This novel has also been touted as one of the most representative American work of fiction. But upon careful reading, I did not find an extremely distinct `American-ness' in the novel. The story appeared universal enough to be transplanted to any country experiencing its own version of the `Jazz Age'.	2006-03-15

It is a story that follows the journey of a young man Nick Carraway who moves into a neighborhood in Long Island and is a neighbor to the eccentric powerful Gatsby. Nick has a cousin, Daisy Buchanan, who he goes visits and meets her husband Tom along with beautiful Jordan Baker. Every night Nick is amazed to see his neighbors' popularity and hear about his infamous parties. One night, he is surprised to find out the Gatsby has personally invited him to one of his entertaining parties. After going to Gatsby's parties many nights he was unsuccessful at meeting him until one night he sparks an interesting conversation with a young man who turns out to be Jay Gatsby. One afternoon Nick had lunch with Miss. Baker who admits to him that Gatsby is in love with his cousin Daisy. Gatsby's intension was to confess his long lost love to Daisy and win her over like he had done five years before. After Gatsby's reunites with Daisy they decide to proclaim their love to Tom, but obstacles keep them from being together.<br /><br />In this book there are many themes that coincide to make an interesting story that turns out to be a tragedy. Love, greed, money, ambition, jealousy, and betrayal are all human attributes that are subtly sporadic throughout the novel. Gatsby represented money and ambition and determination along with love while the woman he loved represented greed and betrayal. Gatsby did everything in his power to get his love while Daisy was undetermined to what she wanted and whom she truly loved. The love interest between Nick and Miss. Baker ends in a unsettled dispute because of betrayal and jealousy. All the characters in the Great Gatsby are tied to these rudiments in one form or the other.<br /><br />These elements combined gave The Great Gatsby a great ending and made reading it worth while. Although extremely slow paced in the beginning for my taste, I was intrigued by about page 100, it satisfied me by the end. It was a surprising tragic ending that made every boring page before was worth reading. Ever since I started high school I had heard about this book and it's elegant style of the 1920's, I was extremely disappointed when I started reading it because it was nothing what it was hyped up to be. I gave the reading 3 stars because half of the book was extremely boring to me but the other half was extremely well written and thought out.

Each student gets to choose his/her own book from four choices. After hearing the basic story plot, I chose \\"The Great Gatsby\\". I was curious and wanted to find out more about \\"the man who worked so hard that he bought a house across the lake facing the girl's house just to make her fall in love with him\\". Now I have finished the book, although it's is a little short, the plot and themes are not being affected at all. In the beginning of the book, it's not so interesting and the readers will be feeling weird about everything. Gatsby, the title of the book, is the crazy man. Although the main character is Nick, he's telling the audience about Gatsby. Gatsby hold grand parties at his mansion with people who he didn't even know, and he often isolate himself from the crowd as people were having fun. His purpose of having parties is not to have fun; but to show off and impress the girl.<br /><br />As the readers goes on, they will start to notice everything that's been happening and start to fall into the book. The author, Scott Fitzgerald, referred himself to the main character Nick in the book. The novel was written in 1920's, the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald thinks that the moral part of people is almost gone under the success and prosperity of the Jazz Age, so he is trying to include some moral ingredients in the story. In this book, he reflected his feelings towards the 20's and expressed himself through the novel.<br /><br />This book mainly talked about relationships, and it also showed all kinds of people's character and personality. Overall, I think this is a nice book, and it's definitely worth reading.	2006-03-07

Jay Gatsby was the main character or protagonist in \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" For his whole life, he went out of his way to turn from rags-to-riches in order to seek for his true love. However, did this \\"fallen angel\\" have the right to pursue happiness? Was his pursuit of true love fortunate or unfortunate? The content or plot of the story would tell us that love was the greatest link.<br /><br />As for Gatsby's real profession, the people despised and looked down on him. In spite of this, this was the one area in which we admired him for. When the people who lived in America during the 1920s were carried away and charmed into vanity, Gatsby did not lose his inner self - his na?vet? and his high or lofty ideals. He was still a person of principle and was still punctilious about his dreams. Even if he would lose every thing for the love of his life, he would have no regrets at all.<br /><br />What was the drive or impulse that led a person to be so dedicated or devoted? What could possibly be the cause that led a person to be so persistent with his or her faith? It is very hard for us to love others as we love ourselves. At certain times, we feel that it's not worthwhile to pay our love and affection. For that reason, I admire and sympathize with Gatsby even more. Throughout his whole life, love had always been both a burden and a reward (for him.) Love is an ongoing lesson in life in which all of us are obliged to learn.<br /><br />Though this story did not contain positive and inspirational characters, the content of this book may direct the readers towards a deeper understanding of the main character's na?vet? and purity, and then guide or bring out the love within the readers' hearts.	2006-03-07

Even the way the story is written is ironic because although the author uses all kinds of deep and meaningful descriptions about everything, the things he is writing about are the extreme shallowness and pretentiousness of  the people who live in that time. In a way, the story is a satire through and through.<br /><br />  The whole story is a whirlwind of emotions and it practically turns everything from the mood to the environment to the people inside out, and all of it is told from a single person's point of view, which makes it all the easier to imagine that you are actually the one thinking those thoughts.<br /><br />  Also, it becomes very easy to relate to the story when you realize that even if the story takes place in a time long before, every kind of flaw in man is still present today, and a lot of them are featured in the very colorful characters from The Great Gatsby. Traits like immaturity, lovesickness, carelessness, snobbery, etc, were present then and are still present now, and once you realize that you will be able to enjoy the pure humor in the book that the author is probably trying to present to us.<br /><br />  The Great Gatsby is one of the most obscure books that I have ever read, and yet after I read it, a lightbulb appeared in my head and now that I understand it's message, I know that I really enjoyed it and the challenge was wortht the read.	2006-03-07

When I first start reading chapter one and two I wanted to give up reading the book because I couldn't understand what the author was talking about. When he said \\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\\" he told me, \\"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had\\" and \\"In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.\\" I didn't understand it until later. It means that it's not wise to judge people by the looks because sometimes you might misunderstand that person and create some problems. However, I think the story was mainly about how wealth, popularity, love, loss, betrayal and emptiness. The whole story is kind of depressing because two of the characters die. Everyone's life is depended on money but nothing else. People tend to care about money than the social problems between groups of people. There is a social problem that caused through many years. People divide themselves in to three groups, high class, mid class and low class. If you're not very wealthy, people would just ignore you but when your fairly rich people would remember your name. If your like some millinery person than you become famous. Someone of the chapters' mood changes by the weather. For example, when Nick invites Daisy to his house and have cup of tea, Gatsby feels all nervous which then the weather changes to cloudy and rainy but when Gatsby was satisfied the weather becomes sunny. Even though it's depressing I would recommend other people to read it, which that is who haven't read this book yet.

When he said \\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\\" he told me, \\"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had\\" and \\"In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.\\" I didn't understand it until later.

But the story ends tragically.<br />However, I think the story was mainly about how wealth, popularity, love, loss, betrayal and emptiness. The whole story is kind of depressing and exciting as you read along. Everyone's life is depended on money but nothing else. People tend to care about money than the social problems between groups of people. There is a social problem that caused through many years. People divide themselves in to three groups, high class, mid class and low class. If you're not very wealthy, people would just ignore you but when your fairly rich people would remember your name. If your like some millinery person than you become famous. Someone of the chapters' mood changes by the weather. For example, when Nick invites Daisy to his house and have cup of tea, Gatsby feels all nervous which then the weather changes to cloudy and rainy but when Gatsby was satisfied the weather becomes sunny.<br />Even though it's depressing I would recommend other people to read it, which that is who haven't read this book yet.

US	34796242	RM8BGR55IPKVX	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Tiffany Feng's Review	The book first starts off with Nick telling the readers that he is not a judgmental person. As he goes on he describes the type of environment he is in. How the East Egg and West Egg differ, yet they both share the same sort of problems. The East Egg is full of the aristocratic, while the West Egg is known as the area for the \\"new rich\\". He is assosciated with Daisy (his cousin), Tom (Daisy's wife), and Jordan (Daisy's friend) who all reside on the East Egg. All of them live in a world where they are surrounded by wealth, and in other people's eyes \\"problem free\\". Nick lives in the West Egg and lives beside a mysterious man, only known as Gatsby. Gatsby is everything that Nick scorns, but disregards that comment because he isn't a person that judges people. As the story moves on we Nick and Gatsby becomes friends. Gatsby tries to win back his past love, but finds that difficult for she already is married. Many surprising events happen, and it all ends tragically.<br /><br />  Overall, the book is full of adventure. When you first read it, you feel as though this book has no point, and you want to find out who Gatsy is. Luckily as the story moves on, NIck and Gatsby develop a close friendship, and we actually get to see who this man is -- behind all those lavish parties and life a luxury. The story unfolds and you actually see that these wealthy people actually have a big load of problems, and that they are not as they seem. The way the author choose his words, make you think about a deeper meaning that goes beyond in the book. I think this is one reason why the book is so interesting, because it is just full of surprises. The Great Gatsby is one of those classic books in American literature that you have to read. I definitely recommend other people to take the time to sit down and read this book.	2006-03-06

Hence the young review below who hysterically complains, \\"it could have been shorter.\\"<br /><br />Simply put, it's not an adolescent's book.  It's a novel about the tail end of youth, not the beginning.  All the characters have reached a point in there lives where the party has begun to die, and find there is little waiting for them in the light of day.  Thus they are perfect metaphors for the Jazz Age, for capitalism and America itself.<br /><br />It's also one of the most stunningly written love stories ever written, conveyed in a completely opaque manner.  Fitzgerald expresses characters' relationships with little more than snapshots, gestures and tones of voice.  The way that Daisy kisses Gatsby while her husband is in the other room.  The way that the Bucahanans talk to each other in the kitchen of their house.  It takes a brilliant writer to use such opacity to his advantage.<br /><br />Fitzgerald basically defined American tragedy with this novel.  The mixture of ambition, romanticism and shame that constitute Gatsby make him perhaps the most archetypal tragic figure since Oedipus.  It's simply a great book and nothing more.	2006-02-28

The Great Gatsby was a mystery to behold - a strong feeling of knowing better, but an unwillingness to admit so much.  Like Nick, I was taken in by his charms and stories and did want to believe the best of him.<br /><br />After letting the book soak in I am convinced Gatsby was not the main character though, but that Nick was.  It was as though what Nick told of other people was in a way a direct portrait of the narrator.<br /><br />I have a very warm feeling, finishing this book and will probably seek out more of the author's work.	2006-02-20

The roaring 20s, the Jazz Age, is captured in all of it's wanton desires, greed, and debaucherous elegance. Throwing lavish parties and stopping at nothing to make his idealized relationship come true, Jay Gatsby chases his dream girl with reckless abandon. Despite the lavishness of his monetary wealth and possessions, the end produces tragic consequences, broken relationships, and broken dreams that leave the protagonists mending their emotional and physical wounds.<br /><br />The use of symbolism and double-meanings is truly profound as Fitzgerald creates a canopy of subtle messages of the dangers present in the pursuit of illogical desires. Much of this novel parallels Fitzerald's own tumultuous relationship with his wife Zelda and the fragments left behind from the real-life counterpart year's later are stunningly analogous to the results explored in this novel. A masterpiece of literature that continues to stimulate the mind and interest of the reader in its exploration of deep seated human foils.	2006-02-14

Like the major rich characters in this novel, today's ruthless robber-barons, cheat on their wives, demean their employees, spend money lavishly on conspicuous consumption. But Gatsby never gave a million dollar party like the head of Tyco did.<br /><br />So much is similar: no one knows where the rich people's money is coming from. Everyone assumes there is something illegal about a few people having all the money and the poor people being pushed further into poverty. But, no one seems to be doing anything about it.<br /><br />When General Motors steps away from its commitment to employee pensions, and United Airlines, and IBM, this book becomes more and more contemporary. Even more so when executive pay rises in the double digits every year. Tom Buchannan, the adulterer in this classic, would fit right into today's business elite.<br /><br />Gatsby himself is mysterious at first, but his background in the First World War is revealed to be similar to that of many of today's veterans who returned from Vietnam, or Iraq, to find that the rules of business had changed, and for the most part, there was no effective enforcement.<br /><br />The real lesson of this book is that the wages of sin is death. Gatsby dies in a case of mistaken identity. His death is triggered by Buchannan's infidelity. This is a message America needs to hear.<br /><br />I had to read this book in high school. And I watched MTV, and the Dukes of Hazzard, and the Flintstones. But that was before Enron. I read this book again after the Internet bubble burst, just like the stock market imploded in 1929, shortly after this book was written, sweeping millions into poverty. And I read it a couple of times since Enron was looted for billions of dollars and sank into bankruptcy, leaving many of its employees without pensions or savings.<br /><br />I think it is a classic because, aside from little things, like air conditioning, which had not been invented yet, the book is as relevant today as it was when it was first published.<br /><br />By the time this book became popular, thousands of people who had hoped to be like Gatsby were living on the streets. If they read the book during the depression they would have been happy that Gatsby got what was coming to him.<br /><br />What will you think of him?hink it is a classic because, aside from little things, like air conditioning, which had not been invented yet, the book is as relevant today as it was when it was first published. <br /> <br />By the time this book became popular, thousands of people who had hoped to be like Gatsby were living on the streets.

I'm somewhat taken aback by the number of negative reviews of a work that has a quite well-deserved reputation as a classic of American literature.  Its prose may seem dated to the MTV generation, but it was certainly \\"modern\\" for its time.  Treating \\"Gatsby\\" as a curious historical or sociological artifact misses all but the bare surface of the work.  I recommend a careful re-reading to those who found it difficult to digest - perhaps paying more attention to how Gatsby's dream shaped what he did throughout his life, and what the final result might tell us about human nature in the context of the American ethos.	2006-02-11

The idea of Daisy is represented throughout the first half of the book by a physically distant but emotionally near green light at the end of a dock across the lake outside of Gasby's house.<br /><br />  When Gatsby finds out that Daisy is Nick's cousin, he proves himself to Nick and tells Nick his life story (which no one truly know and even from told from Gatsby's own mouth, can't be fully believed) for a favor from Nick to arrange a meeting between him and Daisy. Although Daisy, living in the East Egg (the wealthier side of Long Island), is married to a wealthy and mucho but cynical Tom with whom she already have a daughter, Gatsby nonetheless ignores the present and focuses more on making the past (a past with only he and Daisy) the future. Gatsby dwells in the past, the life he could have had with Daisy, and is focused on bringing it back while ignoring what is.<br /><br />  Gatsby's image is in many ways, larger than life, and so are all his beliefs. His character is indeed gorgeous for its rarity and capacity. The great Gatsby, is a incredible young man who has the tangibles but wants the intangibles, who physically lives in the present but emotional lives in the past, and who dreams about the future while pursuing the past.

The theme of this novel is the declining of the American dream.  The falling action of the story is a tragedy because the Gatsby, Wilson, and Myrtle Wilson die in the story.  The setting of the story is in Long Island.  West Egg and East Egg, which are both next to each other, are fictional places in the novel which are near New York City and are both separated from each other by a river.  Nick Carraway, who is the main character of the story, narrates the story so well and is Gatsby's friend.  A green light, which is in East Egg, can be seen from West Egg.<br /><br />In the plot, Nick drives to Daisy Buchanan's house in order to have dinner with Daisy Buchanan who lives with her husband, Tom, who is arrogant, and tall.  Nick then drives to New York City with Tom and Myrtle, whose husband is George.  They go to this party, which has a lot of people invited, in an apartment in New York City.  After some time in the party, Tom punches her wife in the nose because her wife said that she would say Daisy a lot and because she was shouting when she said that.  After many days, Gatsby sends a man to Nick's house in order to give him an invitation to Gatsby's party.  The Owl Eyed man, who is a strange character, realizes that the books in Gatsby's library are real so he tells Nick and a few others that the book are real; however, Nick and the others probably don't believe that the books are real.  After a long period in the novel, Nick, Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom go to New York City in order to go into a big building.  After they leave the building, Daisy accidentally crashed her car into Myrtle Wilson who died at this time, so George Wilson, who loves her wife so much became angry at Jay Gatsby because he was in the car that hit her wife.  At the end of the novel, Nick Carraway sits on the beach in West Egg staring at the light, which is in East Egg, on the other side of the river.<br /><br />There is a billboard in the story with a picture of a face of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg wearing glasses.  The picture on the billboard is one of the symbols, which represents God staring down at the American people, in the story.  Another symbol includes the valley of Ashes between West Egg and New York City.  The valley of ashes represents the poor people.  The green light is another symbol in the novel; it represents the Gatsby's hopes and dreams in the future.<br /><br />I believe the story is very interesting to read, so I would recommend others to read it.  I enjoyed reading some parts of the novel very much such as when Gatsby told Nick Carraway about the accident between the yellow car and Myrtle Wilson and such as when Owl Eyes were talking about the books in Gatsby's library with Nick and his friends.  George Wilson is a very interesting character because he is the only one that murders a person in the novel after getting angry after Tom tells George who killed his wife.  Owl Eyes is also a very interesting character because  he came to the funeral and Nick Carraway did not know that he would come to the funeral and because he crashed his car into another car.  The wreck of his car was conspicuous to chauffeurs.billboard in the story with a picture of a face of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg wearing glasses.

I then decided to look online and see what some other people had said about this book.  Some of them were bored, others thought it was amazing.  I think I misunderstood the main point of the book.  Since i found there to be none.  I would not recommend this book to people.<br /><br />I found the author to put to much detail into the things that I thought were unnecessary, and definetly not enough in the aspects that I thought would have been important. And from the beginning of the story I was confused and lost to as what was going on and where he was.  The way we writes just didn't flow in my head.  I could not grasp what he was trying to say and what he was attempting to show me.  When he would talk about one person, I would think he was talking about someone else, and I was completely lost as to who he was or the relavence to the story.  I got the feeling that the narrator was schitzo. or something along those lines, just from the way he seemed to jump around and completely change.  But I am not totally sure on that.<br /><br />I understood that Gatsby was a very important man, he had a large effect on many people around him.  But I could not get over how Fitzgerlad wrote about him.  I had such a hard time figuring out what was what. Gatsby was a very wealthy man. As I go on reading others reviews I am beginning to understand that there are three settings and they are simply there so the reader and be in awe of how Fitzgerald writes.  I was not in awe, I was very bored through the entire book.<br /><br />I am very picky with the books I like to read, they have to hold my attention from the veryt beginning, or else I just set them down and don't pick them up again. Perhaps he has another book that is written differently and i will read that.  You must always give authors a second chance, for they may have just written something different one day and you may like that.	2006-01-12

I liked the fact that it was based upon the \\"american dream\\", and reading of the author's perception definitely was keeping my attention.  Though I liked the book, I felt it was too long for the information that was to be given & could have been a lot shorter, getting to the climax quicker.  It was a bit confusing at times because of the way the author presented it, going back and forth between one of the main characters lifestyle to his past lifestyle, explaining it along the way. Yet, I did respect the great deatil presented by the author F. Scott Fitzgerald considering it gave you a vast understanding of all the characters and the multiple settings described in the book. I am a sucker for love stories, so the idea of the main character, \\"Gatsby\\", doing all of this out of wanting his past relationship with his object of affection \\"Daisy\\" back, made me feel with him, and put myself in his shoes.  This was another reason why I thought it was worth the many pages of description. It kept you wanting to read more in order to find out if he would get the girl or not.  I would recommend this book to others being that I had a good time reading it, yet I did feel it is a bit biased.  If you are not interested in the time period as well as the basis of again the \\"american dream\\", it may not keep your full attention.  Otherwise, I do strongly suggest this book to others, it was a great read, and it really gets you thinking!	2006-01-12

Daisy left him for Tom Buchanan, who is a superbly stuck-up jerk from Long Island.<br /><br />Each of the main characters, Gatsby, Nick, Tom and Daisy, are comparable to elements. Gatsby is Water, because he lives on the water and throughout the end of the book, it is constantly raining. Wind is related to Daisy because she seems ephemeral and untamable, flowing in and out of Gatsby's life. Nick can be paralleled to earth because he is steadfast in his beliefs and morals. The final element, fire, belongs to Tom because of his flaming temper and his tendency to explode at people. At times, the language of the book can be tough, but the pain is eased by the glossary of words and phrases in the back. I enjoyed this because of its nagging requirement to think and uncover and allude to God, the history of the world, and the beginning of the book.	2006-01-10

It was a little bit too political for me. It seemed to take a long time for things to happen. The book is very descriptive when it comes to the setting. Every little detail is described, along with thoughts and feelings and I don't like too much detail, I am more of a short and to the point kind of guy. I had a hard time keeping my attention focused. There was a lot of confusion as to what was going on with who, where and mainly what was going on. Many parts of the book I had to go back and re-read to get a full understanding of it and even after I reread it I still didn't get it. The plot was decent, aimed more towards romantics than others. At times it seemed like one big soap. Overall if you have to read it, it is readable, if you are interested in life and the times, you'll like it, if your more into action and adventure, which I am, you won't find it here, however it's not a total waste of time to read. The Great Gatsby is a very dramatic book, and it holds a lot of truth. The main reason I read it is because I heard a lot about it and how F. Scott Fitzgerald is a great author. Many of the things discussed in it reflect on even today's society. So overall it was okay, I personally didn't enjoy it too much but again if you like stuff like this, you'll love it.	2006-01-10

I don't need to say it's the greatest American novel ever written, since so many before me said it much more eloquently.<br /><br />All I can add to the chorus of praise is that this book is much more meaningful when you're a little older and able to appreciate it, and it's actually a very quick read.

Fitzgerald's characters are so well imagined that they take on a life of their own - so much so that turning the book into a film is well nigh impossible.  Even though it has been done a number of times, the casting is usually wrong, at least in part.<br /><br />We have such a vividly personal idea of whom Tom and Daisy, Nick and Jordan and yes, Gatsby are, that no one actor or actress can quite satisfy on the screen.  So too with the symbols, from the light at the end of the dock to the billowy room and those ever- watchful eyes...<br /><br />This book is worth keeping near by, and re-reading often.  Say, once a year.  It really is a modern marvel - and o so much more than a snapshot of its time.<br /><br />Fitzgerald got it so right in this novel that it remains his tragic fate that he never quite equaled his genius elsewhere.  Perhaps because the people are real people, aren't they?  We can, for instance, say that Nick and Gatsby are the two personas of F Scott and that Daisy is pretty much Zelda Sayre, and when we do, we will appreciate them more, not less.<br /><br />Read it for the romance, read it for the razzmatazz, read it for the historicity, read it for the tragedy, read it for fun and read it for consolation.  Gatsby really is Great.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.	2005-12-18

Gatsby, the American archetype, was a poor man in love with a rich girl. Through whatever means he employed, he made a fortune. He reinvented himself and showed up again to win her heart.<br /><br />The idea of being able to be anyone you want to be, or being to change your life mid-course, is an (almost uniquely) American characteristic.<br /><br />Having money, though, is equated with moral flaws. Fitzgerald hammers the point home that people with money are careless: Careless about things and about other people.<br /><br />I vacillate between favorite characters. Usually it's a tie between the narrator, Nick Carraway and Jay Gatsby himself. Gatsby is the modern tragic hero.<br /><br />If you haven't read it in a while, pick it up again.

Hopefully, a new reader reads the book without reading others' interpretations. This is a classic. This is a great read.

Selling over 10,000,000 copies is something which most writers dream of doing for all of their books in their entire career -- something which few can proclaim. This book meets that criteria by its one copyrighted version. Amazing.<br /><br />Sadly, this book today -- in the United States alone -- sells 1.66 books a MONTH for every book sold during the LIFETIME of Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald unfortunately never got to see his work appreciated the way it deserved/deserves to be.

While I was reading it about a month ago, The Great Gatsby seemed like a pointless story of spoiled rich people, too lazy to commit adultery successfully, let alone make a marriage or even romance work.  There was a lot of description about the period, and society behavior of the period, that didn't seem particularly relevant, and the end seemed morally ambiguous.  However, much of this short novel has stuck in my mind, especially the characters, longer than other novels I read (mostly sci-fi and mysteries).<br /><br />It also seemed a mistake to make the protagonist a bystander with only passing reference to Gatsby during the first third of the novel.  On reflection, this probably built up the mystery about the character and kept me reading.  Since then I've watched the movie with Alan Ladd, and they dropped that device, bringing Gatsby in early.  The movie seemed like it would be thoroughly dull to anyone who hasn't read the book, though relatively faithful for a Hollywood adaptation.	2005-12-04

Written from the point of view of Nick Carroway, it was told from a subjective point of view providing the only interesting part of the novel. I'm not saying this was a bad book, Fitzgerald is a phenomenal writer, but even so I couldn't make myself care about the characters. Maybe that wasn't the point, but from the perspective of a pleasure reader it made the book rather dull. As a study of the culture of the twenties or of the theme of time in a period coming directly after WWI, it is amazing and captivating, but the characters were so shallow that I felt a strong detachment as i was reading further and further into the novel. Gatsby is a complete flop, spending all of his energy tryig to redo the past, Daisy is so flippant that you can't truly care for her, Tom cheats on his wife and hits his girlfriend, and Nick allows himself to get sucked into their games. Although written well, and worth all the acclaim it has recieved i personally did not enjoy this novel or find it particularly engrossing.	2005-11-22

Don't read this book, or any book, because you believe it to be \\"a classic.\\"  That term is essentially meaningless, and the people who use it -- either as praise or blame -- generally don't have any souls.  Really.  And that is not a subjective opinion.<br /><br />2.  Do read this book because, in doing so, you may learn things about the reality of America, the dream of America, dreaming itself and the beautiful emptiness of it, and perhaps even yourself.  You may not learn all these things.  You may, in fact, not learn any of them. And, frankly, you may not like the way the book is challenging your conception of yourself once you realize just how deeply it is doing so. But at the very least, even if you hate the book after you have read it, you will have exposed yourself to some thoughts that are, in and of themselves, quite beautifully expressed.  Worse things can happen to you.  And if the worst thing that ever happens to you is that you don't like a book, you'll be luckier than most.<br /><br />3.  A lot of people have found in this book something worthwhile, although it hasn't always been (as evidenced by these reviews) \\"pleasure.\\"  Some of those people may indeed be fools, and others of them may have been hornswaggled by the Evil American Culture Industry into thinking this book was more meaningful to them than, say, the Iliad.  But, probably, the rest of them are just being honest.  You might give them the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />4.  Likewise, a lot of people (albeit fewer of them, again as evidenced by these reviews) have found absolutely nothing worthwhile in this book.  I encourage you to read their reviews, and then to press the \\"read the rest of my reviews button\\" to find out just how many of them prefer, say, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (which is, without a doubt, funnier) to this book.  But, as in thought number 3 above, it is probably a mistake to generalize:  certainly not all of the people who find this book valueless are unsophisticated, imaginationless, anti-intellectual, snobbish, or even just plain douchebags.<br /><br />It is remarkable, however, how often they sound that way.<br /><br />5.  You may disregard thought 4 with respect to Luder of Saddam City.  I'm pretty sure he/she IS a douchebag.  And I reiterate:  he/she really doesn't get the book.  Or, I suspect, books generally.

Gatz is from a lower class Midwestern farming family who falls in love with the wealthy well bread Daisy.  The two are unable to marry and live happily ever after as they are from vastly different backgrounds and social status.  Gatz enlists in the military and upon the end of his service is befriended by a wealthy benefactor who employs him \\"in a vague personal capacity\\".  Gatz's employment provides him the opportunity to see the world, and experience life on the other side of the social strata.  His adventures allow him to reinvent himself and upon the death of his benefactor, Gatsby purchases a mansion on Long Island, near the now married Daisy, and begins the process of recapturing her favors.<br /><br />On Long Island, Gatsby is known for the lavish parties and ongoing entertaining at his mansion.  The east coast rich and famous are regulars at his parties but no one knows the origins of his wealth or his family background.  Unable to connect Gatsby to his riches, the socialites create their own version of who he is and where his money comes from.  Meanwhile, Gatsby pursues a meeting with Daisy in an attempt to woo her from her marriage; now that he has attained the wealth that will certainly please her.  Will the good guy get his girl . . . you'll have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />The story is narrated by Nick Cassaway, Daisy's cousin and Gatsby's neighbor.  It's a brief story that's easily read but I'm not quite certain what makes it such a classic.  The novel does depict the role that class and social status played in American culture during the early 1900 - and still - but I can't say this was a captivating or enlightening read.  While not a favorite of mine \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a permanent fixture upon the American literary landscape and I'm glad I read it.	2005-11-16
US	23251135	R40ZQ6XMSXJML	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	4	1	4	N	N	The Great Gatsby	The Great Gatsby is a very suspenseful and interesting book.  There are many twists to the plot and a lot of unexpected events.  I found myself very surprised throughout the book because of the dramatic changes in the plot.<br /><br /> The characters in the book were very interesting people.  My favorite was Gatsby because of his unusual way of doing things.  He would have parties and not go to them.  This was the most odd thing about him in my opinion.  It was also weird how he could keep his love for Daisy over all the years.  Daisy was a very emotional character and I didn't like her very much for that.  She was always unhappy about something during the book.  When everything seemed alright and when she seemed happy something would upset her.  I found this sort of annoying and that is why I didn't like Daisy as a character.  Nick was a fairly shy character and he was my second favorite.  He always went along with what was happening and never caused too many problems.  He was very down to earth and I like that about him.<br /><br /> The setting seemed very old fashioned to me.  Gatsby's Mansion seemed to be very cool though, almost like a castle.  I liked his mansion and the basic setting of the book.<br /><br /> The plot was my favorite out of all.  I was very bored throughout the book until the end.  This is where it went 180 degrees and everything fell apart.  I loved when Gatsby and Tom got into a fight because it staged the killing of Myrtle.  This put some spice into the book and I was suddenly interested.  George then thought that Gatsby had hit and killed his wife.  When George came down to Gatsby's house it was very suspenseful.  I liked when George shot Gatsby and then committed suicide.<br /><br /> Overall I liked this book a lot.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in reading it.  It was also one of my favorite books.	2005-10-28
US	23278931	RRLHSG7LGG2G5	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	2	6	12	N	N	The Great Gatsby	The Great Gatsby is a book about the upper class in New York. It shows you how luxurious life can be but also how money doesn't bring total happiness. In this book the main character Nick Carraway is trying to break away from his country background and finds himself living in New York. What this book shows  and what Nick finds out and doesn't like are the selfishness of the rich community, the backstabbing, and the shallowness in everybody. These are the reasons that Nick movies back to the country and marries his hometown sweetheart.<br /><br /> In my opinion I didn't like this book for the same reason that Nick left to go back to the country. I thought it was a very difficult book to read because there was never any positive happening to these people and it moved at a slow pace. All the ladies in this book were selfish, shallow sluts who didn't care about  anyone but themselves. This is shown when Daisy Buchanan has an affair with Gatsby. At the end of the book, when it comes down to choosing who she wanted to be with, she pick her husband just because Tom could offer her security and the life style she is accustomed to, not for true love. The men are not any better. They are also shallow, careless, and like to take risks. For example, Tom Buchanan is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson. Myrtle is the wife of George Wilson who owns a garage in the Valley of Ashes. Tom keeps an apartment for her in the city during this book which is the scene of a rather wild party.<br /><br /> Even though I didn't like this book there were still a few parts that I liked. I thought it was sort of sweet how Gatsby had a never-ending love for Daisy. Even though she didn't deserve the kind of love Gatsby gave her, the relationship was kind of a fairytale without a happy ending. I also thought the way Gatsby died was interesting. It was perfect timing for a death  because he never had to go through life suffering, knowing that Daisy his obsession, would never be with him. It was ironic that George Wilson was the one who shot Gatsby because Wilson thought Gatsby was the one who had an affair with and murdered his wife. In fact Gatsby did neither and the only one who came on top was Tom Buchanan, who was responsible for causing pain in both of the men's lives.<br /><br /> All in all I didn't like this book. It was slow moving, boring, and depressing. If I had to recommend this book to a group of people, it would be to adults/teenagers with a lot of time on there hands or if you just like gossip.eorge Wilson was the one who shot Gatsby because Wilson thought Gatsby was the one who had an affair with and murdered his wife.

The book was boring.  Plain and simple.  None of the characters was really likeable, there was no great plot to speak of, and overall just dull in tone.  Sure Fitzgerald is an accomplished writer and the novel is descriptively and grammatically great, but it takes more than that to make a classic.  And sadly, this book fell far short.<br /><br />If you're a high school kid getting force fed this crap, you may emerge with a negative view of the book upon completion, which will mostly be greeted (from your teacher) with, \\"Well, you just didn't understand it.\\"  A little inside info for you (from a teacher).  Most educators teaching this are not necesarily doing so because they personally like the book, but because some genius decided Gatsby was a classic and needed to be shoved down the throat of every kid to graduate high school.  But the teachers will pretend they like it and if you didn't enjoy it they'll say you just didn't get it.  Oh no, I got it all right.  I just wish I hadn't.  So don't feel bad if you disliked the book.  There's nothing wrong with you.  And I completely agree.<br /><br />To be fair, the book isn't awful, so I gave it 2 stars.  I guess my biggest beef with it is just how ubiquitous it is in public education.  It seems every single high school kid has to read books like this just because someone said it was a classic.  Meanwhile, ACTUAL classics like the Iliad, Odyssey, Inferno (and even a little exposure to the Bible wouldn't hurt) are left untouched because they're too old or not American.

I went in, as most high-schoolers do, forced to read and understand yet another \\"great\\" novel, one of the other classics, and steeled myself for the worst. 'This book can't be that bad', I thought.  'I mean, it's a classic.  People the world over rave about it, it's been a top seller for the last couple decades.  That has to mean something.'<br /><br />Now that I've read it through I find myself disappointed.  Yeah, I understand that Gatsby is about the rise and fall of the American Dream and not getting caught up in the past and even how much our past affects our future.  But other than that, to me it reads like a biography of Fitzgerald's life, with himself in the starring role.  I mean, really: the young man who started life poor, who worked his way to the top and falls in love with a beautiful, rich, and not-all-there socialite who turns down his love in favor of a life of luxury.  It doesn't seem surprising that this was written only a few years after his marriage to Zelda - who nearly did not marry him because he couldn't offer her the security and luxury of wealth!  It disappointed me very much to think that this classic of literature is a loose story of FItzgerald's life.  I understand writing what you know, and I've written enough to see the power of writing the stuff you understand, but that's just ridiculous.<br /><br />The language of this book doesn't really read like a true view of Nick Carroway, the supposed narrator - instead, to me it felt more like I was watching a home video shot over Nick's shoulder with Nick providing occasional narration.  Fitzgerald over-characterizes certain characters, giving them true form and personality, almost to the point of nausea - in the first chapter alone he has dedicated an entire paragraph and a half to a description of how wonderful Daisy was and how men all over fell in love at the sight of her - and this is supposedly from the mouth of her cousin!  I didn't get much of an inage of Tom either, but Gatsby you knew to the point of wanting to slap him every single time he said \\"old chap\\" because it just gets annoying.  As for Wilson and his wife, the catalysts and the reason for the book's ending?  Didn't get much of a description of them either.<br /><br />Fitzgerald's skill with emotion is supposed to be one of the reasons that this book is so well-known and loved.  But the ending is the only bit that got a good reaction.  I was disgusted by the rest of the story, and I hated it.  He did have skill with emotion, he did make you connect with the story, but it is good to have such pure and total disgust of something?<br /><br />That's pretty much the sum total.  If you want to really, really feel with a story, Gatsby can do it.  Love it or hate it, you'll be at the extreme, I'm finding.  If you want a story chronicling what is typically considered to be the American Dream and it's ups and downs, this book also is probably a good choice as well.  But I would definetely not recommend it for reading outside of those two reasons, whether those be for school or work or just curiousity.

The 1920's have always intruiged me and this book has made me even more hungry for stuff from this decade. I love Mr. Fitzgerald's method of writing, almost poetic in nature but borderline overly-sentimental (although the Age of Excess as the 20's were deemed may have aided in this extra drama).<br /><br />The way Fitzgerald characterized the rich is also very interesting. From Tom Buchanan to Jordan Baker, these rich social elites are wonderfully crafted with complex personalities. I love it!

This book is so simple, and so brief, and it's not really about much more than a wealthy, mysterious, lovesick man who throws parties to attract a girl he loved and lost.<br /><br />But, it's amazing.<br /><br />F. Scott Fitzgerald was a true wordsmith.  He knew how to use the english language, and in \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" he used it more skillfully than he ever had before.  He was a painstaking writer who went over every sentence over and over again, and his exactness shows.<br /><br />That's not to say that the book is flawless--there are whole books that exist just to list the book's faults, especially in its chronology--but let's see YOU write a book this good.  The book is streamlined and focused, in part due to Fitzgerald's time spent writing an unsuccessful script right beforehand.  The structure of a script--in which every scene leads to the next, and every scene moves the story forward, and the whole thing is resolved in about ninety minutes or so--taught Fitzgerald immeasurable amounts about what this book didn't need to make it great, and about how to propel a story forward.<br /><br />The characters are memorable, the place and time (the jazz era) are vividly depicted, and the writing will surround and enfold you.<br /><br />Ignore that kids have to read this in high school--that it's almost a textbook to them.

He didn't exactly tell me to read it but I got the impression I should. In History class later this year, we went over the Jazz age and I remebered I hadn't read the damn thing yet. I got it from the library.<br /><br />I was expecting bells and whistles, stars, hearts, explosions, so forth from it. This is one of those novels bright eyed twenty somethings mention in gasping tones when people ask them about \\"what changed their lives.\\" But to me, it was not much more then a sad, sparse love story. There's a delicate artistic undertone to it that propels it into the range of \\"art.\\" The \\"eyes of Dr. T Eckleton\\" (sp)  were a powerful and disturbing image, and Fitzgerald's descriptions of the industrial wastleands of West Egg were horrifying and stark. But I didn't form much of an emotional rapport with the story or the characters. That \\"green light over the water\\" caught my interest but not my soul.<br /><br />I found it nice but something I did not contemplate for long. It's enjoyable, worth reading, and short enough for even casual intellectuals to whip on through with minimal pain. Fitzgerald  writes descriptions damn well, and I can admire that.<br /><br />I will give it this - the last sentence is superb.	2005-09-30

Carraway as narrator provided the exact perfect pitch:  more awestruck than he would admit, more moral than it was fashionable to reveal -- always objective and distanced and subtle and charming, genuinely decent and impeccably well mannered, a little dangerously smitten himself by the lovely but corrupt Jordan Baker.<br /><br />Alexander Scourby, one of the greatest reading voices of his era (overlapping Fitzgerald's enough to know and feel it all) here does Carraway in a way that cannot, therefore, again be quite equalled.  Imagine having a recording of a great contemporary actor reading Ahab's speeches in Moby Dick, and one begins to appreciate the gift that we only now have in recorded sound, something we are already quite casual about.  But there is much more here than historical accuracy.  Scourby's voice wraps around every phrase of Fitzgeral's text with both an actor's professionalism and a good reader's care, making it not only uncannily his own monument but also a monument in audio book history.  It sets the bar, and anyone interested in the recorded voice as an art form should own this for repeated learning.	2005-09-29

For that act of inhumanity, I humbly beg forgiveness, though I know full well that the teacher who betrays his students' trust in such a way can no more expect absolution than can the Nazi underling, who, acting on his superior's orders, sends a cowering Jew to the gas chamber.<br /><br />And don't you dare tell me I didn't get the book. Since I was supposed to be teaching the thing I read it three times (well, to be frank, two and half times; midway through my third reading, I gave up in disgust, both at myself, for having persisted so long, and at the novel itself). I mean, who really gives a fig for any of the characters in the book? Or for that stupid green light? Oooh, ah, and the Valley of Ashes! How very apocalyptic! And T. J. Mecklenburg, or whatever his name was. How could anybody really give a fig for any of it?<br /><br />I've also seen lots of reviews where high-school students (probably with plenty of help from their teachers) say they must not be smart enough or mature enough to get Gatsby. Not at all, my friends! Believe in yourselves, youth of the world force-fed Gatsby by illiterate curriculum writers! You are neither too stupid nor too immature. Gatsby, at any age, is simply awful.

FSF states, with a singlemindedness, that in the 1920's, the American dream was corrupted by business, industry, misconceptions, and not living in the present. Also, the narration mirrors that of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" because both narrators are full of contradictory ideas. The first line of Gatsby reads as follows: \\" In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I have been turing over in my head ever since.\\" Shortly after the narrator follows by saying that his father helped him to realize that he should reserve all judgements. But throughout the novel he is constantly judging every single person, and is ambivalent to every single person.<br /><br />In summation, The Great Gatsby is a good book, but is overhyped and does not have that great of a plot.	2005-09-24

That might be why people think it is a soap opera instead of being the solid writing that it is. The main difference between the soap opera and this is a soap opera doesn't really incorporate an opinion about it's characters although it does construct situations that are meant to reach the lowest common denomonator.  In this story, as opposed to soap operas, it does have a cut off point where you can not notice certain details of the story that change the significance somewhat, mainly, Fitzgerald's opinion of his characters and how they play.  There has never been a character in a soap that is portrayed in such a knowing way than the narrator.  What's so interesting is how he can insinuate certain things about the main character with the words he says.  I would be interested to see how little kids react to this book and how older people do because of children's tendency to take everything literally and older people's ability to see through the lies, or half-truths.  It really is a good novel and I don't want to actually detail the plot because I want you to discover it without my introduction.  I will give you the main character, though, the title character is named The Great Gatsby, but his real name is Gatz and he becomes an aquaintance of Nick, the main character who sees himself as objective and fair, and his cousin Daisy Buchanan who's married to Tom.  That's all I'll tell you, read it and have fun, it's a short read.	2005-09-14

An interesting fact is that he was named after his ancestor who wrote the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\".  He was an underachiever when he was in high school but he was intelligent.  He did, however, end up going to Princeton University, though he didn't graduate from there.  He instead enrolled in the army in 1917.  Events in Fitzgerald's life inspired him to write his most famous book, \\"The Great Gatsby.\\"  Fitzgerald died of a heart attack in 1940.<br /><br />The most controversial situation in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" was the disfunctional marraige between Tom and Daisy Buchanan.  Tom was interested in a girl in New York.  Daisy even knew that Tom was having an affair but she tried to love him anways.  She figured that she had to because she had a baby on the way and Tom was the only life she knew.<br /><br />Jay Gatsby lives across the bay from Daisy.  Every night, from across the bay, Gatsby watches Daisy's greenlight on her porch.  Gatsby and Daisy used to love each other before Gatsby went off to war.  Gatsby's absence left Daisy lonely and she married Tom.  Gatsby wanted Daisy back.  He tried to live the \\"American Dream.\\"  He thought this dream would bring his love back to him.  Daisy, however, never heard of Gatsby's return until she was invited over to a lunch which he \\"happened\\" to be at.  The luncheon caused Daisy and Gatsby's love to rekindle and they began to have an affair.<br /><br />Tom found out about the affair and he was furious with Daisy.  He knew he was having an affair himself, yet he still had the nerve to tell Daisy she was wrong.  Tom thought Daisy should be a faithful wife to him.  This was the main conflict which caused all the problems to arise throughout the novel.<br /><br />This conflict really caught my attention.  I felt for Daisy as she was still living the life when her husband was with another woman. I can't imagine the pain she was going through and how hard it must have been to continue to be with him. When Daisy started seeing Gatsby, I did not think she was doing the right thing.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  That was the feeling I had throughout the book, hurt for the way the Buchanan's chose to live their lives.  Their life of cheating, lying, pretending, and settling for less then the best.  I felt this way because I know there are people who really live their lives this way and I wish no one would have to go through that pain.

His style--clean-chiseled characterizations and sentences that cut to the chase--was unlike the work of his contemporaries.<br /><br />Most novels that influence literature in this way die a short death. They are stylistically innovative, but soon other writers perfect what they pioneered. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald manages the amazing feat of simultaneously innovating and perfecting. In that, the novel is pure genious.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is the saddest novel I have ever read, because it goes to a deeper level than just tear-jerking. It ends in a place of complete emptiness, despair, and loss. It's a book that will satisfy you emotionally and intellectually, and also a book that will show you how powerful true emotion can be.	2005-08-30

Four years in fact.<br /><br />As a junior in high school this was required reading. I remember reading it then, checking out opinions on it before getting around to it, and becoming somewhat excited with the conversation and debate that would inevitably follow the assignment. I found the novel then, in complete contrast to my opinion now, to be a completely boring and pointless read.<br /><br />Last year as a college sophmore I decided to give it another go. Enough time had passed where I forgot many of the details of the piece that it naturally seemed like a good idea for a quick read. The lingering first impression of Gatsby, along with the seemingly endless amount of opinions contrasting with my own, convinced me that this book was worth a second shot.<br /><br />Without getting into various personal (and probably subjective) interpretations on the many themes and symbols throughout, I simply have to say that I now regard it as one of the best books ever written. While the aforementioned aspects of literature (themes/symbols) play a large part in distinguishing this book from many others, for me it was the prose and the story itself. It's just too bad it took some personal growth and a bit more patience to finally appreciate it- I can't even go on about it because I loved it so much.	2005-08-11

Good fiction should offer some things to think about, but there's no reason the reader should have to force himself. A good writer ought to tell a story that is interesting enough to spark a natural curiosity in the reader over its deeper implications. The Great Gatsby is a good example of this. Fitzgerald subtly interweves social commentary into a solid story, providing entertainment for the casual reader and enough material for the critical reader to keep himself occupied.<br /><br />I only had two problems with this book: First, Fitzgerald's drawn-out, boring writing style, and secondly, the novel's climax, which seemed a little hokey to me. Other than that the Great Gatsby is a very good novel that I would recommend to anyone who has the patience to sit through boring narration (thankfully the story wraps up in less than 200 pages).	2005-08-03

Perhaps he would not have died from a coronary doubtless related to his depression and alcoholism.<br /><br />The book is told through the impressions of Nick, a middle class fellow, and revolves around Mr. Gatsby. A man who has replaced the fortitude of spirituality with the frailty of materialism in the hopes of acquiring a woman, Daisy, hardly worth his disdain let alone his life.<br /><br />The story reflects the deeper truth that rationality and science alone cannot solve our problems and certainly cannot supplant the need for a higher purpose in life or belief in a higher power. To do so leaves a void too often filled with materialism which is a cheap substitute.<br /><br />This is exemplified in the characters of Tom Daisy and Jordan, souless wraiths who drift aimlessly from place to place  draining the life of everything they touch. Even Tom, who has every conceivable material possession, betrays a longing for days gone by when he was revered as a football hero presumably since this was the only title he ever earned.<br /><br />Gatsby is a compromised and tragic figure partially redeemed only by his solitary quest to fulfull an adolescent meaningless fantasy. Unlike  \\"old money\\" he has a goal however trivial.<br /><br />The fulfillment of his goal is anti-climactic as with all  objects pursued solely for possession and display. The empheral joy of possession is replaced with the enduring meaninglessness of his life and the eventual ignomy of losing Daisy.<br /><br />The end of the story shows the illusion of Gatsby, a young wealthy eccentric enigmatic gentleman, dissipated by the reality of Gatsby, a hollow common criminal consumed by the desire for a used mindless woman.<br /><br />With the contemporary obssession with materialism, in the form of youth, beauty and wealth, to the exclusion of all else the book is more relevant today than it was then.	2005-08-01

His descriptions and evocations here are gorgeous, tender--and most of all subtle, which is why Gatsby is lost on so many modern readers. All of this novel is excellent and parts of it absolutely shimmer--Nick's description of the way Gatsby smiled at him. Look at this...<br /><br />\\"It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced---or seemed to face---the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor.

It's ripe with symbolic imagery from Fitzgerald's personal agony over his wife adulterous affair.<br /><br />Everyone knows the superficial lit class interpretation of the novel; idealistic Gatsby pursues fortune in vain attempt to dazzle and win golden girl, only to have her reject him. Conclusion: classic condemnation of the hollowness of upper class materialism. Rubbish!<br /><br />The story is not political. It is personal pure and simple! It would have taken place anytime, any place those two particular personalities came together. In real life Fitzgerald won his Zelda. But he then promptly and insouciantly cheated on her. She got him back by cheating on him. In his journals Fitzgerald wrote that something died at this time. Shortly afterward the couple moved to Paris.<br /><br />Does this not parallel George Wilson's reaction to his wife's affair in The Great Gatsby?  Yes, Wilson is also Fitzgerald, the tortured, jealous part of Fitzgerald who mourns the loss of his wife even as he realizes her for what she is.  Myrtle is the low class floozy that Zelda has become in Fitzgerald's eyes by cuckolding him.<br /><br />Wilson tries to hold on to his wife by locking her up until he can transact a business deal (buying the coupe) and thereby have the money to take her \\"west\\", something they had long talked about but which he is now going to make her do.<br /><br />Analogously, Fitzgerald sold short stories (seeing himself as stooping to low class laborer by writing for commerce instead of art's sake?)to pay his and Zelda's way to Paris, removing her from her paramour's proximity.<br /><br />Who actually kills Gatsby? The symbol of idealism and optimism (Gatsby)is killed by the symbol of grief and jealousy (Wilson). Fitzgerald was disillusioned by Zelda's adultery not class materialism.<br /><br />Who does that leave Daisy/Zelda with in the end? Tom, the lout, the woman beater, the snob.  Realizing, to his relief, that Daisy will never actually leave him, Tom becomes smug. Go ahead, he tells Gatsby (or any man who now idolizes Zelda), flirt with her all you want.

This is nothing more than an adequately written soap opera of a love triangle that ends in tragedy. I expected great writing; I found the author's writing to be merely adequate and the characters to be wooden. The story is of the lowest common denominator type: a sleazy romance that would have been equally at home in the Harlequin Romance series. The supposedly brilliant portrayal of the Jazz Age was anything but. I am a big twenties fan and know a good deal about the period and Fitzgerald certainly did not capture the feeling of the period for me. The twenties were about Jazz in New Orleans and Chicago, movies in Hollywood, hustle and bustle in Manhattan, not about some spoiled and bored people in Long Island who don't know what to do with themselves (how could anyone have been bored in the 1920's ???!!! There was a good reason why they called it the Jazz Age; it was exciting - to everyone but the clueless numbskulls in this novel). Daisy is supposedly irresistable; she comes across as the twenties version of a valley girl. Any grown man moronic enough to fall for her deserves what he gets. Gatsby is as wooden as any toy soldier.<br />Why, oh why, do academics go crazy over these novels? I think it is because they spend so much time in academia that they have no sense of life outside of universities. I bet there really are professors out there who think that this is a daring, explosive novel. The rest of us, living less rarified lives, respond with a big yawn.	2005-06-23

It is a message to be cautious and savor yesterday so that you do not fall and regret tomorrow. It is in this essence that Gatsby stood out from the others in the story and met a tragic fate at the hands of the careless, shallow, rich and the confused. Who Gatsby was, his flaws, and misplaced love fore Daisy was of no consequence, that was not Fitzgerald's point and many missed it by looking solely at the plot and shallow characterizations and dialogue.<br /><br />While Fitzgerald pointed out many obvious human traits-snobbery, excessive romanticism, carelessness of others' feelings, betrayal, and the shallow curiosity of other people's dramas, as well as the social discrepancies between the rich and the poor scornfully and with distaste, he was barely skimming through the true meaning of his novel.<br /><br />It was not a coincidence that the first 3 settings of the novel mirrored the last 3 settings of the story, in which the past meets the present and affects the future of every main character.

Scott Fitgerald in the 1920's, The Great Gatsby never ceases to depict the fallibility of the typical wealthy American. It is also a fine representation of the American dream and the price that comes along with it. The theme that I was imbued most by was the inability to grasp time: past and present. Gatsby is the typical wealthy American in the 1920's who lives the life wanted by all Americans. His involvement in bootleg alcohol tends to make him a shady character; however, he is in a way the fallible hero. His undying love for Daisy was what brought him to the life of organized crime and illegal activities. Along with the theme are symbols used to further substantiate the theme of wealth and time. For example, the clock that Gatsby tips over and catches shows how he is desperate to take control of time and bring what he wants: a chance with Daisy. His courage and motivation to win the woman of his dreams nevertheless proves that wealth cannot bring back what was past and over. Fitzgerald's use of symbols is what represents most the books' themes. It also serves as a lesson that what is past is past and that there is only a chance at moving on, not staying in the past.	2005-06-09
US	24864083	RIZJCQYWRJ5I0	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	1	3	23	N	N	Not So Great Gatsby	The subjects of the book, The Great Gatsby, are Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchannan. If you are rich and money if no object to you then you would see it as a non-fiction story. But if you are like the majority of other people around the United States, then it would be fiction. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote this \\"great\\" novel that everyone proclaims it to be, which by some and sometimes many will tell you the opposite.<br /><br /> The greatest book ever written in American Literature is just a man (Gatsby) who claims to be in love, but looks to be more obsessed, and is trying to win back his lost love (Daisy). Nick Carraway tells the story in third person. He tells of his summer spent in Long Island, New York with the rich and the richer. Nick describes in a very wordy way how each major event of the summer unraveled and played out. With love, suspense and heartbreak, Nick takes you in and even when you try your best to pull away, you just cannot.<br /><br /> It is not so much the book is great as it is addicting. As human beings we are all curious, and one proverb states that curiosity kills the cat. People love drama, and that is what Fitzgerald perfectly describes in his novel. After fulfilling your curiosity with such descriptive and sometimes complicated wording, some might come to realize that there was nothing great about Gatsby all along. Sure the book maybe interesting but that is because people cannot keep their nose out of their own business. People are curious about other relationships and flings and try to dig deeper into them. So just as in the Great Gatsby, you find yourself digging in for more dirt on the romance of Daisy and Jay.<br /><br /> Once completing the novel, you can see the resemblance to Jay and other people in the modern world. Mr. Jay Gatsby was the pioneer of rich people who swoon the females with his money. He is not great; he is just a bootlegger and a liar, just like a lot of people you might be familiar with in Hollywood. And Daisy Buchannan, what is there really to love about her? She is a shallow, gold digging swine that seems like she needs a taste of what it feels like to have no money. If you watched the movie like I did, then you'd hope she was poor to begin with.  Jay Gatsby is nothing but a fool in love and Daisy is just a fool in love with money. Nick Carraway, well he is just a fool who cannot keep his nose out of where it doesn't belong.<br /><br /> The ending had me wanting more though, wanting to know what in the world just happened. A relationship ended abruptly with no closure, well if this in fact is take from certain events from Fitzgerald's life then I most certainly feel sorry for the many. The end could have been as worded longer and complex just like the rest of the book. But in my opinion Mr. Fitzgerald just got lazy and decided to end the book at that.<br /><br /> The Jay Gatsby was as great as claimed to be, then so is everyone who hustles for a women (Donald Trump, me and every other rich non-attractive male with an overly-attractive partner) is great. And if that is true then so be it. I would like to be known as a great person too and have my memory forever etched in the annals of American Literature.re really to love about her?

Fitzgerald's portrayal of the money, romance and scandal remains unmatched to this day. The story is about the lives of two men Nick Carraway, and Jay Gatsby, and their high class lifestyle back in the Jazz Age in New York. This tale about how Gatsby tries to rekindle the love that him and Daisy Buchanon, who happens to be married. once had. Being the story is not too predictable and keeps you wanting to know more, this is a great read.<br /><br />The greatest thing about The Gatsby is that it's not as long as an encyclopedia lokie some books; it's a fairly quick read. But none the less, it's a good book.  You know it's good when I actually read the book, I hardly ever read anything! What separates this book from the other love stories and makes it a masterpiece is the way that it's not too conceptual or corny. On the other hand the book's also not as conservative, the storyline's like of a soap opera's. This book is great because it's relatable. In the book you can see the materialistic attitudes of America in the 1920', in how they were not evenable to see that their wealth will be short lived and though this is set in the 1920's New York, the same hopes and desires of the characters still applies today. The Great Gatsby is one book that everyone should read, because it's not boring and it's definitely not overrated like some other books. Everyone should pick up a copy of this book. It lives up to the hope.	2005-06-07

Scott Fitzgeralds's novel The Great Gatsby, he manages to completely bore his reading audience by slowing down his depiction of the fictional story.  This novel has a bittersweet storyline to it, which can keep a reader hooked at certain points, but not all throughout the novel.  The love between Jay Gatbsy and the married Daisy Buchanan is just enough to keep this story going, without it, Fitzgerald has nothing to keep anyone wanting to pursue the plot.  The strength of the characters in this novel is also questionable.  This book is one that will not be missed for those who would like to read about little excitement once in a while.  The Great Gatsby is a decent piece of fiction, but its slow formation, poor narration, and lack of enthusiasm fails to keep its audience entwined.<br /><br />The introduction in this novel should just be skimmed, because reading would take too much time and it is far too detailed for any intro.  Much of the background that Fitzgerald puts into the story is unnecessary and for the most part, mundane.  At one point, he goes into detail describing pages of guests that go to one of Jay Gatsby's numerous parties.  ALthough this book does move slowly, some of the romantic moments between Jay and Daisy do cause a little bit of suspense in the storyline.  The ending to this story is also another drawn out process.  It is again filled with a bunch of statements that really do not pertain to the story as a whole.  The end is full of sentimental thoughts that do not really mean much to the reader.  Basically, Fitzgerald becomes extremely wordy when he begins and finishes the Great Gatsby.<br /><br />Nick Carraway, the narrator in this story is a poor character.  As he tells about the individual lives of the characters, he seems to give off a sense of detachment.  Being the narrator, of course, he might be somewhat not as important as the rest of the characters; however, it is almost as if he was not even a part of the story.  The book would have been better without him because he did not do much to give a true insight on the feelings of each person.  He is far too conservative for a person who is supposed to give the opinions about the actions of the main people in the two love triangles.  Perhaps if Nick were more a direct and upfront about his take  on the romantic episodes Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan along with Myrtle Wilson and Tom Buchanan, the audience might be enthusiastic about reading.<br /><br />Fitzgerald uses his own life experiences as a guide in this story, which in a way helps readers understand some parts of the chemistry between Jay and Daisy during the roaring twenties.  The poor guy that Fitzgerald used to be was Jay and the beautiful rich girl that he was in love with, but could not have, was the married Daisy Buchanan.  Although the plot might be fascination enough to keep some readers going others may find the general story far too detailed and at some parts boring.  Sure, the ending might serve as the spontaneity that readers were waiting for; however, they should not have to wait until the end to be surprised.  Most authors may throw the readers many times during a story in order to provoke those people into guessing what might happen.  Fitzgerald does that less than a few times making the novel less enthralling.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is a great story if one can truly appreciate its many details along with its wordy introductions and closings.

Fitzgerald was made to write a smooth and entertaining novel such as, The Great Gatsby, which became a classic of the twentieth century literature. F. Scott Fitzgerald  carefully selects his characters' words as he describes the astounding and fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his strong, innocent intentions as he strives to exalt his love to the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. The Great Gatsby is a tragedy amongst the wealthy and the poor. It is irresistibly melancholy but funny, while  light but sensible from beginning to the end.<br /><br />The story depicts Gatsby's obsession with his one true love, Daisy, whether he was right or wrong to love her, his love for her robs life of all its meaning and purpose. Fitzgerald writes a phenomenal novel, that without a doubt, can be called a masterpiece. His choice of words is very articulate and the description he embodies in every sentence is pleasurable for all readers. Fitzgerald helps the reader to become a part of the novel and connect with the characters. He writes to make his readers be aware of their imaginations, while making them picture the narration perfectly down to the very last detail. Fitzgerald creates fictional characters, such as Gatsby that one can fascinate to and enjoy reading about. This novel is hard to put down, its very easy flowing once you start you just have to finish it!. The book is so dramatic and entertaining that it's easy to miss the fact that it's beautifully written.<br /><br />A work to remember, for I usually have trouble connecting with other books I read for Literature class. The Great Gatsby was such a breakthrough, and a good attempt to get my fascination of dramatic, and suspenseful novels into place. I highly suggest for anyone who would like to read a dreamy, classy, and an outstanding story to pick up The Great Gatsby. The story gives a new thrill of a Shakespearean story \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" with a sensational twist at the end. It proves that not every love story ends beautifully, or the way the main character would like it to, which makes Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby an even more sophisticated and like no other.<br /><br /> This story is not like your average \\"love story\\", it gives away more than you expect. And that clearly shows how an author develops his master piece as he progresses with his writing. I am sure that many young adult readers that come across The Great Gatsby will surely enjoy reading it. It is surely a dramatic novel at it's best!a sensational twist at the end.

Scott Fitzgerald.It is a story of one man's desperate attempt at rekindling a past relationship with a beautiful woman named Daisy. She is a wealthy materialistic woman who, due to the difference of social classes, does not marry Gatsby, and while he is shipped off for war, marries a more wealthy man. The real conflict is set off when Nick Carraway, a distant cousin of Daisy comes to visit for the summer. He tries to help Gatsby win back Daisy, who has now become a very wealthy and popular man by throwing large extravagant parties.  This leads to drama and conflict<br /><br /> This book is Fitzgerald's life in a couple hundred pages Fitzgerald is Gatsby in many ways. Gatsby moved to New York in hopes for fulfilling a dream and so too did Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald met and fell in love with a woman who would not marry him due to the fact that he had no money. He wins her over by becoming a famous author. The alcoholism that is portrayed in this play by the party guests reflects Fitzgerald who became a heavy drinker.<br /><br /> The Great Gatsby was Fitzgerald's attempt at being remembered for a long time. It has always been his dream to be great. Gatsby was Gatz attempt at being great also. I think that is why Fitzgerald entitled his book The Great Gatsby, because Gatsby was supposed to be a great, popular guy who made something of himself. However, Gatsby wasn't great since everyone used him and his main goal to win over Daisy failed.<br /><br /> This book was good in ways that the storyline was interesting and that the ending was very suspenseful. I also liked how Fitzgerald made the narrator a truthful and moral man as the narrator because it allowed the reader to trust that his details of the characters were right, and to trust his judgment which also allowed seeing the characteristics and personalities of each character.  Fitzgerald's in depth description of different aspects was needed but at other times it just felt like a run on words.  It at times did create the mood, but for the most part, it created a boring façade upon the reader. It was slow and the real action of the book occurred late.<br /><br /> Overall, this book wasn't so good. I would not recommend the book to those who like action or drama in every page. The whole story was just one jumble of words that bored the reader page after page.rald's in depth description of different aspects was needed but at other times it just felt like a run on words.

Scott Fitzgerald, takes place in the fantastic city of New York. Nick Carraway, a southern boy, leaves the farms and hills of the South to live where the noisy traffic and tall skyscrapers of the North surround him. Of course to Nick, everything is so different. For one thing, New York is a more \\"open minded\\" kind of place and Fitzgerald allows us to explore the feelings that Nick encounters on such a drastic change. We move along with Nick throughout the novel, bouncing around from character to character. We also find the dramatic difference between \\"West Eggers\\" and \\"East Eggers\\".<br /><br /> Daisy, a second cousin to Nick, is in fact an \\"East Egger\\" and she and her husband, Tom Buchanan, unload a boat load of secrets, lusts, and well kept mischievous acts. Nick of course tries to keep out of things but there is no avoiding what Tom and Daisy are dealing with. Jordan Baker, a pro-golfer, becomes a good friend of Nick's and they both are on the outside looking in on the Buchanan's rocky marriage. Nick finds that he's very fond of Jordan but tries to stay alert so that he will not be sucked into any of the chaos.<br /><br /> What will this novel be without Fitzgerald's most mysterious character, Jay Gatsby? Jay Gatsby, from the very start of the story is a very fine, handsome, and yet awe-inspiring man. Nick's curiosity of this creature only lure's the reader to find out what this Gatsby character is all about. Now of course you'll learn that \\"East Eggers\\" are not too fond of the \\"West Eggers\\" and Gatsby just happens to be a \\"West Egger\\". So, of course there's some dispute between Tom and Gatsby when they are first introduce in the novel. However, this dispute goes far beyond where each men are living. The reader finds out about Daisy's past and how she and Gatsby are more then just acquaintances.<br /><br /> It seems that many of characters in Fitzgerald's novel are looking to attain something. What that something is, well it all depends on that character. Throughout the book we still find that even though Nick begins to talk with Gatsby he still doesn't know anything about him. Gatsby throws these extravagant parties and yet is rarely present at the occasions. However, Nick and Gatsby become very good friends and all the secrets begin to spill out to reveal who Gatsby truly is.<br /><br /> Toward the end of the novel you may think that the story may slowly fade out and the book will come to an end, however Fitzgerald throws a huge shocker that will keep you suspended in your chair.

Scott Fitzgerald's expectations and promoting an authorial pride within him. Years later, while being read by a different generation, Fitzgerald's novel exclaims a different effect. With a tense plot and extreme characters, The Great Gatsby produces a complete grip upon its readers but as the character moves through his summer complications, one can witness Fitzgerald's desperation to create a novel.<br /><br />  Set in Long Island, New York, F. Scott introduces a decent but uninteresting man, Nick Caraway, who decides to visit a second cousin but instead, becomes entangled in the past, present and future interactions of this woman's life. By not emphasizing Nick's personality, Fitzgerald helps the reader to focus on everyone else's. The second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, endures a pressured marriage as he commits adultery. Aware of her husband's disloyalty, Daisy only bothers to disguise her knowing. This opens the novel to theories of immoral behaviour and irony. For Nick's neighbour, Jay Gatsby, happens to be the past love of Daisy and is set on returning her to himself. F. Scott. gives his title character an obsessive yet submissive personality that revolves around Mrs. Buchanan. At certain points within the novel, this can become an annoyance. Gatsby's persistence on obtaining Daisy's affection only causes him damage. Such a plot can induce a reaction from the reader which deserves some praise until Fitzgerald forgets to place a period.<br /><br />  Eventually the novel climaxes with tension and complication. Had Fitzgerald not involved such a tense plot with his writing, the novel would've been an actual bore. His constant babbling and unnecessary explanations can lead one into a deep sleep. Though he was unable to write without ranting on, Fitzgerald does deserve to be complimented on his diversion of personality and East Egg versus West Egg (old rich vs. new) dilemma; a diversion from the all too cliched rich vs. poor. Unfortunately the ending suffers most because it was too verbose. Fitzgerald leaves no suspense, which to some can be a good thing, but it takes too long to get to the results of the climactic events, thus one slowly becomes disappointed.<br /><br />  The Great Gatsby is an otherwise decent novel; not to be called a great American classic, rather a book good when produced during its time. Fitzgerald had struggled in his production and caused ruin to the word format. His ideas, however, were of good enough quality, maybe what suffices for it to be called a great novel; then again, Bukowski also holds that title.sus West Egg (old rich vs. new) dilemma; a diversion from the all too cliched rich vs. poor.

Scott Fitzgerald, is a fictional novel portraying the lives of wealthy young citizens of West and East-Egg, Long Island.  Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby was his chance for something new.  It was his chance for what he believed was greatness.  Today the Great Gastby's name is synonymous with that of Fitzgerald's.  Fitzgerald's novel includes love,mystery, and a myriad of events that would lead to downfall and tragedy.<br /><br />  The story takes place around the jazz era.  Nick, the narrator of the story is a young gentlman who comes out to the west into Long Island into a bonds business.  He spends his summer with his cousin Daisy Bunchanan, her husband Tom Buchanan, and their friend/tennis star, Jordan Baker.  Nick is fascinated by the mystery and lifestyle of his neighbor Jay Gatsby.  Gatsby, the topic of the story, is a man who had built an empire for himself which eventually like many empires, fall.  As much as Gatsby is great, he is plagued with many rumors.<br /><br />  Gatsby befriends Nick to get to his cousin Daisy whom he was once in love with five years ago before he had gone to war.  He goes through many obstacles such as Daisy's husband Tom and his fear of rejection once again.  It turns out that Daisy had rejected him in the past because he was too poor.  Gatsby makes his way up top through some illegal activities accompanied by his friend Meyer Wolfshiem. For years Gastby had been hosting parties and moved to West Egg to lure Daisy and to meet her once again.  After wising to the fact that Nick was her cousin he had found his trump card.<br /><br />  However this novel does not end in fairy tale. It is more of a Shakespeareian play, a tragedy. Althoygh I'm more partial to happy endings, the twist in the story does very well suit it.  The story is wonderfully pieced together, in storym plot, and ending but it lacks excitement.  Maybe Fitzgerald was headed in the direction of simplicity but this is definitely too simplistic.<br /><br />  I don't agree with Fitzgerald's title for the story.  To my knowledge there was nothing great about Gatsby.  He used people to his advantage like the way he used Nick to get to Daisy.  To get Nicks help he would even in a manner, bribe him.  Was it because he was rich and famous?  He became rich through illegal acitvities such as bootlegging with shady figures such as Wolfshiem and he was just as famous as rumors about him were.  There is nothing great about that struggling man.  A more appropriate title would be \\"The Late Gatsby\\".  He is dead inside.<br /><br />  I found some parts of the story quite blurry and hard to understand.  Was the role of Tom Buchanan a bad man or a good yet misunderstood man?

To my knowledge there was nothing great about Gatsby.  He used people to his advantage like the way he used Nick to get to Daisy.  To get Nicks help he would even in a manner, bribe him.  Was it because he was rich and famous?  He became rich through illegal acitvities such as bootlegging with shady figures such as Wolfshiem and he was just as famous as rumors about him were.  There is nothing great about that struggling man.  A more appropriate title would be \\"The Late Gatsby\\".  He is dead inside. <br /> <br />    I found some parts of the story quite blurry and hard to understand.  Was the role of Tom Buchanan a bad man or a good yet misunderstood man?

US	24976584	RE7GOZ511P5AO	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Book Review	The Great Gatsby, a fiction novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a book about romance and the struggle to attain it. The main character and narrator Nick Carraway looks back on the romantic heartaches of Jay Gatsby. Gastby is a wealthy, white man in New York City who longs for the love he once had with Daisy. However, Daisy is married to another man, Tom Buchanan. The book centers around this love triangle and the materialistic society that wants to bask in Gastby's fortune. The mood of the book is very dark, pessimistic, and vapid as set by the purposelessness and carelessness of the wealthy and its tragic ending of both Myrtle and Gatsby. Only Nick Carraway's honest view of life breathes hope into the book's sense of tragedy.<br /><br />Personally, I found the book to be rather sad and depressing. Overall it was entertaining but you couldn't help feeling sorry for the character of Gatsby towards the end of the story. I disagree with how Tom and Daisy seemed to make a mess of people's lives, theirs included, to only leave and let other unfortunate people deal with the repurcussions of their mistakes. Daisy was a woman drawn to money and sophistication. And during the book states that she hopes her daughter grows up to be a beautiful fool, when in reality, Daisy was a fool herself. She constantly let men and their powers by money influence her love and because of this I came to resent her the most of all the characters. It didn't seem fair to me how she killed Myrtle and proceeded to live her life with Tom as if nothing had changed. And it astounded me how Tom could then lead Myrtle's husband, Wilson, to believe that it was Gatsby himself who had killed him. This book only taught me that the great love of money, power, and respect can influence people to do horrible things. This is something you tend to see more and more in society whether you're in the year 1920 or 2005.	2005-06-06

Scott Fitzgerald claimed that his 1925 novel in titled The Great Gatsby was to be his \\"greatest masterpiece\\", in the opinion of at least one reader the book fell disappointingly short of his highly optimistic, and probably unrealistic, expectations. The Great Gatsby is often heralded as one of the \\"great\\" and \\"exemplary\\" literary works in American history, but in my opinion as a reader it is simply flawed and uninteresting. And even though my opinion may not fall into the category of mainstream sentiment towards the novel, take it as a viewpoint less explored, yet still like any other, valid nonetheless.<br /><br />  I had no prior knowledge regarding The Great Gatsby prior to its introduction into my American Literature II class, but after seeing that it had received a vast amount of rave reviews as well as learning about its author, F. Scott Fitzgerald, I must admit I was intrigued by the prospect of a novel with lust, romance, friendships, lies among many other interesting occurrences. Fitzgerald commences his \\"masterpiece\\" in a very descriptive manner, at times overwhelmingly descriptive, by introducing to the reader his narrator Nick Carraway. Nick seems to be an honest and trustworthy narrator throughout the course novel, but in my opinion he refuses to speak of the harsh realities of life to Jay Gatsby, a person who he considers his friend. Nick is very observant and descriptive, qualities essential to any successful narrator of a novel, but at times, Fitzgerald goes over board allowing Nick to ramble on about scenery and how he feels towards certain character's actions and feelings. Some readers may enjoy detail, but excess detail, from my vantage point, makes the story needlessly long and a strenuous read. I in particular do not appreciate it when an author forces me to continue reading a story that seems to take forever to develop.<br /><br /> Another aspect aside for the excess detail used by Fitzgerald, is his weak and clich&eacute; storyline. Its been done, honestly, William Shakespeare wrote this same type of story a while back, Fitzgerald simply chose to give it a twist by moving the setting to the roaring twenties, but unfortunately that added little excitement to a boring and unoriginal story. I will try not to give away any of the major portions of the storyline, but still explain why I feel this way towards The Great Gatsby, and the way it was written. First off the characters are all, in the words Holden Caufield in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in The Rye, \\"phonies\\", prototypical aristocrats of the 1920's, much like F. Scott Fitzgerald himself. That includes the narrator Nick, who leaves the rural mid-west for a life of glamour in the \\"capital of the world\\" NYC. I personally had a difficult time relating to their personalities and their various \\"issues\\". Another aspect that makes the story dull and repetitive is its \\"classical\\" love hook. This is a feeble attempt by Fitzgerald to add spice to an otherwise tasteless novel. Its unoriginal, and not what I expected from one of the best authors in American literature.<br /><br />  Now I will not tear the novel to shreds or call it a waste of time, but I rather watch grass grow than reread The Great Gatsby. If you as a reader are able to overlook the excess descriptions given by Nick throughout the novel, the predictable storyline, and the abrupt and disappointing ending, then you will love this book, maybe even consider it as one of your all-time favorites. But I for one would like to forget I ever read it. If The Great Gatsby is F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"greatest masterpiece\\" maybe we should reconsider his status as one of the best writers in American Literature.honestly, William Shakespeare wrote this same type of story a while back, Fitzgerald simply chose to give it a twist by moving the setting to the roaring twenties, but unfortunately that added little excitement to a boring and unoriginal story.

Scott Fitzgerald's 1920s novel of The Great Gatsby really is. It is quite comical to know the many dissimilar viewpoints there are because from several people, they praised the book and had said that it was one of their favorites, whereas others opposed it stating otherwise. So honestly, I unable to take any of their opinions of what they thought of the book into consideration, thusly I had to read it myself.<br /><br />When I first heard that my literature class and I had the opportunity to read The Great Gatsby, I had an open mind and frankly, I grew with such anticipation. The first few pages immediately begins with the narrator, Nick Carraway, a rather timid man from the mid-west, who becomes quite interested into all the glamour and glitz of the New York, along with the wonder of his uncanny neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Nick is definitely not your average narrator. He generally judges all his surroundings by its cover, and basically has something to say about everything. And with Fitzgerald as the author, all that is being judged is extremely detailed as it can get. Some may say detail is good, but I say, too much detail can get others thrown off and indifferent toward the novel.<br /><br />As the novel progressed in content, I began to grow uninterested. I felt that I wasn't as into the novel like others had appeared to be, and my mindset toward the book wasn't quite as good as I hoped. To be honest, the novel's storyline wasn't half-bad; it was typical, a so-called \\"classic,\\" but nonetheless it was rather acceptable. Fitzgerald focuses on a plethora of different characters dealing with their lives of betrayal, love, and sometimes even death; doesn't that sound quite alluring?<br /><br />Charm is brought into this tragic tale as Fitzgerald adds his romantic side into play. He shows how one character loses his love and strives to regain his love back. It is certainly reasonably endearing, but it appears to show originality on Fitzgerald's part.  To me, I feel as if it has already been done. Uniqueness is the basis to any story, in order for the reader to stay fascinated, the author must create something that is out of the ordinary, therefore keeping the reader more than satisfied.<br /><br />All in all, Fitzgerald's \\"Best American Novel of All Time\\" unfortunately isn't at its best. Honestly, the way he expresses his writing with such perplex detail isn't the smartest approach an author, who supposedly is seen as one of the greatest American novelist in American Literature, should make. As a reader you should consider these factors as to how to judge this so called \\"classical\\" novel written by the infamous and supposed great writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald for yourself.

US	25070990	R2AZ8U6KFA23WY	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	0	1	N	N	The Great Gatsby	The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a dramatic novel that deals with the aspirations and dreams of some people and the way they affect relationships with others. The book's theme is complex yet one that most people can relate to; hope, the passing of time, undying love. The novel takes place in early 1920's New York; normally looked at as a decadent period, where money and partying were ways of life for a generation of young people who knew no other way. Among this crowd stands a group of people (our main characters) who, despite not being susceptible to this way of life, are very much a part of it, and, in some cases, are trapped in by it.<br /><br />The novel is narrated by a young man named Nick Carraway. Long a Midwesterner, he travels to New York in his late 20's to become a bonds dealer. He settles in the \\"West Egg\\" district of Long Island, which, in the fictional geography of the novel, is divided into two boroughs - West and East Egg. He is quickly drawn into the circles of anonymous parties thrown by faceless rich people. His only real contacts are his distant cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her racist, sexist husband, Tom Buchanan. He soon befriends his very mysterious \\"Trimalchio\\" (party host) neighbor, Jay Gatsby, and slowly but surely is caught in the middle of a drama fueled by broken dreams and sincere hope.<br /><br />Once used to the language and literary style of the book (which is very different from more modern writing) this book is very addictive. The imagery is beautiful; often, the very human characters say or do very memorable things, and the storyline is perfectly paced. And many of the issues the author mentions (but does not try to present explanations or solutions for) are still relevant today; class differences, lost love, alienation. And the fact that 80 years have passed since this period does not take you out of the story or dialogue; often, the situations in the book could just easily have happened today.<br /><br />Overall, The Great Gatsby is an excellent book, easily worth reading by anybody. It tells you a lot about the period it was written in, and even tells you more than the generalities often associated with this period; it probes that not everyone in the Roaring 20's were so willing to throw money out of their car windows and hop speakeasys; the characters in this book are struggling with problems in society many people are still struggling with today. I definitely recommend The Great Gatsby.an excellent book, easily worth reading by anybody.

Scott Fitzgerald around 1924-1925. It is told to us from the perspective of Nick Carraway, one of the main characters. Through Carraway we learn about the rest of the characters and their way of living. The book introduces time, love, and reality as its major subjects. From beginning to end, Carraway mentions time for an event that takes place, along with the season which gives a certain type of mood. The character of Jay Gatsby runs after luxury and wealth in order to gain the love of Daisy Buchanan. Through this action Fitzgerald demonstrates the hardship he had to go through in order to be with his love, Zelda. Similarly, other events in the book are related to the author's life.<br /><br />  Fitzgerald raises the issue of morals and decency in this novel, however, each of his character face a problem with morals. Nick Carraway believes he is the only one who is honest and decent but I believe he is not as good as he thinks he is. Carraway secretly forms opinions about the others but when he needs information or company he has no problem being around them. I don't believe this action of his to be decent behavior, consequently he is not decent as he says to be. At first, Carraway is very curious to meet the famous Jay Gatsby, a mysterious and interesting guy everyone talks about, but towards the middle he changes his opinion about him, making Gatsby the mean guy and in the end Carraway is once again on Gatsby's side because he feels sorry for the guy.  Carraway's cousin Daisy is dishonest with her marriage and to her Gatsby, her love. She appears to be innocent and unaware of her husbands affair and yet she herself goes of with another man, not caring about the consequences her marriage would have to face. Jay Gatsby has lied his way into the lifestyle that he is living, all for his true love, which he hopes will someday return back to him. As you can see, Fitzgerald has his characters based on a web of lies and problems, which hardly leaves them any room for happiness.<br /><br />  I believe the novel to be very informative and descriptive. All the characters are introduced with a full detail of their appearance, actions and achievements so far in life. For this very reason, the book did not hold my interest. I thought it to have no real meaning behind it and didn't quite enjoy it even after we were done with the book and surely didn't think of it as a classic. I definitely would not recommend this novel to read but if you enjoy drama that is pointless than go right ahead and read the book.him.

Scott Fitzgerald's sterling 'The Great Gatsby' (1925) is broadly considered the greatest American work of fiction of the twentieth century; with Twain's 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' (1885), it is one of two viable candidates for the mythic title of the Great American Novel. Coming on the heels of the glib, hilarious 'This Side of Paradise' (1920) and the overextended 'The Beautiful And The Damned' (1922), 'The Great Gatsby' represented both an immense step forward in Fitzgerald's artistry and the kind of achievement only a handful of writers are capable of producing over the course of a lifetime.<br /><br />What makes 'The Great Gatsby' all the more remarkable is the fact that the economically-written novel is built upon a thin, almost predictable plot which concerns itself exclusively with crass, spiritually coarse people.<br /><br />With the exception of hopeful, naive narrator Nick Carraway, almost all of the characters are frayed personalities existing in a depthless, moment to moment world which lacks values, substance, and any inherent quality worth living for.<br /><br />Magnificently wealthy Tom Buchanan is an earthy, brutish man who believes that \\"might makes right,\\" while his attractive wife Daisy is a skittish, shallow, and unintentionally callous woman apt to go with whatever the wind blows her way. Their friend Jordan Baker, a jaded sportswoman with a talent for shrewd social observation, illustrates the novel's cynical view of both humanity and the American way of life. Jay Gatsby, whose flaws are somewhat easier to sympathize with, stands in contrast to these diversion-seeking characters.<br /><br />Gatsby is a delusional man with a benevolent God complex, a manipulative, calculating individual who falteringly believes that the past--and the truth--can be obliterated and permanently transcended by sheer force of will. Unlike the Buchanans and Jordan, Gatsby has more than filled the empty void of the universe with his fantasies of romantic fulfillment. But Tom, Daisy, and Jordan eventually show signs of human feeling and moral awareness, however briefly, while Gatsby, who is also exceedingly wealthy, clearly reflects their superficial vision in some of his own choices, actions, and values.<br /><br />The genius of 'Th'e Great Gatsby' is evident in the manner in which Fitzgerald subtly underscores and illustrates the motivators that drive and define the American psyche. In an America that is both a relatively new country as well as a capitalistic one, Gatsby and Tom are concerned with recreating themselves and achieving self - esteem, social respect, and power through the attainment and maintenance of wealth, the single recognized indicator of success in their world.<br /><br />A distorting-mirror image of the American Dream, 'The Great Gatsby' illustrates how a sincere desire for evolved selfhood can instead devolve into a nightmare scenario of the nouveau riche. To his credit, the pseudo-heroic Gatsby has a larger, if impossibly imagined, goal beyond the accumulation of wealth, property, and friends.<br /><br />The novel is also a meditation on how the American desire to achieve a socially respected, successful identity usually requires moral compromise and a series of carefully - constructed fabrications, which in turn may lead directly to self delusion. Jay Gatsby may be American literature's most famous chameleon, though one ultimately lacking the nimble antisocial personality to successfully pull off his charade.<br /><br />Interestingly, few establishment critics have commented at length on Gatsby's youthful relationship with wealthy, older mentor Dan Cody, a suspect relationship that Nick rightly refers to \\"strange.\\"<br /><br />As a striking but penniless young man, Gatsby has been employed by Cody \\"in a vague personal capacity\\" while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary and even jailor.\\" Having traveled together three times around the world by yacht, their longidle comes to end when Cody's wife Ella suddenly comes \\"on board\\" and puts a stop to their companionship. Then Cody--bereft of Gatsby's company--suddenly dies.<br /><br />As an adult, Gatsby keeps a portrait of Cody prominently displayed in his mansion, which Nick calls \\"a token of forgotten violence.\\" Is Gatsby, despite his troubadour-like obsession with Daisy, in fact bisexually inclined? Or has his relationship with Cody merely been an opportunistic means to an end? Or one of honest mentoring?<br /><br />When Gatsby invites Daisy to see his palatial estate, Nick is surprised to suddenly come upon Klipspringer, a man Gatsby refers to as his \\"boarder.\\" Klipspringer, who has never previously been mentioned in the narrative and who promptly disappears back to wherever he came from, is discovered \\"in pajamas\\" \\"doing liver exercises on the floor\\" in one of the spare bedrooms. Nick then recalls that he has seen the mysterious Klipspringer \\"wandering hungrily about the beach\\" earlier that morning.<br /><br />During an uncomfortable lapse in conversation, Gatsby lights on the idea of having \\"Klipspringer play the piano,\\" and calls out \\"Ewing!\\" Entering, Klipspringer is described as \\"an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair.\\" Sitting at the piano, Klipspringer plays a song of his own choosing, tellingly called \\"The Love Nest.\\"<br /><br />Fitzgerald makes it evident that Klipspringer is both 'artistic' and subordinate to Gatsby's whims. Curiously, Nick, who is fascinated by the enigmatic Gatsby's motivations, never raises the question of Klipspringer again.

Scott Fitzgerald's tale of American values in the jazz age of the 1920s is one of the great classics of 20th-century literature.  The novel is written about Nick Carraway's sum up of his summer in New York where things aren't what they appear to be in the life of luxury.  He visits his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom in their lavish home only to discover how unhappy she is.  He returns from his visit to his home to see the figure of his mysterious neighbor Jay Gatsby. From that moment, Nick's life became more engaged in Gatsby's life than he could possibly imagine.<br /><br />This novel describes each character with great detail.  Detailed facts about each person's personality appeal to a wide variety of readers.  This allows them to have a better understanding of the situation they are put through.  Readers are able to put themselves in the characters' positions and wonder what they'll do next.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby, however, shatters the American dream.  During that time period, people came to America to earn an honest living.  While reading through it, it was evident that this idea was shattered by greed.  Any person with much wealth gained a great deal of power.  For example, Meyer Wolfsheim, a bootlegger and Gatsby's friend, became wealthy by being a criminal.  He exclaims about how he fixed the 1919 World Series with the utmost pride.  He was capable of such things because of his wealth through illegal activity.  Fitzgerald destroyed the vision for the common people.<br /><br />The book is wonderful for a high school level.  The classic deals with topics like alcohol that students in the middle school shouldn't be reading.  Another topic is that of adultery.  Tom Buchanan was having an affair during that story.  Elementary school and middle school children might not understand that it's wrong.  Beyond the story, the vocabulary and terms used are quite difficult to grasp.  Some readers might need a dictionary for a better understanding.  This is excellent for study to achieve better word usage.<br /><br />I loved Fitzgerald's style of writing.  He describes the time period so well of the Jazz Age.  The parties that take place at Gatsby's home are great account of the 1920s. Things were lively and full of entertainment and this novel explains it so well.  The setting and environment is brilliant; I'm sure many will love it, too.<br /><br />F.

Look beyond obvious plot details and into the intricate web of colors and name symbology to fully appreciate this book. To all the disappointed high schoolers out there, grow up before you read this novel and learn to appreciate this writing for what it is: a nostalgic tribute to a changing society, not an adventure novel for your shallow entertainment.	2005-05-18

For those of you who were initially not impressed, look past the somewhat sordid plot. His characters are living breathing people, but also emblems of America. This book was carefully constructed.

I read The Great Gatsby in my senior year of high school, and of course, it was not particularly my favorite book. If someone asked me why I did not like it for the first time, I would say that I was not concerned about the author's language but the plot of the book.<br /><br />  About a year after I had read the book, I chose to read The Great Gatsby for the second time because I wanted to know what other people meant when they referred to Fitzgerald's \\"beautiful writing.\\" Even though I chose to read The Great Gatsby, by myself, I did not expect to get something different out of it. However, surprisingly, the second time was so much better than the first time.<br /><br /> Before I read this book for the second time, I did not understand what my English teacher meant by \\"beautiful writing\\". I do not want to say that it is the best book that I have read in my life, but it has descriptive writing that keeps people's attentions. I can say with confidence that it is a well-written book that has \\"beautiful writing\\" and engaging characters.  I can picture Gatsby's parties and what Daisy looks like because of the metaphors that Fitzgerald uses in his book.<br /><br /> I consider The Great Gatsby one of the \\"greatest\\" American novels because it not only entertains people but also leaves many questions. However, I looked at other reviews from the Amazon.com, and I was little upset that some people did not appreciate Fitzgerald's writing.  My advice to high school students who did not enjoy this book is that they should try to read it outside of school. I guarantee that everyone will have a different reaction to the book the second time.	2005-05-03

It seems to be about nothing on the surface, but for some reason, it feels like there is an undercurrent of meaning that just didn't come through for me.<br /> The book is narrated by a man named Nick, who moves out to West Egg on Long Island to learn about bonds in the 1920s. His cousin Daisy lives on East Egg with her husband Tom, though they don't have a good relationship.<br /> Next door to Nick lives a self-made millionare named Gatsby, who throws weekly wild parties at his house, but seems to have a sad secretive side. Gradually, Nick gets to know these people, but not a whole lot else seems to happen for quite a while. Tom has a mistress named Myrtle, who is married to a car mechanic.<br /> Eventually, Gatsby begins to confide in Nick, and tells him that he once knew Daisy and wanted to marry her, but left to fight in the war. By the time he came back she was already married. His wild parties were designed to attract her attention so he could see her again. Nick eventually gets them back together, and finally one hot day, Gatsby confronts Tom.<br /> They had gone into NYC for the day, and argue hotly over who Daisy really loves and who she's going to live with, but eventually, Tom pretty much wins. He sends Gatsby back to East Egg with Daisy while he stays with Nick and another girl, Jordan.<br /> Meanwhile, the car mechanic has finally discovered that his wife is cheating on him. He tries to lock her up, but she runs out the door and is hit by Gatsby's car. Driving by a little later, Nick and Tom see this and are convinced that Gatsby was driving, though it was really Daisy. Gatsby decides not to tell anyone the truth to protect her.<br /> By the next day, Tom and Daisy have left the state and Gatsby seems tranquil, but there is a sense of foreboding. Nick has to leave for work and when he returns, Gatsby is dead in his pool, killed by the mechanic because he thought Gatsby had killed his wife. This part was a little confusing.<br /> In the end, Daisy doesn't seem to really care about Gatsby, and no one comes to his funeral except for his father and Nick.<br /> By the end of the book, I definitely felt that it meant something, but it seemed very hazy and I couldn't figure out exactly what. I think it has something to do with caring more about appearances and money, than anything else. I would recommend reading this book as it was fairly enjoyable after the first chapter, but if you're a teenager you probably won't understand it completely.

US	38545210	R2SBTSDU8GGQR9	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	2	8	19	N	N	The Grating Gatsby	This is the unfortunate case of the reputation making the novel, rather than the other way around.  I found \\"the Great Gatsby\\" very dissapointing.  Its said to be the greatest American novel of all time, yet I found it largely uninteresting and poorly written (in light of its reputation, that is).  The characters are not dymanic, and the novel's apparent focus -- that the wealthy, petty, aloof inhabitants of both East and West Egg are interchangeable -- is made evident during the first chapter.  The novel centers on a host of blase characters - Gatsby chief among them -- whose lavish parties are attended by strangers, and whose funerals are attended by nobody.<br /><br />This is not the \\"Great American Novel\\" - actually, its far too short to qualify as a NOVEL. Novella, maybe. Limerick, more like it. only limericks are at least amusing.<br /><br />Theme One: Old money, new money, the perceived difference in the have's and have more's.  Whether East Egg, West Egg or Fried Egg, its nothing more than a distinction without difference.  I found the same message in Dr. Seusss's story of the Sneeches - and at least that rhymed.<br /><br />Theme 2: You can't escape the past.  Thanks, Nostradummy. The past repeats itself. Much like Fitzgerald's tired themes and characters.<br /><br />Theme 3: Love = jealousy.  There is no great romance here.  This much is evident when Gatsby admits to Daisy that it is not her love that he desires, but for to have loved no other, even in the past.  The much-lauded green light at the end of the dock?  Just another symbol of petty jealousy, not the sign of \\"hope\\" as some commentators believe.<br /><br />But is not the bland characters that make this novel unworthy of its reputation; it is the fact that the characters are fully fleshed out by page 20, and remain static throughout the remainder of the novel.  Read Dr. Seuss instead. You'll read the same themes in the same amount of time, and if you're going to write on the level of a 6-year-old, you may as well do it intentionally.y.	2005-04-27

Its said to be one of the best American novels of all time, yet I found it lacked maturity as well as development. The novel is about Nick Carraway's friendship with Jay Gatsby, a mysterious wealthy 30 year-old who throws lavish parties where most of the guests are not even invited and don't know the host at all. Gatsby reveals to Nick through a mutual friend named Jordan that the reason he has been throwing parties for years is because he hopes that the love of his life will somehow walk into one...<br /><br />Gatsby is a generous but painfully removed man who cannot forget Daisy,the love of his life who he hasn't seen in years, since before her marraige to another man named Tom. I thought that the plot was good, but it need more development and the characters needed more depth. 'The Great Gatsby' is a short read, I read it in a day, and found that Fitzgerald's style is continuous from that of his first novel, 'this Side of Paradise'. The only credit I do have to give to Fitzgerald is that his word flow is very readable and his revised sentences are nearly perfect. I wouldn't recommend reading it unless you are an absolute fan of Fitzgerald, you want to learn about the Roaring Twenties, or want a short and hardly romantic and at times boring read.	2005-04-06

The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book, I dont see the need for highschool students to be reading this. Personally, I dont believe that they have the mind for it. He or she is not mature enough to understand the value of this book. They dont see the agony Gatsby goes through. The lust he has for Daisy and wanting her more than every material object on this earth. He puts this girl in his mind and he cant get her out. EVen though he is well aware she is with another guy, that she may or may not truely love. Either way he wants her but cant get her and he feels his life is not complete without her. So many adults do that today, teens dont understand, their idea of \\"love\\" is spelt with l-u-v. They just dont get it. If you are in highschool, your gonna hate it, read it when you have grown up.

It is not a diffiuclt read, so it is reasonable to see why so many of us have or will read this work during our high school days.<br /><br />Our story's protagonist, Nick Carroway, is the real focus of the story, despite the book's title. Gatsby is merely the focus of Nick's observations. Beginning as a person of mystique and fascination to our protagonist Nick, Gatsby lives a life of luxary and prestige. Throwing lavish parties and seemingly on the top of the world, Gatsby is merely putting on a show. The lavish lifestyle he displays is meant to represent what can be achieved if you work hard to find the 'American Dream'. The whole concept of the American Dream is what this work is continually tied to, that Gatsby has a great number of skeletons in his closet and that he lives in rich misery because he cannot be with Daisy, his one true love.<br /><br />THE GREAT GATSBY is a book with a meaningful point, yet it is a somewhat dull read. While it certainly does not lack staying power, it is understanable why so many students gripe at having to fight their way through the sometimes tedious moments. THE GREAT GATSBY is great for some, but a chore for others.	2005-03-24

This is one of those novels that is so beautifully melancholy and tragically romantic as to inspire countless additional readings. F. Scott Fitzgerald has the most unique and surprising way with words. This book not only moved me with its lyricism but left me often with a sort of physical feeling that I simply cannot find words to explain.<br />This novel says so much about the emptiness and excess of the jazz age as experienced by the wealthy leisure class.<br />Fitzgerald so wonderfully portrays the idea that it is the STRIVING for greatness that counts in life, because once it is reached, it can never possibly live up to the grandeur that one envisages in dreams. In many ways, this book suggests the end of the American dream, and while Gatsby himself is not far from reproach, he represents the desire in all of us to be something better. He is both flawed and beautiful; lonely yet eerily surrounded.<br />If you want to be moved, read this book...and really pay attention to the language and the mood; it may very well change the way you see the world.	2005-03-10

I truly, truly do not understand how and why this book is considered a classic novel. Excluding foreign works that put this book viciously to shame, even for an American novel, this is not an extraordinary achievement. I'll admt, however, that had this been called a short story, I should have more respect for it; but it is considered a novel! one of the greatest novel of all times, one reviewer wrote! Anyone who believes that has never read a single \\"great\\" book in his or her life. Read \\"The Man Who Laughs,\\" \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" anything by Chekhov, \\"Les Miserables,\\" \\"War and Peace,\\" \\"The Magic Mountain,\\" \\"The Decameron,\\" or even \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and then come back exclaiming this is \\"the perfect novel!\\" It is not. It's wretchedly unorganized, sloppy, more shallow than a puddle of water quickly drying in the sun, poorly written, overly ambitious, and in everyway wanting. I was not forced to read this for highschool, I did for enjoyment, and though I found the work enjoyable, it was enjoyable in the way that a movie is enjoyable: a brief moment of delightfulness. \\"Long Journey into Night\\" had more literary qualities than this, and that's a movie. I do not mean to sound harsh in this review, but I wish American readers had the ability to recognize great work. But as I was commenting on earlier, even as an American novel, to place this swill on the same level as \\"true\\" American classics such as \\"As I Lay Dying,\\" \\"The Awakening,\\" and \\"Walden\\" is an insult to the genre. I hope this review has been helpful.	2005-03-08

It really captures life in the 1920's in a way that leaves you breathless. This book is not made for optimists; its ending is very depressing. This resolution, however, is needed in order for the reader to receive the full impact of what the author is trying to say. Fitzgerald does a remarkable job of using symbolism of many aspects of the book. It is the symbolism that really makes the book the great book it is. The only negative aspect of the book is the extensive vocabulary Fitzgerald uses in certain sections of the book. It is good to have juicy vocabulary in a novel, but the author just saturates his book with these vocabulary words. This takes away some of the interest in the reader, for they will spend some time pondering what the author was talking about. Overall, the Great Gatsby is a wonderful book for everyone to enjoy.	2005-03-08

Scott Fitzgerald is a Midwesterner who came to New York City to try his luck. Many great New Yorkers came from outside the City (PT Barnum, Robert Fulton, Alexander Hamilton, etc.). However, their fresh perspectives of Gotham--something a native might overlook--allowed them to see things in a different way. Nick, the narrator of THE GREAT GATSBY, is also a Midwestern boy who comes to New York. In Jay Gatsby, Nick sees someone alluring, mysterious, dazzling, intimidating, aloof, and shady--all those qualities associated with Jazz Age New York. And the population of Gatsby's parties, like the population of Roaring 20s New York, are money-, power- and sex-hungry, yearning for celebrity, and, in many cases, hollow people who drink too much.<br /><br />For all the drinking, Nick's view (and therefore Fitzgerald's) is incredibly sobering and clear-eyed. Caught up as he is in the excitement, he is often repelled by some of it. THE GREAT GATSBY, in my book, contains some of Fitzgerald's most lyrical writing. In form, character development, and plot, this book stands out as just an important book of early 20th century American literature as anything by Steinbeck, Dos Passos, or Dreiser.	2005-02-17

The way he writes of the character's reactions and emotions seems so realistic, that is what I beleive will make it easy for one to read and get \\"into\\", so to speak.<br /><br />  Now, yes, Fitzgerald was an alcholic, but that does not mean that he wrote this while being drunk. Quite the contrary; Fitzgerald is known for his notorious revisions - in which 'Gatsby' was revised several times before he was satisfied with it.<br /><br />  I am saying this to basically let the reader know that it is very worth giving it a chance, and even though by the end it may not be ones' \\"favorite\\" story, however it is a very good introduction into the writings of F.

Scott Fitzgerald, \\"social historian\\" of the Lost Generation of disillusioned writers in the post-war world. Fitzgerald's prose and style so eloquently capture the fleeting spirit of the 1920s, the breaking through of social taboos and finding little on the other side, the desire for something impossible, the continuing themes of disillusionment, spiritual isolation, and death.	2005-02-15

No other book out there fleshes out the pre-World-War-1 era like this one.  Everyone knows the story is about a man who amasses a lot of wealth by various dubious means, solely to please Daisy, a socialite that he has his heart set on.  Daisy had rejected him once before in favour of a social equal, Tom Buchanan.  But poor Gatsby.  No matter how high he rises, he is doomed.  When he takes the blame for a hit-and-run murder committed by Daisy, he is murdered by the victim's husband.  Gatsby is an anti-hero.  His main fault is that he has fallen in love with the wrong girl.

Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece is one the finest novels America has produced. It centres on the lives of a few wealthy New Yorkers during the 1920s, and is now thought of as epitomizing the `Jazz age' more than any other novel (hell, more than ANY other book for that matter).<br /><br />Through the main character Gatsby's love for Daisy, Fitzgerald shows us how we become blinded by our dreams, and yearn so much for them that they take over our perception of reality. But Fitzgerald was also giving a scathing criticism of the materialistic lives of the wealthy, as the sub plots and numerous conversations in the novel show. The narration of the character Nick is superb, and the numerous flashbacks that he describes are brought on so effortlessly that the reader often forgets they are occurring.<br /><br />I have read the Great Gatsby twice, because this really is the type of book that needs to be read more than once. It works on so many levels that cannot be fully grasped in a single read.

US	14831590	R19TCWK440PHA	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Superb Novel	A lot of people tend to say The Great Gatsby is an overrated piece of literature, however I agree with the majority that considers it one of the finest pieces of 20th Century American literature (or literature from any period, from any country for that matter). The story is pretty familiar to most so I won't summarize it, however if it's possible for you I highly recommend listening to the 1984 audio cassette version narrated by Frank Mueller (who was and indeed still is probably the greatest audio-book reader anywhere). Mueller's rich and inflective voice is a joy to listen to; he makes the story's prose -- already inherently poetic -- even more beautiful by greater life by stressing certain words/phrases and changing his voice slightly for each character.<br /><br />This book seems a little short but it accomplishes a lot for what it is. It's a simple basic story with a lot of complex symbolic meanings, and that's probably why it gets studied so much. If you want further fascinating reads, a biography of Fitzgerald's turbulent life (he died young at 40) reads like a true-life allegory of his stories.<br /><br />So, definitely read the book! Definitely listen to the tapes! Definitely watch the 1974 Redford film NOT because it's particularly well dramatized but just for the great costumes and period settings. After watching the movie, even though I didn't think it was a good one, I still picture Robert Redford as Gatsby, the shrill Mia Farrow as Daisy, and that one dork whom I can't name as her husband, Tom.<br /><br />A special treat might be the 50s version starring former heartthrob and current dead actor Montgomery Clift. He gives a subtle, nuanced performance compared to Redford's \\"it's okay if I can't act well in this movie because I'm good looking!\\" portrayal.	2005-01-26

The glitz of New York in the 1920's barely overlays its moral decay.  Our ambiguous narrator, Nick, is repulsed by this at the same time as he is complicit in every event of the story.  The distant and pining figure of Jay Gatsby, who longs for a woman he can never have, represents the belief that money can buy anything and the purposelessness that would occur if a dream were fully realized.  As a near-perfect example of modern literature, Gatsby uses symbolism itself to show that symbols only hold the meanings with which we vest them.  For example, the symbol of the eyes is so haunting because it infuses the story, but has no fixed meaning or context.  As long as this novel remains a beloved classic, America will never fully be able to divorce itself from its past.	2005-01-25

There are some who call it \\"boring\\", \\"pretentious\\", \\"pointless\\" and most of all, \\"confusing\\".  However, the beauty in this masterpiece is Fitzgerald's weaving of what (we can conclude) he may have witnessed in his own life of wealth, carelessness and debauchery.  He had a way of seeing through people's facades and getting to the truth of a person's heart, and then revealing these truths in deceptively simple ways.  There was his genius.<br /><br />Jay Gatsby is one of the great tragic heroes of any time.  He has amassed a great deal of wealth, but doesn't know what to do with it.  He uses it to throw parties for people who don't know him, and who don't care that they don't.  His myth is bigger than he is, and so he doesn't set them straight.  He is a pathetic, lonely creature who comes alive again after he reunites with Daisy, his lifelong love.  But this happiness, too, is elusive and fleeting.  And it is his undoing.<br /><br />My favorite parts of the work are the descriptions of the times, the people, the places.  When reading this book we are afforded the opportunity to cut through the glitzy, glamorous depictions of \\"the roaring twenties\\", and instead see the darkness, emptiness and loneliness all that glitz was supposed to be covering up.	2005-01-10

The writer's vivid descriptions of the Jazz Age ranks as the best, and his language and character development can be understood by young and adult readers both.<br /><br />Published in 1925, this book has many events inspired by Fitzgerald wealthy life. The narrator --and one of the main characters--, Nick Carraway, like his creator, is a young man from Minnesota educated at an Ivy League School (Yale), who moves to New York after the war. At the same time, the main character, Jay Gatsby, also share many things in common with Fitzgerald. Both are young and sensitive, and, what is more interesting, is the fact that they have a very romanticized vision of wealth and love, and felt in love with a young woman when in a military camp in South.<br /><br />Nick starts his narrative telling that his readers an advice his father gave him, telling that when he feels like criticizing someone he should remember that he is not in a position of doing so, because he has had many advantages in his live. Beginning with that, it is sort of a disclaimer as if the writer is telling that in his narrative he is just portraying a story, rather than making judgments on the events and people. Smart movie -- since most of the novel reads like a big criticism against the lost of the American Dream, due to money and corruption.<br /><br />Nick is learn bond business, and lives in New York. He rents a house in the West Egg district. His neighbor seems to be wealthy and happy -- he is throwing parties in an everyday base. One day he goes to East Egg to visit his cousin Daisy and her husband. He meets young Jordan Baker, a young woman who claims to know his neighbor. He is Mr Gatsby. She also tells him that Tom has a lover.<br /><br />Days later, Jordan invites Nick for a meeting and tells him about Daisy and Gatsby. They used to date before the war. And now, the man wants that Nick and Jordan arrange a meeting for him and Daisy at Nick's. Once the couple meets again, the tragedy starts in the characters lives.<br /><br />By telling this American Tragedy -- and loss of American dream -- Nick is very contradictory. To begin with he is making judgments -- not following his father advices --alternating moments when he is very objective, and moments when he seems to give his own interpretation of the facts.  What also has resonance in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is the nostalgic tone adopted by the narrator. He seems to be telling about the end of a civilization that no longer exists, and at the same time he feels guilty for its destruction.<br /><br />On another point, Nick/Fitzgerald is criticizing the hollowness of the upper classes. This is the part when the book has a sociological --and not only literary-- interest. The West Egg citizens represent the noveau rich; while the East Egg ones are the aristocracy. The newly riches are vulgar and have no social grace or taste. Gatsby is his most effective example of that. But the aristocracy, on the other hand, lacks heart -- they don't care if hurt other people. Ironically Gatsby's best qualities (love and loyalty) are what lead him to the tragedy.<br /><br />\\"The Great Gastsby\\" is a very short and entertaining book.

Written in the first person, its detailed descriptions and sensitive humor remain immensely readable, even as the lives of the characters descend into troubling, inevitable chaos.<br /><br />The namesake character, Gatsby, is an intriguing mystery who happens to live next door to the narrator, Nick.  Gatsby's house is an overwhelming mansion that serves as the location for many a party among the city's idle rich.  Nick gradually becomes entangled in their lives and carefully observes the drinking, carousing and (oftentimes) harmful behavior.<br /><br />As Nick tries to unpeel the layers of the mysterious Gatsby, desiring to discover the source of his fortune, he instead discovers a secret he'd be better off not knowing.

F. Scott Fitzgerald is a prime example of one who writes so well that he makes it seem easy.<br /><br />Like his contemporary Hemingway, he had the ability to make shocking statements without exclamation or over-emphasis. Also, his narrator is in a way a step removed from the central story, although having his own demons and hang-ups; in the end he is an irreplaceable part of Gatsby's sad ending.<br /><br />The story transports the reader into the 1920's, when bootlegging and infidelity were taboo but evidently commonplace. Idealistic love, and its dissolution, are at its core. This makes the novel timeless. Daisy Buchanan (the central female character) represents the type of ideal, rich, carefree woman that the 1920's is known for; Jay Gatsby the swashbuckling and debonair type that women sooned over; urbane and unaccountable. Perhaps the novel shatters the shallowness of those simple stereotypes. It is not by any account a feel-good reminiscence of the Jazz Age. bit something much deeper. The brilliance is that it makes you pine for the era while exposing the obvious superficiality present within it.	2004-12-25

While I understood the concept he was getting at (we read this in English, and we discussed this book until I was sick of it) it still failed to truely interest me.  This is a story of the shallow twenties, when the rich threw glamorous parties to flaunt their wealth, and those that went to the parties went to flaunt their own.  In the middle of this stands Gatsby, trying to find his lost love, and the narrator, who finds himself drawn up in the relationships between Gatsby and his companions, which rapidly degrade due to Gatsby's delusions of himself and the world around him.<br /><br />  I liked what Fitzgerald was getting at, yet the story itself of Gatsby and Daisy and all the rest just bored me.  At no point in the story did I care about what happened to any of the characters because, as another reviewer said, they were very shallow, as Fitzgerald may or may not have intended.

This book is about Jay Gatsby, a young wealthy neighbor who lives in a huge mansion, and his tragic love for Daisy Buchanan, Nick's beautiful cousin. However, she is already married to Tom Buchanan. Gatsby once dated her before World War I but had to leave to fight in it. He still loves Daisy though after many years and moved back to New York to impress her with his wealth. Apparently, she does not realize Gatsby even lives there because he asks Nick to organize a reunion with her. Nevertheless, Daisy falls back in love with him during the reunion and the two begin an affair. Gatsby then stops throwing his extravagant parties as they were only meant to attract her attention. Before long, Tom learns of their relationship and is outraged by his wife's infidelity, even though he is already involved in an affair with a woman named Myrtle Wilson. Afterwards, he forces a group of friends including Nick and Daisy to accompany him to a hotel where he confronts Gatsby. There, he accuses him of making his fortune illegally by bootlegging alcohol. Attempting to prove he cannot hurt him, Tom sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby. However, while driving through a road, Nick, Jordan, and Tom discover Gatsby's car struck and killed Myrtle earlier. Nick then learns from Gatsby that Daisy was actually driving the car when it killed Myrtle but he intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom mistakenly tells George Wilson, Myrtle's husband, that Gatsby ran over her. George concludes that he must've been her lover and shoots him dead in his mansion. However, he also commits suicide. Nick is the only one left to organize Gatsby's funeral and after doing so, he heads back West, disgusted by the life in New York.<br /><br />Essential Questions:<br /><br />What is the truth and how do you know?<br /><br />This question refers to the truth that Jay Gatsby hides behind his rather superficial façade. In an attempt to impress Daisy, he lies and creates an appealing past far from his own. Her high status would not suit his low birth so Gatsby makes up many stories. For example, he claims to be an Oxford man when he really in fact dropped out of this prestigious university after only months. Also, his \\"drugstores\\" sell things far from medicinal such as alcohol. In addition, Gatsby does not tell Daisy that he loves her but throws wild parties instead in an attempt to attract her attention, assuming that money could always cover up for anything.y hides behind his rather superficial faade.

Note - this review assumes you've already read the book.<br /><br />Writing is excellent and east to get into, and you feel you know the narrator despite his lack of emotional openness.  Gatsby however I found elusive and even somewhat unbelievable - maybe that's the idea but the notion that this otherwise capable guy lives his entire life in pursuit of his elusive Daisy and what-might-have-been strikes me as, at best, fanciful and at worst bad romance-novel blubber.  Maybe I'm cynical but I just don't believe anyone without severe emotional disorders - a stalker, a depressive, etc. - would idealize someone the way Gatsby does Daisy, and after what seemed like a pretty superficial, if intense, initial relationship.  If Gatsby is supposed to be so emotionally or psychologically damaged that he would thus lose all perspective, Fitzgerald does a lousy job of having it manifest in other ways that would give the reader a clue.  Overall I come away finding Gatsby, who is supposedly this tragic hero, to be a histrionic schmuck.  Not that he deserved his fate, really, but c'mon - he shows up out of the blue to steal a woman away from her husband and child?  How am I supposed to sympathize with that?<br /><br />Having said that, the book is very evocative of the time - jazz age, flappers, etc. and this is its true attraction.  A generation of people with wealth, health and opportunities who fritter it away with gaieties and shallow pleasures - this I can understand, and relate to when I look around me at my own age.  Fitzgerald may not have been a huge critic of this (he was too busy participating) but his portrayal of the life of the bold and beautiful doesn't exactly come across as an endorsement either.  Tom and Daisy Buchanan in particular provide a good and not too heavy-handed example of carelessness, as Fitzgerald thoughtfully has Nick point out at the end of the book.  The utter self-absorption of running your life based on `what do I want?' causes them to be oblivious to the lives they ruin.  Nick, to his credit, at least has the decency to feel tawdry about his involvement in it all, and to escape back to the west.

I had also forgotten how obvious it was that Gatsby's wealth came from the Jewish NY mob and his connections to it.

Hell, there doesn't even have to be a profoundly deep meaning hidden within a novel for me to like it, just as long as there is some redeeming value to it all.  The Great Gatsby has neither enjoyment nor meaning, despite what all the critics and analysts may think.  Of course, that is only my opinion and I can't tell others what to think.<br /><br />When I began reading The Great Gatsby, my opinion of it was entirely neutral, (as it goes with every novel I read).  I knew that it was considered a masterpiece.  I saw that it was number two on the Modern Library's 100 greatest novels.  Yet, I didn't roll into my reading with extremely high expectations; I just let the book speak for itself, as the pages unfolded in front of my eyes.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is told from the point of view of Nick Callaway, a middle class man who moves back East into a wealthy neighborhood.  The book opens with him at his cousin's house.  A small get together is in progress, and we are introduced to some of the main characters.  We meet Tom, an athletic, hot tempered, adulterous man.  We meet Daisy, Tom's wife, a cheerful and rather innocent girl.  Finally, we meet Jordan.  Jordan is Daisy's good friend, a rather gossipy and dishonest woman.  They drone on about nothing in particular and the first scene ends.<br /><br />In the scenes that follow we encounter Jay Gatsby, who is supposedly the hero of the story.  He is the American Dream.  He is the typical \\"rags to riches\\" story some of us might envy.  He is a very mysterious man, and rumors fly in every which way about him.  Rumors such as how he inquired his money and where he came from.  He throws large parties and invites Nick to them, along with countless other shallow people whom Gatsby has no interest in.<br /><br />The reason Gatsby engages in all these parties and hoopla, is an attempt to win back the love of his past, Daisy, (Tom's wife).  He has acquired all this money and attempts to take her from her husband Tom.  Tom, meanwhile, has a mistress across town that he uses for sex and is quite abusive towards.<br /><br />Well, all the parties and conversations eventually lead up to the climax at the end of the novel.  I won't reveal too much except for the fact that a lot of sparks fly between Tom, Daisy, Tom's mistress (Mrs. Wilson) and the mistress's husband, Mr. Wilson.  If I were to say anything else it might ruin it for you.  Although by that time, if you are like me, you won't really care.  The narrator, Nick, meanwhile just fades into the background and tells us the story in an offhanded kind of manner.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby fails on so many levels.  I don't know where to start.  The novel is supposed to be highly symbolic.  I have nothing against symbolic novels, I usually adore them, but in this case it was different.  I read the Cliff Notes and it still did not change my opinion.  What good are symbols when their meaning doesn't really add to the depth or meaning of the story?<br /><br />Another major failure is the dismal writing style.  I couldn't stand it.  To me, it seemed Fitzgerald just wanted to show off his vocabulary.  I don't have a problem with that, but he mixes words together in a rather strange and incoherent fashion, which does not make a whole lot of sense or add any power whatsoever to the story.  Another failure: The characters are extremely one dimensional.  I didn't feel like I really knew any of them by the time the novel was complete, and I certainly did not care about them.<br /><br />That brings me to my final failure of the novel that I will mention: the ending.  I have said this in other reviews I have written.  How am I or why should I care when tragic events occur to characters that I don't even care about?  It is impossible.  I really didn't care about anyone in this book, because the author did not shape and mold them into the vivid, memorable characters we read about in so many other masterpieces.  Endings like this always worsen the overall credibility of a novel when adequate preparation has not been put in place, as if the author is trying to manipulate us into thinking how grand of an ending it was.  Tragedies are great, if they have been properly framed and constructed from the beginning of the novel.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby has been said to mean things varying from \\"Social Stratification\\" to \\"Religion\\", to the seven deadly sins, and so on.  Rest assured that I don't rely on others to tell me whether or not a novel is great.  I did not hate this book, but as a \\"classic\\", it fails miserably, and it was not enjoyable to read.  In my eyes, it is a shame that a book so mediocre can place number two on any list, let alone be considered one of the greatest books of all times.  If I had to some up The Great Gatsby in one word, it would be \\"empty.\\"  If I could have one more word it would be \\"hollow.\\"  You be the judge.  The only thing more mysterious than Jay Gatsby, and his infamous title, is the fact that this tale could be considered great by anyone.<br /><br />Grade: C-ters we read about in so many other masterpieces.

I read it recently in class, and connected so well with the characters. It is a book that takes multiple reads to understand fully, because of the amount of symbolism in it. Fitzgerald's words are so beautiful, and his descriptions paint verbal pictures that are truly magnificent. The Great Gatsby is a book I intend to read over and over again. It is am american classic that every person should read at least twice.	2004-11-25
US	51844093	RQM7EJMIAFNIL	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Essay, Blue in The Great Gatsby	[...],<br /><br />  There is the brighter blue and the darker blue. For the brighter side, blue is the color of the earth and the sky, represents purity and beauty, and holds wonders to the limits beyond the eyes. For the darker side, it is synonyms with dreary, dismal, depressed and gloomy, and phrases like into-the-blue are associated with extreme exasperation. These two different and contrasting qualities of blue come into perfect match in The Great Gatsby, with the brighter blue matching the dreams and glories of Gatsby's life, and the darker blue matching the cold gray sadness of Gatsby's reality. The blue ocean and sky, the BLUE music, and the blue eyes of Dr. Eckleburg are three themes showing these contradictions. Blue is the color of Gatsby's tragedy.<br /><br />  Rain, ocean, and the swimming pool are where Gatsby's dreams once lay, but also where they vanish.  Gatsby loves Daisy, but he is always separated from her by blue water. At first it is the Atlantic Ocean, and then it is the water that separates East Egg from West Egg. Gatsby dreams of Daisy all this time and the blue distance is the medium through which his dreams grow into the grandest proportions. In fact, blue, the color without edge gave Gatsby too much room of imagination, and at the end, golden fruits turned out to be the same old apple trees. Really, who can argue that the ocean is not a beautiful thing, but yet with all the tragic dreams that this grand blue beauty empowered people to, is it not also the greatest curse?  Then there is the rain and the swimming pool, which further add to the sadness. It is significant that it rains both during the meeting of Gatsby and Daisy, and Gatsby `s burial. Gatsby's blue dreams was a cloud building up in all these years. It gets too heavy that it collapses with reality and falls on to the hard earth. Gatsby dies in his swimming pool, on one of the last days of summer, when the pool is drained. The pool represents his blue dream, and Gatsby dies in this pool of dream, or more accurately, was killed by his dream. At the end, the once flourishing bright hopes of light blue, becomes the smoke of gun shot, a darker blue dimmed by the setting sun.<br /><br />  Blue is the music of the 20th , it is popular, beautiful, creative, full of soul, and relieves people of their pains. Yet, the songs are about Poverty, hard times, Lost love, Sexuality, and Oppression. Listening to BLUE music is using sadness to defeat sadness itself, and this contradiction has the same quality as the contradiction of the color blue and of Gatsby's life. The \\"wailing\\" of the Beale Street Blue's \\"hopeless comment\\", while \\" a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust.\\"(P158) during Daisy's party with boys after she losses patience with Gatsby is a good example. All night saxophones will play this music among \\"golden slippers\\" of happiness, but inside there is only the depressing notes of the \\"wailing hopeless\\" BLUE. It presents happiness as a brief stop on the train of a depressing life. Then there is the \\"There is music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens.....\\"(P42) when Nick witnesses Gatsby's magnificent party. This \\"Blue Garden\\" is where Gatsby waits, and where sad music of the Blue flows with a million bottles of gay champions in a lonely and crowded symphony. There is grandeur, yet inside this grandeur are fighting husbands and wives, people talking who did not know each other, and drunker who attempts to drive a broken car.  The people are empty, they are searching for \\"fun\\", only because they are confused about life and their place in their life. The \\"blue garden\\" did not have blue grass, but had blue music, and a blue soul, and that blue soul belongs to all the people at the party, and the host himself.<br /><br />  The symbol of the valley of ashes is \\"The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg\\". They are \\"blue and gigantic--their retinas are one yard high.\\", and its \\"persistent stare\\" is always watching over. This stare by this brighter color over the lesser colors around it makes the pure blue eyes seem like a ruler. A ruler to which all the forgotten ashes and decays are hopelessly compared to, and the reality around is so corrupted and ugly that they even clouded the ruler itself. Words \\"pale\\"(P167) and \\"faded\\"(127) describe the blue eyes, which to a greater extend show this overcrowding of darker forces. The gray ash field is the reality of the world, and underneath the grand mansions of Gatsby and Tom is a thousand valley of ashes. They support the superficial happiness, but that happiness is to fall and to become a part of the gray burial mound at anytime. In fact, Gatsby becomes a part of the ashes even before he dies, he has nothing real, except a empty dream for Daisy. The blue here represents the only hope inside a hopeless world,  because it is the only color inside a colorless valley of ashes. It is clear that the blue here is different from the blue ocean and BLUE music. It is still about hope and despair, but of a different and higher sort.  Near the end of the book, Wilson repeats \\"God sees everything\\" as he looks at the blue eyes. It is questionable if Fitzgerald is calling people to turn away from the fate of been buried in the evil ashes and turn back to the promise of God. But it is clear that those blue eyes of a certain moral values are been ignored, and it is Fitzgerald's intention for people to pay more attention to this only color of promise.<br /><br />  Gatsby lives in the fancies of the blue music, sleeps in the dreams of the blue ocean, and is buried under the blue eyes of God. The use of the color blue shows not just the contradictions of Gatsby's life, but also that of his generation, the roaring 20th with all its laughs of the brighter blue and tears of the darker blue (as on the cover). The Great Gatsby is about hope, the collapse of hope, and more hope, and blue, with all its contradictory qualities, best mirrors this tragic story.always watching over.

This is not only a love story of the rich Jay Gatsby and the glorious Daisy Buchanan, this is the epitomy of all which that time period stands for. Fitzgerald paints an era where money and status were the true faces of the American society and people were defined by their glamourous houses, expensive clothes, and lavish habits. It was the era of the parties lasting until dawn, the era of nightlife and gossip. But it was also a very unsteady era where that green light which could bring you up to the top of the mountain could just as well make you fall from grace. Nevertheless, one finds himself hoping that \\"one fine morning...\\"<br /><br />I was never forced to read the Great Gatsby in school but reading it now I know instantly that this will be one of my favorites and I will read it many more times because one time is not enough to understand all of its levels and fully appreciate this masterpiece.	2004-11-18

Taking place in the giant city of New York a young bachelor named Nick Carraway finds his neighbor to be one of great wealth and mystery. He has never met his neighbor but there are always wild parties in the gigantic house next to his. One evening after returning from a small dinner party at his friends Tom and Daisy Buckhannon's house; Mr. Gatsby emerges from the shadows next door and greets Nick mysteriously. The next afternoon Nick is invited to one of Gatsby's great parties. Nick and Gatsby become good friends throughout the book. One evening Gatsby confesses to Nick that he has loved Daisy Buckhannon for a long time. So Nick sets up a tea party with the two and, they fall in love behind Tom Buckhannon's back. That's only the beginning it gets much more interesting from there.<br /><br /> Personally I didn't like this book, because its just not the type of book I like to read. I think that over all the entire book was interesting and had a good plot. However I couldn't familiarize myself with the characters. I didn't really understand were they were coming from or why they did certain things. For example I never understood why Mr. Gatsby threw big parties because he was always quite and no one really knew who he was or where he came from. Also I didn't like that the author only described the characters once. It was hard to get a mental picture of what the characters looked like. The author also introduces new characters more than halfway into the book and I didn't really know who they were. I started to get confused with the characters. For example the author introduces a man named Michaelis for about 15 pages and then he is gone from the book. Overall, the book had a great plot but I didn't like the way the author wrote and described things.	2004-10-26

Each characters personalities and behavior is an example of every human beings temptations, flaws, wants, and desires. F. Scott Fitzgerald created the book The Great Gatsby in a way where it symbolizes a typical human being. Each character shows a human flaw, our arrogance, needs, wants, and temptations within life. He describes the steps we use to get there and how we try to be on top to achieve things.<br /><br /> Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, Jordan, Myrtle, and George are images of an idealistic American life. The way Daisy and her other family live is full of riches and never a day full of work. At the beginning of the book, Daisy admitted to herself that the things nobles do, like go on picnics, was a rather odd thing. That alone was a big point in the book because she segregated herself from the commoners. That proved that she thinks of herself of being different. Also, Gatsby, Daisy, and Myrtle all ends up having an affair in the book. The affair leads to unfortunate endings and a twisted story line.<br /><br /> Overall, the book was great. Not only was it a great read, it had a great plot and the way the book was organized was spectacular. Fitzgerald not only wrote a great story, but he created a book that got in depth with the American society and the way we chase after our dreams. Making us realize that sometimes, no matter where time brings us too we cannot turn back time and live in the past. All that you can do is move on and be who you are, accepting the future and taking grasp of it.	2004-10-25

The Great Gatsby is a book about a love remade between Jay Gatsby, an extremely wealthy man who was known for throwing lavish parties, and Daisy Buchanan's, a woman who is charmed by a mans wealth. The two meet through Nick Carraway, (Daisy's cousin) a young, educated man who moves to New York to further his knowledge in the bond business. It begins with Nick meeting Jay at one of his parties where he doesn't feel that he really fits in.  Here he learns that the locals pride themselves on material possessions more so than that of more noble goals.<br /><br />As the story grows you learn more about Daisy's husband, Tom, who has a side relation with Myrtle Wilson of which Daisy knows about.  Although Tom is just as guilty, with his gain in knowledge of his wife's affair, he becomes more and more jealous of the relation between Daisy and Gatsby which is growing more intense as time goes by.  With the progressing tension building, things take a twist to end the book with an exciting, unexpected ending.<br /><br />This work by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a remarkable display of the way society was folding in the 1920's. The way people were falling into a trap where moral values were deteriorating, greed was taking over, and the reckless lifestyle of parties displayed most of the times ideas of wealth. The unrealistic ideas of money could have been related to the rise in the stock market after the war which led to a newfound materialism. This allowed people of any social status to become wealthy.  The difference between the East and West egg in the book demonstrated this idea of \\"new and old money\\".<br /><br />The symbolism in the book can become baffling at some point making it an unpleasureable read.  In order to understand the whole concept that Fitzgerald is trying to convey, you need to recognize and understand the meanings behind what he is actually saying.  Although this was a good book, this aspect of it threw me off a little bit and created a confusing read.

I thought it was wonderful at the time, but I didn't appreciate it as much as I did now that I've read it for the second time. The story of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan enthralled me from beginning to end. Written during the Jazz Age, which is also the story's backdrop, F. Scott Fitzgerald tells the tragic and decadent love story of an impoverished officer who seeks wealth in an attempt to woo Daisy. He also happens to want to obtain a respectable place in society. However, Gatsby's attempts to obtain both Daisy and richness beyond his wildest dreams backfire and he soon falls from grace in a poignant conclusion that brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />Someone once asked me if I wanted to be like Jay Gatsby -- if I wanted to aspire to things beyond my means and want someone who will never be within my reach. And that is the reason why this novel touched me so much. It spoke to me. Gatsby is one of the most compelling characters ever written. And the love story is quite a sad one, but I think that that's what makes it memorable and special to me. And the fact that the story is narrated by a third character -- Nick Callaway -- makes the reader appreciate both sides of the coin, though Callaway is quite vocal about his own observations and prejudices. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a true American classic. I have read it twice and will no doubt reread it at some stage in the future. I cannot recommend this American classic enough.	2004-10-23

And Mrytle Wilson- representing the other side of the coin- from a poor background yet desperately enamoured with the world of the rich and turning up her nose at those close to her to climb up the social spectrum.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby shows up the hollow, nasty, reckless, superficiality prevalent in certain sectors of society better than any other novel I know. A timeless classic.	2004-10-22

I especially enjoyed Fitzgerald's intricate portrayal of Jay Gatsby as the American hero, a self-made man who accomplishes the American dream of rising from \\"rags to riches,\\" but who is ultimately incomplete because the one thing for which he desires, Daisy, is unobtainable.  Daisy is restricted by social conventions, duty towards her husband, and also by the death of Gatsby, and therefore can only remain elusive as a dream.  The irony of expectations is not only reflected in Gatsby's story but also in the \\"boom and bust\\" consumerism and mass production of the Roaring Twenties.  On the outside, the Roaring Twenties seemed like an endless age of consumption, wealth, and happiness characterized with an easy-going \\"get-rich-fast\\" mentality.  However, corruption also flourished during this era.  Prohibition heightened organized crime and introduced bootleggers and \\"speakeasies.\\"  Anti-foreign sentiment ignited a new Ku Klux Klan.  Union workers and farmers fell into poverty as the result of rising prices.  On the outside, Gatsby seems to have it all:  extravagant riches, elegant parties and friends, and happiness.  However, on the inside, he is incomplete without the one whom he loves so dearly, Daisy.  He searches in vain to obtain her as his own but she is ultimately outside his grasp.  Fitzgerald weaves his own cynical views into the novel and gives a thorough examination into life in the 1920s, providing a realistic outlook for the reader.  His intricate portrayal allowed me to experience the positive and negative effects of the 1920s without actually being there.  I can easily see why The Great Gatsby has often been revered as the \\"classic American novel.\\"	2004-10-05

One of the reviewers before actually gave it a 4 star review despite the fact that she or he admittedly did not even finish it! This is probably what you'd call a biased judgement. The Great Gatsby is certainly an interesting book to study (as would be any book, in my opinion) but I cannot say I enjoyed it too much, even if the images and underlying themes are interesting. I have to say I read it in the Penguin edition, so I don't know about the preface of this one, but I found helpful the essay displayed there (always read these introductions and stuff AFTER you read the novel, otherwise it's merely a spoiler and it can't deepen your understanding of the book since you know nothing of it at that moment).<br /><br />Despite all this I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 stars, I hesitated longly between 2 and 3 to be honest.	2004-10-04

It tells the story of Jay Gatsby who tries to win back the love of Daisy Buchanan with his money. The story is narrated by Nick Carroway who views all aspects of the rich. Whether it's the front that Gatsby puts on or the deception between the Buchanan's, he views it all. The American Dream is the theme throughout this novel which seems to be what every character longs for.

These books throw us into their subject by allowing us to understand what it would be like to be in the same scenario, and we can better understand that type of life.  I am uncertain what it is that links these, but perhaps the narrators'  fear, uncertainty, and continuing effort to figure life out in spite of the knowledge that the effort will inevitably end in failure make them human and part of us.  The Great Gatsby lets us live for a moment in the twenties without engaging in any truly great events, despite the title.  If only there were one of these for every decade.	2004-09-29

It includes a preface and notes by Matthew J. Bruccoli, a publisher's afterward, a drawn map of the story site and a brief Fitzgerald biography.<br /><br />The green light in THE GREAT GATSBY is probably the most frequently cited example of \\"objective correlative\\" in fiction.  T. S. Eliot coined the phrase objective correlative for the author's device of describing an object so that it reveals an emotional state, but without explicitly linking the object and the emotion in the narrative.<br /><br />Fitzgerald mentioned the green light three times in the novel.  On page 26, when Nick is observing Gatsby gazing across the bay between East Egg and West Egg, Nick involuntarily glances seaward and distinguishes \\"nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock.\\"  On page 98, Gatsby says to Daisy, \\"You always have a green light that burns at the end of your dock.\\"  Finally, on page 189, at the end of the story, Nick the narrator tells us \\"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic* future that year by year recedes before us.\\"  By then, the reader understands that the green light correlates to Gatsby's distracted longing for Daisy.<br /><br />*In his afterword, Mr. Bruccoli claims that Fitzgerald purposely used \\"orgastic\\" instead of \\"orgiastic.\\"  The Encarta dictionary accepts orgastic, but not the Microsoft Word spell checker or my WordWeb Thesaurus.<br /><br />For those interested in a timeline, do a Google search on: \\"last day of summer,\\" 1922, Gatsby.  The results should be two hits, both good timelines.  The one on geocities has at least one error, however; it has Cody dieing in 1910 instead of five years later.<br /><br />I found 113 proper names of persons, some only given names, some only surnames in the story.  Of these, 74 are names of Gatsby's guests listed on pages 65 - 67.  Fitzgerald mentions only two of those guests later in the story.  He does not give \\"Owl Eyes\\" a proper name, but he figures as a significant character.65 - 67.  Fitzgerald mentions only two of those guests later in the story.

The narrator is Nick Carraway, whose seemingly dull life is meant as a contrast with the lives of the other characters.  Jay Gatsby is the title character, whose true identity remains hidden for most of the novel.  He has created a life for himself: a new identity, a disreputable job, and elaborate parties, all a front to impress the woman of his dreams.  Daisy Buchanan lives in fashionable East Egg, with her husband Tom.  Their life is consumed by maintaining an outward façade of wealth and perfection.  The truth, like Gatsby's life, is much less glamorous.  Daisy is bored and restless, and Tom keeps a mistress in the City.<br /><br /> Nick, at the beginning of the plot has rented a house on Gatsby's property, and conveniently is also Daisy's cousin.  Gatsby comes up with the brilliant idea of recruiting Nick to help him seduce Daisy.  Daisy is immediately attracted to the excitement that seems to surround Gatsby.  The dangers of his business dealings, and the constant flow of strangers that attend his parties seem so different from her calm life with her husband.  Both of them are desperate for some change, and believe that all their dreams will be realized when they are together.<br /><br /> Fitzgerald in this novel has created an American classic.  His tale of decadence and destruction is an essential work of fiction.  He has taken the \\"roaring 20's\\", and shown the negative side of luxury and wealth.  Although at times he seems to be advocating lewd parties, or adultery, he is merely trying to show what ends come to people who partake in these activities.  One cannot help but sympathize with Gatsby. He is a man who is convinced that he must be something other than himself in order to impress the woman he loves.  Yet all his efforts prove in vain when he realizes that Daisy would never make him happy, and still his pursuit of her still leads to his death.<br /><br /> In reading this I felt that one could not help but enjoy it.  The plot lacks dramatic action scenes, but this is made up for with the complex social situations that Fitzgerald showcases.  Its appeal also lies in the readers' strange attraction to a character who is less than perfect (Gatsby), and distaste for a character who seems to have the least flaws (Nick).r /> In reading this I felt that one could not help but enjoy it.

Great books and authors are much like children, each one is both different and special, with different flaws and strenghs. To truly appreciate the unique beauty of Gatsby, you have to look in the right place.<br /><br />  The tone of Gatsby is that of a man who is filled with a longing for a woman and a dream that he is driven to pursue. Gatsby is torn by his knowlege of the transparency of his illusive dream and his his obsessive need to conquer it.<br /><br /> I do not admire chasing illusive dreams,I admire the courage to dream and the incredible drive it takes to chase the dream -- the power of his spirit and the courage that he shows when he holds nothing back in his quest, risking everything. It takes a brave hearted man to soar to remarkable heights only to crash to the ground, when the common man hugs the ground instead.

The Great Gatsby is certainly nothing I would have finished had it not been so short.<br /><br />My basic response to this book: It lacks depth of any significance. The descriptions are minimally imaginative, and never spark excitement. And the characters? The characterizations, the portrayal of the characters and their actions and emotions, are all simple and don't transmit any of the passion they are supposedly feeling. Supposedly, for example, the several main characters in the book, most notably Gatsby, have the Chalice of Life just at their fingertips, but are afraid to grasp it. But I got no feel for the inner anguish and turmoil and tortuous yearning that must arise from such fear and self-denial.<br /><br />In short, this book, while having a decent plot and overall structure, was boring, because the writing is boring. If The Great Gatsby was a serious attempt at good writing, then it is evident to me that Scott Fitzgerald had never in his his life experienced any significant passion or the thrill and thunderburst excitement that is the reward of spirited creativity.	2004-08-25

The novel is narrated by Gatsby's next door neighbor, Nick Carraway, as he views everything that happens to Gatsby.  The setting takes place in Long Island, New York, in two places: \\"West Egg\\" and \\"East Egg\\" separated by a bay. Gatsby is this filthily rich guy who lives in a gigantic mansion next to Nick in West Egg.  Rumors about what kind of a man he really is swirl about Gatsby, but Nick keeps his own opinion until he actually meets the great Gatsby himself. Gatsby holds extravagant parties in his mansion, and people from all over the Island come, even uninvited. In reality, he has moved to West Egg and holds these big parties hoping to attract the attention of the woman he once loved during World War I, Daisy Buchanan, who is now living across the bay in East Egg. Unfortunately, Daisy married during the war, so she is technically unavailable.  Gatsby, who values the past and money above anything else, does all he can to win her back, but alas, Gatsby is not called a tragic character for nothing.<br /><br />Beautifully written, mostly in prose, The Great Gatsby makes a reader step back and examine his own values. Even though Gatsby has all these bad characteristics attributed to him, the reader cannot help but empathize with him and his romantic idealization of the past. We all do that sometimes--live in the past and forget about the present.<br /><br />F. Scott Fitzgerald, when he died in 1940, thought he died as a failure in life. Well, with this classic The Great Gatsby that I have just now read, I beg to differ, Mr. Fitzgerald.	2004-08-22

What's wonderous and sad about this book is that Gatsby is a human being.  How can anyone compare Gatsby to a human being?  He is a robot isn't he.  After all, no human would exploit himself to the degree that Gatsby would.  Yet it's part of the American culture and tradition to be a shameful exploiter in the first place.  Think about all of the \\"me-tooers\\" that you've known in your life. It would be most disingenuous to \\"not\\" recognize anyone that exploits himself for profit.  Yet Gatsby is the biggest exploiter of them all.  He is the epitome of that \\"American Dream\\"  He is that big fish in the school of fish.  Fitzgerld writes so eloquently yet so tragically the life of one such \\"big fish\\" in this book.  It is a part of capitalism to \\"at least\\" take notice to what the big fish are doing.  Who in your lives represent the big fish.  Is it the mass media?  Is it Rush Limbaugh?<br /><br />  All in all, when we end up reading the Great Gatsby we end up relating to some of the characters in the book.  Maybe you're the \\"conservative\\" Tom Buchanan.  Maybe you had a past affair with someone and would do \\"everything\\" to win her heart.  Maybe you try to be like Nick.  Although I'm not WASP, I end up relating to some of the characters in the book.  I actually almost cried when Gatsby's father wrote the letter to Nick at the end explaining the dillemma his son was in.  I felt Fitzgerald was doing a great public service by exploiting the true misery that wealth brings and how it corrupts the soul.  In closing, this book has helped me adjust to American life and warrants me to read mor Fitzgerald books.<br /><br />P.S.  If this book is too complicated, read the cliff notes.	2004-08-12

A good plot plus an engaging writing style make a bestseller. Sometimes, those elements are combined with a third: the story makes us think about ourselves, and life in general.

It was first published in 1925, an the author set the background of the story in the 1920's, the &quot;Jazz Age&quot;. Disregarding the fact that particular period of history is already distant, this book has managed to mantain its edge.<br /><br /> But why does that happen?.

Daisy is quite unhappy (in a rather superficial way), and ready for a change when Gatsby enters again into her life, as good-looking as ever but with much more money.<br /><br /> The story is told from the point of view of Nick Carraway, who is Daisy's cousin and who happens to meet Gatsby in one of the party the later organizes. Nick is a catalyst in the story, due to the fact that he puts Daisy and Jay in contact again after many years of separation. However, and more important, Carraway makes the book remarkably more interesting for the reader, making commentaries from time to time regarding what is happening. In the book, Nick says &quot;Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known&quot;.<br /><br /> At the very least, Nick's role is an effective way that Fitzgerald found of involving the reader a little bit more in what's happening in the story. Most people can identify with Nick Carraway because he doesn't go to the extremes where the other characters permanently are. Gatsby, and his relentless persecution of a love that never was, that can end in nothing else that pure tragedy... And Daisy, so frivolous and vain, so thoroughly engrossed in herself that is incapable of true love...<br /><br /> All in all, I liked the story, but I especially enjoyed the way in which F. Scott Fitzgerald writes. His style is very simple, with only some metaphores that don't obscure the meaning but help to make it clear. He is also quite concise, as evident from the fact that this book has little more that 200 pages.<br /><br /> I think it is probably wortwhile to point out that what really makes this book a classic, instead of merely an enjoyable book (not that there is anything wrong with those!!), is the fact that it deals with many themes all of us deem important, for example love, dreams, lies, justice, social differences, hate, money and what it can (and cannot) buy...<br /><br /> From my point of view, this book is more than worth your time and money. I only wish the ending had been different... The book would have lost some of its dramatic air, but I would have been happier. Even though I know it is rather silly, I prefer happy endings. I hope you notice that despite that, I still recommend &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; to you.

To be quite honest I have never been more disappointed in a book before.  I heard many praises about this book but when I actually read it I kept asking myself what is wrong with so many people who think this is a great book...I guess it's because the title of the book has the word great in it.<br /><br />All it's about is this guy who becomes way too obsessed with a so said 'golden girl' and just dedicates all her accomplishments to her.  It's a book about doomed marriages that ulitmately results in infidelity (what a surprise).  It's no wonder the book is classified as a tragedy.	2004-08-01
US	40440775	R45I48I4D32HP	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	2	2	N	N	a paradox defined	Sadly, the Great Gatsby has been relegated to the pantheon of books we are forced to read in high school and dutifully summarize in book report format or else address the endless concerns of whether this or that character should have done this or that thing. I have made the similar mistake with works like the Scarlet Letter, or Emerson's Essays, which equally require a greater degree of maturity and perhaps experience to appreciate.<br /><br />  The core of this book lies not in a simple unrequited love story. Fitzgerald addresses a much larger theme of how the mythic aristocratic ideal triumphs in American society while the fundamental reality of this ideal is denied. It must of course be remembered, that this paradox is distinctly an American one. This is a book written in and for a culture that embraces the value and rights of all of us and believes in the ability that we can all fulfill our unique destinies in life. There are no institutionalized lineages of kings and queens believed to be ordained by God to embody qualities above the common lot. No! We may say 'God save the Union!' or (until recently) 'One nation under God!' but never 'God Save the Queen!' The Great Gatsby was not written for a British or French audience who have believed in the authenticity of royalty and royal power, but for an American one. The Great Gatsby challenges each of us to question how we can reinvent and embrace a notion so fundamentally contrary to our stated beliefs and constitution?<br /><br />  Primarily through the title character Jay Gatsby, we see how the aristocratic ideal triumphs, particularly over the unfortunate ones who choose to inadequately embody it. Gatsby fails in his pursuit of aristocratic grandeur for one simple reason: he is not an aristocrat. He comes from a poor family and is primarily a self-made millionaire, scrappy and opportunistic. If this were not condemning enough, we get a glimpse into some of the questionable business practices he is perhaps too closely tied to (we are led to believe bootlegging. It is the Roaring Twenties after all). Thus, one of the two must perish; either Gatsby or Gatsby's dream. We learn that it is Gatsby who does.<br />  At first inspection, the title seems contradictory. Gatsby fails, so therefore he is not great. However we see that he is - he achieves great success, purchases a great house on the Long Island Sound for a great sum of money, throws great, if not spectacular parties. The problem is that he is only great and great is not enough. He wants to become royalty and royalty is not great - it simply is.<br /><br />  Those who do embody the ideal successfully are Tom and Daisy Buchanan. They are the victors. While we see that they win and those around them fail, what is it that they win? Who and what are they? Fitzgerald constantly defines them in elusive terms, the indescribable melody of Daisy's voice, the majestic athleticism of Tom Buchanan, the Yale man. The activity of life is not perpetuated by these two demi-gods. They behave as if they are spectators, bored and dissatisfied ones. While they have connections, wealth and beauty, what of a fundamental nature do they do that makes them admirable? Nothing. And therein lies the eternal source of disappointment for the imitators and emulators and worshippers. Inherited wealth and privilege cannot be achieved or pursued it can merely be had.<br /><br />  The book is the story of a disappointed and disillusioned man, but not a mad-man. Gatsby is not someone who worships say; toothpaste and we can veritably call him crazy. We can relate to his quest for grandeur. We may even root for his success with Daisy. This is one reason why this book resonates and can be called a classic and should be read. Gatsby is not nuts. In fact, we are like him. Why? Because the myth has persisted through time as a way to make life taste more real and exciting, to create aspirations based on more than tangible considerations. We embrace the mythical because the converse is to embrace the mundane. Yet... How can we also embrace authenticity and meaningful values in our lives? And what about embracing values that contribute to stability and continuity? These are the timeless questions that remain.embrace the mundane. Yet...

I did like it, particularly the prose, but didn't consider it &quot;great.&quot; I was led to believe it was a story of life during the Jazz Age, an era I am very much interested in, and didn't find much in the way of describing life in the 1920s apart from some nightly parties thrown and attended by overly rich people and the title character being involved in bootlegging. I was expecting more descriptions of things like the actual process involved in bootlegging (how they made the alcohol in their bathtubs, for example), the kind of clothes people were wearing, popular songs and dances, flappers, movies, that sort of thing.<br /><br /> I found what remained of the story, after the lovely prose and descriptions of Twenties life, to be plotless and unconvincing. Why is Nick Carraway narrating this story? What does he do that's important? This book would have been better served with third-person narration instead of being narrated by Daisy's second-cousin once removed. It was also really unrealistic how Daisy and Gatsby instantly are as close and loving as they were before Daisy jilted him when he went off to war in 1917 and because he wasn't a rich man. Daisy has since married and had a child; she hasn't sat around waiting for him all these years like Penelope waited for Odysseus! I'm supposed to believe that their romance is rekindled overnight, and applaud Gatsby for throwing these lavish nightly parties only out of the vain hope that Daisy might come to one of them and see him again? He even has his house right across the way from Daisy's, and became so rich only in the hopes of winning her back, which seems really obsessive instead of sweet and romantic.<br /><br /> The book would have been better served having a hundred or so more pages so the reader could figure out the solutions to all of the whodunnits on his or her own. These are some great and intriguing mysteries, yet very quickly we're handed all of the answers on a silver platter. That takes away the thrill of figuring out what happened on one's own. The ending also was very dead-end and disappointing. I would have liked it more had the plot unfolded slower instead of too quickly to be realistic.could figure out the solutions to all of the whodunnits on his or her own.

Like Nick Carraway, the narrator, I am a Midwesterner that ventured out East to Yale and returned somewhat disenchanted with the rhythm of life on the East coast.  So there are personal reasons for me to identify with the novel, in addition to Fitzgerald's unusual brilliance and mastery of the English language.<br />This was not always the case.  Many people-- some of them very intelligent- often faulted The Great Gatsby for being 'soft' or 'too easy to read.'  This is not intentional academic snobbery-- how often have readers taken up a facile book without coming away satisfied?  Indeed, the critics of Fitzgerald's time did not take him seriously for similar reasons-- I myself fell within this skeptic group until I reread the novel four years later after heavy exposure to the other literary lights of that time.<br />Having now read The Great Gatsby approximately twenty times, I have come to recognize the unique power of the novel.  It is, as described in the introductory essay, a complete miracle.  It is a miracle of social criticism as witnessed by the unsurmountable gap between old and new money; it is a miracle (one might almost say an inevitable result) of the modern schism between the age of hard-nosed science and pure romantism; it is a miracle of story-telling, combining Hemingway's lucid economy with Faulkner's innovation and power.  The result is Fitzgerald's characteristic 'magic voice,' which has yet to be duplicated by any author since.<br />And above all, it is a good story.  At the heart of the tale is the use of a partially-involved first person narrator (in the form of Nick Carraway), combining the power of the first-person POV with the sweep and scope of the third person narrative.  This stroke of genius becomes even more evident as parallel story lines develop, resulting in the convergence of the two paths and the famous closing scene with the now-transformed Nick brooding on the deserted beach.<br />There is so much to this book that it is impossible to list all that I admire.  Yet paradoxically, unlike other masterworks like Absalom! Absalom!, it is possible for everyone who reads The Great Gatsby to view the work in its totality.  It is so natural that it is almost as if Fitzgerald did not write it, and rather, the work appeared completed and perfect of its own volition-- a masterpiece for everyone.<br />There is so much to this book that it is impossible to list all that I admire.

Scott Fitzgerald is not by any means as talented as truly excellent writers like Jules Verne, H. G. Wells or Tolkien, but he manages a writing style which, if not involving, is at least amusing at times, even when he's not trying to be.<br />The Great Gatsby starts out in two massive egg-like structures made for luxury on Long Island, in a futuristic setting almost reminiscent of an anime, and like an anime, starts with characters discussing things that promise great things from the story.<br />Of all the characters found in the novel, only the narrator; a man known as Nick, is morally-upright to any noticable degree.  This itself isn't so bad.  I often like stories with a lot of evil characters.  The problem is that very often in novels worth reading, evil characters either confront their evil tendencies leading to internal conflict, and/or are overcome by them, and it makes them interesting as a result.<br />Really, that's my problem with this story.<br />When dealing with Nemo or Griffin or Dorian Grey in truly excellent novels, we face characters who have been tainted by evil impulses, and as a result, their characters are interesting to watch as their evil impulses are in direct contrast to the parts of themselves that deep down, still desire to be good.  These contrasts paint truly impressive pictures, especially since the characters themselves always manage to use their good and evil sides to bring something truly amazing to the story.<br />Gatsby, Tom, Wilson and Daisy don't do that.  The story plops the characters down in the middle of a city with what look to be the makings of an interesting picture, but it is missing the most important brush strokes.  &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; promises a truly phenomenal occurance that could shock and amaze, but, and this is entirely the fault of the author, it never really follows through on that.  I was left feeling like &quot;what?  Where's the 'Kaboom?'&quot;  This book neither contained the depth to involve me emotionally, nor the thrill to get me excited, and I was disappointed with that.

Fitzgerald somehow describes a situation, and does so in a way that leaves you with no doubt as to what he is descrbing, without any excess.  The levels of thought this book touches upon are amazing.  To me its theme is simply that of disillusionment.  Fitzgerald shows both a world we see and assume to exist and the things that lay beneath it.

Fitzgerald has so perfectly captured the era between WWI and the Great Depression, that it is forever engraved in our minds--the colors, sights, sounds, and even moral forays of the time.  And all of this melds wonderfully with Fitzgerald's characters; the way carry on with reckless abandon.  But don't think that Fitzgerald is preachy.  No, he simply presents the material and lets you decided what kind of karma, if any, should be passed around.  The beauty of this book lies in its simplicity (seeming) and execution.  This is a keeper. Also very much enjoyed &quot;The Scarlet Letter, Bark of the Dogwood, Of Mice and Men, and Catch 22.&quot;	2004-07-02

Yes, it's true, I am making myself vulnerable to all sorts of negative votes to express an honest, yet negative, opinion on a &quot;classic&quot; book.<br />But first, a little plot overview.  This is a tragic lovestory told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a Midwestern transplant to New York who happens to live in a modest house in a very rich neighborhood.  He is the narrator, but most of the action is happening with other principal figures, most prominently J Gatsby.  Gatsby is a mysterious figure who has gained wealth quickly from questionable means and goes to great lengths to win the heart of the woman he loves...who happens to be Nick's cousin.<br />The story twists and turns and describes Gatsby's high-rollin' lifestyle -- which would make a great episode in today's world of MTV Cribs -- and melds together several love stories with a great description of the &quot;bored rich&quot; living in the 1920's.  The story is very entertaining and moves you along quickly.<br />So, if this were a novel I picked up without knowing anything about it, I would probably be glowing and gushing all over the floor about it.  But it's not.  It is &quot;classic&quot; literature whose merits to fit into that category seem to be in debate.  Well, here are my two cents.<br />Some of the arguments that I have seen for this book's greatness are its beautiful language, Fitzgerald's economy of words, and the portrayal of the Jazz Age.  And to that I say, first, that yes, the language is very good and I liked alot of the writer's descriptions, but they simply did not blow my doors off like other classics seem to.  My personal grade would be a B+.<br />Secondly, hey, economy of words is great, and I appreciate that an author is able to express him/herself succinctly (as opposed to many non-classic current authors,) but that in and of itself is kind of like an add-on benefit for me, like if the car dealer throws in some customized floor mats or something.  That's great, but it's not a deal maker-or-breaker.<br />Thirdly, I appreciate the portrayal of this period in history.  But I really don't care that much about the bored rich in that period of history.  By reading some reviewers' comments, you would think that this would be akin to learning about the hardships of Western pioneers or the tribulations of flood victims or something.  It's just not that captivating of a topic to me to carry a story, but I guess that is personal preference.<br />So, to summarize.  I liked the book.  I give it four stars.  But it has a wagon-load of expectations that it is carrying, and I just felt like I was missing something when I was reading it.  And perhaps that just means I don't have enough edgukashuns to &quot;get it,&quot; but this feeling seems to be a common one among other readers, even those who have finished high school.<br />Go ahead.

He achieves fabulous wealth in the heady early days of the Roaring 20s, at  time when the stock market was unregulated by the SEC and such things could be accomplished. In the manner of the Count of Monte Cristo, he makes a fantastic splash on High Society, a nouveau riche pretty boy, supposedly an officer in the Army during the Great War, who owns a huge Long Island mansion and holds enormous Summer parties.<br />The book centers on the angst of the idle rich, the love affairs of the morally ambiguous, people who must look for newer and more outrageous ways to tickle their fancies. Naturally, Gatsby's attractiveness among the gorgeous socialite women of the Hamptons stirs resentment among the old school boys, who question his validity.<br />Fitzgerald here describes a world from the standpoint of guilt; guilt at being rich. He paints a picture of people who have money without having earned it, who are not worthy of it in the entrepreneurial sense. This is an elite, liberal view - the opposite of the more hard-scrabble Hemingway world.<br />Political views aside, Fitzgerald is a fabulous writer who lends a distinct voice to the American literary scene.

I found it to be poorly structured and somewhat choppy. The characters are pretty well crafted for a short novel such as this, but you don't really become enthralled with any of them. When the murder occurs, you really don't care. Even when the individual is struck by the car, you kind of go &quot;Oh, wow, that's too bad,&quot; but nothing more is felt. And there are a few minor loose ends that are never resolved. I finished the book with a feeling of &quot;Is that all there is?&quot;<br />Perhaps the big rush to get this into print was part of the reason for its shortcomings. I'm not sure.

Jay Gatsby throws all his extravigant parties but has only one goal in mind-attracting Daisy. Her husband Tom is already wrapped up in an affair with low-life Myrtle. The Rich folks' treatment of each other and disregard for others is at the center of Fitgerald's novel. Other themes to look for are his use of weather to set the mood of the scenes, use of colors(especially yellow and green) to foreshadow upcoming events, and the disparity between the upper and lower class.

When my yr.11 class whined to our teacher over how much we hated this book, she replied with &quot;This is english advanced..you're not going to read fun,interesting books in english advanced..you're going to read boring, old novels&quot; i don't recommend this book for people aged 17 and under, as there are better and more interesting books (for this age group)  out there.	2004-05-25

Scott Fitzgerald's crowning achievement is a relatively concise, easily readable gem of a story, which goes much deeper than the average genre fiction (obviously), but not in a dull way.<br />It is very easy to picture oneself as Nick, the protagonist, attempting to piece together this strange character, Jay Gatsby, and the elaborate world he inhabits. Character development is beautifully accomplished as the book progresses, and there is no wasted scenes or characters. In fact, there is a great deal of substance to the entire story, despite its focus on the lack of substance for the characters presented.<br />The Great Gatsby will help you understand the lives of the fabulously wealthy in the 20s, but more importantly it will help you begin to understand the real world, and what is really important. Gatsby's &quot;Green light&quot; is each of ours as well, if we would only see it.<br />If you have a soul, you will love this book, and either way, it will certainly make you think.	2004-05-18

I would first like to tell you that upon my first reading of the novel I was not impressed. My first reading of the novel was when I was a freshman in high school. I didn't enjoy reading nor did I appreciate writing at that time. My disliking of reading contributed and affected my views on the book drastically. I decided to give the book another try again seven years later and I love it! I think if the book is read by an experienced reader at any age, then one could appreciate the book for the many great aspects and details provided for the readers.<br />This novel brings to us many feelings. It demonstrates to us how greed, wealth, love, ambition, success, lover's triangles, and one's desire can change life. Once all those things are linked together the plot becomes very intense. I enjoyed that the novel included all of those life's happenings.<br />The plot to the novel is very exciting. It portrays the early 1900's and the Jazz Age beautifully. I enjoyed that the plot was directed towards what daily life could bring to one's self. The characters, plot, daily occurrences, opportunities, employment, and the struggles in the book were all a very good representation of early American life. I feel the book portrayed real life, real problems, and real people. While reading the book I never thought or found what I was reading to be far fetched.<br />I enjoyed that the book was told by a character that wasn't the main character. I enjoyed the perspective that it gave by looking into Gatsby's life and not Gatsby simply being informative about his life story. I also enjoyed that the main characters were not the only focus in the book! There were additional characters that were linked in many different ways to the main ones and were introduced and then continuously followed upon. The book became to be a story about many people and how life`s obstacles affected their decisions, choices, and life in general.<br />I think anyone who enjoys reading should read this novel at least once. The novel has a very nice story line that I think most everyone should enjoy it! I give this book 4 stars!!!!I think anyone who enjoys reading should read this novel at least once.

It seemed from the people that I talked with were either fascinated or disappointed with its' story line. So my thoughts were mixed about the author and what he wrote, however, once I read the book I was quite pleased with the story and its' narrator, Nick Carraway, and the experiences he had with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby.<br />The book is essentially filled with love-hate relationships and suspenseful twists, which enlightened my curiosity page after page. It is no wonder that this book is being used in school curriculums as a required reading, for its material is interesting for many young minds because of its wide range of adventure, mystery, romance, and ambition within the book that kids can relate to in one aspect or another.<br />Furthermore, upon reading \\"The Great Gatsby\\" I would recommend anyone with virtually any reading level to jump at the opportunity to read it, for not only is F. Scott Fitzgerald one of our finest writers, his book \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is an American classic, and also the book may enhance your perspective of what New York and its people were like in the nineteen twenties.	2004-04-27

It truly has everything--the universal American themes of success and money, finely drawn characters, perhaps the most doomed love story ever written, and finally, a bitterly tragic ending.<br />I first read this book over 30 years ago at a time when I was first discovering Fitzgerald's genius.  However, I have since found myself coming back to it again and again.  The mood Fitzgerald's words generate is like nothing else I've ever experienced in literature, with the possible exception of the writings of Isak Dinesen.<br />In &quot;Gatsby&quot;, a sense of impending doom seems to loom over the entire story.  Here you have a hero whose only goal in life is winning the love of a boundlessly shallow and self-centered woman who can never be worthy of his affections.  Daisy's persona, combined with the world of money and carelessness that has produced her and her kind, can only lead to tragedy for Gatsby.<br />A masterpiece ...	2004-04-22

Scott Fitzgerald has been showered with praise and celebrated as one of the great authors of the century, and deservedly so. His language is remarkable because he uses quite an extensive vocabulary with the utmost precision, and is able to create vivid characters with a few succint phrases, a few strokes of the artist's brush. However, there are two things that strike me as odd in this novel: the &quot;prologue&quot;, that is, the first few paragraphs, which must have been written after the rest of the novel had been completed. This is a strange and ambiguous opening, and I am not sure that it is very good. And secondly the ending itself, because closure is brought about by introducing an accident (Daisy running over Tom's mistress). Somehow this is not satisfactory, at least not to me, because it avoids a final confrontation between the characters. Here Fitzgerald may as well have sent down a bolt of lightning to kill someone! People's fates in literature should be decided by themselves or by some other character, not by something beyond anyone's control. Why? Because that negates that character is fate and action; in fact, EVERYTHING in a novel should stem from character.	2004-04-19

Gatsby is a classic example. Having read the novel ten times over the last twenty years, I have enjoyed a certain distance and just as importantly the opportunity to compare different impressions at different stages of my life. The result is that I am even more impressed with the novel than all the annoying hype and commotion that continues to follow the novel would allow me to have. Without boring you about all the themes that have been hashed over and over, I would like to point out that there is a great question the novel asks us: Why does the narrator Nick have sympathy for Gatsby while loathing all the other chasers of the American Dream? It seems that Gatsby is a contradictory fellow, part ruthless dreamer zealously selling his soul to afford himself the trappings of fame, popularity, and glory. However, Gatsby, unlike the other ambitious characters in this novel, has a certain innocence and vulnerbility. Also, he is a true believer in his own delusion that if he can live a life a wealth and afford parties, he will overcome his childhood limitations and win the love of others. It's his craving of others' love that makes him sympathetic. In a way, he's a spiritual cousin of Citizen Kane who, for all his gaudy possessions, simply wanted the unconditional love represented by &quot;Rosebud&quot; on his sled, the embodiment of childhood belonging. Nick the narrator has the sensitivity to see this wounded child in Gatsby and reserves judgment against him.<br />Gatsby's pathological hunger for attention and popularity reminds me of all the people who go on Reality TV shows, hoping to promote themselves and be seen by all, grabbing their fifteen minutes of fame even as they debase themselves in various types of tomfoolery that showcase America's blind ambition and back-stabbing competition. Many years earlier, Fitzgerald saw how dangerous it was to blindly embrace American images of success without self-knowledge and without a moral code to keep us sane and he wrote about this theme so elegantly in Gatsby, a masterpiece that transcends all our limiting preconceptions we bring to it.ompetition.

Its takes place in Long island, New york in the summer of 1922. I really like New York since I have been there many times. This made the book better for me because i can relate to it more. The main character is named Nick Carraway. Nick is a young guy who has moved from minnesota to a district of Long Island called West Egg. West Egg is a very wealthy district. Nicks neighbor is a man named Jay Gatsby. Jay lives in a huge house and has parties ever saturday night. Fitzgerald does a good job of describing East and West Egg. He gives you a clear immage of what is going on and the various types of views. Throughout the book, there is a lot of chaos going on between the diferent couples which makes the story very interesting. I like how Fitzgerald describes Gatsby's house to be very gothic and prodiguous. Throughout the book you learn not only about Gatsby's past, but all the characters secrects.Almost all the characters in this book have or are cheating on the ones that they love.It was tricky to understand completely what was going on durring the book. Nick learns a lot about the people he meets in Long Island. Although most of the things he learns are not good things. Overall i thought this story was exiting and fun to read. Although I found it to be quite confusing at times. I would still recomend this book to all.	2004-03-26

Inevitably, the story ends in tragedy.  Really, the story centers around the main character's dream to find a relationship.  This dream ended in adultery and murder.  The character, Nick, from which the story is told from in the first person, gives this conclusion,<br />\\"His dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.  He did not know that it was already behind him....Gatsby believed in the (dream), the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us.  It eluded us then but that's no matter- tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\"<br />In a sense, the story is a dark account of humanity's failure to achieve happiness in pleasure, relationships and money.  In trying to achieve these things, mankind ruins lives.  In the end, we find that the wealthy, popular Gatsby only has three people at his funeral.  While the number of people at a funeral is not a marker of success or happiness in life, it does show that attempts at popularity, wealth and power does not add up to much in the end.	2004-03-19

Now I have read the book four times, and I have yet to understand what makes this novel receive all the praise it does.  The plot is like a Beverly Hills 90210 episode in the 1920s.  The plot is that Gatsby loved a beautiful socialite Daisy way back when.  Then Gatsby had to leave for the war, though Daisy promised to wait for him.  Unfortunately, Daisy didn't wait and married the overtly rich Tom Buchanan instead.  So Gatsby accumulated all this wealth and stature in hopes of winning back Daisy.  There are two problems here though.  One, Gatsby doesn't love Daisy, he loves what she stands for, money, power and social standing. Two, Daisy doesn't love Gatsby, she is too vapid and shallow and only loves men with money (and when she first met Gatsby he told her he was wealthy, which at the time was a lie) which is why she married Tom instead of waiting for Gatsby.  I also had a problem with Nick as the narrator.  If this was supposed to be a story of Gatsby and Daisy why on earth do we care about who he is having lunch with or what the weathers like?  Also, when things happened, like Tom breaking Myrtle's nose, Nick didn't seem to care he just told the reader about it and them went on to something else (\\"The sky was shining blue as bright as a diamond\\"..blah blah blah)  Upon reading the reviews here I noticed that many kids like me also had to read this book and most them didn't like it.  I don't hate this book and I'm not going off on one of those \\"This was so boring!\\" tangents.  My problem was with the characters.  Daisy was a vapid, shallow money loving gold digger.  I couldn't understand why any man would love her.  Gatsby spent so much time trying to live up to the measures of a women who would never really love him unless he was made out of gold. Tom was a hypocritical, racist, sexist punk.  Jordan was a lying, cheating loser.  If they are examples of being wealthy, of fulfilling the American dream (in this book is to do what? Become a bored snob?) then I don't think its really worth it.(in this book is to do what? Become a bored snob?) then I don't think its really worth it.	2004-03-07

They represent important things in the book.  Weather and time are very important symbols.  Weather, especially when Daisy, Jordan, Tom and Nick went to the Plaza Hotel, represented tempers flaring as the heat got more intense.  Time represented Gatsby trying to change the past. F.

I am a junior in highschool who has recently finished reading this book.  I happen to believe that you are older than me and yet, I understood the book better than you.  Why don't you read it a little more carefully next time?  There aren't any unanswered questions.  Gatsby's work is subtely mentioned in the book after Gatsby's death when Nick picks up a phone call that was meant for Gatsby. On page 174, Nick is confused by what the man on the other line wants from Gatsby. &quot;'Young Parke's in trouble,' he said rapidly. 'They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter.'&quot;  It goes on to tell how it actually happened.  If one read closely enough, it is obvious that Gatsby was not a bootlegger, as believed by Tom, but a white collar criminal who created counterfeit bonds.  <BR>I also do not enjoy seeing comments like &quot;teenagers don't appreciate books, read it when you grow up,&quot; because I really liked the book and am sure that many other teenagers appreciate it too.	2004-03-07

He ends up renting a small cottage next to a mansion, which is occupied by the man who gives his name to the book, Jay Gatsby.  This story takes place during what was known as the \\"roaring twenties\\" when everyone seemed to get rich quick.  People who weren't there to experience it first hand seem to see it as a time when everyone got rich, went to speakeasies and consumed alcohol illegally.  F. Scott Fitzgerald seems to think that the twenties were an era of possibility, aspiration and achievement.  Gatsby is a deep, mysterious character that has secretly loved Nick's second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, since they used to date five years before the story takes place.  In the present, Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan, and they have a young daughter.  Tom has a mistress, who is also married, and Gatsby takes the opportunity to win back Daisy's heart.<br /> Like Gatsby, I've made the mistake of thinking I wasn't good enough for someone and that they wouldn't accept me just the way I was.  Jay Gatsby took it to a higher level than I when he lied about his upbringing and basically \\"wrote his own story.\\"  It is heartbreaking to think that someone won't accept you for who you really are.  It hurts when people see your flaws and imperfections as what makes them better than you instead of viewing those flaws as what makes you human.  This book, narrated by Nick, who said, \\"I am one of the few honest people I have ever known,\\" brought me to the realization that people should not be ashamed of their past and the details of their less than perfect lives and instead learn to love them because it is what makes us who we are.<br /> The Great Gatsby accentuates the idea that ambition is a strong virtue. It reminds us that when you strive to become the best and you want it bad enough, you'll get it.  Our lives should be about turning ambition into success instead of material things and status.  We need to achieve happiness in our own lives before we try and be happy with someone else.

Scott Fitzgerald<br />For my report I really didn't know what book to read, I asked around and one answer I got was to read the Great Gatsby. The person I asked had said they had never read the book but it was a really good movie. Since I have heard of this book before because it was a classic I decided to read it and I have to say I was not at all impressed. I decided that maybe the movie would improve on things, but I soon realized that this also was not all it was cracked up to be.<br />I thought that the book's basic plot was really good and interesting, but the problem with the book was that it didn't always follow the basic plot. This book was about a past love between Jay Gatsby and Daisy Duchanan trying to rekindle itself many years later, but there is only one problem, Daisy is already married to a man who is cheating on her with a girl from New York. Yes this sounds very intriguing, and it is, but this was only the story for a little more that half the book. The other half was the cousin of Daisy, Nick Carraway (teller of the story) telling about a party he went to, or what his backyard looked like, or the weather that day. What I am saying is that the tangents Nick went off on took away from the attention of what was really going on in the story.<br />The fact that it was told by Nick was a weird point of view to lay the story out at. It is difficult to tell a love story from the point of view from neither of the lovers. You can never really tell what they're thinking, which either adds to the suspense of the story or, takes away a lot of detail.<br />The book also left so many unanswered questions, one in particular being: where did Gatsby get all his money? He said that it was inherited from a man he was with at sea who died, but later tells us that most of it was wasted in the panic of the war. All we can infer is that he was gaining all this money through something illegal; drugs maybe, but never really know exactly what he was doing. This is not to say this is a bad book completely, just a very slow paced book in which most action takes place the last 70 pages about. This book is more for people who are into quiet romance novels and are very patient in their reading, in other words, for people who aren't me. Even though it seems like I spent the last paragraph trashing the book I would like to make it clear that I didn't hate it, I just didn't really like it either. It did have its moments though, just not as many as I would have liked.<br />The movie didn't improve on things. It mirrored the book exactly, scene by scene. I can honestly say I don't think they had a sentence out of place. It is like, if you saw the movie, you practically read the book. Not like in other movies such as \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" where once you've seen it, you still don't know what the books about. This really surprised me because for such a short book (189 pages) it was a long movie (2 hours and so). This was mainly because of how much they stuck to the book, which I think wasn't the smartest thing to do. I think some of the scenes they included where a little stretched out rather than just getting to the point. Like the scene where Daisy and Gatsby meet again for the first time in many years. They just sat there for a while, then walked around a bit and talked in a very drone voice.<br />This brings me to another case about the movie, the acting. The parts of Daisy and Jordan (a good friend of Daisy and Nick) were very either over dramatized or under dramatized. Daisy is supposed to be calm, with a soothing voice. Instead they made her constantly shaking and her voice always in a quiver. The part of Jordan, who was supposed to be jaunty and full of life, walked slowly and spoke with a monotone voice. The movie did however clear up a few parts in the book that were confusing to me. When I read a certain part I didn't really understand what had just happened but the movie is able to show you rather than just describing it.<br />In conclusion for those of you who enjoy faster paced books, this isn't for you. I would recommend this to romance readers who are very patient with their reading. This book is obviously not for everybody but I have asked more people and got good responses about this book so all I can say now is read at your own risk.describing it. <BR>In conclusion for those of you who enjoy faster paced books, this isn't for you.

Scott Fitzgerald, and I really enjoyed it, although the story was sad.  I liked how he wrote the story from the observations of a neighbor. I like the way he wrote the novel.  I could picture some of the events and conversations taking place.  This novel painted a picture that seemed more real to me than many other novels I have read.  The plot was also good.<br />What happened? Nick Carraway was the neighbor to Jay Gatsby.  Gatsby owns a large house and throws extravegant parties.  His ambition is to have his former love, who is now married, attend one of his parties, and so renew their former relationship.  The women Gatsby loved has an unfaithful husband and some of the novel deals with his mistress.  There are also many twists in the novel, that kept me interested and allowed me to finish the book in one night. I encourage you to read this book.  It is not long and is very well written.	2004-02-15

Other works in this same category include Invisible Man, anything by Dostoyevsky, anything by Tolstoy... well you get the idea.<br />Gatsby, with its tight almost terse language, complex relationships, and subtle imagery places it among the great works of American literature.  Its subject, wanting and loss, are feelings with which Fitzgerald was intimately familiar.  Tragically, many people were turned off to this work as teens when they could not yet understand its multi layered emotional landscape.  Hopefully, some of them return to the book as adults so that they can experience a real reading pleasure. Fitzgerald died young, but he left the world a master work.	2004-01-22

Can you imagine a millionaire who would give up everything he owns just to be with the girl he loves for another second? Joe Gatsby is such a man. After years of fruitless searching he has finally found the girl again he loves more than life itself; and he is determined to win her back, no matter what the price might be.<br />In my opinion Fitzgerald does do a great job in portraying New York's high society of the 1920's. As the plot carefully unfolds the reader gets to know more and more about the protagonist's past and can consequently form his own opinion not just about Joe Gatsby, but about a whole class of society.<br />I would recommend this book to adults of every age. Fitzgerald uses a variety of different symbols and a rather elevated style which is not always easy to understand upon the first reading. However, I think that one should take the time and let oneself be enchanted by a storey of love and betrayal that will be unlike everything one has read before.	2004-01-15

This novel has been characterized as the quintessential American novel, and even as &quot;THE&quot; American novel.  Whether or not I agree with that characterization, F. Scott Fitzgerald's short but dense tale is a masterpiece.  That said, there is not much I can add to the years and years of analysis and praise.  This book is simply stunning.<br />I will not rehash plot details here, but I will make a few comments.  I studied this book as an English major at college, and just reread it for fun 10 years later.  I remember reading it as a student, and learning about all the symbolism present.  If you look for it, you can find symbolism contained in every paragraph.  A few symbolic themes I remember studying were those of colors, the weather, religion and the Bible, and numbers.  I remember learning that different colors represented different traits.  White, for example, supposedly represents purity, while yellow represents artificiality.  Therefore, the name Daisy is itself a symbol:  a daisy is white on the outside and yellow in the center.  Accordingly, Daisy appears to be pure but inside is tarnished and artificial.<br />While it is fascinating to study all the symbolism in this novel, this time I read it purely for the story.  And the story is more than enough.  Strip away all of the symbolism, and this would still be a masterpiece.  This is the tale of a twisted perversion of the American dream--one of Gatsby's ambition to amass a fortune in order to win over Daisy.  Yet he will never win over Daisy, for she will never love one who has to earn his wealth.  It is the story of Gatsby's failure to win even one true friend, despite the fact that his house is always filled with people, and everyone &quot;knows&quot; him.  Even the narrator only arranges Gatsby's funeral out of a sense of obligation and pity.<br />This slim masterpiece is beautifully and concisely written, and heartbreaking without ever being sentimental.  This book has survived 75 years worth of critical analysis, and it still going strong.  In another 75 years, people will still be studying this grotesque manifestation of the American dream.tical analysis, and it still going strong.

Upon finishing the novel found myself contemplating who was driving whose car, who was kissing who, and who shot who.  Then an incredible idea dawned on me:I couldn't give two $#!ts.  The book is a confusing roller coaster ride of creepy behind the scenes love affairs, convoluted past relationships, and the inconsequential and oddly enough santimonious attractions to mysterious green lights,wealth, and a never ending desire for the ultimate twentieth century American ideal: A big house, a big wallet, and a big Rolls Royce in the driveway.  Twenty pages from the end when I discovered that the old windbag Gatzby had been murdered (YES!!! I do take pleasure in ruining the ending to millions of eager readers out there), I closed the book and ended the worhtless drivel once and for all.  All in all, I have to say that I don't take any shame in saying that the only satifaction I got from reading the book was when i found out that Gatzby is dead.

As such, it is timeless.<br />In this book, author F. Scott Fitzgerald perfectly captures the energy of that moment when the Gilded Age was ending and the Jazz Age was beginning. Set among the estates of Long Island's elegant North Shore, Fitzgerald illustrates why \\"the rich are different from you and me,\\" a classic line straight out of this novel.<br />Treatises have been written on whether Fitzgerald was the best American author of the 20th Century. Regardless of the conclusion as to whether he was the single best, there is no dispute that he belongs in the pantheon of the writing gods.  To read GATSBY is to lose oneself in Fitzgerald's lyricism.<br />So, re-read THE GREAT GATSBY, and enjoy what it takes to make a book truly great.	2003-11-15

Instead, he became the Great Gatsby, moving like a Homeric Gyad among the party-goers of East and West Egg. His money came from a dubious &quot;gonnegtion&quot; with the wolf (Meyer Wolfsheim, rather than Lanski), to whom he had presented himself in his uniform, covered with medals, because he lacked the cash to buy clothes.<br />Like many an able lad of plain background (North Dakota) Jay encounters the leisured class, particularly the beautiful and popular Daisy (she loves me, she loves me not). Supposed to wait while he went to war (that one again), she marries into Buchanan money and has a daughter. Jay comes back to hover around the green light at the end of her dock and build a life &quot;founded securely on a fairy's wing.&quot;<br />We are treated to a catalog of party-goers parallel to the catalog of ships in the Iliad. The denizens of the two Eggs are more fragile than heroic. Jay makes his move for Daisy, who nods back and forth between him and her husband, Tom. The significance of the daughter seems to escape Jay totally (what's it all about, Jay?).<br />Finally, one horribly hot evening, Daisy, driving Jay's car beside Jay, runs down and kills her rival for Tom's affections, Myrtle Wilson. Tom, driving in a subsequent car, tells Wilson, Myrtle's husband, whose car it was. Wilson shoots Jay. Tom never finds out the truth, and Nick Carraway, the narrator of the story, walks away from the entire irresponsible crowd.<br />This writing is a fictional story from the mind of the great F. Scott Fitzgerald and is not a document of American society. Perhaps people like his characters have existed, but America is bigger than he. If the shoe doosn't fit, don't wear it!	2003-11-01

There were some things I liked about the book but more things I didn't like about the book.  It seemed like too much of the same thing happened, with the affairs and then the deaths.<br /> The Characters were one of the things I enjoyed about the book.  That was probably the only thing I enjoyed about it.  Nick Carraway, he was the narrator, the thing that I didn't like about him was he claims to be objective.  Throughout the whole book he isn't objective at all he always seems to judge others.  To me Jay Gatsby was my favorite character.  He started out poor and left his love to go to Vietnam and then he came back and worked hard to try to get her back.  He became a millionaire.  He always threw the most amazing parties and he just seemed like the man.  All of the other characters I didn't like that much daisy tom Myrtle, and Daisy.<br /> The things that I didn't like about the book were there was too many affairs.  I understand that there are a lot of affairs that take place in the real world but I don't think you need to have that many affairs in one book.  I also don't like how Nick left Jordan at the end and he just went back because things got too weird and complicated.  I also don't like how Gatsby dies at the end and I thought when Myrtle died that was a little cheesy.  I mean she died by Gatsby car running over her. I couldn't stand that at all.  I also didn't like how Daisy didn't wait for Gatsby; I mean if they were in love you think she would wait for him.<br /> I gave the book a bad review because to me the book didn't seem to keep my interest for a long period of time.  I also think that the book just wasn't a type of book I like to read.	2003-10-31

Scott Fitzgerald, the suspense never ends.  The character the book is revolved around is a man named Gatsby.  In the first part of the book Gatsby does not take the role of a main character.  No one knows much about this man Gatsby except that he owns a house on the Long Island Sound and hosts many parties.  Gatsby is a very rich man.  He has servants take care of his house and himself.  He also owns an enormous house with a pool.  Sometimes Gatsby even takes people up in his hydroplane.  When referring to a hydroplane he means a seaplane.  Gatsby claims that he is rich because of a large inheritance from his family out west.  Gatsby is also a self made millionaire.  He also states that he made some of the money in the oil and drug business.  Gatsby is a mystery that many people gossip about.  Many people say that he supposedly went the Oxford while others disagreed and said he lied about that.  Other rumors that circled around the neighborhood are that he was a soldier and killed some Germans.  What Gatsby did is for you to find out?  Gatsby's true character finally comes out during the book.  He becomes good friends with the main character Carraways in the book who eventually finds his true character.  In my opinion, Gatsby is a very discreet person not sharing any of his secrets with anybody.  Gatsby meets this woman Daisy who is married to Buchanan.  This is where the story unfolds.	2003-10-28

Though at times I found it somewhat difficult to follow, and found myself re-reading paragraphs to better understand it.  At first I believed the theme to be that of a love story, but further reading brought me to find the main theme, which was the American dream in the 1920's.  The dream was to become wealthy and socially excepted by a higher class, even if it meant going against your morals.  I think I like this novel because I can relate the dream of the 1920's to be very similar to that of today.  This connection helped me to stay interested and better understand what the theme was about.<br />My favorite character was Nick Carraway even though he had no desire to achieve this dream.  He possessed a very strong character and did not give in to the immoral things his neighbors did, which separated him from the rest.  Nick was the middle man and it was interesting to see how he learned of everyone's affairs, even his cousin's, which he had a hand in setting up.  He was also the narrator, so his ideas and views influenced the reader's feelings about the story, as we saw the account from his point of view. This is the first novel that I have ever read where the main character was not in the beginning or end of the story.  Nick was the person who was important in the beginning and end of the book, though he was not the main character. This approach was very appealing and pretty amazing.  Jay Gatsby was another character that I found interesting.  He was the main character of the story and was who the novel revolved around.  He was a young man who made his millions illegally and only did it to win his long-life love back.  And that is why at first I believed the theme to be about love.<br />The ending of the novel was very attention grabbing.  I would have never guessed it to end that way.  I think the ending was the best part.  It really showed the American dream and how immoral people can be to one another.  The ending really made me think about my dreams and how I should be careful in all things I do and that I should always stick to my morals.ple can be to one another.

The story starts off slowly, but has a lot of plot to make you want to keep reading. The story is interesting because the whole picture comes together as you read. The story is a bit complicated if you skim through it, so it is a book you have to read in its entirety in order to understand the stories plot twists and to understand the characters. The characters way of speaking gives the book its early 1900's feel, and the clothes they wear also help. The book is in a way a love story, and is the focus, but there is a lot more than just the focus on Gatsby wanting to be with Daisy. There are the relationships between Daisy and Tom, Tom and Myrtle, and the relationship between Myrtle and George. These relationships create examples of the characters are, conflict, and plot in the story are shown through dioulouge and situations. Example for showing that Tom was a violent person was when Myrtle shouted the name of his wife,<br />\\"Daisy, Daisy, Daisy!\\" Tom hits Myrtle in the face and breaks her nose.<br /> Why I recommend this book be because it is an interesting story. It's interesting in the way that truth slowly surfaces throughout the book. The story about Gatsby and who he really is makes you want to keep reading, and also to see if he achieves his goal. The book successfully covers how Gatsby uses the American Dream, power and money, to try and achieve his goal of winning back Daisy. The way Gatsby gets his power and money, bootlegging alcohol, fits in perfect due to the time period that the story takes place because there is a prohibition going on.<br />One thing I didn't like about the book is that the book is very detailed, especially about the characheters. I found it difficult to come back to the book after not reading it for a week. I went back several times to remember the story and recent developments. Other than that one minor difficulty the book is very good and is recommended.is recommended.	2003-10-21

I question whether I should even write a review of a book I dislike which most people, even most of my friends, seem to adore.  What it comes down to, for me, is that all the characters, even the best of them (namely Gatsby) are amoral, and the worst of them are vile.  I ended up reading this book for school twice.  The first time, in high school, I finished it and thought, &quot;I must be missing something,&quot; so I bought and read through the Cliffs Notes, and then said, &quot;Well yes, I knew all that, but so what?&quot;  In college I was assigned to read it a second time, and that time I got more substance out of it.  The book will never be one of my favorites, though.  I just haven't got enough cynicism in my soul (at least not yet, anyway) to look into a moral vaccuum and find much enlightenment there.<br />Perhaps I should read it a third time; it's a short book, after all.  I'm older now, and I do get the point in a way I couldn't have then--Gatsby falls in love not with a real woman, but with his own dream vision of her, and confrontation with the real thing shatters him.  (Then again, Don Quixote did the exact same thing without making me dislike him.)  The equating in Gatsby's mind of love with money is also worth understanding as a very American hang-up, but it does just make him seem pathetic.  And yes, I know that's the point.<br />I also concede that one reason I disliked it was the sheer glut of tragedies I was forced to read in school.  I find that I have more patience for unhappy endings in fiction now that they're not being forced on me.  (Heck, I read Dostoevsky for fun, now).  But unhappy endings need not be the same thing as nihilism.  Gatsby's universe is a highly nihilistic one, a world so far gone that even the saddest ideals seem priceless simply for being ideals.<br />Perhaps it's the kind of cynicism the book represents--it's not &quot;grumpy old man&quot; cynicism like Vonnegut or Twain, which at least feels earned and honest.  No, this is youthful &quot;look how worldly I am&quot; cynicism, the sort that drives us as kids to write bad poetry and wear lots of black.  Perhaps that's inevitable--the characters ARE all young, and the book is about decadence.<br />It may also be the humorlessness of the book that sets it aside from Vonnegut and Twain.  I enjoyed de Laclos's &quot;Dangerous Liasons,&quot; where the protagonists are both insidiously evil, but at least the cynicism there is laced with black humor.  Gatsby carries an unrelenting air of &quot;I'm writing something important, dammit!&quot;<br />It's not my cup of tea.  You're free to like it.

And I absolutely loved the perspective character, Nick; Fitzgerald sets up at the very beginning that Nick is an observant character who is careful with his judgement and remains true to this characterization throughout the story.<br />However, I gave it just four stars because it took quite a while for me to get into the story, which isn't very long to begin with (my copy is only 115 pages). But I did enjoy it and was impressed that such a charismatic story could be told in just over a hundred pages.

The story is somewhat reminiscent of Heart of Darkness.  Both are first person narrations of the downfall of fabulous, ambitious social outsiders.  And \\"Gatsby\\" points to the heart of darkness in American life, not only in the shady and criminal wellsprings of Jay Gatsby's wealth - and, by implication, perhaps, all wealth - but also in the coldness and cruel indifference of the privileged classes in the social hierarchy.<br /> The story touches on many traditional American themes.  The loss of innocence and the seduction of the new world by the wicked old one - roles often assumed by America and Europe - are here played out here in the second-favorite context of heartland versus New York, as the young sons and daughters of the Midwest are drawn into the web of the old, worldly, moneyed, Jewish metropolis.  As the narrator, Nick Carraway, observes, not only does he hail from around Minnesota, but so do the other major characters - Jordan Baker, the Buchanans and Gatsby (and indeed Fitzgerald himself).  Fitzgerald's America is different from today's.  Whiter, much more parochial and homogenous, and smaller - Carraway uses the terms west and midwest interchangeably, whereas today west means LA not Chicago.  Yet it is still familiar and its concerns regarding the struggle for success, the discovery that its attainment need not mean happiness, and the fickleness of social approval are as pressing today as they were then.  The role of money is not as primary as that of acceptance and prestige, and certainly less important than in many 19th century European novels where it is a true nexus.  Here - as in the lives of the super-rich today - it is mainly just a way of keeping score.  The themes of remaking oneself, of moving and making a new start, and the gap between one's newly constructed self and one's enduring personal reality are likewise as topical (and American) as ever.  The lurid denouement also has a flavour which is all too familiar today and is reminiscent of any number of recent classic American violent scandals among the newly rich - cases like Harris-Tarnower, the Menendez brothers, OJ or Ted Ammon.<br />Obviously, many of these issues were of direct personal import to Fitzgerald himself, yet \\"Gatsby\\" is a truly mature work without a trace of autobiographical flavour.  Fluidly and assuredly written, it has stood the proverbial test of time, while many contemporary and later works have begun to date or are entirely forgotten.  The epigram at the start is perhaps one of the funniest to preface any major piece of fiction (although Fitzgerald - or his editor - chose well in not using it in the title).  Yet for all its merits, \\"Gatsby\\" is a slighter work than its reputation suggests: a novella, perhaps, but it has the feel of a short story.

Told in first-person through the young, middle-class metaphor Nick Carraway, the story has one of the most overarching themes I have ever encountered.  On one level a tragic love triangle between Daisy Buchanan, Tom Miller, and Jay Gatsby.  On another, it tells the story of New York's middle- and upper-classes, and the aftereffects of a lavish lifestyle on both societies.<br />The narrative unfolds in a straightforward manner, and the language is beautiful, the prose intricately crafted with the care of a master gardener.<br />The novel also touches briefly on the theme of war as well; Gatsby returns to find his idea of feminine perfection, Daisy, has married the bellicose Tom Buchanan.  Gatsby becomes infatuated with the acquisition of wealth, material possessions and appearances the centerpoint of his existence.  Which makes his ending all the more powerful; in the end, Gatsby is undone by his greed and egocentrism.<br />There is much, much more to the book--including the character of Jordan Baker, the significance of Gatsby's surname, and Meyer Wolfsheim--but there is not nearly enough space to discuss this masterpiece of American Literature.<br />Yes, it has been the hallmark of high school English classes, but that should not be it's grave; indeed, it is the foundation of modern literature and the defining moment for an entire generation.	2003-09-27

But the magic of the book resides in the depth of the context in which the story unfolds: the restless prosecution of money which characterizes Americans (in general), and which in this case would also buy love. It is a Romantic story in the strict sense of the concept.<br />The novel evolves with agility, elegance, and freshness. Jay Gatsby is a new millionaire who desperately tries to recover his beloved girlfriend of old, now married to a bully and also millionaire man. The narrator is a neighbor of Gatsby, Nick, who is witness to Gatsby's efforts to reconquer Daisy Buchanan. Eventually the lovers reunite, but of course happiness lasts little, and the events unfold, as another reviewer has aptly put it, like a Greek tragedy. Social conventions impose themselves, and finally Realism triumphs over Romanticism. It all happens in the Twenties, when American society rapidly evolved towards the hedonism and materialism that characterizes much of it today. It is undeniably a great novel and it will last not just because it reflects neatly the American character, but because in the end it speaks to any manifestation of human nature. Say: back when you were a young person, and your loved one turned you down, didn't you dream of becoming rich and successful and THEN getting the girl (or boy)? How did it turn out?	2003-09-04

The tale is a romance, Jay Gatsby longs to be with Daisy, a girl from a different social world that he knew for a short period of time mamy years before.  On a different level the book describes the pointless existence of the idle rich and their dissatisfaction with their lot, although set in the 1920's it is still applicable today in many ways.  The characters Fitzgerald paints are shallow and undeserving, having achieved their wealth through inheritance or crime.  The author clearly is critical of his creations, but at the same time seems to be entranced by their mixture of style without substance.  My one dissapointment was the lack of any character I felt I could identify with or empathise with, even the narrator Nick Carroway came across to me as having few if any endearing qualities.  Probably just my personal prejudice in a novel rather than any literary requirement.	2003-07-15

It is easy to become enthralled with the lavishness and mystery of Gatsby, but the center of the book remains with the protagonist's analysis and understanding of human nature.<br />Most great writers embed their thoughts, experiences, and musings into their work, and The Great Gatsby is a perfect example. What you find in the book will differ, some will say it's an accurate portrayal of the shallowness of the 20's, others will find a deep feeling of sadness: that no one is ever be truely happy, whether you are a beautiful woman, a football star, a millionaire, or if a famous woman is attracted to you and you live in West Egg.<br />The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the book seemed a little flat. Perhaps it is a side effect of being concise, but I felt very little attachment towards any of the characters, and although Fitzgerald gave them some dimension, it's been done far better.<br />The Great Gatsby is a book I would recommend none-the-less.	2003-07-11

She may have been called the original obscure object of desire. Jay Gatsby hungers for a past where he was happy with Daisy. But is she is part of the  moneyed world  which is entered by crime or by inheritance. No one really earns it. Fitzgerald seems at odds with the American dream of wealth, but attracted to the glamour and excess of it.<br />The lack of  a moral compass in financial matters, can also be seen in the directionless lives of the novel's characters. Gatsby uses his fortune in an ill fated attempt to bring back Daisy. The narrator has empty affairs with people in his office. Daisy and Tom `smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money ... and let other people clean up the mess.' The author seems attracted to fame and fortune, and yet horrified by it. There is no moral centre in this universe.<br />A very sad novel that has haunted readers for almost 80 years.	2003-06-29

The story is told through the eyes of Nick Carroway, who sees from all perspectives the world of the rich: the hollowness of the Buchanons, the &quot;mask&quot; that Gatsby must wear to attain his goals, the many &quot;acquaintences&quot; of the Gatsby parties who only attend his parties because it serves their own purpose of having a good time.<br />At the heart core of this tale is the question of how far one must go to follow the aquistion of a dream, whether realistic or not. Nick admires Gatsby's determination, but he sees the dangers of Gatsby continuing to follow his dream. However, what Nick learns from Gatsby is the most essential part of the book.<br />This is one of those books that starts off relatively slow, but picks up as we move on. It is set in the mid 1920s and has a few flashback references to Gatsby's former affair with Daisy. Overall I would recommend reading this book if you have never done so. I will admit that I was assigned this book in high school, but never even finished it. When I reread it a few years later, I was pleasantly surprised. I think what you should take from a book like The Great Gatsby is what it says about not only life in the 1920s, but the times we live in now.	2003-06-22

I found it a little hard to get into, but as soon as I did I absolutely fell in love with it, and it has become one of my all-time favorite novels.  The honesty and accuracy that Fitzgerald writes with makes The Great Gatsby a timeless piece of literature, and the social comments that Fitzgerald makes are as relevant today as they were in the 1920s.

Though its language isn't as easy to follow as today's modern language is, the book still retains its clarity.<br />Aside from its ability to enthrall, The Great Gatsby also addresses the American problem of superficiality and greed.

Scott Fitzgerald was a writer who truly understood that &quot;writing is revision.&quot;  The story of the Great Gatsby covers an era of decadence and lavish living that most of us can't imagine.

There are some descrepancies within the story but, beyond that, the writing is phenomonal.<br />Fitzgerald takes the English language and plays with it, subtly. Giving us beautiful phrases and lingering images that were quite exciting in his day. As we live in an age of hurry up and hurry up, reading his work is a real pleasure.

There are many who consider THE GREAT GATSBY to be the great American novel.

The book evokes a particular time and place like very few writings can. The words in the novel flow together like cool water in a fresh-water mountain stream. However, what I find most amazing about THE GREAT GATSBY is that even though the novel doesn't have any truly redeeming characters and has a plot that is pointless and somewhat predictable, the story unwittingly sweeps the reader into the world in which it takes place so that before one realizes it, the story is over and the book is finished. Not very many stories can do that. It's not difficult to understand why Andy Kaufman loved this book so.	2003-05-26

It deals with the quest of one with a purpose, and his attempt to attain it and the purposeless person accompanying it.  This copy includes the sections; Forward, Preface, The Text of The Great Gatsby, and A Brief Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald by Matthew J.

The added material is useful and informative, providing the reader with welcome information on various aspects of both the author and book.<br />The book is quite faithful to its time period, presenting a world uniquely of its own, a world content to be defined as the 1920s.  There are many historical inclusions, creating an atmosphere of unexpected reality.  The author also sticks to his thoughts concerning social matters, being sure to complete and keep up any attempted efforts in the area.<br />The literary style is very involving, not giving a hint of boredom or disinterest in his work.  His countless corrections and drafts prove their worth in the masterful storytelling ability of its conceiver through the work.  However, Fitzgerald displays more than a few discrepancies regarding geographical and chronological matters.  The style the contributing author, Bruccoli, presents conveys a sense of at least slight disinterest in the topic, damaging his rather valuable additions.  Scribner presents a style that is slightly over praising, but does contribute meaningfully.<br />The chronological and geographical discrepancies detract little from The Great Gatsby, as its true worth and meaning are presented in the lives and actions of the characters.

This relatively short novel is a biting commentary on the nature of class distinctions in American society in the early 1900s.  Gatsby, the 'hero,' is an extremely rich man who lives in a mansion and throws extravagant parties.  But he has not always been that way.  Once he was a pauper.<br />Gatsby is in love with Daisy, a married woman who comes from a wealthy family.  Though Gatsby now has money, he has 'new money'--in other words, he has not come from a long line of wealthy individuals.  This, in some ways, makes him inferior, at least in the eyes of Daisy and her husband.  The power of this novel, the lasting appeal it has, lies in Fitzgerald's poignant commentary on American upper-class mentality.<br />Nick, the narrator, comments that the rich are often \\"careless people,\\" and that they \\"smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back to their money...and let other people clean up the mess they made.\\"  What makes Gatsby great is his driving ambition, his burning desire to penetrate the upper social strata and get the heart of the woman he loves.<br />This novel is very tragic, but Gatsby himself seems to be more of a pathetic hero.  This is one of the things which gives the novel its appeal, and which makes Gatsby 'great'--he can be seen as the underdog clawing and fighting his way to the top, only to realize he isn't welcome there.  Besides being beautifully written, well told, and enjoyable to read, the Great Gatsby has a very important message to convey--sometimes (unfortunately), money IS everything.	2003-05-15

It seems inane to review The Great Gatsby because of its proverbial timelessness and consistent crowd of faithful readers, especially at my age and lack of literary experience, but it also seems blasphemous not to pay homage to Fitzgerald by indulging in his brillant novel. He intertwines the moral value of the rich vs. the poor in the early 1920's, and the general thematic virtues of life in an exceptional storyline. Fitzgerald tactfully constructs the plot throughout the majority of the novel, resulting in a crescendo of clashing characters and settings, but then slowly extinguishes the tension with a calming resolution. Several literary philosophies/movements are threaded throughout and it is an extraordinary read. I suggest it to anyone who likes classic literature or just books in general.	2003-05-13

Gatsby, the main character, lives an illegal life for the love of a silly married rich girl named Daisy. Daisy thinks that ignorance will get women far in life. In my opinion she is pretty ignorant her self. Tom, Daisy's husband, thinks that money and power gives him the right to do what he wishes to do, including hit women and cheat on his wife with Myrtle Wilson. Myrtle is also married and hopes to one day live a glamorous life with Tom, but Tom is lying when he said he would leave his wife for Myrtle. Myrtle's husband, George Wilson, is a depressed man that looks at life as though it were covered in ashes. The others live in West Egg also known as New York, the city of sin. These confused individuals all have one thing in common and that is that their outlook on life is all wrong. <BR> In the story I found that F. Scott Fitzgerald used colors to help express the characters. He did this by using the green light outside Gatsby's house to show that he had money; he used white dresses that Daisy, Daisy's daughter, and Jordan wore to show they were rich. The Valley of Ashes is a gray gloomy dark depressed place. The author did this to describe the setting more clearly to the reader. I enjoyed the color coordination in the book. The colors make this book more interesting and unique. <BR> The characters were overall selfish people that really did not care much about anyone else. Gatsby's love for Daisy clouds his mind and the facts that Daisy is married already and has a child. Their love affair could jeopardize Tom and Daisy's marriage and the daughter. Tom cheats on his wife regardless that there is a child involved. No one in the story really mentions anything about the welfare of the child. Everyone seems to be much too involved in other things. George just wants to up and leave so bad that he overlooks Myrtle's feelings. Myrtle hurts George to the point of depression, and won't even go to a church when his friend suggests it to him. Daisy leads Gatsby on, knowing that she can't and won't leave Tom. Nick's need to be friendly to everyone blinds him to the point were he can't prevent the tragedies that occur when it's possible to do so. <BR> If I could change one thing about the book The Great Gatsby it would be Gatsby's love for Daisy. The whole love thing between Gatsby and Daisy dose not make sense at all. I would change this because Gatsby's love for her leads to tragedy. Gatsby could have done better. Gatsby was a strange guy that did too much for too little. Gatsby let himself be taken for granted. <BR> I would recommend this book to anyone that is selfish or someone that looks at love, money, power, or dreaming as though this means everything in the world. These things may be good to have but, like in The Great Gatsby, too much can lead a person to his end.

There were, however a few moments within this picture that I was vaguely disappointed in.<br />For one, a large portion of the acting was over the top and very unbelieveable.  The man who played Gatsby is perfect in terms of appearance, but it is obvious that he has either never read the book, or that he had a misinterpretation of what Gatsby is like.  He played him too cocky, and even when he tried to act unsure of himself, it still came off to arrogant. However, Gatsby wasn't the only character that I found myself displeased with. Jordan's appearance wasn't at all what I expected.  I had personally pictured her as a longer haired blonde woman, and looking more sporty as well.  In contrast, I believe that the people who played Nick and Tom were absolutely perfect.  I was especially please with Nick-- he did a wonderful job of capturing the essence of the character, and seemed to fit very well into a surprisingly nonchalant character.  However, there were a few parts of this movie that was very impressed with.<br />A major portion of the movie rendition of the Great Gatsby I was happy with was how true it stayed to the book. I found myself questioning if anything was changed at all, and I don't think that I found one single part, other than the fact that it had to be cut down in order to make into a movie.  I know that this is a very hard task to accomplish, especially since so much happens in the book, and I was extremely pleased.<br />In general, the combination of a good script and so-so acting made me have an overall neutral feeling for this movie.  It was entertaining, but I obviousley enjoyed the book much more.<br />Thank you, Mr. Mr, for making me read this book.	2003-05-01

A man who has been given the name, Jay Gatsby, lives in East Egg, New York. He is obsessed with money, and so are all his neighbors.  Five years before the story takes place in the 1920s, Gatsby met a lady by the name of Daisy. They fell in love, but Gatsby had to got to war. Daisy couldn't wait for him, so she married Tom, a wealthy man, yet has been cheating on her with Myrtle. She is a lower class, rather fanatical women who is married to Wilson. This whole story about how money corrupts people and their loves, is told by the perspective of Nick, who becomes Gatsby's closest friend.<br /> The movie was very closely related to the book, even using some of the same dialogue in parts. Yet the book seems to have more foreshadowing than the movie. Events such as when the car crashes in front of Gatsby's house after a party of his is not included. The casting has its ups and downs as well. Characters such as Daisy and Gatsby shined in their performance. Daisy had a flowing, yet somewhat ditzy attribute about her that made her perfect for the role. Toby Stephens has a tricky role to play being Gatsby, yet he pulled off the ambitious, prosperous character. One character that was not cast correctly was Tom. In the book he is described as a huge, muscular man who is forceful and rough. Martin Donovan was not much larger than Gatsby, and did not have the stature of a football player.<br /> The director, Robert Markowitz, must have done his research on the 1920s, because even the music had its place. The jazz background music brought to life the scenes, which were all very colorful. Gatsby's house had rich colors, such as gold and red, to portray all the money he had. The dressed that the women wore were just right. Myrtle did not wear the type of dress that Daisy would have. This was right on because Myrtle was part of the lower working class, and Daisy was an upscale woman.<br />All together, I was very impressed with the movie. It was closely related to the book, which would make it easy for one to understand, even if they hadn't read the book...yet. The movie kept my attention throughout the entire time I was watching it, it never became boring or repetitive.

About five years ago Gatsby loved and wanted to marry Daisy, but couldn't because he was too poor.  Finally he has earned enough money, but Daisy is already married. The Great Gatsby is the story of upper-class society in the 1920s and the interactions between a group of people.<br /> Nick, played by Paul Rudd, was what I expected Nick to be like when I read the book.  He was short which I think was supposed to show his unassertiveness and also he just looked controlled and exactly like the character I had read about before.  Gatsby was played by Toby Stephens, who did a good job.  The only thing I didn't like about his performance was that he reminded me of a really sleazy guy.  When his smile turned to the side, he looked like he was trying to sell you a car or something.  Overall I thought the cast was well chosen except for Gatsby because he seemed like a jerk.<br /> The movie seemed very accurate to book (themes, characters, symbolism, plot).  It was really neat that when the two cars reached the setting of Myrtle's house that it was all dark and gray and colorless.  This was a change from the bright colors the rich and symbolized the difference between the two classes.  Another similarity involved the mood of the scenes.  Most of them seemed to fit very well, like when Daisy cried over the shirts and was like a little kid touching all of Gatsby's possessions.  This scene is supposed to give a feeling of materialism, and it's done very well.  A major difference between the book and this movie is that at the begging of the movie it shows Gatsby being shot in his pool.  I think the purpose of this was to get the movie of to a faster start before the introduction of the characters.<br /> One major problem with the movie was that it switched narrators about half way through.  Instead of being from the perspective of Nick, it switched to Gatsby and Daisy's perspective during their affair.  This is a little confusing because in the book Nick is informed about their relationship from other people, and that information is changed depending on who's telling it.  By changing this part in the movie, it takes away a certain character development that is given through the way they talk to others.<br /> An aspect of the movie that really impressed me was the camera movement towards the end.  Although seemingly insignificant, this detail can create different feelings depending on the quickness of the movement or how much waiting time is allowed.  After Gatsby is shot the camera goes from his body to his killer, Wilson, to the police officer, to Nick, and finally to the sky.  This sweeping movement gives the viewer a new piece of information every time it moves.  Also, the scene was relatively calm and relaxed, as the event was an inevitable conclusion.  I really liked the music of this movie.  It seemed to enhance each scene by making some of them more dramatic or warning the viewer when something bad is about to happen.  That's a quality that a movie can have that a book can't, it can use sound and visuals to bring the plot to a different level.<br /> Overall the Great Gatsby was a well-adapted movie of a book and used the extra senses to create feelings that weren't apparent before.  The director's knowledge of the themes, moods and characters was obvious through the careful presentation and flowing scenes.  One area in which this movie could have been better was some of the details like nick's perspective seemed a little different or untrue to the book.tive of Nick, it switched to Gatsby and Daisy's perspective during their affair.

I was surprised that the lines were said word for word. It made the book become real, and I was finally able to see certain places that I couldn't picture in my head while reading the book. I believe that while the settings and events were accurate some of the actors that played their character could have been chosen better to fit the part.<br /> The performance of Nick played by Paul Rudd did an excellent job with his character. In the book I was always picturing Nick to be this man that was relatively quiet, boring, and the most normal of all the Great Gatsby characters. In the movie that's exactly what he played. He did a good job looking very glum throughout the book, and I believed his character very much.<br />As for Gatsby, who was played by Toby Stephens, I feel they could have found someone that would have played the part better. I pictured a character that looked older, and wasn't so perfect looking, (hair, teeth, etc.). I just feel that he didn't play up to his role, and when he spoke I didn't feel as though the movie was as real anymore, because I don't think he fit the character. I also think it could be due to the fact that finding an actor for the role of Gatsby would be difficult because Gatsby is such a hard character to play.<br />The movies accuracy to the book was extremely concise, and fitting. I totally believed it, and the director, (Robert Markowitz) did an excellent job keeping things parallel with the book, instead of putting a Hollywood spin on things. The characters were mostly played well and were accurate with the exception of Tom, whom I thought would be a much heavier and stouter character, and Myrtle, whom, I thought would have more beauty to her than she did. Even though she played such a small role, I though that Tom and Daisy's little girl would have been a blonde haired cute little thing, and turned out to have brownish/blackish WILD curly hair. Of course Gatsby, who I felt didn't fit his character well at all.<br />The production of the film was very well done. The settings and places in the book were extremely concise in matching up with the book. The tone and the feel of the movie were well done also. The book, to me, felt dark and depressing, and surprisingly enough the movie gave off that vibe too.<br />Mr. M made us watch this movie.who I felt didn't fit his character well at all.<BR>The production of the film was very well done.

The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, who met the main character, Jay Gatsby at one of Gatsby's parties.  Gatsby, whose real name is James Gatz, has moved from North Dakota to New York City to prosper as a wealthy stock broker.  That is a very different change, even if it's in the 1920's.<br />  Gatsby has one intention throughout the story that is to get Daisy back.  She is a past fling that took place in Louisville, Kentucky.  Daisy is married to Tom, who is very wealthy.  Tom, unlike Gatsby, has had wealth in his family that dates back several generations.  Tom says, \\".....\\"  Tom is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson.<br />  Nick meets Jordan Baker, whose name represents Lexus or Mercedes in current times because both Jordan and Baker were popular automobiles during the time.  Nick invites Gatsby and Daisy over to his home so they can meet up with each other again.  This makes Tom jealous because Gatsby and Daisy fall in love again.<br />  Tom invites the whole crew out to eat and accuses Gatsby of causing trouble with him and Daisy.  They tell everyone that they are in love and leave.  George Wilson, Myrtle's husband, also gets into a fight and she leaves, only to be hit by the car that Daisy is driving.  Tom tells George that Gatsby is responsible for the Myrtle's death and George goes to Gatsby's home and kills Gatsby, but then turns and shoots himself.  Nobody shows up to Gatsby's funeral in the end, which I perceive as you can change the outside of a person, but not the inside.	2003-04-25

If I was a high school student forced to read this and have to answer test questions on it, I would not think so highly of this book. However, now thirty and coming to this on my own I found a book that has righfully earned it's place among our few American classics. At first, Fitzgerald's poetic and economic prose takes some time getting used to. I found myself rereading certain passages. It did win me over though, after the first page where the narrator defines personality as &quot;an unbroken series of successfull gestures.&quot; He has other witty observations throughout and I was surprised to see how funny the book could be at times.<br />Symbolism aside the story is a decent, readable one. The premise is a young man starting out in 1920's New York after the end of Worls War I whose next door nieghbor is the self-assured but mysterious Jay Gatsby. This may seem boring to some, but I hesitate to say more at the risk of giving anything away. Trust me, there more to it. At first it meanders, seeming to string a series of almost random but interesting vignettes depicting the jazz age. For those who may want to give up on the book at that point, I say don't. Fitzgerald has been setting the reader up. The other shoe drops halfway through the novel. Also a note on the characters. Even though you may not agree what the characters are doing, at least it invokes a reaction. Which is more than I can say of the &quot;classics&quot; that I was forced to read in high school.<br />The themes in Gatsby are very poignant. Showing us how fragile dreams and perceptions, both self and outside, can be. And that sincere intentions do not always come from honest sources. Is this the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;? I don't know, I have a few more books to go before I make that assumption. What I can tell you is that I  has a pleasant time reading this one and see why many people think so.	2003-04-23

The Great Gatsby is an interesting novel which brings the \\"Roaring Twenties\\" to life.  The author of this book certainly knows how to maintain the reader's interest. The main scheme consists of a cast of colorful characters seemingly stuck in what modern day society would call \\"a mild soap opera type of lifestyle.\\" At least each and every one of these characters that the writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald has come up with; either has already or attempts to commit at least one or more of the seven deadly sins. These sins include pride, envy, greed, anger, lust as the main occurrences, with, sloth and gluttony ranking more at the lower end of the events that take place throughout the book.<br /> The narrator, Nick Carraway, irreverently states his thoughts and opinions about nearly each and every one of the vibrant characters more than once as the story goes on. Should we as reader's value Nick's opinion is something that you will have to find out for yourself. Nick says, \\"Gatsby turns out alright in the end.\\" I beg to differ with that statement but again, once the reader gets into the story he or she will realize  this is a suspenseful plot which leads up to the main idea of who Jay Gatsby really was and what his intentions were as he shared the same social circle as Nick's cousin, Daisy. The \\"cast\\" includes the infamous Jay Gatsby, who the book revolves around and his former lover, Daisy Buchannan, who decided to marry Tom, who was richer and readily available while Gatsby was away at war. Also worthy of mention is Tom's mistress, Myrtle Wilson who will eventually share the same fate as Jay Gatsby as the story evolves closer to the end of the tremendous fiction.<br />  The bottom line being that The Great Gatsby is a great catch and a worthwhile read for any of us. We as readers should and could benefit from the literature and historical aspects in which F. Scott Fitzgerald has so terrifically written.	2003-04-21

If we define the greatest American novel as that which most completely captures the American ideology of a certain place and time in our history, then &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; might very well be the greatest American novel in existence.  However, is &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; the most enjoyable book I've ever read, or even the best written?  No.  This falls pretty low on my list of favorites, but I can't deny Fitzgerald's wonderful talent in putting it together.  In a way, this novel is the literary equivalent of &quot;Casablanca&quot; for me---I can acknowledge how well made it is, but distanced from the unique set of social circumstances in which it was first experienced, I can't quite understand the effect it seems to have on so many people.	2003-04-17

Great American novelists such as Francis Fitzgerald himself are known world wide for their intelligent works.  I decided to read his book, The Great Gatsby to find that it was a mistake.  I usually enjoy reading challenging books, however, this book was far from challenging. I moaned and whined when it was time to read it, yet I kept reading to see if it got better.  Reading The Great Gatsby was a great waste of my time.<br /> This novel has a handful of very complex characters.  Many who disguise themselves until the very end.  Tom and Daisy Buchanan are mainly a spoiled rich couple who need nothing but money to live.  They ruin lives and do not think of the consequences of their actions because of their social status of where they live. Nick who is the narrator and that is hard to see until 40 or so pages into the book is good at contradicting himself.  He makes several remarks that he is the most honest man he has ever known yet, he lies about a web of rumors about an engagement to everyone except Jordan Baker.  The \\"great\\" Gatsby turns out to be a great let down.  The readers find out that Gatsby and Daisy had a relationship going until the war calls Gatsby out.  Daisy then finds \\"untrue\\" love with Tom, this makes Gatsby's life miserable even though he is rich and powerful.  His power leads to the unbelievable ending of this book. The book has a basic plot which the world lives on and society thrives on everyday.  It puts the status versus happiness clich&eacute; into a realistic perspective.  The affair between Tom and Myrtle also is realistic in the main events between those two characters also.  Even though Myrtle plays a minor role in this book she is the main reason for the ending.<br /> I did not enjoy this book very much, however, people who like to compare social status and power should enjoy this book a great deal.  I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks money, power and fame is everything.	2003-04-17

F. Scott Fitzgerald has given us a timeless treasure to read and enjoy time and time again.  The illusion of grandeur &amp; the disillusion of marriage coupled with the search for love, happiness, The American Dream, as well as the imperceptibly foreboding desire to rekindle the past all make The Great Gatsby an incredibly entertaining, yet highly enigmatic, masterpiece of a novel.<br />No one can deny the greatness of F. Scott Fitzgerald.  No author since has had the unique gift of such masterful and captivating use of the English language  - combined with unparalleled social insight into his age and time.  The excessively lavish and glitzy, yet highly impersonal, fetes of Gatsby, make one feel as if one is in attendance partaking in the debauchery - thanks to the effortless and fluid prose of Fitzgerald.  The classic American tragic figure, Gatsby symbolizes all that we want to be, and not be, at the same time.  Exemplary masterpiece.<br />&quot;And I like large parties.  They're so intimate.

I breezed throught the book, often skimming, and was done, and dissapointed.<br />Fast forward to the present day.  I had been thinking about how The Great Gatsby is considered a classic, and how i didnt enjoy it at all. I decicded to read it again, carefully trying to asorb some meaning.<br />And I found it.<br />This book is really profound, a great work.  The characters all fit together so well, and the story just takes you back to another time.<br />If you are 14-18 years old, and just read this book to read it you wil not enjoy it.  I think I just wans't mature enough to appreciate this work before.  Don't judge this book by the first time you read it.  Take the time to read it again and think about it; you will love it.<br />A good analogy is how a diamond in the rough just looks like glass on the beach, sanded and hidden in a fog.

While it does depict a historically accurate and believable account of the 1920s, not one of the characters seems to be anything more that a superficial comsumer or partygoer.  Through the entire novel, Nick Carraway, our straighfoward, if not boring, narrator is a shadow of a real man, showing no courage or brain for himself.  In the end, just when he could stand up and change the entire point of view for the characters, he chooses to stay comfortable in his little corner of his unimpressionable life.

This may be due in part to the fact that the 20's is my favorite time period, but I think its mainly because I love the way Fitzgerald writes. His work is full of gems and wonderfully sad quotes. He successfully reflects the essence of the 'Lost Generation' more than any other author I have read, that 'party-hard' attitude punctuated by melancholy.<br />His characters are rich and successful, but unable to escape the weight of their pasts. They subsist on the American Dream gone wrong, finding happiness only in their fantasy versions of others. The main character, Jay Gatsby, lives for the hope of a relationship with his lost love, Daisy Buchanan, but he finds out that the real person can never live up to the ideal he has set for her.<br />In essence, this novel conveys the melancholy and loss of missed opportunities. Gatsby is unable to accept that he cannot live his life with Daisy the way he once envisioned, so he retreats to a fantasy in which he convinces himself that if he just tries hard enough, he can win Daisy back and make everything right again. But he can't. He is living in a dream world, and when it is shattered, he is unable to really come back to reality again. Basically, the whole book can be summed up by Fitzgerald touching last line, \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\"	2003-02-27

It took a much more careful read to realize what a masterpiece this book is.  Fitgerald uses the quick and flowing style of writing born in the Jazz Age, making this an easy read as well as a very satisfying one.  I'm tempted to say that the basic storyline of Gatsby, a self-made millionaire, who pursues his fickle sweetheart to a tragic end, is outweighed by the synesthetic descriptions and intimate character studies.  Fitzgerald has a skill for highlighting the dark, tragic moments in the book by contrasting them with beautiful and carefree lifestyle of its characters.  This can make the book seem too light and at times arrogant; however, look deeper at the dialogue and actions of the character to find the disquieting sense of melancholy that make this book so sadly lovely.	2003-02-23

Great Gatsby is a book that I would highly recommend to others.  It maintains a readers interest, and also tends to be a thought-provoking book.  The characters throughout the novel seemed to be almost as real people.  With the plot fulfilling everything you could ask it to be, and with an unexpected twist.  The author F. Scott Fitzgerald developed the novel thoroughly throughout the entire novel.  The way in which he utilizes every aspect of the book to keep the attention of the audience is remarkable.<br /> As you can tell I admire the author's writing gift, with each and every character having characteristics that are possible to relate to people in real life situations.  The main character was Nick Carraway, and he seems to be a very studious, and intelligent person.  Along with this main character, the author added in many other characters to help makeup his cast.  The main focus of the book was Nick's wealthy neighbor, Jay Gatsby.  He is a mystery to many of the people around his area, and everyone wants to know, or find out about him.  The other characters that the author develops are all of an authentic and credible nature.  The writer explains each character with just the perfect amount of information, and in a way in which the reader can feel as if he understands how each character thinks.<br /> Along with the creative nature that he introduces, and maintains his characters throughout the story the author makes the plot thicken with wonderful ploys.  The author made very unique descriptions of everything, no matter how large or small throughout the scheme of the novel.  He manages to seduce your thoughts by keeping the story running through your mind, even after you sit the book down for a minute.  This way of writing was very elaborate and tended to make an obvious impression on the reader.<br />  The author manages to keep the readers interests in the plot and develop the story very elaborately.  Throughout the development of the book, there are new things being entered into your mind, which tend to keep you thinking.  This makes the reader stay on his heals, and wonder what may occur next.  Even until the end of the book you wonder what will occur next.<br />  I would definitely recommend this book to others.

Throwing elaborate parties with a guest list that includes anyone who wants to show up, Gatsby builds a mansion just across the way from Daisy, the object of his obsession.<br />Circumstance thwarts all of his goals, the futility of his quest never completely realized. Gatsby is as tragic a character as the inevitability of his failure. Gatsby, \\"pa[ys] a high price for living too long with a single dream.\\"<br />The story is told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a somewhat solemn and restrained fellow who never really expresses what he wants to say. His virtue, however, is his silence and profound honesty. He says so himself: \\"Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.\\"<br />The Great Gatsby is a stunning tale of remarkable poise and literary quality. Fitzgerald is the epitome of the highschool English teachers dream--he appreciates the English language, and takes the standard approach to literature very seriously. The book is a tour de force of depth and contrast, and an exploration of the King's English. The author has taken pains to diversify his word choice, and the texture and depth of his language.<br />Here's a passage that demonstrates Fitzgerald's quality as a writer: \\"There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward teh drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated teh surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.\\"<br />Yikes. Enough to give you goosebumps, isn't it?<br />Highly recommended, and worth the praise.orth the praise.	2003-02-06

As Hunter Thompson said about this book, read it and see &quot;how the big boys write.&quot; Fitzgerald had a tragic sense of the world that is always there behind the money and bright surfaces of his characters. His ability to convey this melancholy is nearly supernatural. What more can be said about this book? This is the writing of one of the greatest writers that ever lived. His talent was so great, not even his self-destructive nature could dim the light. His Jay Gatsby is still so classically American, and this novel is one for the space capsule.	2003-01-31

Scott Fitzgerald takes us into the life of Nick Carraway, who - at the height of 1920's glitz and excess - has just moved to the East Coast with the hopes of getting in bonds sales. Detached but forever present and trusted by the characters, Nick tells the story of Jay Gatsby, an enigmatic neighbour who throws lavish parties, and Daisy, with whom Gatsby is infatuated. As the story evolves, we are slowly given insight into an odd love triangle, the penalties of excess, and who Jay Gatsby really is.<br />The Great Gatsby is a smooth read which maintains its capacity to be called a classic throughout the ages, despite having been written 80 years ago. The themes it investigates (infidelity, greed, class struggles, etc.) are as timeless as Fitzgerald's wonderful prose, and the carefully interwoven and surprising storyline makes for an exceptionally entertaining read as well. Although I would struggle to call this a &quot;love story&quot;, as some have, I would certainly concede that it is a story about love. More than just a love story, though, it deals with the ramifications of infidelity, the consequences of infatuation, and the effect wealth and security has on it. Fitzgerald's statement can be found in simply considering where everyone is at the end, and what they have done to be there. Is that justice?<br />A welcome read for everyone. True classic.<br />Matty J	2003-01-31

It is a masterpiece, and known widely as such, but what surprised me on hearing it was how the book I'd remembered as terribly romantic was actually rather clear-eyed and dark. My wife, who had never read it, listened spell-bound, and at the end burst into tears at the sadness of it. A word about Scourby as reader - he is restrained but emotional, captures the personality of each character with a slightly different tone, and - most importantly for me - brings out the fact that the closing pages, which are often quoted out of context as deeply romantic, are in fact painfully cynical, a voice of disenchantment about the cost of America, not its promise. A masterpiece on the page and on tape. Can't recommend it too highly.	2003-01-25

This novel is useful to those teenagers who wish to seek the American dream of becoming successful and make a great deal of money. Reading The Great Gatsby gave me a look into what the High Society of the early 1920's was like. To many, this era was not really that important because World War 1 had ended years before and the world was just trying to get back on its feet. I thought this time to be dark and mysterious.<br />  F. Scott Fitzgerald's portrayal of a young businessman from the Mid- West, living in one of the many posh neighborhoods along the coast of Long Island, was brilliant.  The main character, Nick Carraway, who is also the narrator, brings a sarcastic, yet genuine truth to the secret life of the rich and powerful. After waiting for a while, Nick finally meets the man named Gatsby.  Despite all the rumors about the way he acquired his money and all the illegal actions that he might have taken part in, they become very good friends.  The storyline continues and blossoms into a few love triangles, adultery, and murder.  Reading this book will be an advantage to those students in high school who wish to do well and succeed in life.<br />  Some say that this Fitzgerald's novels should not be required reading for high school students.  However, I believe that reading them can be life altering.  The Great Gatsby allows you to take a glimpse into the lives of the rich and powerful.  Within the walls of this aristocratic society there is great despair as well as great success. Fitzgerald is trying to send the message to those young enough to realize that money and power are not everything.  Also, when power is obtained, work hard to keep it and do not let other things distract you.  This novel is exceptional and should definitely be used in the classroom.	2003-01-21

I'll tell the basic plot to the story and then elaborate on my feelings.<br />The story is told by Nick Carraway, a man living on Long Island next to the very wealthy Jay Gatsby. On first sight it appears Jay Gatsby has a wonderful live with his wealth and the extravagant parties he throws every week, but he's missing something. He's missing Daisy Buchanan's love. Daisy Buchanan is a woman he knew 5 years ago and fell in love with, but circumstances kept them apart. Coincidentally, Nick Carraway happens to be the 2nd cousin of Daisy whom lives only across a lake(which Gatsby knows). So, Gatsby befriends Carraway in an attempt to get back the love he lost. In retrospect, Carraway, as the narrator, relates the events of the period of his life in which he knew Gatsby and what happened.<br />Reading this book, I just found trouble getting really into it. The characters are described well enough and a pretty clear picture of them is painted of them(except maybe for Gatsby who is always surrounded by some mystery) and the writing was pretty good(the book isn't bogged down with very sophisticated language or anything like that), but for about the first half of the book I just found things to be kind of boring. The 2nd half gets a little more interesting when things start to pick up between Daisy and Jay. Also, there's an interesting cast of characters which seem very real and make the book more interesting.<br />Overall, I'd say that I would recommend reading this book since it is considered to be a classic and I know that others which read The Great Gatsby would probably have completely different opinions about the book and think it's great. Also, it's only about 197 pages, so it's really not too long. It's a book that I wouldn't be surprised that if I read again, like in a few years, perhaps maybe I'd have a different view of things. I do sort of get the feeling that maybe this is a book I'd appreciate a little more after another reading.I do sort of get the feeling that maybe this is a book I'd appreciate a little more after another reading.	2003-01-12

It is fairly familiar to most people and instantly recognizable when its title is said. F. Scott Fitzgerald, the author of The Great Gatsby, was very detailed in his writings and used a lot of imagery and emotion in this novel. It takes place in the early 1920's in the heart of New York. Near Long Island, Nick Carraway (the main character) rents a house here and lives for the summer of 1922. In his time of living here, he has heard about the wealthiest, most popular, and most luxurious man in all of Long Island, Jay Gatsby. This man is known for his lavish parties, extreme amount of money, and a bad past. Come to find out, these two are connected in some way from their past, and will be reunited through different meetings. Jay turns out to be Nick's next-door neighbor, and through a series of events, both bond strongly.<br />This all sounds like a good plot, and a good read for anyone, including high school students (like myself) on up. This however is not necessarily the case. Although I am in an AP English class that is more of a college level class, I found this book to be hard at times to get through. There is too much that goes on that strays away from the main plot and main point of the story. I just simply found this book to be boring. It is not a book that young adults should read. It is very drawn out, long, and detailed. It uses very sophisticated language and is written with very much detail. The only reason I found this book difficult to read was possibly because I had to keep myself from nodding off. Respectfully, yes it is a classic and should be read, but maybe for college students or adults instead of teenagers.	2003-01-09

I apologize for many of the close-minded high school students who decided to vent the fact that they hate everything they read in school on this website.<br />  I am sorry to say that I am a high school student, who had the pleasure to read this book last year.  It is truely amazing how one book can get a kid my age so engulfed in the concept of reading.  Everything about this book is wonderful to me.  The symbolism throughout the whole book just adds to the tragic story of Jay Gatsby and his inability to let go of a past life that has haunted him for years.<br />  In short, this book deconstructs the basic American dream and reveals it as a desperate attempt to cling to memories of a love that is, and always had been out of Gatsby's league.  The superficiality of his new social status is made extremely lucid by symbolism as simple of Gatsby's pool.  The pool had never been used by gatsby himself, it just sat in it's place to be used for nothing other than show, much like Gatbsy himself.  The money he acquired(through illegal ventures) had never been about himself, but only about the hope that somehow he could prove to Daisy that he had become an upscale man.  The hope that somehow the past would could be not forgotten, but re-lived ultimately led to Gatbsy's destruction, as he failed to realize his own desperate and hopeless quest for wealth soon enough to save his soul.  The way Gatsby is depicted paints two portraits of one man, a man who has everything; a fabulous mansion, money, cars and all of the other worldly possessions one can hope for, and the other; a man who has everything but what he desires most, the love he would give everything up for.  In the end, Daisy and friends are revealed as nothing more than snobbish drunks, and Gatsby remains the shattered man who always strived to do better for the ones he cared about, the ones he loved.<br />  How any person who reads this book and does not appreciate it for the wonderful story it tells is beyond me.  Kids these days seem to automatically hate any book they are forced to read in a school environment, and it is a shame. Perhaps if high schoolers could look past their own superficialities and accept a book for what it is, than many would be better off.Kids these days seem to automatically hate any book they are forced to read in a school environment, and it is a shame.

Scott Fitzgerald is considered by many to be the greatest American story, the tale of what an empty life one can lead if one adheres too strongly to the American Dream.  Jay Gatsby has risen to prominence in a method seeming to be right out of a Horatio Alger novel.  Born a Westerner of no consequence, Gatsby has acquired his millions, moved to a Long Island mansion, and thrown lavish parties nightly.  Only later we learn that he has done all this for the single goal of marrying Daisy Buchanan, a woman he romanced for a month in his youth.<br /><br />However, Gatsby's single-mindedness is his downfall.  Every action, every acquaintance, every acquisition over a five-year span has only helped him to romanticize his quest.  Gatsby fails to question whether he wants to belong to Daisy's world, and he cannot comprehend that Daisy's daily concerns about her wealth may temper her love for him.<br /><br />Through the eyes of Nick Carraway, another misplaced Westerner, but one with his feet firmly planted in the less-manicured lawns of reality, Fitzgerald weaves a tapestry of the excesses of New York in the Jazz Age.  It is a world of people bonded together by \\"their money or their vast carelessness\\" who \\"let other people clean up the mess they had made.\\"  Gatsby could not find fulfillment in his elaborate hoax because he is too honest to enjoy the illusion he created.	2002-12-29

Scott Fitzgerald was plainly alarmed by the cultural and financial excesses that marked America's new and what was for him, a perverted interest in the historically rooted American dream.  In this dream, begun by Ben Franklin in his autobiography, he lists, as does Jay Gatsby in THE GREAT GATSBY, a shopping list of virtues whose goal it is to inculcate those values that both Franklin and Gatsby thought would lead to material success. The difference between Ben Franklin and Jay Gatsby has more to say about the use of those virtues than their origin.  With Gatsby, the American Dream is not simply pulling himself up by his bootstraps from poverty to riches, but in his warped vision of that dream, Gatsby symbolizes what can go wrong when any upwardly mobile American allows another to recast that dream according to the competing dreams of another.<br />  Gatsby believes that he loves the incredibly alluring Daisy Fay, a teenage society deb--beautiful, sexy, elegant--whom he sees as the ultimate goal for his life.  They meet, they fall in love (or do they? This is arguable) and they break up because Gatsby is too poor for her to marry.  Up to the point that they meet, Gatsby is pursuing the Franklinian version of the American ideal, which can be summed up as hard work + true grit = material success.  Gatsby wants success, but he wants it for himself.  After meeting and being rejected by Daisy, Gatsby now sees his dream as the means to achieve a higher dream: securing the affections of a woman whose limitations in taste and fidelity were obvious to all but him.  During the years of their separation, Gatsby worked hard to build his criminal empire that brought him the money and possessions that he truly saw as the missing variable in the romantic equation that would convince Daisy to be by his side.  Gatsby is wrong is so many ways that the reader is not sure whether to laugh at him for his emotional myopia or to pity him for the same reason.<br />  Those critics who analyze Gatsby's role in the perversion of the American dream tend to focus on the Gatsby side of the equation, yet to understand the inner tragedy of this dream's deconstruction, one must also examine Daisy's role.  Exactly who is this Daisy Fay?  To begin with, consider her last name, which is an aberrant spelling of 'fey,' which means a doomed vision. Those who connect with her, both Gatsby and her brute husband Tom, are doomed to a life of trying to relate to a woman who cannot return basic human kindness.  Daisy is shallow, frivolous, and easily impressed by the very qualities that Tom showers her with (a $350,000 ring) and Gatsby shows her (those silk shirts that cause her to weep).  It is almost as if Daisy is auctioning herself off to the highest bidder.  Daisy's dream is the flipside of Franklin's.  She wants the rewards of hard work without incurring the demands of the work itself.  In the collision between these contrasting dreams, it comes as no surprise that buried somewhere in Daisy's soul is just enough of a link to harsh reality to remind her that Tom, despite his affairs and animalistic nature, is still preferable to a Gatsby, who offers only the illusion, not the reality of love.  When Nick tells Gatsby that the past cannot be reborn and reshaped into a present more to his liking, Gatsby stuns both Nick and the reader by saying, \\"Of course it can.\\"  Gatsby's entire life and by extension his dream of success that is to include the questionable charms of Daisy, is seen as so flawed that whenever his dream meets a competing dream that has at least some root in reality, his dream of a green light that can blink into any color he wants will crash into a tragedy that resounds even today.otional myopia or to pity him for the same reason.  <br />     Those critics who analyze Gatsby's role in the perversion of the American dream tend to focus on the Gatsby side of the equation, yet to understand the inner tragedy of this dream's deconstruction, one must also examine Daisy's role.

The Great Gatsby is a prime counterexample of this.<br />In my opinion, a book that is entertaining and exciting needs to stretch the mind. It needs to use great imagination. Imagination makes mystery and murder novels scary and thrilling. Imagination makes a sci-fi interesting. What is there to imagine about The Great Gatsby? There are murders, but not very unique ones. If I wanted to read a good murder mystery, I would go to Thomas Harris. As for the love story The Great Gastby is placed around, I see this as the only conflict in the book. Every event in the entire book was based on this unrealistic relationship between Daisy, Tom, and Jay.<br />To conclude, I would expect this story in a 1920's newspaper rather than being a mass produced as a \\"classic\\" novel. The only use I have for this book is a sleeping-pill substitute.	2002-12-01

This book was a very good example of the roaring 1920's.  After studying the prohibition that happened in that decade and the depression in the following decade it really shows how the stock market really can change the world.  The Great Gatsby is a good example to what happened during the prohibition.  It was never said in plain English what was going on but if the reader knows the events of the 1920's it was very apparent.<br /> While reading The Great Gatsby, I was amazed by all the money that was spent.  One example was when Jay was having large parties and driving very expensive cars.  It also occurred to me that Jay Gatsby has a very dark side that nobody knew about.  The people that did know about his income weren't willing to talk.  This was one reason that the 1920's are called the \\"High Times\\" nobody cared how much money they spent or how they made money.<br /> I enjoyed reading this book.  It was very easy to follow and had a lot of descriptive clues about the time period.  It seemed like the whole book was an adventure because Fitzgerald never paused on one subject for a long amount of time.  I liked how Fitzgerald wrote it on the events that really did happen in the 1920's. This gave the reader a glimpse into what a person at that time could have been doing or was doing to have fun or make a living for his family.<br /> I would highly recommend this book for anyone that is studying or going to study the 1920's.  It is a very good example to what could have happen to someone during that time period.  You won't regret reading this book once you start it.	2002-11-25

But it was soon eclipsed in my mind by Joyce's works. And Hemingway's. Against the works of these latter authors, Fitzgerald's GATSBY seemed to me to be rather ordinary, old fashioned if you will . . . albeit a nicely honed piece of prose.<br />There is, indeed, a certain artifice to the Gatsby story which smacks of the writer's intentions, an intrusive \\"plottiness\\" reflecting coincidences which are not at all the way things really work in life. And yet for all that, the story is strongly told, moving and lyrical, and the characterizations, as I found on re-reading the novel at my wife's urging, far more subtle than I recalled from my high school days. GATSBY is the story of a mystery man who dreams of a wealthy debutante he met years before, when he was an impoverished young soldier, and whose entire life since has been dedicated to winning her. To do this he has earned millions of dollars in the heyday of racketeering and prohibition (how is never quite made clear) and, at the time the novel is set, is engaged in creating an upper class persona for himself, in order to be worthy of the woman he loves.<br />Of course, as Fitzgerald, through his narrator, the Midwestern transplant and aspiring bond salesman, Nick Carraway, shows, it is not Gatsby who needs to be made worthy at all. There is a certain melodrama to the tale which kind of blunted the edge for me but, on balance, the overwrought tragic overtones in the careless hit and run accident that brings all to a head are more than balanced out by the insight vouchsafed to us by Nick when he tells Gatsby, near the end, that the whole lot of them are not worth Gatsby alone. Gatsby wanders off distractedly to meet his undeserved destiny, thereafter, and Nick remains to pick up the pieces, packing up and returning home to the Midwest in disgust, and something akin to despair, at the human condition when, at last, the full import of what has occurred comes home to him.<br />Fitzgerald had set out to craft a gem with this novel and he succeeded. Though it has flaws, the powerful insight and the polished, lyrical prose more than make up for them, setting this book firmly in the constellation of great American novels.<br />SWMrt of what has occurred comes home to him.<br />Fitzgerald had set out to craft a gem with this novel and he succeeded.

I had to read this book as an assignment, and I found the language cumbersome, and difficult to read.  The last chapter says it all, the rest is filler.

Overall, it was an easy read, and for the most part, a light-hearted, entertaining story.  It had an interesting plot with remarkable characters to support it.  Even though it was written almost a century ago, it is still easy to appreciate Fitzgerald's ideas and style of writing.<br />  The book was very well written for many reasons.  I liked the fact that it was a first person narrative.  I personally enjoy first person novel because I think that the insight of the narrator makes the reader relate to the story more, as opposed to the neutral position of a third person story.  The narrative offered details vivid enough to easily imagine the setting.  I was not familiar with the setting in New York, but the descriptiveness was clear enough for me to picture the scenes.  Also, the writing style was excellent at using setting as a device to convey emotion, and in a few instances, foreshadowing.  The plot is fast moving and I really enjoyed the unexpected plot twist towards the end.  The small side plots that arose between the supporting characters sustained my interest also.  The story was very much to the point, and did not at any time drag on.<br />  The strongest part of the writing was the development, connections, and introduction of the characters.  Nick Cattaway fits the role of the narrator perfectly and provides a central connection among all the other characters.  It allowed me to feel more sympathetic towards the characters because of Nick's sympathy for his friends.  The order in which he introduces the characters and then slowly revealed how their lives were intertwined made for a very interesting story.  My favorite of the introductions was the surprisingly low key intro to Gatsby.  However, this character was the only one that I wasn't satisfied with, and proved to be the only flaw I found with the book.<br />  The lack of development of the character of Gatsby was very disappointing for me.  After such a unique entrance, in addition to the title, I expected much more than the book offered.  Although more is revealed about Gatsby as the story progresses, I still didn't feel a connection to the character.  Since Gatsby was intended to be a mysterious character, that may be the reason the lack of information about him.  However, there seemed to be a true depth missing that was hinted at, but was never fully communicated.  This was especially true in the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy.  The intensity of Gatsby's feelings seemed to be glanced over.<br />  Besides that minor negative point, the book was very good, and as a said before I recommend it to anyone looking for a short but enjoyable book to read.appointing for me.

So, I decided to give myself a treat and reread. Here is some of my marginalia: \\"Not a great paragraph. Nice image and flow. Could Gatsby be so successful while being such a clumsy liar? Anti-Semitic image. Great scene. Great chapter. Thought is confused. Another terrific chapter.\\"  So, what am I saying? Fitzgerald writes with flawless lyricism when the subject is money and society. But when his subject doesn't evoke this lyrical mood, his writing can become choppy while his attitude toward certain types of people becomes superficial and harsh. Regardless, it's amazing the book is nearly eighty years old, since it still conveys what many people probably regard as a contemporary experience. My advice: Read Gatsby again!	2002-09-24

I can't add any new words of wisdom that haven't been written already by one of the other 600+ reviewers of this book.  This deserves 6 stars, and is the quintessential american novel, putting the American Dream under the microscope and finding the ugly truths that lies beneath the glammor.  The jazz age of the 20's is the perfect setting for a novel like this, about the American Dream, and the people who would do anything to acheive it.  This is the era of bootleggers (how Gatsby got his money) and the sort of reckless spending and investment that sent the country into the Great Depression.  If you are in high school, you should definitely read this book, and most high schools make you read it.  I read it back in high school and didn't think too much of it, but after reading it again on my own, without useless worksheets or stupid deadlines, I got a lot more out of it, and that's what I suggest, read it on your own.  If you are over high school age and haven't read this, shame on you.  Pick this book up now, and read it front to back.  No cheating!

Naipaul was recently quoted in the NY Times Book Review: &quot;The only valuable life is one that is shaped by the anguish of aspiration and that is engaged in a struggle against the void of nonachievement.&quot; Gatsby's life personifies the aspiration of a young man who has just returned from World War I so poor that he wore his uniform after his discharge because he couldn't afford to buy new clothes. Through his own entrepreneurial talents he rises to attain an immense fortune, which he hopes will renew the affection of his much beloved object of desire, Daisy Buchanan. She once jilted him because of his abject poverty and married another wealthy man. Now that Gatsby is rich, he wants Daisy to become his wife at any price. He asks her to forsake her relationship to her wealthy, philandering husband. The denouement of the novel is opulent in its irony. Gatsby's demise and the response of his many friends to it is truly memorable. Fitzgerald as Nick Carraway is an intelligent, articulate, noble and faithful narrator in this great American novel. At a time when so much focus has been placed on the hubris of American CEOs, the message of this novel about the unbridled pursuit of material wealth plays with as much high fidelity now as it did in the Jazz Age. This brief but important and beautifully crafted novel is a must-read for anyone who seeks to know the best work of one of America's most legendary writers.	2002-09-20

This book is obviously more than just a boy meets girl who is married to another boy book, but it is not much more. Sure, it raises interesting issues of consumerism and 1920's post war culture, but it never sets its heart on it. It touches it half heartedly, but it doesn't attack it like it should. Or as english teachers would say, it doesn't \\"commit murder\\". Fitzgerlad is too busy telling the story which happenes to be dull and unexciting at the most.<br />The plot, the storyline, the story, and the execution of it is just poor. It's boring. It's futile. It's dumb. I fail to understand why Fitzgerald chose to use Nick, this incredibly dull and uninteresting character, as his narrator when he could have written it third person, or used a more interesting character for the narrator. Even the conversation and dialogue is quite useless. Take this for a sampler, \\"I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year...or wait a minute- it's ust the opposite- the sun's getting colder every year.\\" And this quote comes from nowhere and has to do with nothing.<br />Gatsby was obviously drunk, or smoking marijuana when he was writing this book, and must have thougth that this book was pretty clever. It isn't. All I can say is that, I don't consider it a classic. It's just so haphazard and bad that people mistake it for being good.	2002-09-19

Brutal, low moral, arrogant and you name it.. but extraordinary rich..<br />So that's the scene setting for this novel. This book has everything, the (impossible) love story, money and wealth, greed, affairs, jealousy and obsessions. Fitzgerald's writing style is vivid and eloquent. Simply an elegant use of the language! His language reminds me of Hemingway, one of my other favourites. The different characters are extraordinary well developed. I especially liked the cynical narrator of the story, Nick Carraway.<br />Fitzgerald has written one of the best books I have ever read. This is a short book, and I read it in 50-page gulps at the time. A great book, ready to be re-read any day!!<br />PS. Make sure to get this edition, as it has a great preface written by Matthew Bruccoli. The preface contains valuable information about the author and background information on the story itself.

Fitzgerald's prose is heartachingly lyrical, the story tawdry and the times legendary.  I have read it thrice now and it only gets better.<br />For those who want a basic plot sketch, here is my take:<br />Wealthy man (a bootlegger?) Jay Gatsby moves into a mansion across the bay from his former lover and throws a continual party in hopes of winning her from her husband.  The carnal excesses of the Jazz Age ensure that this won't end happily for anyone, including the seemingly detached narrator, Nick Carraway.<br />Kids, skip the Cliff's Notes and just read this one.  It's short and beautiful.	2002-08-16

The answer is more than just Fitzgerald's wonderful prose or his use of imagery to convey messages.  The answer lies in the way the characters in this novel teach us to look more closely at ourselves and our lives and notice things we might otherwise have missed.<br />The novel's narrator, Nick, opens by telling us that he \\"tends to reserve all judgements\\" of people until he has gotten to know them.  From this introduction, we come to see the flaw in Nick's reasoning.  For he does judge people, though he chooses to remain silent about it, and we see his judgements as he introduces us to the people in his life.  It seems that everyone around Nick is obsessed with money, particularly his second cousin Daisy and her husband Tom.  Nick introduces Tom and Daisy by telling us that they \\"drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together.\\"  This excellent sentence tells us pretty much everything we need to know about Tom and Daisy, and the events that follow do little to change this perception.  And then there's Gatsby.  Wealthy, popular, mysterious Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties at his mansion and seems to be totally in control of his life.  And yet he longs for something more: to be with Daisy, the woman he loves.  But is he really in love with Daisy, or is he only in love with the person he thinks she is?  This question plagues us as we read, watching Gatsby's facade crumble as he pursues Daisy throughout the novel.  We know that something terrible is going to happen, we just don't know what it is.  Yet we know that the relationship is doomed; Daisy doesn't love Gatsby, she is in love with his image.  And through Nick's eyes, her true character is revealed.  We see that although Daisy is beautiful, she is also cold, caring only for herself and her own happiness.  Her true love is money, and she's married to a man who can provide her with what she truly loves.  She cares little for the consequences of her actions.  Nick's final assesment reads, \\"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy-they smashed up things and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...\\"<br />The lesson is powerful and important: things aren't always what they seem.  The bible says that the love of money is the root of all evil, and we see this played out in the lives of these characters.  In the end, Nick realizes that some things are more important, and so he has resolved to go on with his life and learn from Gatsby's mistakes.  We, the readers, are touched and changed.  That is why this book is truly a classic.f her actions.

And if this isn't _THE_ Great American Novel, then it comes close to being so. It's a simple story of a love triange. But it is so much more than that. Fitzgerald captures the period of The Jazz Age, and is considered to a certain degree, a social historian, by himself if no one else. What strikes me most about this book is the voice Fitzgerald uses to tell the story. There are a handful of narrators in American fiction whose voice stands out as so good, that it lifts the story above being merely good. Examples are Huck Finn, Holden Caufield, and Nick Carroway.	2002-07-27

US	37670168	R31ZQD1FHYJHIS	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	4	0	2	N	N	Gatsby is Great	The protagonist takes you through the highs and lows of 20th Century high society. The protagonist, introduced to polite society by an acquaintance (Gatsby), shows you the landmarks and windfalls along the road to dinner parties, and points out the many trappings of culture and conscience that befit a beautiful young fool surfing the upper crust of industrial-age America.<br />Much of this book draws from the writer's own life, as he watched his own wife suffer from many of the same symptoms of society as his book's characters; obsession with the trappings and trimmings of the social elite; greed and spite; treachery and manipulation;alcoholism and insanity. This genuine point of view is distilled by careful selection in a tour de force o the ballroom lifestyle.<br />The author's style relies heavily upon narrative, and his descriptions are potent. He mingles Western cultural artifacts (billboards, warehouse districts) and signs of life in America's dustbowl (parked cars) to spot the low and high income parts of metropolitan culture like the warm and cold spots in the river. All in all, this is a book which draws its power from subjective interpretation of the narrative; very little is decided for the reader, who feels much like a back-seat passenger in Gatsby's car, listening in and seeing the sights.	2002-07-09

The descriptions were lovely and rich, and Fitzgerald really captured life and put it in this book. It is about a midwesterner named Nick who goes to New York and meets several characters including the rich nextdoor neighbor Jay Gatsby. It then shows the progression of all of these people's relationships until the climax of the book.<br /> My only gripe would be that the characters are quite unlikeable. You can't relate to them. You can't sympathize with them. It's not that they're thinly drawn. They're not flat and two dimensional. One simply has to dislike all of these characters, though! The book would be perfect if I could at least have one character to hang on to, so to speak. Maybe see myself in. Despite that I still have to say it was an exceptional book.	2002-06-27

In fact I really coasted through the book without really following it too closely.  I decided to reread it and I was much surprised by how much I liked this novel.<br />Fitzgerald has created a great portrait of a tainted American Dream.  Through his character Jay Gatsby we see how the ideals of society have been corrupted. Gatsby made his fortune by dubious means, and pursues irrationally Daisy Buchannan, a very vapid individual who comes to tears over shirts.  This is also symbolic of his the futile pursuit of happiness.<br />Though this novel was written in the 20's, the message is still timeless.  Anyone who thinks this is dated has not looked at the society we live in.  We are practically in another me generation.  People today don't have a care in the world.  Having recently finished high school and being currently in college I have witnessed the sort of carefree vapid sense that most young people have.  They don't have a collective thought in their heads other than drinking and partying.  They also don't seem to care who they hurt in the process, sort of like Daisy and Gatsby in the car.<br />The only drawback I can possibly see with this wonderful novel is the technical skills.  They aren't great but they don't detract from the story.  Fitzgerald does use a limited perspective and he does follow a cohesive plot, so the technical writing isn't too terrible.<br />Overall this is one of the top 10 books I have ever read, and I have read quite extensively.  So don't listen to the negative reviews, read this novel and enjoy it.	2002-06-26

And no wonder, The Great Gatsby is vintage America. As a panoramic snapshot of the Jazz-Age, The Great Gatsby provides a crystallized glimpse into the age that bore swing dancing, the end of prohibition and the new exhuberance of an America breaking out of the shell of old world puritanism. With poignancy and simple beauty, The Great Gatsby conveys the timeless story of endless love, and the jealousy that eventually murders it.<br />The Great Gatsby is not simply a reflection of its times -- it is perhaps the greatest love story of the century. It is the story of a man who had everything but love, and gave everything for his love of Daisy -- a Marilyn Monroesque goddess who evokes the raw passions of innocence and beauty.<br />The story is not complex -- nor is particularly innovative. What makes this novel a masterpiece is that Fitzgerald associates all these actions with a particular naivety -- the same naivety seen in Nick to Daisy to Gatsby. It is this unbridled ebullience that typifies the era that gave way to a depression which shackled the nation with fear for years to come. And in its particularly austere style, there arises an unmatched elegance, whose words cannot be matched by those who masquarade behind the incomprehensible jargon of \\"knowledge\\".	2002-06-21

Nothing could be further from the truth. This novel captures the American spirit in all its confused idealism, its expansive dreaming and scheming, the corruption in its childlike innocence and its penchant for pressing into the future without examining the past. The old money and its callous cop-out policies are still practised by the ones who can buy second chances as symbolized by the established Buchanans while neurotic upstart Gatsby is the forerunner of every motivated small town boy who makes it against the odds and finds out that although everything is for sale, including a brand new identity , all the power and all the glitz can't buy back the wasted youth or the heart of the ones who had their finger on the pulse of opportunity and rationale. The closer Gatsby gets to his dream the more remote its core becomes;not unlike an emotional fata morgana. Nick Carraway is the chronicler of this tragedy of illusion  and leaves the wiser for having the veil lifted and seeing nothing more than a poor boy's broken heart in the swimmingpool of vodka and blood. The Wilsons from the wrong side of the track are a brilliant signifier of how the priviledged amuse themselves with the hardscabble folks for diversion but can effort to cut them at a moment's notice. Having means won't buy you love or real friends but it will buy you a clean slate again and again until you run out of real estate. Gatsby's real estate is his heart's yearning so he dies desolate because he bought the motivational speech and was never told that the new continent and all its attentant promises might make room for a new brand of hero but it can't change the human heart.<br />A classic in the best sense of the word. A Greek myth remade to fit the size of the new world.	2002-05-20

They never speak of the off balance, really modern relationship of Nick Carraway and Jordan Baker.  Carraway is by far the character to watch, and the one that makes this book interesting.  His constantly changing relationship to Gatsby is strictly human.  Reading this book from the twenties is like reading a book from the nineties.  &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was far ahead of its time, and so was Nick Carraway and the relationships flooded throughout the book.<br />The gossip aspect is very modern as well.  Everyone at Gatsby's parties follow him around because of mystery.  And that's what Jay Gatsby is about.  Mystery.  Even when the book is over, you never fully understand him.<br />Overall, a great book, but not the best ever.	2002-05-11

This is a quality Classic, full of enchantment, and taking us back to the twenties just after the war.<br />I took my time and savoured every word as it flowed along with a mysterious edge, causing me to be somewhat unsure of where you I was actually heading next.<br />Narrated by  Nick Carraway who had been anxious to come out to the East (New York) after spending a rather dull childhood in the Midwest, I found Carraway a very interesting person. A bit of a schemer sometimes; one is never sure how he really feels about Jay.<br />Jay Gatsby is the enigma in this story; a rather poor officer who before he goes to war falls hopelessly in love with the beautiful Daisy Fay from Louisville.  But what happens after the war???<br />The Great Gatsby having heard that his lovely Daisy has tied the knot with the uncouth, ill-mannered and filthy rich Tom Buchanan, goes to great measures to become wealthy too.... by all means.  When he accomplishes this, he buys an elaborate house not far from the Buchanans where he hosts glittering and five star parties most weekends; with the hope that Daisy will eventually turn up.<br />You will be entertained and shocked by the things Jay Gatsby does all in the name of love. His parties filled with lots of celebrities and Hollywood people do nothing to assuage his troubled and lonely soul. I felt his pain in this book and his isolation which you will experience too when you read this book.<br />This is one of the best Classics on the market, even more so now that it has been updated.  I highly recommend this book and can't wait to get my hands on F. Scott Fitzgerald's other updated ones; The Beautiful and The Dammed and Tender Is The Night. Fitzgerald is a boss and oh; the cover is soooo beautiful.	2002-05-09
US	44747369	R1C0C48HTBHM1O	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	5	7	N	N	The Ultimate American Novel	In college, when I asked my literature professor to name the greatest novel of all time, without hesitation, he mentioned Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy.  I then asked what he thought was the tantamount novel by an American.  He offered three, Moby Dick, Huckleberry Finn, and The Great Gatsby.  I had already read Moby Dick and Huckleberry Finn while I attended high school.  However, my high school failed to include The Great Gatsby in its curriculum.  I vowed that summer (1993) to read Gatsby.  Since then I have read it two more times and savored each subsequent reading.  I now understand why The Great Gatsby has received such an exalted position in the literary stratosphere.<br /><br />After his first two novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and the Damned, F. Scott Fitzgerald said he wanted to try something \\"exciting and new.\\"  His creation became The Great Gatsby, published in 1925 to modest success.  It wasn't until later that Gastby became regarded as Fitzgerald's masterpiece.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is a short novel and can be completed in a day or two.  The ease of reading The Great Gatsby belies its intricate plot and evocative prose.  Gatsby perfectly captures the prosperous, carefree era of the 1920's.  The novel appealed to me because of its Long Island setting.  East and West Egg are Manhassat and Great Neck.  Jay Gatsby, the novel's protagonist, had a love affair with Daisy Buchanan that ended when Gatsby went to fight in World War I.  Gatsby lost his fortune thereafter.  Daisy married Tom Buchanan while Gatsby was away.  To regain Daisy's affections, Gatsby uses unscrupulous means to garner money.  Tom Buchanan refers to Gatsby's bootlegging.  Gatsby throws lavish parties at his home thinking Daisy might attend.  Daisy won't leave her husband, even though she knows he is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson, thus creating tension between Gatsby and Tom.<br /><br />The American dream does not become a reality for everybody.  Although Gatsby's wealth can afford him a luxurious house overlooking the Long Island Sound, it's the wrong currency for recapturing Daisy's love.  Daisy and Myrtle are both materialistic characters and money clouds their perceptions.  Daisy ignores her husband's affair with Myrtle due to Tom's wealth.  Although Tom treats her terribly, Myrtle is shallow and only sees Tom's affluence.<br />The Great Gatsby also vividly displays Fitzgerald's adept utilization of foreshadowing and symbolism.

Scott Fitzgerald wrote a true classic of the 1920's and the affluence of a distinguished facet of society.  As a high school student, I am quick to judge any novel I read, yet this one caught my attention and had me wondering the truth about the book's title character, Jay Gatsby.  Fitzgerald mixes romance and tragedy to create an unforgettable plot which keeps the attention of its audience.  It proves that wealth cannot buy happiness and does so with unexpected circumstances that surprised me and kept me on my toes until the tradgic finale.  The only unfortunate thing about the book is that it ends and leaves you wanting more.  For an intriguing and different read, The Great Gatsby does not disappoint!	2002-04-25

It tells the story of Gatsby, the dreamer, and his fall from the world of fantasy to the world of reality; two worlds that for him were one and the same.  Gatsby stands for the dreamer in all men; that force which we must use yet restrain.  He reminds that while it is imperative to dream, we must live in reality.  This story tells not only of that philosophical message, but of adventures among the rich, and provides a commentary for the society of the Roaring 20's.  No book ever written provides as much insight to human nature as the Great Gatsby, and no book that ever will be written will either.	2002-04-20

One gets the impression from reading the negative reviews<br />of this novel written in these \\"modern\\" times that the<br />reviewers are refusing to recognize any correlation<br />between Gatsby and his world -- and themselves and their<br />own. It seems they would rather mask their own weakness<br />and vulnerability behind a screen of \\"objectified\\"<br />skepticism and complaints about the \\"boredom\\" of the<br />characters and the the plot. So be it. But it is at<br />their peril. For in refusing to see, the blind stumble<br />across the cliff whenever it comes.<br /> It is true, this novel on the first read (and perhaps<br />at the wrong time in one's life) may seem a surface,<br />rather than a depth. But with experience, and heartbreak,<br />shadows and depths appear not only in one's own life<br />but also in one's understanding and insight into things<br />which earlier in one's life seemed to make no sense or<br />to have no real meaning, depth, or interest. Such is<br />the wonder -- and horror -- of life and living.<br /> There are two main types of Idealists who swim in<br />the shifting, unstable oceans of life. One is the<br />Romantic Idealist -- moved by visions and fantasies<br />of beauty (usually for some unattainable female goddess,<br />who may be a Medusa in disguise), by his luring feelings<br />and passions, toward some elusive goal of ultimate bliss.<br />The other is the Classical Idealist -- moved by visions<br />and dreams of beauty (usually involving some unattainable<br />male god, who may be Hermes or a malignant Apollo in<br />disguise), by his luring Reason, divine intuitions,<br />and mystic desire for melding and absorption toward<br />communion with the Ideal (the beauty, the power,<br />the love).<br /> Jay Gatsby is a Romantic Idealist. If that fact is<br />not understood from the beginning, then all that is<br />marvelous and miraculous about his metamorphosis --<br />and \\"apotheosis\\" -- cannot fully be understood. What<br />happens to a dream deferred? What happens to a dream<br />transmogrified into a nightmare?<br /> What happens when youth, yearning, hopes and dreams<br />(weighted down from flight by the oppression and depression<br />of poor beginnings) -- suddenly meets the great<br />American fantasy of \\"the Main Chance?\\" Chapter VI of<br />this novel is the inner sanctum of the the Temple of<br />Apollo at Delphi. There we see Jay in his true light.<br />His fantasies, his future, and his fatality.<br /> \\"His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful<br /> farm people -- his imagination had never really<br /> accepted them as his parents at all. The truth<br /> was that 'Jay Gatsby' of West Egg, Long Island,<br /> sprang from his Platonic conception of himself.<br /> [Fitzgerald has it wrong -- Jay is a Romantic<br /> Idealist, not a Classical one.] He was a son of<br /> God -- a phrase which, if it means anything,<br /> means just that -- and he must be about his<br /> Father's business, the service of a vast,<br /> vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented<br /> just the sort of 'Jay Gatsby' that a seventeen-<br /> year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to<br /> this conception he was faithful to the end.\\"<br /> -- F. Scott Fitzgerald. [with the addition<br /> of a few quotation marks]<br /><br /> Some lines from Catullus seem approprate to Gatsby's<br />fixation on Daisy. For poor Catullus was as hopelessly<br />driven for his Lesbia as Jay is for his Daisy:<br /> O sparrow...my Lesbia's darling pet;<br /> Her playmate, whom she loves to let<br /> Perch in her bosom and then tease...<br /> With tantalising fingertips;<br /> Provoking angry little nips<br /> For my \\"bright beauty\\" seems to get<br /> A kind of pleasure from these games...<br /> Even relief -- this being HER way,<br /> I think, of damping down the flames<br /> Of passion.

US	50002830	R1Q6CQZEBX6RWP	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	4	4	4	N	N	American classic	This is one of those books that has become immortal because it perfectly captures an era. The 1920's were perhaps the most exciting decade of the previous century in America (rivaled only by the 1960's), and this book showcases its excesses in all their glory. We see the rich person, and what money can do to you. We see how love can not only change a man's life, but also take it away from him. We see interactions between different social classes. We see how the amounts of excess in the 20's reached such a zenith that people would actually hold huge parties for multitudes of people at their houses that they not only didn't know, but would never even meet. This book, on the surface, is a love story, but it also has deeper revertebrations. It's a tragedy. It's poetry. It's a warning about the false luster of the American dream. The plot in this story is wonderful and perfectly thought out. The writing style is very, very smooth and actually acutely beautiful. It's a beautifully written book - almost like prose at times, but very literate. It's probably Fitzgerald's masterpiece. This is a book that you can't afford to skip over when reading your way through the American classics.	2002-03-30

My favorite aspect of Fitzgerald's prose is the way he was able to convey such precise shades of meaning, fearlessly crafting sentences that though wordy perfectly capture a character's emotions or a memory's effect.<br />\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is, essentially, a tragic story of love gone wrong. Is a lie told out of love less censurable than those told for lower reasons? Gatsby spins a cocoon of lies around himself, a cocoon from which he hopes to emerge as a new man worthy of Daisy's love. He emerges instead into a world of liars, and though on the face of things he is the biggest grifter of them all, Gatsby alone elicits sympathy: there is a degree of absolution due the creator of such a colossal deception. It is almost as if one is begging to be found out. Neither Tom nor Daisy nor Jordan nor even the unhappily married Wilsons have any such claim on our understanding. In the course of this story everyone lies to everyone else: only Gatsby pays the price. The truly creative liar is punished, the everyday tellers of banal lies go unchecked.<br />I personally preferred \\"Tender is the Night\\", perhaps only because its longer and more complex nature allowed Fitzgerald more room to perform, to draw on all the powers at his command. But \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is definitely a worthwhile read, a relatively short tale told with the ease of a colorful memory.	2002-03-26

Gatsby and his doomed love for Daisy is cast against the deco backdrop of roaring 20's New York, which is vividly rendered by Fitzgerald. It is a period piece, and there are things that are definitely of that time, but there is much about it that is timeless.<br />I want to encourage anyone who read this in high school and was made to hate it to pick it up. It's a very brief read, and is worth your time. Maybe the passage of a few years helps clear the high school myopia about great books like these.<br />And if you were lucky enough not to read this in high school, pick it up now!	2002-03-12

US	43387097	R3CJ7SWO1LANJZ	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	4	6	N	N	The Greatest Novel Ever?	There's so much critique-wise that could be said of this book.  It's an entertaining, interesting story.  The characters are so well-developed and their actions and words so consistent and unique throughout the novel that they seem so real.  This is something most novels lack.  Fitzgerald brings even the minor characters to life.  The imagery and symbols are intricate, both serving to further the theme.  The symbols are an integral part of the story, like Gatsby's car, which characterizes him as ostentatious and symbolically leads to his death.  The characters themselves are symbolic.  The story serves as a historical document of the 20's.  The thematic material applies as much to our present society as it did back then.  It is condensed, fitting so much meaning into each page, each sentence, each phrase.  Much of the wording of the book is so memorable, so quotable, even magical.  The Preface, Publisher's Afterward, and the Explanatory notes of this edition, as well as Cliff's Notes are very helpful to understand and appreciate this novel.<br />The basic theme is that of the American Dream.  Jay Gatsby is defined by his dream to win Daisy Buchanan, a popular, beautiful, but superficial girl.  To win her, he needs exorbitant sums of money which he gains through corruption.  Gatsby has all the \\"toys\\"-- a mansion, a Rolls-Royce, a hydroplane, and connections to people like Meyer Wolfsheif who fixed the 1919 World Series.  Dan Cody circling the continent aimlessly in his yacht as he falls victim to alcohol shows that money is not an end in itself.  Gatsby is different because money is only a means to an end for him; still, he fails.  This book shows the harmful effects of a wide gap between the rich and the poor.  The wealthy Buchanan's are not productive at all and the poor Wilson struggles to survive and is pushed around by Tom Buchanan.  This book shows that such extreme wealth as Gatsby's and the Buchanan's leads to waste.  Gatsby has a pool he only uses once all summer.  He drives a Rolls-Royce which can cost over 300 grand in today's money.  Daisy drives the car and accidentally kills Wilson's wife who was having an affair with Tom Buchanan, Daisy's husband.  Tom manipulates Wilson into thinking Gatsby killed her and Wilson shoots him then turns the gun on himself.  The major theme of the novel is that \\"money isn't real\\" as the movie \\"Blow\\" put it.  The material world is illusion, in other words.  I've heard it said that \\"You can't buy happiness but you can rent it.\\"  If that's true, then it helps explain Gatsby's failure-- he tried to, and thought he did, buy it.<br />Gatsby's boyhood program for self-improvement as revealed by his dad at the ending is just like Ben Franklin's autobiography.  Two self-help books I've read and reviewed negatively are \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" by Dale Carnegie and \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" by Anthony Robbins.  After reading Gatsby it seemed as though these two books were studied and practiced thoroughly by Jay Gatsby.<br />First off, Gatsby's mannerisms resemble what is recommended in \\"Win Friends.\\"  Gatsby is very indirect.  He can't just go directly to Daisy or even directly to Nick to arrange the meeting between he and Daisy.  He has Jordan tell Nick about the background between them then has Nick invite Daisy over to his house (he's Gatsby's neighbor) and tells him to tell her not to bring her husband.  Gatsby then disappears outside when she comes and knocks on the back door.  He must have looked like an idiot to Daisy being so ridiculously  indirect and obvious like this.  Gatsby even bought his house in the neighborhood of Daisy for this reason.  Another aspect of Win Friends is to smile-- whether you are truthfully happy or not to charm other people into liking you.  Consider Nick's description of Gatsby's smile, \\"It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it.  It faced--or seemed to face-- the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you, with an irresistible prejudice in your favor.  It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.  Precisely at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck...whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.\\"  As is advised to do in \\"Win Friends\\", Gatsby makes other people feel special like the way he calls everyone \\"old sport.\\"  But keep in mind Gatsby has no real friends and everyone but Nick merely uses him.  They flocked to his mansion by the hundred for his parties but only a few people were at his funeral.<br />The other Jay Gatsby handbook is \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" by Anthony Robbins.  I once saw Tony on TV and Jay Gatsby came to my mind before I realized it was him.  I saw Tony's signature before and it was signed in a \\"majestic hand\\" just like Gatsby's writing on the note of invitation to his party to Nick.  Throughout his book, Robbins writes of his accomplishments of making money and buying all the ostentatious \\"toys\\" like Gatsby has.  Both men's obsession with materialism is so intense as to almost take on a spiritual level.  Comparing \\"The Great Gatsby\\" to these two books and the movies \\"Blow\\" and \\"Casino\\" are just some ways you can understand how Gatsby relates to our world now even though it was written about the 1920's.<br />I don't feel a review of a 1000 word limit can possibly do justice to this novel.  To appreciate it yourself, all the more I can say is read it, read Cliff's notes, think about it, read it again, and observe how the theme relates to the world around you very much today.then concentrated on you, with an irresistible prejudice in your favor.

It's amazing we had to read it in high school. How could a teenager understand all this stuff about adultery and materialism? I remember my eleventh grade teacher said that F. Scott Fitzgerald, &quot;wasn't a first rate writer, but he was a very good second rate writer.&quot; Even in eleventh grade, I found that horrific. Why labor at all to write a book in the first place, pouring all your life blood into writing what would become a 20th century classic, just to have some high school English teacher dub you &quot;a very good second rate writer&quot;?<br />In my English teacher's defense, we were a very trying class. She was trying to get us to elucidate the symbolic meaning in the scene where Jay Gatsby stands on his dock and stares at the green light across the water. She said, &quot;The dock scene . . . what comes to your mind?&quot; The jocks who sat in the back of the class yelled, &quot;Hickory Dickory Dock.&quot; The poor woman literally banged her head into the brick wall of our classroom.<br />Rereading THE GREAT GATSBY all these years later, I am struck with how fresh and utterly relevant it is. In essence, it isn't dated at all. What happened in West Egg in the Long Island Sound in 1923 could just as well have happened in Silicon Valley in the Dot Com Nineties. There are many Jay Gatsbys. Fitzgerald created an essential American archetype with Jay Gatz, the boy from North Dakota who wanted to reinvent himself and turn himself into something grand, based on the dreams he had for his life when he was 17. We catch a poignant glimpse of him as a thirty-year-old man who woos and impresses his long lost love with his swank mansion and his English tailored shirts. All glitter and glamour, the most important thing is that gaudy surface and facade that dazzles the eye. It says a lot about our culture, about the quintessential American dream.	2002-01-22

I also think many people don't see the depth that there really is in this book. It's not just about love, or romance. It is the persuit of a dream, a dream that is not all that it seems.

First is the general story; plot, characterization, setting, storyline. Second is the way it is written which keeps you reading it over and over.<br />The setting is a fictitious New York suburb of East and West Egg in the early 1920's, a location dotted with large estates build with immense wealth. The main characters are the narrator, Nick Caraway; his new found girl and golf pro, Jordan Baker; Tom Buchanan, the husband of Daisy Buchanan; and of course James Gatz also known as Jay Gatsby, self prescribed culturist of old wealth.<br />Concerning the first aspect, this book is an art of obsession, treachery, deception, hubris, crime and murder. It is the original soap opera (though not annoyingly melodramatic). It will keep you turning pages and ends with a bang.<br />The second aspect, the one that makes it a classic is the brilliant prose and mastery of the English language. Like a movie that presents something new every time you watch it, this book has many subtle subplots and philosophical outlooks.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in reading and rereading the classics. A book from \\"the lost generation,\\" written by an author from World War I, it definitely has the era's deserving undertones.	2002-01-16

Yes, I've read this many times,since high school, where it seemed like a force fed waste of time.I never knew the types described in this book then.Like &quot;Bond Business&quot; Nick,a business based on trading money (update to Tom Wolfe'S BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES,which has many similarities to THE GREAT GATSBY!) But, that was a long time ago. Usually I breezed thru it,but recently I gave it a more serious try, and found it to be just as great as they say! Why? Simply, because the characters are incredibly true to life. I've met Tom Buchanan types so many times it makes me want to (I won't say here.) The world is full of arrogant smart alecks who never had to do a thing on their own,and who look down their nose at their supposed &quot;inferiors&quot;. And Daisy...How many shallow,money grubbing,self obsessed young ladies are there like this? One wonders what Gatsby saw in her too,but that's probably the point. You know, the ones who get thrilled by looking at dozens of colored shorts in a wardrobe, as she does with Gatsby. Both types really care for nothing except themselves and their little toys. FS Fitzgerald probably knew hundreds like this...Now the Gatsby character is more unique and refreshing,even if he is dull.The self made guy who may have made his money under shady conditions. Then again,how about the dot-com millionaire rage of recent memory, and the way the world and the media were lapping it up. Now, the Enron fiasco where it's obvious the bigshots could care less about anything other than lining their own pockets at everyone else's expense.A little like Tom perhaps. But Gatsby seemed to have a heart, shallow as he may have been. And the New York 1920's locale rings true too...This novel easily can be read by a 15 year old,even though his life experience will not be able to understand it. And an 80 year old can appreciate it too. If Joyce's ULYSSES was the best novel of the century, how many can figure it out?. Really, almost no one!

The Great Gatsby is a novel about the pursuit of a romantic ideal. Gatsby/America pursues its ideals in vain. For all our optimism, for all the pure belief in the ideal/the green light/the orgiastic future, it recedes before us, year by year. It is unattainable, it does not exist, it is but the projection of our past desires (for Gatsby, read the Daisy of his past, for America, read the untarnished new world). Still, no matter, we will keep trying, we will row on, boats against the current, our goal folornly already behind us... we are born back ceaselessly into the past.<br />As for the anti semiticism/racisim - Tom is a racist, but is clearly an unthinking ignorant racist - did Fitzgerald really need to expressly condemn him? The condemnation is implicit.<br />Perhaps the professor referred to in the first review had his own political agenda. If so, i suggest he read Roth's the Human Stain.	2002-01-14

Scott Fitzgerald's life. I felt that The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald was an amazing novel for many reasons.  Some people felt that around the first fifteen pages or so were not needed, but I thought that the pages helped me a lot with understanding the setting.  It was incredible how well written this novel was.  Every page just keeps pulling you in deeper and gets you more interested. As I got into the book, I had to think twice about whether it was a true story or not.  If you read this book straight through like any other book, you will think it was well written and had a good story line.  However, this book is much more complicated then it seems.  There is symbolism throughout the whole book that you should lookout for.  Once you identify it, you will have a whole new understanding of what this book is really about. I loved the way that this novel was such an easy book to read because one idea just flowed to the next.  Most books that are considered classics are relatively difficult to read, but this really wasn't.  It was really amazing how you could relate what happened in this book to what happens in everyday life today even though it is a completely different time period.  For people who like reading good literature, this is a must read.	2002-01-06

The Great Gatsby, however, is probably one of the only books I've read that I hate.<br />It is the story of a man who, basically, talks about nothing.  The plot is nonexistent, just the ramblings of a man who's confused about society.  The characters are either boring or not developed enough.  The worst part about the book is that you get the feeling that F. Scott Fitzgerald is going to hit you with a great, dramatic, thought-provoking ending, and nothing happens at the end.  When I finished, I was left with the feeling of &quot;Okay, what was that all about?&quot;  I can understand that it is a reflection of the  1920s, but certainly not a very good reflection.<br />This is a book you should read when there is absolutely nothing else to read.

Sure, it's been heaped with praise since the critics of the mid-1920s were thinking about worshipping a new messiah.  But let's face it: their enthusiasm was on the right mark.<br />The Great Gatsby is a swift, gorgeously written story about people we don't seem to have anything in common with.  These are confused, wandering, sub-stratispheric members of an even more deeply ingrained sub-culture that, for the modern reader, also has no bearing on anyone they will ever encounter.  And yet the prose and the narrative force of this novel imbues these alien characitures with the sweet and stunning glow of life.  They transform into very human beings caught up in much of the youthful pain and torment of anyone who ever dreamed of success.  It is a tragic, heart-rending story of broken-hearts and insincere love as well as an epic portrait of nearly an entire generation of people embodied in the character of their greatest ambitions.  This book soars higher and higher with the passage of time and continues to force students, sometimes, to realize that they can enjoy reading a novel.<br />A wonderful, extraordinary book that tends to stay with you for a long time.	2001-12-15

Many of the thoughts I now have on Fitzgerald and Gatsby I owe to him and I think it would be good to share them and allow people who read these reviews to rethink Gatsby somewhat. The fact is that Fitzgerald's &quot;great&quot; novel of the &quot;American Dream&quot; has serious problems that make it a questionable text for number two on such a list, especially considering it is placed above such novels as Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury and Light in August and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man.<br />From the beginning of the novel, we are in the hands of a first person narrator in Nick Carraway, an empty shallow young man from the midwest who moves to the east to try his hand at the &quot;American Dream.&quot; The problem is that although most people would regard Nick as a shallow character, Fitzgerald doesn't seem to offer an underlying critique of this moral void inside of his character but instead forces the reader to accept what Nick says at face value. Then we meet Tom and Daisy Bucchanan. Tom is the quintessential Aryan prototype spouting racist propaganda about how it has been scientifically proven that the blond haired blue eyed Nordic male is superior in every way to other races, and again there is no satiric edge from Fitzgerald to say that Tom is not correct in his beliefs and assumptions. Then we reach the introduction of Gatsby and the melodramatic love story of Gatsby and Daisy. Gatsby is the nouveau riche who throws large excessive parties for anyone who will come to his mansion hoping that Daisy will someday show up. Fitzgerald goes down a list of participants in those parties and most of the people there are Eastern Europeans. This is a criticism of the parties in Fitzgerald's prose and begins to venture into the anti-semitic areas of the novel. The introduction of Meyer Wolfsheim, the stereotypical Jew seals the deal on that. We also soon discover that what attracts Gatsby to Daisy is not a human bond of understanding and friendship, but the fact that Daisy's voice jingles like money; and yet, people seem to view this love affair as stirring and tragic. The sad thing about the book is that all of its characters are shallow and money hungry. There is not a redeming figure in the book though the narrator Nick would like to say that the hero is Gatsby. Gatsby was all right in the end. It was what prayed on him that was bad. This is Fitzgerald's judgment.<br />If this is the quintessential novel about the American Dream, if the lust of Gatsby is our lust as Americans and the love story of Daisy and Gatsby the type of love we as a people aspire to, we're in a great deal of trouble in this country. When books such as The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn come under attack in high schools across for using the word &quot;Nigger&quot; and others such as The Grapes of Wrath are banned for using profanity such as &quot;Christ,&quot; The Great Gatsby, which is a far more damaging and subversive novel, slips by unnoticed. I'm not for censorship in any form, but we must think about what we want to tell children or any other students about America. While Huckleberry Finn and the Grapes of Wrath are being banned yet are permeated with important and positive messages about the meaning of America, The Great Gatsby is a staple in cirriculum everywhere saying that this is really what America is about. Part of the problem is that Fitzgerald's prose is so exquisitely poetic that the themes of the book sometimes disappear beneath the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleberg or get clouded by a green light at the end of a pier. Half the time if you stop to think, you can't even figure out what Fitzgerald is talking about. &quot;And so we float on, boats against the current borne ceaselessly back into the past.&quot; At the endof examining the novel in an American literature class in college my professor asked the students what this line meant. No one could come up with a satisfactory answer. The teacher who had been teaching The Great Gatsby in class for twenty years told us that he had never met anyone would could tell him what it meant. Perhaps the novel should have fallen to a lower spot on the list of the twentieth century's greatest novels.of examining the novel in an American literature class in college my professor asked the students what this line meant.

A tale like TGG could be the right answer. Even if I have found the track a bit boring, it is the most representative subject that can be defined American epics. But what I really appreciate about Fitzgerald is his style of writing, the best I have ever met in American and English literature, which also retains its meaningful form (but in that case I have to pay much credit to the translator) in the Italian version. The final short digression about the green light is one of the most often seen quotations.	2001-11-05

Through two old acquaintances, Tom Buchanan and his wife, Daisy, he learns that one of his neighbors is the rich, extravagant Jay Gatsby, who soon invites him to one of the periodic late night parties on his property.  At this party, he befriends Gatsby and soon becomes intertwined in his story.  He finds that Gatsby's money was earned through illicit methods, and sees his friend's incongruously idealistic character.  Finally, he watches as Gatsby is confronted by his past in the form of Daisy Buchanan.<br />During WWI, five years before the events recounted in The Great Gatsby took place, Jay Gatsby was a soldier stationed in Louisville.  There, he met Daisy, and in his romanticism, he believed that it was everlasting, mutual love at first sight.  Four years later, when Gatsby discovered Daisy's marriage, he moved to Long Island, where his past lover and her husband were now residing.<br />We see Jay Gatsby's incredible idealism, inharmonious with the rest of his character, which is, to me, the most significant characterization in the entire novel.  It is the one aspect of the story that allows the reader to keep reading, feeling that everything might be eventually work out.  How Gatsby hopes against hope, believes against belief, that Daisy, after five years, still loves him, is a tribute to the human spirit.  His complete confidence during his confrontation with Tom Buchanan shows the incredible ability within us all to trust in a reflection of the past.  It makes us all Gatsby's friends, makes us hope with him, wish with him, have faith in him.  Gatsby's romanticism makes readers aspire to or even believe that they have this incredible love of \\"a green light at the end of the dock\\", a symbol of the hope that has been lost and yet is still there.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone, although some slight racism and sexism common at the time the novel was written may discourage sensitive readers.  The literary style and word usage is, for lack of a better description, incredible, and the book's plotting is superb.  The Great Gatsby realistically portrays both the best and the worst of human attributes and allows any reader to identify with the characters, no matter how far-fetched this might seem.  F.

Scott Fitzgerald's life is somewhat paralleled by the character (Jay Gatsby) he creates in his most famous novel, The Great Gatsby.  Gatsby throws lavish parties and lives one of the most extreme lifestyles fictionalized during the Jazz Age.  Although Fitzgerald's life was tragic at times, he seems to have drawn the content of the novel from his creative literary genius as well.  Because of its amazing story and craftsmanship, The Great Gatsby is the type of novel that deserves to stay in print for as long as people are reading books.<br />  The novel is a bit of a love story gone wrong, mixed with the budding friendship of a common bond salesman (Nick Carraway) with the notorious underground gambler and namesake of the novel (Jay Gatsby).  The two are somewhat confidants, yet the audience never knows if Gatsby is totally truthful with Carraway.  Gatsby finds that Carraway's distant cousin (Daisy Buchanan) is a lost love who has married another man (Tom Buchanan).  It seems as though his pursuit is worthless, but the soap-opera feel of the book helps the story continue to flow.  Tom is also having an affair; his mistress is a low-class woman named Myrtle Wilson who lives in a gas station halfway between the two major areas that set the novel (East Egg and West Egg).  Gatsby goes on a mission to reclaim the love of his life, almost an attempt to eternally grasp happiness. Carraway also has a somewhat love interest, a lady golfer who often lands herself in trouble.  A novel is complete without unexpected disaster and The Great Gatsby is no exception.  Twists of fates and other accidents play into the story as the reader's heart beats faster and is too involved to close the book.<br />  Other plot elements allow Fitzgerald's novel to be highly esteemed.  He magically mixes carefully crafted symbolism, dramatic irony, complex plot, figurative language, and vivid descriptions in such a bold yet intriguing way.  A fantastic cast of characters work together move the story forward, although one man (Carraway) does the actual narration.  After reading this amazing novel, any reader would wish to travel back to the 1920s and attend one of Gatsby's wild parties or befriend one of the other characters.orward, although one man (Carraway) does the actual narration.

Having such a light and lucid pen, Fitzgerald manages to describe scenes in such a way as to make them come to life.  He is also very subtle in his use of sarcasm (mostly demonstrated through the narrators remarks on those around him).  This ornate style is in contrast to the spare quality of the plot.  Basically, the story follows Nick Carraway's involvement in the relationship between Jay Gatsby and his --Gatsby's-- long time love (who is a married woman).  It plays out in a way that is very similar to Greek tragedies (imagine Oedipus Rex).  However, simple this may sound, it plays out in an interesting way, and is somewhat refreshing when compared to the modern day four-plot-twist-per-book style of writing (not to say that there aren't good modern writers; there are, of course).<br />Another interesting aspect of this book is the idea of wealth, or the idealization of wealth.  All of the characters involved in this story are either bent on gaining, or flaunting money.  Gatsby throws lavish parties, and drives around in a distinctive automobile.  Nick is looking to earn a fortune in the supposedly limitless city of New York. Fitzgerald even lays down a sort of classist line (through Gatsby's lips, I believe):  &quot;The rich get richer, and the poor get children.&quot;  It follows that within the book there are thin, nearly invisible, lines drawn between all the characters of different classes.<br />  I would recomend this novel for anybody who is interested in clever writing. I'd also recomend this to anyone who's interested in the expatriot writers.  For while Fitzgerald is in contrast to Hemingway, they almost seem to compliment each other in defining the time period.  I would also recomend this to anybody who's interested in classic american literature, for it is very much a hallmark American story.	2001-10-22

First let me start out by saying that I am a high school student who was forced to read this book during summer, which is the first downfall. The Great Gatsby is a story of a man, Jay Gatsby, who wastes his life away throwing parties, hoping his first love, Daisy, would maybe attend one of these parties. The narrator, Nick, finally meets Gatsby at a party and since Nick is Daisy's cousin, Nick is pulled into a plot that ends in a very tragic way. I was more interested in Nick than Gatsby or any of the other characters. Gatsby is a character that really isn't defined besides the fact that he loves Daisy. Also, along the way readers are introduced to characters at parties that have no signifigant role in the book. Another problem with The Great Gatsby was that it seemed to progress so slow. The plot didn't keep my attention like it should have. The ending is a little surprising but not enough that could redeem the rest of the book. Although this is a highly acclaimed book, I found out it's not a book for everyone.	2001-10-04

What is the American Dream, but the idea that you can transcend your background and origins to become whatever you want? To transcend barriers of class, wealth and breeding? Of course, the cost of such a dream sometimes ends up as more than most of us would be willing to pay, and the dream often crashes upon the rocks of reality. F.

Jay Gatsby pursues the American dream with a single minded zeal and the closer he gets to his dream the emptier he is.  The greatness of the book is both in this theme and in the way Fitzgerald makes Gatsby stand for all of us Americans. In his later works Fitzgerald falters but here every last detail is in its proper place. The narrator Nick is the perfect voice for this story. Through his eyes we may see that Gatsby is not all that Gatsby wants to be but like Nick we let ourselves be seduced anyway.  The most superficial creature in this book, Daisy, is the object of Gatsby's lifelong obsession. She is about as weak as that flower and no more complex. Only Gatsby with his undying ability to dream which is unmatched by any character in fiction and the reason we all love him can imagine she is anything more than the common flower of her namesake. Everything functions and happens exactly as it should. No plot, I suggest, can be repeated by more readers. I put this in a tie with Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises for greatest book by an American. Hemingway's book is equally great though for quite different reasons. I think in his next book Tender is the Night Fitzgerald is trying to cover Hemingway's terrain but unlike Hemingway Fitzgerald does not really belong in Europe. Hemingway uncovers what it is to be American by showing Americans outside America and in contrast to Europeans. Fitzgerald never brings his Americans abroad in contact with anything but each other.  But in this book he is brilliant. I just wish he would have stayed put.	2001-09-03

The flashiness and greatness of the 20's are represented well in this book, with lavish parties and care free guests. It shows that the rich have problems as well, and many times their lives are more empty than the lives of those that are poor. Fitzgerald's writing style kept me very entertained, being very calm and relaxed throughout the whole book. The oddity in Gatsby's &quot;style&quot; kept me interested and thoughtful, such as the constant use of the phrase &quot;old sport.&quot; I think this book deserves to be considered the classic that it is, and has earned its place among other greats.	2001-08-25

However, my reaction to the story was different than when I first read it in high school. I recall that back then I was hoping that Daisy and Gatsby's love story would ultimately yield a happy ending. Now, I found them both to be such shallow creatures that they inspired no pity. While I considered the characters to be emotionally stunted, that dooesn't mean I was not impressed with Fitzergerald's skillful rendering. As in most forms of art, in literature it is more difficult to accurately and interestingly portray nothingness than to describe a richly endowed subject. At this more cynical age, I found Daisy to be a remarkable emotional void, and Gatsby's quest to pour all of his hopes and dreams into such a shallow cauldron only confirmed his own vapidity. One thing that hasn't changed in all these years is my amazement at Fitzgerald's ability to set a scene. His descriptive passages are truly poetic, and his command of word choice in unparalleled. All this made for a stimulating and delightful read.	2001-08-25

People describe F. Scott's Fitzgerald's writing as poetic, and indeed it is at some points in the book. However I believe that as a result of this, Gatsby is much more difficult to read and comprehend. I would have preferred a more traditional writing style instead of a over-embellished, over-done, and, most importantly, an overly-complex style of writing.	2001-08-17

Let me try to be fair, the book started decent. I thought the writing style of the author was good, but nothing egregrious. I was interested in finding out about the narrator, of course, the story turns and introduced a mob of characters from parties and dreaded plots. It was plainly, and simply and tediously S-L-O-W. Reading this book is a torture. Okay, that was my first impression of the book. After finally reading it through, however, I guess I should say it was better than I thought. The story speeds up a little, still retaining the air of elusiveness. It is hard to grasp the theme of The Great Gatsby. But perhaps when you do it is worthwhile to you. Though I still feel unable to relate this story very well. But different people have different opinions.	2001-08-16

The Great Gatsby has many twists and turns, chock full of phrases and situations that make sense as the story unfolds that beckons you to go back and reread this story.  The story meshes the characters and their setting very well.  However, as good as the story was, it was difficult to feel anything but disappointment with any of the characters.<br /><br /> The narrator, Nick, is never fully fleshed out.  He seems to be a prop brought in from the Midwest only to be used as an observer of the strange goings on of the rest of the characters.  Even his relationship with Jordan is blandly glossed over.  With so many different characters to juggle, one wonders if the narrator character could have been dropped completely.<br /><br /> Jordan is ... a golfer, was it?  She appears to be another peripheral prop in a mad dash to bring the only three characters who have any flesh together.<br /><br /> Which brings us to Daisy.  A girl who one begins to feel a warmth towards but who destroys any goodwill as events reach their climax.  She is childish and numb to all but her own feelings.  She is beautiful and fascinating, but wholly boring and empty.<br /><br /> Her husband Tom, on the other hand, was a powerhouse of a character.  Full of energy and passion and endowed with the wealth of his forebearers, this man has the ability and nature to lead corporations or governments.  He squanders it all buying into pop psychology and wrestling with the 'ash' of society.  What is most disappointing in Tom is that one can see this gargantuan man slowly turning himself into a stupid ape.  How many times did I feel like wrapping my fingers around his thick neck and telling him to shut up?<br /><br /> Finally there's Gatsby.  A boy in a man's body.  Building himself into the man that he is by careful planning and determination, he finds himself at the crest of adulthood used as a doormat for those who he might consider his friends.  He confuses serfdom for gentlemanliness.  He throws off the shackles of his past but builds for himself a house of cards.  One almost feels happy for him when Wilson makes his housecall to Gatsby's mansion.<br /><br /> All in all, this is a great book.  Even without sympathetic characters, the story flows along quite well with little eddys of brilliant storytelling that come together at the end and urge the reader to go back and reread what may have been missed on the first outing.st but builds for himself a house of cards.

If it isn't the finest novel ever written (which I've been known to argue it is) or the finest American novel (which again I've been known to argue it is) or the finest Twentieth Century novel (which, you know the drill), it is the finest crime novel ever written.  I read this book annually.  Many other crime fiction writers do the same.  THE GREAT GATSBY is perfectly constructed, with ambiguities within enigmas, as it recounts the Jazz Age, capturing that era's ambience splendidly.  It is a crime novel, yet, as with the best crime novels, crime does not dominate the entire book.  At one level, it is the story of a poor boy who dreams of becoming rich and marrying an American golden girl.  On another level, it is the story of the American upper crust personified by that golden girl and her polo playing husband.  On still another level, it is the story of a young Midwestern gentleman who matures into genuine manhood one summer amid the parties and social events of East and West Eggs in Long Island.  It is the Tale of America.  No one has told it better than F. Scott Fitzgerald, either before or since.  Ever.	2001-07-26

There are both things I love about the book and things that I found a little tedious. On the positive side, I enjoyed the social insight, the lyricism, the story in general. Fitzgerald was truly blessed with the gift of words, and the use of imagery gives this classic much staying value. It is just so real it comes alive in your head. The story of Jay Gatsby, who has grown wealthy (on the shady side of the law as it turns out) and his love for Daisy Buchanan is still affecting today. I disliked how it took a while for the story to get really moving, it was a little tedious sometimes. But don't let that spoil it for you. Read this book.	2001-07-18

Gatsby was great because he was pure in his pursuit of love, yet as the tragedy unfolds, he had to pay for his &quot;greatness.&quot; Fitzgerald cleverly depicted a whole range of characters who are your typical everyday people with slightly accelerated and dramatic events happening around them. After all the book is set in the Roaring 20's.<br />Gatsby himself was the touchstone character. He provided the contrast to all the characters around him. As one party scene in the book presented, most people were phonies - yet, Gatsby remained uncontaminated. He pursued love. And his failure was Fitzgerald's condemn of the world in which the Roaring 20's was, or rather how it always is.<br />When reading this book, you see the society, you see your own life, and you'll see the fireworks produced by the deft writing that only Fitzgerald brings. It has something for everyone. And you'll see your bit of world, though less glamorous, perhaps, is no less colorful than the one painted by the author.	2001-07-06

Gatsby is in search of his true love, which is something all of us look for in life - that relationship of heroic proportions that seems almost surreal and timeless.  Perhaps the last page is the best clincher of the book: \\"Gatsby believed in the green light (true love), the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us.  It eluded us then, but that's no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther...and one fine morning ----- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" How true it is...beat on my friends.	2001-06-28

A time of splendor, illegal drinking, and scandelous dealings.  This work takes the reader back to the great era of pre-depression years.  The advertising knowledge Fitzgerald portrays in this novel is represented in his imagery of the opthomologist billboard.  Unbeknownced to many, F. Scott was showing the negative impace of advertising on society.  Notice the crime and pain caused by the eyes of the billboard.  Perhaps without commercials, we would be a much greater nation.  The eyes represented a big brother captalistic attitude surrounding the commercialism with that society.<br />Pay close attention to the symbolism in this work.  Thousands of high school students read this each year, oblivious to Fitzgerald's dreary prediction to a marketing society.  Sadly, it is these young men and women who make it possible for Britany Spears to sell Pepsi...<br />Commercialism and Fitzgerald make a great paper topic.  I ought to know.	2001-06-17

In this case the era is the Jazz Age, a time of promise and excitement, especially for young people intoxicated by its novelties. It's no easy thing to capture a moment like that, but Fitzgerald does it with remarkable fluidity, because his writing skills are simply unparalleled. You can open any page of this great book and revel in the sheer artistry of phrasing, the wit, the precision of description. Since it was published it has continually been enjoyed by generation after generation because it is the perfect snapshot of the moment. For an equivalent in later years, On the Road captures the 50's brilliantly. For contemporary times, the very best I've found is the remarkable Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, which demonstrates ably that the concerns of the Jazz age -- fast living, young people grabbing the world by the throat and giving it a good shake -- are still with us. Great books from great writers, evoking eras perfectly.	2001-06-05

Throughout the novel, Fitzgerald is very descriptive and uses many themes to add a deeper understanding of the emotions and trials of the characters. Two major themes are wealth and self-improvement.  Jay Gatsby had been in love with Daisy since the two met a month before he was sent to war. Gatsby admired her voice and felt the \\"stirring warmth that flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to (him) in one of those breathless, thrilling words.\\" She had \\"an excitement in her voice that men who cared for her found difficult to forget.\\"  Gatsby loved Daisy's youthful beauty and cherished their limited time together. They devoted themselves to each other and expressed their powerful love. However, one problem existed- Gatsby's social status made him unsuitable for Daisy. Daisy came from a very wealthy family and Gatsby even noticed the \\"money in her voice.\\" Throughout and after his service in military, Jay Gatsby desperately tried to improve himself and his status so that when he returned his proposal would be accepted.  When Jay Gatsby left the military, he began to establish himself with illegal \\"new money.\\" He met Meyer Wolfshiem, who \\"raised him... out of the gutter.\\" They were involved in illegal activities such as bootlegging, the unlawful sale of alcohol. They established a series of \\"drug stores\\" that provided it to the people. Jay Gatsby also forged counterfeit bonds. Although the sources of his income were illegal, he saw only the quick money that he was making and thought he could win Daisy back with his improved status. Sure enough, when Daisy and Jay were reunited, she was very impressed with his possessions. Oddly, she seemed to adore Jay more when he boasted his multiple silk shirts. She realized that Jay has done well for himself and she fell in love with him and the money. Although Daisy enjoyed Jay's lifestyle, she could not leave Tom Buchanan, her wealthy, arrogant husband (especially when she learned that the source of Jay's money may only be short-term.) Right before Jay Gatsby is killed, he began to realize that Daisy was a selfish being who was too obsessed with money and herself. He also realized that he spent about five years improving himself and becoming a man that he thought would be suitable for Daisy, but now he knows that Daisy was not suitable for him.  When Gatsby was murdered, none of his party guests, business acquaintances or even Daisy pay their respects at his funeral. Some had picnics to attend; others were too wrapped up in a business deal at the moment. Daisy's selfish mind ran from the problems she caused and escaped on a vacation with her husband. She sent neither a letter nor flowers to acknowledge Gatsby's death. She did not recognize the trouble and struggle that Gatsby went through to improve himself and to gain her approval. Instead she retreated into her luxuries and forgot the one who loved her.<br />Money distorts the mind and often produces false priorities. Daisy was accustomed to a certain lifestyle and wanted luxuries more than love. She was not able to face realty and often retreated intoher money, which she thought would solve everything.  For Jay, it was the idea that he could buy Daisy's love. He soon realized that if someone would not accept you for who you are, then they are not worth accepting.

When I learned that the Modern Library Board had selected the Great Gatsby as the second most important novel to be written in the English language in the twentieth century, my first reaction was &quot;Uh-oh.  What did I miss.&quot;  So, after twenty-five years, I picked up the novel again.  After reading the novel for a second time, even with the Board's lofty ranking always in my mind, my original opinion remained unchanged.<br />Although I have always been astounded by the beauty of some of Fitzgerald's prose, I considered his story of ambition, the &quot;American Dream,&quot; and lost love as somewhat trite and predictable.  That opinion did not change with this reading.  I still saw the plot as being too contrived, the characters too thinly drawn, and his theme of the corruption of the &quot;American Dream&quot; better handled by Dos Passos, Dreiser or even Nabokov.  So why did the Modern Library give this novel such a high ranking?  I am still unsure.  And I might be so presumptuous as to suggest that even Fitzgerald would be surprised; after all, during his lifetime the book nearly went out of print.  I guess that many critics, following the lead of Lionel Trilling, see the character of Jay Gatsby as standing for America itself, and the novel as the most American of American novels.<br />Even though my opinion of the novel remained the same after two readings, my overall impression of the author grew.  I have always associated Fitzgerald with wealth, as an author with whom I could have no connection.  This prejudice affected my reading of Tender is the Night, and has remained for twenty-five years.  Now I see Fitzgerald in a more human light, a man haunted by the same desires that drove Gatsby, and like his chief character, a man who could not give up his dreams, or his &quot;old warm world.&quot;  Both Gatsby and the author lived lives of silent desperation, moving slowly toward thier dreams, passing through the ash heaps of American society under the sightless eyes of Dr. T.

This one-sentence plot summary does nothing to relay the considerable issues of the book. We learn that Jay Gatsby has a strong sense of romance--he is a product of the American Dream, where everything is possible as long as anything can be bought. He becomes a product of reputation, a carefully cultivated fictional past, and ready money at a time when established order has suffered a severe jolt from early twentieth-century ennui and loss of faith. Fitzgerald's analysis of shifting societal proprieties remains relevant as we begin our new century, but Jay Gatsby's yearning for a pure, enduring love makes this book timeless. If THE GREAT GATSBY isn't the greatest American novel, it must be in the top ten. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough.	2001-05-25

Scott Fitzgerald, set in the year 1922, is a literary classic and I can well understand why.  A mere 205 pages, it's a book that has everything - story, theme, symbolism, moral drama and great characters.  No wonder it's stood the test of time.<br />The early 1920s was a very special time in American history.  The Great War was over, and it was a time of celebration.  Prohibition was the law of the land and bootleggers and gamblers were making fortunes as everybody partied with illegal booze and speculated in the stock market.  In retrospect, we readers know that it all came to a crashing end later, but that was after the book was published and so the book captures the era in its own time.<br />The narrator is Nick Carraway, a young man who, like Fitzgerald himself, was raised in the mid-west and is working in the stock market in New York City.  His own financial circumstances are modest but he rents a house in Long Island next door to the flamboyant and wealthy Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties and whose background is shrouded in mystery.  As a New Yorker myself I must say I cringed at his geography, but the rest of the book transcends these minor physical details.<br />Slowly, we learn of Jay Gatsby's obsessive love for the wealthy Daisy, now married to the snobbish Tom Buchanan who is having an affair with a garage owner's wife.  Nick is a friend of this cast of characters, participating in their lives but yet standing back and observing.  He's a man of his times as well as a person who understands human character and foibles.  How the story plays out is a complex drama filled with passion and tragedy and including elements worthy of Shakespeare or classic Greek theater.  This is more than just a good story.  It's an emotional ride in expensive cars to an era filled with people we can all identify with.<br />I give this book by highest recommendation.  It rises above a mere good read and dwells in the realm of great literature.	2001-05-17

Fitzgerald, in his classic novel about Nick Carraway, Jay Gatsby, and the American Dream, not only delivers a message with which every American can identify, but writes with such an amazing lyricallity that at times I simply had to stop reading to visualize the beautiful descriptions he gives in the novel.

I enjoyed reading material by a new author. Fitzgerald does an incredible job of bringing to life the settings of the book, and he uses such vivid and colorful words to describe them. There are times when the novel could become a bit confusing as far as the time element was concerned, but Fitzgerald would usually give subtle hints to allow you to estimate around what time it was.

I had heard about this book a long time ago and knew that it was supposed to be one of the great &quot;classics,&quot; but I hadn't ever actually gotten around to reading it.  Well, recently a friend of mine reccommended it to me, saying that it was the best book he had ever read...so I finally decided to read it.  After finishing it last night, I was left with one question, &quot;What was all the fuss about?&quot;  It's alright, I suppose, but why it's considered a classic I have no idea.  As a lover of history, I found it interesting as a commentary on the life and times of the 1920s, but at times I was left confused as to what was going on and found the plot line drab overall...There are some interesting ideas included, but they are very poorly developed.  Also, there are notes included in the book about how Fitzgerald was poor with geography and made a lot of errors that had to be revised later on.  If he couldn't even write a book on his own, why was it even published in the first place?  Bah!  I could take it or leave it, personally.	2001-04-09

It is narrated by the simple Nick Carraway and tells of the intricate lives of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan.  Fitzgerald creates a perfect mix of love, happiness, wealth, betrayal, and suspense.  Through the use of the characters and their love, the reader can picture the times of the roaring twenties.  From astonishingly gorgeous parties of the wealthy Jay Gatsby, to the simple beauty and innocence of Daisy, Fitzgerald convinces the reader to truly believe his writing.  He writes with a style that creates beautiful and sometimes frustrating images for the reader.  His descriptions utilize precise detail.  As one reads Fitzgerald's words slipping across the page, one can witness exactly what is being described.  Fitzgerald's techniques of using descriptions and detail prove helpful. Moving beyond style, the book pushes past the basic storyline and becomes very symbolic.  The characters, setting, and events that take place are all telling of the American dream in the twenties.  It depicts people who let wealth determine their lives.  It emphasizes how money and people's desire for money can stand in the way of true happiness.  The Great Gatsby is a well-written novel that creates a telling depiction of life in America in the 1920's.	2001-04-04

The first few chapters were rather descriptive and this was more of a hindrance to me than a help.  The story contains a lot of symbolism also.  Everything really has some deeper meaning.  But you can read it on a more &quot;surface&quot; level too, and just enjoy it as a tragic love story.  If you do decide to read it in a more in-depth manner, you will see Fitzgerald's story as one of the &quot;American Dream.&quot;  The characters are striving for money, love, success and guarantees.  They often try to be something on the outside that they really aren't on the inside.  The story is told from a rather minor character's point of view and this enables the reader to come to many of his or her own conclusions.  The narrator is also easily relatable.  The Great Gatsby is a well-written book that gives a strong sense of the author's values and beliefs, which are typical of his time.

I picked it up again, to-day, though, and realized the truth of the notion that one learns something new each time one returns to a book.  'The Great Gatsby' just is a novel that must be returned to periodically to appreciate it properly.<br />While the characters in the novel remain ultimately unknowable at their indefinite cores, Fitzgerald does a great job tying his characters to their historical setting.  The protagonist of the novel, to my mind, is Nick Carraway, the narrator.  The hero of his story, which frames the novel, is the legendary Jay Gatsby - a legend in his own mind.  Although Carraway's narration is often heavily biased and unreliable, what emerges are the stories of a set of aimless individuals, thrown together in the summer of 1922.  Daisy Buchanan is the pin that holds the novel together - by various means, she ties Nick to Jordan Baker, Tom Buchanan to Jay Gatsby, and Gatsby to the Wilsons.<br />The novel itself deals with the shallow hypocrisies of fashionable New York society life in the early 1920's.  It is almost as though Fitzgerald took the plot of Edith Wharton's 'The Age of Innocence' and updated it - in the process making the characters infinitely more detestable and depriving it of all hope.  Extramarital affairs rage on with only the thinnest of veils to disguise them, the nouveau-riche rise on the back of scandal and corruption, and interpersonal relationships rarely signify anything permanent that doesn't reek of conspiracy.  The novel's casual allusions to beginnings and histories often cause us to reflect on the novel's historical moment - when the American Dream and Benjamin Franklin's vision of the self-made man seem to coalesce in Jay Gatsby, a Franklinian who read too much Nietzsche.<br />No matter how you read it, 'The Great Gatsby' is worth re-reading.  M.J. Bruccoli's short, but informative preface, and C. Scribner III's afterword are included in this edition, and both set excellent contexts, literary, personal, and historical, for this classic of American literature.edition, and both set excellent contexts, literary, personal, and historical, for this classic of American literature.	2001-03-15

Scott Fitzgerald is a complicated tale comprised of many themes which are all linked together in a very clever fashion.  Nick Carraway is the title character, who is from Minnesota.  The setting is the 1920s, and Nick has just moved East, to Long Island.  His neighbor is man by the name Jay Gatsby, but as he later finds out, that name is false.  Although Nick lives in the West Egg, his friends live in the higher-class East Egg.  Daisy, his cousin, lives with her husband there.  Nick discovers that Tom, Daisy's husband, is cheating on her, with a woman across town, Myrtle.  Both Myrtle's husband and Daisy know nothing of the affair.  Nick meets Jordan Baker via Tom and Daisy, and they have an intimate relationship.  As the story progresses, more information is revealed about Gatsby, and how he knew Daisy from a long time ago.  In fact the sole reason that he moved to New York was to be near Daisy.  Gatsby's complex emotions are that of a man who obsesses with power and wealth.  His vision is to achieve power and wealth, which he has done illegally, and to achieve Daisy, who symbolizes power and wealth.  Tom finds out about Gatsby's affair with his wife and asserts himself; Daisy does go back with Tom.  While Daisy was driving home with Gatsby, she ran down and killed Myrtle, her husband's lover.  Gatsby took the rap for her, as he still loved her.  Myrtle's husband got word of who made him a widower and then tracked down Gatsby and shot him.  He also killed himself.  Nick tried to hold a funeral for Gatsby, but hardly anyone attended.  Thus, he realized that New York was no place for him and moved back to Minnesota.\<br />The most prevalent theme present in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is: \\"The grass isn't always greener on the other side.\\"  Nick moved to Long Island in hopes of getting rich.  However, he couldn't see past the mask of fame and fortune to the low level of morality.  In the end, he realized that he would rather live a simple, honest life than get tangled up in a web of deceit in New York.  This idea is enough to make anyone think, and so did I.  I have always thought it would be cool to live in an extravagant life in a big city.  Being from a rural Midwest town, such as Nick and Gatsby, I often ponder the opposite lifestyle.  However, like the characters in the book, I am not sure that I could sacrafice my morals an honesty just for a mansion, a BMW, and a yacht.  At first thought, I would say that, \\"yeah,\\" I could do without to get ahead, but after analyzing it, I bet I probably couldn't.  This type of situation involving \\"the American Dream,\\" really does depend on the strength of the person who is put into it.  In the case of Gatsby and Nick Carraway, they could not handle it.<br />When looking at the \\"The Great Gatsby\\" for the first time, the reader does not know that the title is actually quite ironic.  Gatsby was acutally the opposite of great.  He lied about his past to almost everyone he met, he changed his name, and he became a criminal just to get ahead.  This is not a person who is great.  Contradictorily, he was great in the eyes of the people who perceived him.  Even Nick, who knew the whole story, still had a feeling of respect and liking towards Gatsby after his death.  The ending was good in that it reflected the themes of the book.  It was fairly complex and complicated, but it did finalize the story.<br />I would recommend this book to more advanced readers.  It contains a heavier vocabulary, and the theme are presented somewhat abstractly, but the story is great.  \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a classic book, and no one has an excuse not to read it.  It really is an excellent story.than get tangled up in a web of deceit in New York.  This idea is enough to make anyone think, and so did I.

There were quite a few parts though at which I got confused.If I did not have to read this book for a novel project in my Language Arts class, I highly doubt whether or not I would have gotten past the first chapter. The first seventy pages of the book were filled with so many details and so much information that I kept getting confused. Luckily, one of my friends, the one who recommended the book to me, was always able to answer my questions and explain things to me in a manner that I could comprehend. I feel that the book does not really begin to pick up and make any sense till page eighty or so. After that point though, I feel that the plot really picked up and became more interesting. I am one who watches soap operas, so it was a little bit of a resemblence. For the most part, I do not think I would have finished this book had i not been forced too, but I am glad that I did,because it turned out to be a half decent book in the end.

It holds your interest because of the subject matter - love, betrayal.  Most of the characters aren't likeable, they are dislikeable.

It's really a writers' textbook that teaches by example how to extend, invent, and use language in new and effective ways. For it's a rare book that gets this amount of meaning into a sentence and it's a rare book that has the dimensions and extraordinary intensity of impression that its paragraphs carry. Scenes blaze with life and it all goes by so fast I always end up with the feeling that I have finished a short story not a book. In Gatsby Fitzgerald is more in command and control than he is in all his other novels put together including The Last Tycoon, Tender is the Night, The Beautiful and the Damned, and This Side of Paradise. Gatsby is a novel with few false moves, a simple story and a simple plot. One might say almost perfect in structural simplicity, but the meanings are complex creating the suggestion that there is more, much more, under the surface, which incidentally there is. Part of the subtext is brought out by rich symbolism. Who will ever forget the weird eyes of T.J. Eckleburg looking over the wasteland of ash and what that means? Who will ever forget the green light at the end of Daisy's dock and what that means? If you haven't read this classic of twentieth-century literature, please read it. If you have read it, you might profit by going back after you have matured some more and rereading.	2001-02-23

It takes place in the early 1900's. The main characters are Jay Gatsby, a very rich and handsome man, Daisy and Tom Buchanan, and Daisy's cousin Nick Carraway. This book is written for entertainment. It captures all the romance and glitter of the Jazz Age in its portrayal of a young man and his tragic search for love and success.  The theme of this novel is that Gatsby wants to get Daisy back as his true love. The problem is that Daisy is already married. Gatsby believes that once Daisy sees him again, she will fall back into love with him.  One day, Gatsby wants Nick to invite Daisy over to his house for tea. Nick said that he would do it, so he called Daisy and asked her to come over. When she got there, she started talking to Nick, then Gatsby appeared. Daisy hadn't seen him for a long time. They just starred into each others eyes. Finally, they started talking. This scene is a major event in the story because this is where Daisy starts to fall in love with Gatsby again.  The use of irony in this novel is repeated throughout the story. For example, if Gatsby is so much in love with Daisy, then why would he have even thought about leaving her in the first place. Then, if Daisy was so in love with Gatsby, why did she marry Tom and not wait for Gatsby to return to her.  A quote that is repeated in this novel is &quot;good morning, old sport.&quot; This quote is said to Nick by Gatsby. Gatsby never calls Nick by his real name. He always refers to him as &quot;old sport.&quot;  A person that likes love stories would like this novel. It keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to read more to find out what might happen to Gatsby and Daisy's love for each other.	2001-02-06

That is definitely a sign of a great, classic piece ofliterature. If a novel was written and full of adulation and honour, it would not be a good book, because human thinking seeks entertainment and the literal sense of words, therefore a book that is both loved and hated at the same time proves to be one which offends and intrigues audineces in such a vast, drastic way, that its  ablty to do this makes itself a masterpiece. The myriad themes in this novel are what sets it apart from all others. The rise and fall of the American Dream is portrayed in which we can all see the rise and fall of success in our lives and forces us to think whether we should proceed with our lives, living in superficiality and materialism as Daisy and Tom did. The passion and obsessive love that Gatsby hold for Daisy is unrecognizable today, and it brings a sort of mystery and wonderment of what it could be should it be refelcted at present. The Great Gatsby is based upon equality, socail discrimination and our human ideals. It revolves around what we perceive is important, happiness or materialism and while we go about careless of others and absorbed by ourselves, what are we trying to prove? God is in fact watching us and as we try to achieve success and beconme happy using guidelines other than those of reaching the genuine American Dream, we are doomed to failure. This book is touching.... read it... do not expect excitement... look for depth, meaning, symbolism and those lessons that could change your perspective of the world.	2001-01-25

Fitzgerald's style of writing ingrigued me from the beginning.  His exquisite use of figurative language had me fully engaged.  I never wanted to put the book down.  His characters had me enthralled throughout the whole novel, and I felt like I was watching the events happen, just as Nick was.<br />When I first was told I was going to read the Great Gatsby I wasn't that excited.  Although the 1920s were a fascinating time in our history, it didn't seem the book would be that great.  Once I read the first page, I was proven wrong.  There were many themes that taught me.  Instead of running away from the question &quot;What are the themes of this novel?&quot; (usually asked by English teachers), I wanted to know the answer and understand the novel more.<br />The symbolization in the novel was also great.  The green light across the bay represents the far away love Gatsby has for Daisy.  The clock falling represents the way that love has been lost and will never be retrieved; that too much time has passed.<br />All of the symbolization, the themes, and the distinct description throughout the novel make it a wonderful read.

Scott Fitzgerald.  \\"It is a shocking book,\\" wrote Walter Yust, \\"one that reveals incredible grossness, thoughtlessness, polite corruption, without leaving the reader with a sense of depression, without being insidiously provocative.\\"  The book is captivating; when the story becomes calm and relaxed, the words themselves remain thrilling as they impel the pages to keep turning.  Set in the 1920's, The Great Gatsby explores the life of the wealthy and hopeful  J. Gatsby as he pursues his love, Mrs. Daisy Buchanan.  Through the narrative of the gentle and level-headed Nick Carraway, we learn to love Gatsby and to loathe those who cause his downfall.  Money, love, selfishness, infidelity and misdirected passions are woven together to form a net that ensnares the larger part of the book's characters.  \\"Gatsby turned out all right in the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men\\" (pgs. 6,7).  Yet, through many understated, despicable acts, there is a light of goodness and hope: Gatsby's hope.  It is seen shining brighter than the great and twinkling lights of Gatsby's summer parties.  \\"It was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found before in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again\\" (pg. 6).  Fitzgerald magnifies the underlying ideas of the novel in each of Daisy's tears and every splashing drop from Gatsby's fountains.  When gathered together, the droplets reflect Fitzgerald's own life of money and misfortune as his own wife caused him heartache over an extra-marital affair. Furthermore, Fitzgerald  also battled against the troubles of living a lavish life without an incredibly stable income. As the story can be paralleled to Fitzgerald's own life - Gatsby can be paralleled to the ideals of America in the 1920's; a generous visionary with a goal and, also, hopeful enough to pursue his goal.  \\"Gatsby believed [in] the future that year by year recedes before us... So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past\\" (pg. 189).  As time went on, the world around Gatsby changed, and, outwardly, Gatsby changed right along with it.  But, inwardly, Gatsby longed for and strived to regain his past, just as so many people of the twenties were torn between the past and the present.  The Great Gatsby shows a hero like we have never seen before.  A hero who unconsciously battled against an evil force: corruption caused by money.  He also, consciously, fought for the sake of his heart as he tried to regain the love of his past.  Despite his valiant efforts on both battle fields, Gatsby is trampled over by the effects of the thoughtless, calloused actions of others.  With the book thus ending, Gatsby can still be called nothing short of heroic.n life - Gatsby can be paralleled to the ideals of America in the 1920's; a generous visionary with a goal and, also, hopeful enough to pursue his goal.  \\"Gatsby believed [in] the future that year by year recedes before us...

True, it's a fairly nice love story, but there have been many better love stories written. The characters all seemed very one-dimensional to me, and the story was fairly dull. It's not a *bad* novel, but I cannot fathom why on Earth the Modern Library would rank in #2 on their top 100 list. I wouldn't have put it in the top 100. Or the top 1000, for that matter.<br />If you want to read classic American lit, don't read the Great Gatsby - read Twain or Steinbeck or Salinger. Their worst books are probably better than this one.	2001-01-11

I was assigned F. Scott Fitzgerald's &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; in grade 11.  And after reading it over, I concluded that if Mr. Fitzgerald's personality was reflected in his characters, it is quite understandable that Zelda Fitzgerald ended up in an asylum (sp?).  That book was the poorest excuse for literature I ever had the displeasure of reading.  I did read it twice, but each time, I was disgusted with it.  The characters in the story were worthless wastes of human flesh.  Daisy was a ditz, Gatsby himself was a possessive stalker and everyone else didn't have enough brains to realize that they were all being used!!<br />Tom, Daisy's idiot husband, actually took Nick to meet Tom's mistress!  How much more stupid is that?  Yes, I'm sure everyone with a brain cell wants his wife's family to know he's having an affair.  And his mistress, well, all she wanted was to seem important, when everyone knew she wasn't.<br />Nick was used by everyone, but he did nothing about it.  Tom used him, Daisy used him and even Gatsby used him.  And all the while, he thought Gatsby was God.  He worshiped him.<br />I wrote my report on the novel and passed it into my professor.  I wish I still had a copy of it, because I would post it here.  Unfortuneatly, I do not.<br />In the end, I would recommend this book only to the person who likes to read about stupid people sleeping with each other just to seem important.  Or as a cure for insomnia (sp?).  I was greatly disgusted with this novel, but that's just my opinion.	2001-01-09

It is often read in English classes and sometimes read on one's own.  If you like novels from this time period, the 1920's, this book is one you must read.  But if you are like me and prefer modern novels, let me suggest not reading it.  The plot is quite simple, a man who has finally made his fortune is attempting to win back the love of his former conquest who married to her station while he was on duty in the army.  This man will do anything to impress his boyhood love and goes as far as moving close to her and living an extravagant life with many parties in the hopes she will come to one.  She avoids him, either wittingly or unwittingly, and he is forced to seek help from her cousin, a mutual acquaintance.  He ends up getting in the middle and it is all a big mess, but you will have to read the book to find out how it ends.  Fitzgerald shows the time period very well in the materialistic and secular sense.  The plot is very well thought out and the use of foreshadowing and symbolism is very evident as one reads.  It is a good book to read if you are interested in the time period or in romances of the bizarre sort.  Unfortunately, if neither of these things catch your eye, it isn't a great book to bother with.  It is tedious and slow reading.  If you prefer more action, or perhaps more of a mystery, let me suggest a modern book.  Or if you simply like to read in plainer language with a faster flow, read something else.  If you are planning on reading this for a class, read it.  It is educational in the sense that one learns a good deal about the 1920's and symbolism from it.  But otherwise, look elsewhere.	2001-01-09

You will feel the pain of long lost love, the shallowness of the urban-socialite community, and respect and admiration for an incredibly well written novel.

But crimony.  Read the thing.  I've read the thing.  I don't understand what the big deal is about.  This isn't good prose.  It's self-help.  It's also pretty insulting.  How agonizingly elementary does symbolism have to be before a reader realizes that the author has taken him for a fool?  Fitzgerald writes with all the subtlety of a locomotive.  He sounds like he's trying way too hard, and in the end, what was intended as verbal sweep and style reads as tackiness.  &quot;Gatsby&quot; is the work of a bad juggler--it would have been so much better if he'd tried fewer balls.  (If you want to see a man drop twenty metaphors on a page and actually get away with it, thanks to God-given writing genius, read Shakespeare or Robert Penn Warren's &quot;All the King's Men.&quot;)<br />What we have here is a book that for some strange reason has been ranked for all time with &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; &quot;The Sound and the Fury,&quot; and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot;  I think it's enough to acknowledge that Hemingway, Faulkner, and Steinbeck weren't the only American writers of their day--there was also a lightweight pretender named F.

Like most students I dreaded it (Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Steinbeck, what's the difference?)  This was one of the first books to open my eyes to use of almost perfect prose while telling a story of less than perfect people. It helped that I had an instructor who led us on a hunt for the symbols within the story. She expalined the use of the symbols whether they were conciously put there by the author or whether they are a manifestation of societal mores and structure.<br />The basic story line is that a poor boy falls in love with a rich  girl. The poor boy goes off to make his fortune, the rich girl marries someone else.  The poor boy comes back rich and finds the  unhappily married girl.  Chaos ensues.  At first he is one of the &quot;in&quot; crowd.  But Jay Gatsby still seems like the man trying to buy his way into high society.  His attempt to woo Daisy from her philandering husband ends in tragedy for one of the &quot;little people&quot; in the story.  As usual the old monied beautiful people are untouched by the petty problems of the rest of world, even if they are the cause.  The entire story wrapped in beautiful prose as if to emphasize that with the proper wrapping even the ugliest present can look beautiful.  The light of hope only blinks off once the contents are fully revealed.	2001-01-04

No, he wanted to be up there on the hill with the rich. What a cop out.<br />Scott Fitzgeralds said to Ernest Hemingway \\"the rich, you know they are different to you and I\\" Ernie replied \\"yes they've got more money\\" and I reckon just for once that old braggart Ernie had hit the nail on the head.<br />So what does Fiztgerald do, he has his hero Gatsby mysteriously get some money but no that is not enough because he is not part of society and he can only look at his long lost loves window over the water.

Difficult to understand because it was written in the language of the times, say others.  It is neither.  I borrowed this book because it was supposed to be a classic.  Instead I found it was lacking in sympathetic characters, focus, meaning (aside from the very obvious, played-to-death 'everything is superficial' theme), and thoroughly unabsorbing.  From the moment it started out, it rang false. It begins with the narrator (Nick Carraway; even his &gt;name&lt; is mediocre) giving the reader a lot of pointless information.  Do we need to know that he looks like a painting of his great-uncle?  He goes over in very abstract terms, what he got out of the experience that this book is about, which would have been infinitely more meaningful toward the end.  I'm sorry that I have not read any of Fitgerald's other works - I hear &quot;Tender is the Night&quot; is supposedly better - but that leaves my opinion unclouded by prejudice.  This book is amateurish, meek, and clumsy.  Where is the elegant prose that other reviews go on about?  The most I can say about this book is that it ends correctly, though somewhat predictably.  For marginally better books on the same era, try PG Wodehouse's Jeeves or Blandings Castle series.  They may not be quite as serious, but that can be a good thing.	2000-12-25

Conversely, this must mean that &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is second only to Shakespeare.  How sad.  (He sounds like the Village Voice when it berated the movie &quot;Arthur&quot; for being a comedy about rich people.)  The trouble with narrow schools of criticism is that they cease to be about the text and focus instead on their own dogmatic (or phlegmatic) view of the world.  I suggest you just read the novel and make up your own mind.  Bathe in Fitzgerald's descriptions (especially Nick's first sight of Daisy in the wind-blown room), the gradual unveiling of the truth about Gatsby, and the suspense and heartbreak of the last few chapters.

I have no sympathy for Jay Gatsby and in my opinion all the characters in this book are arrogant, rich stuck up snobs, who have nothing better to do than be caught up in the cruel pettiness of their own lives.<br />Perhaps I am giving my review of this book too much of a Marxist slant, it is possible that someone else may become more emotionally involved in this novel than I did.

Scott Fitzgerald. When I finally had time to read it, I wasn't disappointed. The Great Gatsby, written in 1925, is a fictional tale that takes place during the American Jazz Age. The story is set in the eastern U.S. and follows the journey of a young man named Nick.  The book trails Nick from his home in the West to his new life in West Egg, New York. Nick becomes involved in the social scene is West Egg, which is mainly centered on the weekly extravagant parties thrown by the incredibly wealthy and strangely mysterious Jay Gatsby. As the book progresses, Gatsby's past is slowly unraveled. Nick witnesses Gatsby's gradual admittance of his significant secret. He discovers that Gatsby is deeply in love with Daisy Buchanan, a beautiful socialite, trapped in a miserable marriage to an unfaithful husband.  Though Nick does not want to be involved in any way with the illicit love affair between Daisy and Gatsby, he is gradually takes a larger part in Gatsby and Daisy's dangerous romance. When Jay and Daisy decide to declare their love to one another, it leaves Gatsby in an unforgettable and risky situation that changes the lives of all involved.  The Great Gatsby was one of the most interesting books that I have ever read.  It included a beautiful love story, danger, suspense, tales of true devotion and friendship, and a wonderful, thought-provoking commentary on the society in post-World War I America, a time of excess and confusion. I have learned several lessons from the novel, whether they are about loyalty or remaining true to oneself. I would recommend this book to anyone above the age of thirteen because of some parts of the novel that might be difficult to grasp. The Great Gatsby is a truly wonderful book, and sure to be enjoyed by many for many years to come.	2000-12-04

Fitzgerald has written out prose that intertwine so many elements, the heirarchy of American society, love, aspiration to the American Dream, the sign of the times in the Roaring Twenties, friendship, paradise, and paradise lost, yet it is all woven together so clearly, so vividly, so beautifully...<br />Fitzgerald's prose is lyrical, sharp and intense. It is the height of the use of the English language. The devices used to keep the reader interested are borrowed, yet brought to a level of perfection, a level that the originators of these devices could never fathom.<br />Comparing Fitzgerald's work to the work of more modern novelists, I see what the latter aspire to. I was supposed to read this in high school but neglected to. I wish this was the novel to have sparked my interest in the art of prose.<br />In the Esquire article &quot;Monologue to the Maestro: A High Seas Letter&quot; by Ernest Hemingway, Hemingway talks about what makes a great writer. He says that reading the classics is something a writer should do &quot;...so he knows what he has to beat.&quot; He goes on to list classics that he feels are essential for a writer to read. In a modern times, &quot;Gatsby&quot; is a novel a writer should read &quot;so he knows what he has to beat.&quot;<br />The Great Gatsby is not only a benchmark for writers, but a novel for anyone to read for its beautiful use of the English language, gripping story, and story structure. As I wish I could read Russian to fully understand the essence of classics like &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, I can imagine serious readers who cannot read English feeling the same way about a book like &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot;<br />I recommend this book to anyone who is into fine art, for this is fine art of storytelling and the English language of the twentieth century. Furthermore, I suggest,in order for this novel to be fully enjoyed, that it be read in one sitting.ully enjoyed, that it be read in one sitting.	2000-11-30

Scott Fitzgerald ranged between the two extremes of liking the book then hating its ending.  The characters of the book were excellently described, from Tom Buchanan's enormous size and temper to Jay Gatsby's strife for prestige to wealth.  The story line was well written, except for the disappointing ending.  My favorite parts were of the great parties Gatsby threw and of the confrontation between Gatsby, Nick, Tom, Jordan, and Daisy in the hotel room; this is where I was totally tuned in as a reader.  These incidents portrayed the intriguing, lavish lifestyle that Gatsby enjoyed and the turmoil of the lovers' quarrel.  The thing in this book that just irked me was how fickle some of the characters turned out to be, and how easily swayed by their emotions. This really upset me, but what also bothered me was how Nick appeared spineless in the face of defending his friend.  Yet, these two dislikes do not add up to my hatred for the ending.  It left me disappointed in all of the characters and mad at the senselessness.  Even though, it was a good book overall.	2000-11-27

Yet the very experiences of his own become the theme of the book.  Nick, as a narrator, becomes significant in the thematic content.<br />Like many American novels in the same time period, THE GREAT GATSBY relies heavily on variety of symbols.  A symbol may function on several levels at once.  A symbol may represent an idea but also function as an idea throught the book.<br />One of the central idea that stands out and persists throughout the other novel is wealth.  Fitzgerald's persoanl life has contributed a greal deal to this idea of wealth.  In fact, his own life has more direct pertinence to his work than the lives of most writers.  The idea of wealth ocuupies a great deal and achieves a central role in the novel, as well as Fitzgerald's life.<br />Nick Carraway is able to see the self-destructive nature of fascination of wealth.  Maybe this is the message Fitzgerald wants to get across as he was deeply possessed by such fasination of materialism.	2000-11-24

During this story Gatsby follows his dream of getting Daisy back at any cost......even death of other people or himself as well.  Fitzgerald's strong values and beliefs were clearly presented which is a very entertaining style to read.  One thing I would criticise about this book is that the action of the story does not start until the fourth chapter, which discouraged my interest greatly.	2000-11-20

I would recommend this book to a specific group of people, because I believe that this book is not one that any person can read, because other individual's help is required to understand some parts. The book in my opinion was not entertaining in its first parts, when the characters are introduced and you begin to know each one of the lives of the different main characters.  When I could overtake half of it, my opinion towards the book started changing, because as the different events started to be introduced in the story, I began to involve myself more and more with the book.  Finally, when I reached the end, which from my point of view, is the most interesting part, I realised that it was a good book to read, but if I had the opportunity of reading it again, I would not do so.	2000-11-13

I really found it disappointing, for before reading this book I thought it would be interesting enough to capture my attention. This did not happen because those parts that would be considered the climax were not interesting (I found theses scenes dull and predictable).<br />Furthermore, I would like to say that most characters were not good at all.  I consider that some scenes, such as the one in which Daisy starts crying on  Gatsby´s shirts, are meaningless (perhaps because  what these parts want to symbolise, is not clear enough).  Moreover, I think that the story should not have been told in the first person by Nick, because by doing this Fitzgerald gave no possibility of including an account of the emotional relationship between Gatsby and Daisy from the time of the reunion to the catastrophe.<br />Finally, I would like to make clear that my opinion should not be taken as an insult towards Fitzgerald, who is a worldwide well-known writer, but as a personal comment in which I highlight what for me was wrong in the setting and development of \\"The Great Gatsby\\".	2000-11-13

I really enjoyed it and would like to recommend it to anyone who has a dream. The book is very clear and I only had a minor problem with the vocabulary which I found a bit difficult. Apart from that, on the one hand I was very happy to finish reading the book because it was extremely interesting but, on the other hand, I was sad because I had got involved myself with the characters and now I \\"miss\\" them.  It is important to know what the book is about in order to know why everyone admires its beauty. Fitzgerald wrote this novel as an example of the famous \\"American Dream\\". The story is based on a man who has devoted his life to the fulfillment of his platonic conception of himself. Jay Gatsby had chosen Daisy to incarnate this dream, but nothing would be easy for him.  The book's plot is well developed and suspense is kept till the last chapter. Moreover, many of you will feel identified with one of the characters and will not regret at all having read \\"The Great Gatsby\\".	2000-11-13

In my opinion \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is not an outstanding novel but it is quite good. I would recommend  this book for teenagers from 15 to 23 years old. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of the best love stories I have ever read and it is also a suspense story. On the one hand we are encountered with the love between Gatsby and Daisy, which grows bigger as the story develops, and on the other hand we have Gatsby's secret; nobody really knows Gatsby but everybody enjoys his big parties. Once we find out why he organised them and why he  surrounded himself with glitter, we admire him for his total dedication to his dream and for his endless search of love. Gatsby is a character with which we can easily identify because he is the embodiment of the American dream. in my  opinion, the book shows how this dream will never came true because of careless and cruel people such as Tom Daisy and Jordan, who are materialistic. I would rate it with three stars because although the story is interesting the book is written in a very complex way. The only thing I would criticise about it is that the action does not start until the fourth chapter, which  encouraged my reading.	2000-11-13

The success of this book does not simply lie in the fact that this author portrays the ideals of his time so well; applicable to today's society, it is the destruction of them as seen through the profound observations of the narrator that places this book among the elite.  The impact of these observations is what highlights Fitzgerald's impressive skill.  Not only does this author portray the historical pressures of society at the time, but he also interweaves advice through a simple plotline of love and greed.  This advice does not act to accentuate the story, but to create it; it is the questioning of the push for the perfect life and what we define it as that allows this novel to stand alone.  Read not for the sake of entertainment and strictly for the qualities of a good novel; look beyond the obvious into the social implications stated through the author's voice.  Only then, will this novel become what it was intended to be - a helpful tool written to assist us in broadening our views on society.  It allows us to continue to &quot;beat on, boats against the current,&quot; but with more knowledge than ever before.	2000-11-10

In the novel, Nick Carraway tells the story of his neighbor Jay Gatsby, a handsome bachelor who has amassed a fortune as a racketeer in order to build a Long Island mansion and give fabulous parties that he hopes will enable him to win back the love of the married Daisy Buchanan.<br />This book is a story of the American dream and Fitzgerald's basic belief that the dream has been degraded and corrupted until it almost seems to be foolish to aspire to that dream because it would just make one morally derelict. The lower orders that aspire to infinite and instant wealth are trying to adopt the values and standards of the established rich class, which are already corrupt. Fitzgerald felt that American idealism had been corrupted by embracing materialism as its means. Fitzgerald believed that we are in a vicious circle, that the established wealth is corrupt but the new rich adopt to the same ideals as the old rich and they become corrupt and join the established wealth and then the new group aspires to the established rich values and so on.<br />A strong statement of the author's personal values and beliefs, it is also a highly entertaining read.	2000-10-18

The enigmatic bachelor Gatsby gives huge all night parties at his mansion, dancing, drugs and sex are the season's most fashionable events. His fascinated neighbour, the book's narrator Nick Carraway, makes friends with him and begins unravelling the secrets of his personality. Carraway's intervention triggers revelations about Gatsby's criminal past, and a love afair between Gatsby and the wife of the wealthy Tom Buchanan; these in turn leads to further tragedy. At the end of the book Carraway sits alone outside Gatsby's mansion, reflecting on the emptiness of the lives he has just described. Certainly this novel stands alone in range and depth. You will want to read this book again just for the beautiful flow of Fitzgerald's prose.	2000-10-14

I read this book for a class of mine and totally fell in love with Fitzgerald's writing style. It is one that you can identify with so easily, as if you know exactly what he is talking about. The love story is somewhat common, that of a tragic nature, yet one truly feels completely saddened for young Gatsby at the end. Fitzgerald not only makes the reader eager to read, but you will find yourself eagerly grabbing for his other novels, all of which are equally superb.	2000-10-09

I thought the theme and underlying message (i.e., image &amp; materialsm don't equate happiness) was good.  When reading the one review where the guy says he identifies w/Gatsby, I chuckled, thinking, 'Must be a doctor or lawyer' and wouldn't you know, he was a lawyer.  What is it about these 2 professions?  Maybe they're in their occupations for the shallow prestige and phony status, similiar to what Fitzgerald talked about.  Enough of my ranting.

Even when &quot;forced&quot; to read it in high school, I loved it.  I've read it for probably the tenth time recently and I can say that every single time it's better than I remembered it.  I was prompted by the character is Haruki Murakami's book Norwegian Wood who carries it with him and reads it to cheer him up.  This narrator calls it the most perfect book ever written and says that you cannot find a page that's not perfect. I have to agree -- it's not just the plot, it's the beautiful writing and incredible characters and scenes that stay with you years later.  Even after years, who can forget the scene when Gatsby shows Nick all his custom made shirts, or Nick describes his first vision of Daisy by comparing her posture to someone balancing something on his/her chin, or any of Gatsby's parties, or the broken nose -- you get the idea.  For some reason, rereading this book reminds me of picking up a relationshp with an old friend.  It's so very comforting to read the best prose you can find in English and find that certain passages are almost committed to memory.  Don't miss out on this one.  If you didn't like it in high school, try it again when your reading tastes mature.	2000-10-03

The narrator of the story is Nick Carraway, a young man quietly carving out a living selling bonds and securities.  Nick moves into a meager house located next door to the great Gatsby mansion.  Nick is in awe of the fabulous Gatsby home.  Lavish parties are the norm there, with prominent guests coming and going, and music and laughter filling the Long Island air.  Jay Gatsby, however, is a mystery to Nick.<br />Soon Nick receives an invitation from Gatsby himself to attend one of his parties.  People are filled with uncertainty about Jay Gatsby.  How did he become so wealthy?  Where was he from?  Who was he?  Gossip stirred and rumors abounded.<br />Although they were not from the same social circle, Jay Gatsby took an immediate liking to Nick Carraway and befriended him.  But he had other motives too.  Nick was cousin to the beautiful married Daisy Buchanan, a woman who Gatsby once loved and lost.  Through Nick, Gatsby desperately tries to rekindle the romance with Daisy.  At one point Nick tells Gatsby that the past cannot be repeated.  Gatsby's reply is, &quot;Can't repeat the past?  Why of course you can!&quot;<br />The characters in this book (with the exception of Nick) all share one common thread.  They are striving for more of everything...love, success, money, notoriety, and a sense of self-worth.  Yet they chase after their ambitions blindly.  Feelings are hurt, friendships are destroyed, and tragic events unfold.  What they thought would bring happiness only brings sorrow.<br />Fitzgerald's insight into social interactions is profound.  Through the voice and eyes of Nick, he helps the reader empathize with even the most loathsome characters.  The prose is beautiful and oftentimes heartwrenching.  Even after 75 years, the keen observations made by Fitzgerald (Nick) about people and society ring true today.  History changes, but the human condition holds steadfast.  Unforgettable...teadfast.  Unforgettable...	2000-10-02

What is there not to be able to say about The Great Gatsby, except that it was a fantastic book. When I first read it, it was for a class assignment, the next couple of times I read it, it was for pure and unadulterated pleasure. I'm not sure it's even legal to fall in love with a piece of literature that isn't a romance novel, nor a sonnet, nor words of love written to you, the way I fell in love with this literary masterpiece. Up until recently, I had forgotten how much of an impact the words within this piece had on my life. And not to say that Gatsby will be that awe-inspiring to everyone who is fortunate enough to pick up this book and begin to read it, but for me, I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. Fitzgerald conveys so many things in this book, it amazes me just how deep everything is...it's almost as if nothing is really what it appears on the surface, everything down to the ditch, and the billboard, and the &quot;chance&quot; meeting with Owl-Eyes...everything has a deeper meaning and extrodinary effect on the outcome of the book as well as the reader. To sum up my point of view of this book, I cannot praise it enough. It is definitely (in my eyes and library) one of the 5 greatest pieces of literature ever written. Falling somewhere between the Bible and perhaps The Richest Man in Babylon.	2000-09-28

The dream was embodied in the ideal of the  self-made man, just as it was embodied in Fitzgerald's own family by his  grandfather, P. F. McQuillan.<br />The Great Gatsby is a novel about what  happened to the American dream in the 1920s, a period when the old values  that gave substance to the dream had been corrupted by the vulgar pursuit  of wealth. The characters are Midwesterners who have come East in pursuit  of this new dream of money, fame, success, glamour, and excitement. Tom and  Daisy must have a huge house, a stable of polo ponies, and friends in  Europe. Gatsby must have his enormous mansion before he can feel confident  enough to try to win Daisy.<br />What Fitzgerald seems to be criticizing in  The Great Gatsby is not the American Dream itself but the corruption of the  American Dream. What was once--for Ben Franklin, for example, or Thomas  Jefferson--a belief in self-reliance and hard work has become what Nick  Carraway calls \\"...the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious  beauty.\\" The energy that might have gone into the pursuit of noble  goals has been channeled into the pursuit of power and pleasure, and a very  showy, but fundamentally empty form of success.	2000-08-20

There is so  much just below the surface of this book, you can easily read through it  and miss the depth.  But it is there, to be discovered under Nick's  watchful gaze.  You have Gatsby's fabricated fabulousness, a persona he's  created with his own self-serving mythology.  But there is so much he  hides, so much he wills Nick to discover.<br />You have Daisy's flightiness  and selfishness also hiding her true self because that's how it is for  women in her world--fake, flighty, frothy, lacking in substance.  She knows  the rules and she plays by them.  Jordan, Nick and others--their truth is  more obvious to us (i.e., Jordan is a cheat).  But everything is tragic  here, it is a fasade built on Eliot's famed &quot;wasteland.&quot;<br />I  can't stres this enough--this is a book that must be read, reread, and  analyzed countless times in order to understand what an extraordinary  achievement it is.

Widely regarded as a classic of modern literature, Fitzgerald  manages to capture something very American, very modern, very sublime and truly timeless in this novel; from the relatively simple narrative of  romantic yearnings, to the greedy ambitions, the lost loves, the complex  enchantments, and the underlying despair; this is a journey of life.<br /><br />This book for me is just too  much. Take the exchange between Nick and Gatsby about the 'past', and  following 'lost dreams';- \\"You can't repeat the past\\" (Nick).  \\"Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can\\" (Gastby). Can you?  I still don't know. How about the early quote of \\"the foul dust that  floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest  in the shortwinded elations and abortive sorrows of men\\". A dark  promise of things to come. And what about the exhileration and excitement  of the \\"returning trains of my youth\\", near the end, where Nick  decides to leave the 'big smoke' in New York, permanently tainted in his  mind, for the wide plains, the homely townships, and to escape from the  shallow, superficial and 'messy' lives of the Big Apple pretenders.<br /><br />I  won't spoil you with intricate details of the story, if you haven't read it and you want to understand modern literature and the modern western world, you have to read it. It is as simple as that.<br /><br />This book is a unique expose of the human spirit, the western dream, the love and despair of life; quintessentially 20th century and quintessentially beautiful.<br /><br />I wish I was seventeen and could read it again for the first time.	2000-08-01

It could have been written yesterday.  It is as perfect a novel as one is likely to find in American  literature; not a word is wrong or out of place.  The choice of a second  person narrator gives the reader wider and greater appreciation of the  characters and events.  At the center of it all, of course, is Jay Gatsby,  bootlegger, liar, party-giver, doomed romantic.  His love for Daisy  Buchanan, his &quot;incorruptible dream&quot;, is the only genuine emotion  felt by any of the characters (excepting narrator Nick Carroway, whose  loyalty to Gatsby is touching), all of whose superficiality is buried  beneath the glitter and gaiety of the Jazz Age, the endless parties, the  extramarital affairs, the endless-flowing booze, the accumulation of wealth  and things.<br />This edition of the book features critical commentary and  notes from Prof. Matthew Bruccoli, the world's foremost Fitzgerald scholar.	2000-07-17

The symbolism is amazing--a green light, the watchful eyes of an eye doctor's ad, the owl-eyed man, driving, Gatsby's library...  it is amazing how Fitzgerald pulls it all together.  And on top of it all,  Fitzgerald creates what is considered the perfect narrator in Nick Carraway  (give or take a letter).  All in all a great read!	2000-07-12
US	49178865	R28ZR64VXKB2BO	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Hollywood Syndrome	It's interesting to notice the one common thread in all of the negative reviews of Gatsby.  They all criticize the &quot;lack of action&quot;.  It's indicative of the American need for a definite ending, either good has  to win, or evil has to win, and the American reader must always be told  exactly what is happening in clear omniscient narrative.<br />It's the same  with movies.  American movies are so packed with effects and plot, there is  hardly any room for the viewer to make his own assessment of the nature of  the characters.  Notice that foreign/Independent American films concentrate  on the CHARACTERS, whereas Hollywood studio films concentrate on the PLOT  (and usually a few explosions thrown in and some gratuitious sex  too).<br />The beauty of this book, as with Fitzgerald's other works, as with  Faulkner's works, as with Hemingway's works, lies in the development of the  characters... complexity to the point that each reader takes something  slightly different from the book, as each reader has had different  experiences.	2000-07-11

It's short and simple, beautifully descriptive and carries within it the weight of great devotion and tragedy.  It's a book one would call a work of art.  I would read this for a taste of the  fabulous lifestyle of the rich, decadent and charming in New York at the  height of the Roaring 20s.  Also, for Gatsby's utter devotion to a lost  dream, the depth and the consequence of such a devotion.<br />If anything, I  felt the characters of Nick Carraway (narrator) and Jordan Baker weren't  built up enough.  Fitzgerald's method of description wasn't too much to my  taste either.  It was rather amusing when at one point, within the same  conversation, he uses &quot;inquired Jordan humorously ... said Jordan  helpfully ... snorted Tom contemptuously ... demanded Jordan crossly&quot;.	2000-07-07

I don't really think it deserves such high  praise.  Although it is a penetrating look at 20's life- in all its excess-  the book falls short on plot and substance.  Sure there are greater  meanings (don't forget that green light) but reading it is not the pleasure  it could be for me.  Perhaps I feel this way because I find that much of  the writing, especially the dialogue, is still very much ingrained in  1920's culture.  Thus, I find it hard to see how it is so timeless in the  minds of so many people.  So, I personally would give 3 stars but its  &quot;greatness&quot; has got to be 5.

Fitzgerald's writing style is incredibly evocative - stirring vivid images  in your mind of the mansions of East Egg, of the complex individuals that  lived there and how they interacted. Each person presents one face to the  world, while hiding a wealth of fears and desires. The scene where a car  looses a wheel is one of my favorites - the witty way Fitzgerald turns  words and plays with the individuals is just fantastic. <br />This is  definitely not a book to read 'on assignment', forced to hunt for meaning.  It's a book to read in your 20s or beyond, when you see the way old loves  can still call to you, when temptation strikes sometime to try to turn back  the clock. But of course, you can't, as Fitzgerald demonstrates with such a  wonderful style. There were so many scenes in this book that stood out as  stellar, that sparkled in our minds.<br />I think it's hard for a younger  person to identify with some of the themes in here, just as it's probably  hard for an older person to truly remember what it's like to be a teenager.  It's the kind of book that, if you've lived through love and loss, battled  years to achieve something you realize later wasn't worth it, you finish a  passage and say ... &quot;Yes. That is it exactly.&quot;	2000-06-18

This frequently is not the case, as everyone's idea of a classic is different. However, in the case of  &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, I would state that this book should be read  by all.<br />It tells the seperate stories of a number of people, but its  focal point is the hidden love Jay Gatsby holds for Dasiy Buchanan -  married, elegant and charismatic. As Gatsby pursues shady deals and his  doomed obsession with Daisy, F. Scott Fitzgerald distills the essence of  the Jazz Age and the empty heart of the American Dream. The novel is  tragic, yet witty, with people and stories that tend to linger in the  readers mind long after the book has been put down.<br />Wonderful.	2000-06-16

I  found myself questioning myself &quot;Why are you continuing to read about  these fatuous individuals?  Do you really care what happens to them?&quot;  But I couldn't put the book down. I felt I was right there, actually  participating in the storied 1920's decade, albeit a certain slice of that  famous decade (which many liken to the 1990's).

The book is flawless.  His excellence comes in his subtle use of characters, the &quot;twists&quot; in the story, and the slow, teasing unravelling of the  &quot;real&quot; story.<br />We don't meet Gatsby right away.  We are given  hints, gossip and a vision or two.  Yet Gatsby, while not the narrator of  the story (as is Nick Carraway), is the main character.  This is Gatsby's  story, as told through his neighbor, Nick Carraway.  Even when we do meet  Gatsby, we, along with Carraway and the inhabitants of West Egg, are made  aware of the fact that we still do not fully know who he is, where he comes  from or very much about the man.  This subtle characterization illustrates  Fitzgerald's genius.<br />There are a handful of moments in The Great Gatsby  when the reader drops the book down and says, &quot;Ohmygosh!&quot;.  Fitzgerald doesn't make this book flat and predictable, but instead takes  some interesting turns.  One such turn occurs when Tom Buchanan gets  confrontational with Gatsby, and Gatsby, the polished gentleman, opens  right up and speaks the truth as he sees it -- giving a shocking  revelation.<br />We wade into The Great Gatsby not knowing what lurks in the  murky waters.  Is this a story about a mysterious man with a dark past?  Oh--  okay, this is a love story!...No, wait...this is a story about  life...  It is not until the last word is read, the book is closed and set  down, that the reader truly &quot;gets&quot; The Great Gatsby.	2000-05-20

After deciding to go back and read some of the classics I fell upon &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. The problem I have with this book is it leaves to much up in the air and you  want to know more. You get a feeling for the 20's but not much since this  is such a short novel and very little is written describing the 1920's  parties and events. The people seem interesting at first but you never  learn anything of value about them and why they are in their current  condition. After reading 1984 and Slaughter House 5 I was enthralled by  their charters and their situation but that just didn't happen here. Maybe  Fitzgerald is showing how shallow the 20's era and people are bye making  everything so empty and non-descriptive but that doesn't make for great  reading by my standard.	2000-05-12

However, the book  had already gone to press and it was too late to change the title at that  point.  The reason I mention this is that I believe Nick Carraway is  actually the most interesting and compelling character in the novel,  contrary to popular belief.  Fitzgerald set a standard for narration with  this novel - a larger-than-life character seen from the less-biased view of  a narrator who is eventually drawn into the novel's plot (as seen in  &quot;All the King's Men&quot; and &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot;,and even the  film &quot;Wall Street&quot; among others).  By the end of the novel, the  reader comes away with a compelling and solid portrait of the Midwesterner,  Nick Carraway (note, carraway seeds are in rye bread, a Midwestern  association), who goes East, finds it &quot;morally bankrupt&quot;, and  eventually returns to his roots.  The novel is about the American Dream in  general, and it is incredibly ironic to call Gatsby &quot;great&quot;, as  he is shown to be a slave to love and ambition, whereas Nick is a much  stronger man in the end.  Nick is the only one who changes throughout the  course of the novel, and therefore while he is not as outwardly flashy as  Gatsby, he is the one who keeps the reader's interest in the end, as he  comes to the same conclusions that we hope we would come to in a similar  situation.	2000-05-08

That woman, Daisy, is concerned only with the material world and  represents themes of the decaying moral standards of the 1920s.  By the end  of the novel, Fitzgerald has made apparent the unattainableness of the past  as well as the falsity of the American Dream.	2000-05-07

In his work Fitzgerald has created a picture that summarizes an  entire decade.  The character Daisy also represents the pressures put on  women during that time period.  This book is excellent for anyone  fascinated with the 20's as it transports you to Gatsby's time and for all  of you hopeless romantics out there.	2000-05-05

Through Nick's eyes the reader learns of Gatsby, Daisy and Daisy's husband Tom.  Gatsby is a veteran who has horded  much wealth through corrupt means. In the beginning of the story, the  reader knows very little of Gatsby or his past.  The conflict is apparent  in Gatsby's utter love for Daisy.  The plot centers around this conflict  and much happens because of it.<br /> The theme of this story is that  money can't buy happiness; therefore the search for happiness should be of  one's own accord.  This theme is brought out by the characterization the  author uses in the story.  For example, through the first quarter of the  book the reader learns about Gatsby from rumors and gossip.  The  characterization brings out the tone of suspicion and nerviousness, leaving  the reader to guess the next step of the plot for themselves.  Through and  through &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a classic book with very effective  literary techniques and a universal theme.	2000-05-04

But the only thing that he wants is his past love Daisy. Daisy is now unhappily married to Tom Buchanan, who is also  very wealthy. Daisy is caught between her true love Gatsby and her husband  Tom. Gatsby's quest to capture the love of his one and only Daisy leads to  heartbreak and conception.<br /> Fitzgerald does an excellent job in  portraying the mood of the roaring twenties. Gatsby's parties are described  very well and all the events show this time period. Fitzgerald also shows  the lifestyles and the characteristics of the time period of all three  classes of society. The three classes shown where Gatsby and the Buchanans  as the upper class, Nick Carraway as the middle class, and The Wilson's of  Asheville as the lower class. The second thing that Fitzgerald does well is  capturing the reader's attention. The character Jay Gatsby is a very  handsome and rich and is left very mysterious by Fitzgerald. This mystery  of such a character draws the reader into the book. Later in the novel the  reader attention is obtained by tragic and unpredictable events. One part  where the author may not have succeeded in his purpose was showing how  Gatsby obtained the &quot;American Dream&quot;. The novel talks about how  Gatsby is so successful, yet Fitzgerald never even mentions directly what  he does for a living. Overall Fitzgerald is successful in portraying not  only the characteristics and lifestyles of the time but also turning it  into a popular novel that is very interesting.	2000-05-03

Scott Fitzgerald, is a well written novel that explores the everyday life of a town through the eyes of an outsider.  This onlooker sees not only the town, but every detail that paints a picture,  for the reader, of the town and its people.  The authors use of imagery is  very good, because he uses great detail to from the smallest item to the  largest disaster.  He describes, in one part, a simple billboard for T.J.  Eckelburg's, who is an eye doctor.  Fitzgerald describes the billboard  which has a great big pair of glasses with two eyes starring through, yet  this is not only a good ad, but it also describes the town by a simple  picture.  These eyes describe, that everybody is watching everybody, and  all is seen sooner or later.  Through his use of imagery, a metaphor is  produced, and the glasses and eyes are those of mainly Nick who sees all,  but also of the townspeople, who sooner or later see all that has happened.  This imagery also is used at the end of the book when the town is described  as the fire is burning it down. This helps paint a mental picture of the  destruction the fire did to all the buildings and the few people still  alive in the town.  All in all this book was a very good book because of  its use of imagery which placed the reader with in the story making that  much more exciting.	2000-05-03

When I had a chance to see the story as a whole  that the emotions began to set in. Truly wonderful writing that is top  notch among any of the writers I have read. His reading does not  &quot;talk&quot; over you, but rather with you. Which is what makes the  story attractive. Although many people complain about being forced to read  it for school, its probably best read on your own time without  constrictions.

Much to my disappointment I found nothing more than an a superficial plot based mostly on descriptions  of the 1920's. Fitzgerald succesfully caught the spirit of the 20's so if  you're looking to get a feel for that era this would be a good book to  read, on the other hand if you're looking for a grand literary work, there  is a lot more out there. Fitzgerald's characters are shallow and  unidentifiable, his plot weak and slow-moving to an extent which becomes  tiresome even though the book is relatively short. Fitzgerald is not an  author but rather a social historian, something apparent in other of his  works, such as &quot;Bernice bobs her hair&quot;. So if it's insight on the  20's you want, this should be great, but it falls short of anything else  it's reputation demands.	2000-04-30

I did not go to school in America, and read this book about a year ago, but for whatever reason, I ended up here, and have to write some kind of upbeat report on the Great Gatsby to try to balance the tide against all  the revisionist critics.<br />The reason I mention school is that it would  appear a lot of people have had traumatising experiences with classics  being thrust down their throats. I do not know if it is a case of bad  teacher, bad student, or simple incompatibility, but I would say this - if  you really did not enjoy a book, DON'T TELL OTHER PEOPLE NOT TO READ IT!  One of the most disappointing experiences of my literary career (if you can  call it that) was when I recommended my girlfriend to read Catch-22, and  had it metaphorically hurled in my face after &quot;3 chapters&quot;.  That's her right, but the negative reaction will always hurt more people  than help them, whereas vice-versa for the positive one...especially since  I have noticed that works that someone has always been attached to can  still be reduced for them in the face of violent enough criticism. If you  had a bad experience at school, it's fair enough to be upset about it...but  this truly is a great book which should only have great things written  about it.<br />Both of Catch-22 and the Great Gatsby have humour and grace,  and not a little hidden dignity. But Gatsby is clearly the superior work  for the symbolists and amateur students of literature. It is a period  novel, but like all the greatest of these kinds of works of fiction, it  reaches far beyond its time. The writing is timeless, and the mystery makes  for a latter day Much Ado About Nothing - perhaps it is boring on the  surface, but boring like tectonic plates: fundamental, dealing in huge  issues in subtle and slow movements. Yet it is not even a particularly long  novel - several hours of great entertainment and effort well expended.<br />I  hate having to write prescriptively, but sometimes you can't help reacting,  you know?ing,  you know?	2000-04-28

I enjoyed it very much, and I see how it defined the \\"Jazz Age\\" so well, but I tend to think this book is overrated.  It is listed as the 2nd best novel of the century according to the Modern Library's List of the Top 100 Books of the Century.  The book  has many good points, but I do believe there are many better books out  there.  I like the characters and how the story is told from the eyes of a  bystander to the happenings, Nick Carraway.  I also admire Fitzgerald's way  with words and his ability to tell a story.  The descriptions of Gatsby's  mansion and parties give a vivid picture of what the 1920's were really  like, and because of this, the book is known as the definitive novel of the  1920's.  The theme of the \\"death of the American Dream\\" cannot be  underrated, either;  this undoubtedly is a major reason why the book is  rated so high in booklists.  On the bad side, I believe the story takes way  to long to get going.  It only contains 197 pages and nine chapters;  the  first four chapters all contain exposition.  Once the action gets going,  the book is good, but overall, I believe this book, while definitely a  classic, is overrated.	2000-04-22

It's the type of book a person  can really sink their teeth into.  The plot and meaning isn't just laid out  for you, but nor does it take a rocket scientist to find.

While perfect reading for an english class, this book just doesn't have too much going for it for most contemporary readers.  Fitzgerald stuffed as  much symbolism as possible into such a short book, and gave us a pretty  good picture of &quot;the roaring twenties,&quot; but it was overall pretty  boring and pointless.  I think that this, like The Catcher in the Rye, is  one of those books where either you love it or you hate it.<br />The ending to  Gatsby was amazing, and really worked to fit the whole thing together, but  for me the book itself was just a dreadful waste of time to read.

As a teacher of American literature, I have read many of the American classics, and since to teach is to learn something twice, I've had to read them often and closely.  Without a doubt, The Great Gatsby is my favorite American novel to teach.  Fitzgerald's prose verges on the poetic.  The  thematic and symbolic issues in the book heighten the reader's enjoyment of  the story, but even the basic story is enough.  I simply love this book.

However, I've never come across anything that so captured the profound wonder and sadness of the human condition.  There are passages in The Great  Gatsby which took my breath away, passages so perfect I couldn't believe  that someone was capable of writing them.  Hunter S. Thompson once said  something to the effect that he couldn't imagine one word being added or  taken away from this novel.  Surely that's one of the highest compliments  one writer could give another (it also gave me a newfound respect for  Hunter S. Thompson, but that's beside the point...).  Like most of  Fitzgerald's work, The Great Gatsby holds up well as a period piece on  young America in the Jazz Age.  More importantly, it is a timeless metaphor  of mythical proportion.  The green light on Daisy's dock is the longing  that drives us all; our dreams dissolve in the moment of fulfillment,  leaving us with the bittersweet realization that it was only the dreams  themselves that gave our lives beauty and meaning.	2000-04-02

It is simply the most beautiful book you can come across. The prose is gorgeous and deceptively simple, all the more stunning for its simplicity, because it  almost makes you believe you could write a book like this yourself. You can  read the novel on many levels. Few readers can avoid finding symbolism.  Daisy is the untouchable American Dream, perhaps, and Gatsby is the  immigrant who, like all new Americans, throws himself fully into the idea  of America while ignoring or hiding his own and America's reality. The  opulence and decadence of 20s America is brilliantly conveyed, and there is  also a considerably amount of realistic description of the time. The Great  Gatsby more than any other book made me realise just how pervasive and  persuasive the idea of the American Dream is, and just how empty the  reality can often be.	2000-04-01

The most sophisticated, popular, extravagant man on West Egg Island. The host of lavish, extraordinary parties, sprawled across the gardens of his enormous house, filled with aristocrats, vibrant colors,  jazz music, laughter, and the tinklin of glasses. A personable young man if  there ever was one. A friend to all, and fond of calling them &quot;old  boy.&quot; And above all, an Oxford man. Or is he? For it seems one can  never fully trust Gatsby and the stories of his past. The occasional  uncertainty  d hesitancy in his voice, as well as frequent inquiries,  investigations, and juicy rumors, contradict the his words.  Jay Gatsby  is the hero of F. Scott Fiztgerald's classic, The Great Gatsby, an  captivating novel full of intertwining stories and characters, and the  revelation of the first connection is intriguing enough to leave the reader  begging for the next. A won rful story, The Great Gatsby is laced with  mystery, and spiced with a dash of romance.  The tale unfolds  itself in 1922, on the Long Island provinces of West and East Egg Island,  the latter being the more fashionable of the two, and the island where  Daisy and Tom Bucanan reside. Daisy is a sparkling young woman and adored  by all that meet er. She is sociable, polite, energetic, enthusiastic, and  positively delightful, complete with a voice resembling lilting music  notes.  But this bright girl isn't all she seems; even lovely Daisy has a  passionate secret. Her husband, Tom, is an athletic an, the epitome of  arrogance. His eyes are always described as &quot;flashing about  restlessly.&quot; The former football hero demands dominance over all,  especially over the women in his life; his wife, and his over-the-top,  full-figured mistress, Myrtle Wilson. t is only when he feels denied of  this control that he shows emotion. Across the bay, on the West Egg, lives  Daisy's cousin, and Tom's college friend, Nick Callaway, who also happens  to be Gatsby's neighbor (just some of the slew of  intertwining connec ons  between the characters). Nick is the narrator of the story, and does well  in presenting an objective view of the string of events that take place.  Perhaps this is because he lives by the rule to not criticize others.  However, he is incredibly percep ve, and whatever criticisms and opinions  he does take on become completely justified to the reader, biased or not.  Nick is forever changed by his encounters with Gatsby, but still remains  able to continue his normal life, leaving any stinging memories b ind.  Perhaps this can be attributed to Jordan Baker, who can be considered the  anchor of sanity, or the accomplice for the plot basis. Jordan, Daisy's  good friend, moves through the story to become Nick's love interest, but  also serves as the source of  e missing pieces of the story, the glue  between other characters, without being incredibly integral to the  connections themselves.  As said before, The Great Gatsby is a  wonderful whirl of mixing and mingling pasts and presents. It focuses  around Jay Gatsby and his quest to recapture the love he had and lost five  years ago; Daisy, who loves him in return. However, between elaborate  chemes and secret meetings, the two must conquer husbands, mistresses,  death, tragedy, and pass the test of true love and loyalty. And despite how  much readers come to wish them well, at times their happy fate is wholly  uncertain.  Through the tangled story of Gatsby and Daisy's romance,  and the web of characters and events that surround them, Fitzgerald makes  it painfully clear to his readers that people are interminably connected,  and the actions of one can start a chain that e ects the lives of many.  And, contrary to main-stream fictitious happiness, love does not always  prove to be pure and true, or prevail over all.  Although The Great  Gatsby eventually proves itself to be a simply engrossing novel, the  primary story line can be difficult to deeply fall into. The first  seventy-fivepages can seem dry and lagging, as they primarily consist of  explaining how Nick cam to live in West Egg, and retelling seemingly  unimportant encounters with several of the characters, probably simply a  method of presenting them to readers. However, with the introduction of Mr.  Wolfshiem, a shady character, as well as the conversation b ween Gatsby and  Nick that precedes that meeting, the plot thickens tremendously. It is with  these two events that the mysterious story and the intertwining pasts begin  to unfold themselves, and readers will find themselves immediately  entranced by the s uence of events to come.  The Great Gatsby, though  not entirely difficult, should also not be tackled by those who find  expressive language and metaphors troubling. However, once readers have  become aquatinted with Fitzgerald's writing, his exquisite use of language  and metapho will become apparent. They will find the lavish words find even  necessary to match the sophisticated nature of the characters. He makes  exceptional use of metaphor, best exemplified by his description of Daisy's  voice. It is praised time and time again, nd is said to retain the quality  of music, notes that will never be played again, the sound of tinkling  money, and glowing and singing noise, the sort that the ear follows up and  down. Jordan is also frequently said to &quot;balance objects on her  chin,&quot; def ing the way she holds herself. And just outside of New York  is an area where everything is apparently made from ashes, and the piercing  blue streams of sky are solely referred to as &quot;the eyes of Doctor T.J.  Eckleburg.&quot; These metaphors help to paint a wo erfully vivid picture,  making sounds and sights come alive, full with depth and meaning.five pages can seem dry and lagging, as they primarily consist of  explaining how Nick cam to live in West Egg, and retelling seemingly  unimportant encounters with several of the characters, probably simply a  method of presenting them to readers.

The reasons for this novel's greatness are unexplainable and somewhat mysterious to me. i.e., I have no idea why I  love it so much, but I do!  With this masterpiece, I believe that  Fitzgerald has captured some unknown and unpracticed form of writing that  is seldom equalled. With a style all his own, he took an ordinary, everyday  setting and plot, with your average &quot;next door&quot; characters, and  created something exceeding the extraordinary.  Nick, the narrator, has  a refreshing, honest way of letting the reader know exactly how Gatsby's  story played out, and at the same time bringing us into his own life.  I found myself sympathizing with Gatsby, and his love for Daisy, as I would  with a member of my own family, and even having feelings, not present in  the book, that a man in Gatsby's situation would likely have.

The reasons for this novel's greatness are unexplainable and somewhat mysterious to me. i.e., I have no idea why I  love it so much, but I do!      With this masterpiece, I believe that  Fitzgerald has captured some unknown and unpracticed form of writing that  is seldom equalled. With a style all his own, he took an ordinary, everyday  setting and plot, with your average &quot;next door&quot; characters, and  created something exceeding extraordinary.      Nick, the narrator, has a  refreshing, honest way of letting the reader know exactly how Gatsby's  story played out, at the same time bringing us, somewhat, into his own  life.      I found myself sympathizing with Gatsby, and his love for Daisy,  as I would with a member of my own family, and even having feelings that  weren't present in the book, but that a man in Gatsby's situation would  likely have.      It is easy to see, however, how one could misunderstand  the book, and have a low opinion of it. There are a number of time-line and  grammatical errors, but if it is read for what it is, it will be a  cherished classic forever.	2000-03-26

This novel is an extremly remarkable book that has so much to do with devotion and trying to attain a goal that any cheesy romance reader should love it.  Gatsby believed in the green light, and he knew that one day he  would have Daisy, and the symbolism precribing to this is wonderful!  However, it is not mush that you can read without thinking, otherwise it  would be a cheesy romance novel.

However, in the end, one feels sorry for these tragic characters who  represent not only the small group of people who they are, but everyone.

The tone of the  storytelling is fascinatingly whimsical and monumental at the same time. As  it satirizes the lifestyle of a group of free-wheeling upper class  twenty-somethings partying through a summer on Long Island in the early  1920's, the title character displays an innocent desperation that resonates  profoundly, indeed, on the meaning of the &quot;American dream&quot;.  My only major qualm involved some apparent contradictions regarding  this said character. At the outset Mr. Gatsby is referred to mysteriously  as a celebrated self-made man who few can get close to. When we do get  close to him, however, he suddenly becomes two-dimensional, a love-crazed  sap. I wished Fitzgerald had gone further to make the Gatsby we come to  know match up more with the far more complex character we have imagined.  However, this problem is minor. Among the many more numerous things to  admire, it stands out how Fitzgerald reaps benefits from using an the  unconventional narrative style perfectly appropriate only because of the  idiosyncrasies of the tale, a terrific example of content dictating form.  This is one &quot;classic&quot; you will not regret reading.	2000-03-15

It was a book that really kept me interestd in it with its exciting plot. Chasing dreams and lost loves, love affairs, lavish houses, and big parties  make the story exciting. The characters in this novel really draw you into  the story. Some are mysterious, some are cruel, some are kind, but they're  all interesting in their own way. Their obsession with wealth, chasing  after dreams and goals, and wanting to repeat the past gets the characters  into a big mess of problems.  Not only is it a very good story, but it is  also very well written. The book has deeper meanings to it and many  symbolisms that make you really get into what you are reading. You would  also enjoy this book if you like history because it demonstrates what life  was like in the 1920's.

It was the period of time which was known as the Gilded Age.  The Gilded Age could be used as a comparison to  a gilded vase. Things during this  time looked nice and perfect on the outside, while on the inside, things  were rotting, diminishing, and disintegrating.  The poor were becoming  poorer, while the rich were becoming richer.  The lives of the rich were  perfect, for they had nothing to worry about. It was a time of fun , games,  amusement, parties and women.  However all was not as good as it appeared  to be.  This time was filled with deceitful men and women; it was  the  time of prohibition, where the so-called drug stores sold about every kind  of liquor; it was a time when bribes ruled the way things were run; it was  a time when the World Series was fixed, and the profiteer was not found.  F. Scott Fitgerald's novel The Great Gatsby was written to show the lives  of society of both the newly rich, and the ones who inherited the wealth,  the ones that were born rich and stayed that way.  To show their inside  lives, and to depict the morality of these people, the author has used to  depict the themes of Gold Imagery of moral corruption, misplaced idealism,  and waste of potential in the lives of the fictional characters.	2000-03-02

It is also the finest novel of a very fine novelist. At a time when America was just beginning to realise that it was as susceptible to corruption, greed and  self-delusion as every other country on the planet, Fitzgerald wrote a book  that really does capture the moment a nation founded on ideals realises  that ideals are hard to live by.<br />Gatsby, the central anti-character, is  a mere shadow, a man who reinvents himself to win the heart of the girl he  think he loves.  The foundations of this infatuation and subsequent  reinvention are rotten and the result must be rotten too. Fitzgerald writes  beautifully, his words tinged with the sadness and quiet desperation that  flavours the whole novel, and his characters all seem to sense that their  lives are built on precarious ideas about success, happiness and love.<br />The Great Gatsby is a very honest and acute portrayal of a nation built  on the misbegotten assumption that you can be whoever you want to be, and  the consequences that that belief holds. More importantly it is a brilliant  and moving novel.	2000-02-22

Don't be bullied by William T. Vogt's review, though, read it for yourself and form your own opinion.  It is easy not to have any sympathy for  the characters because of faults such as greed, brutality, and arrogance.  But it is important that you look beyond those characteristics when  reading.  You must remember this is the 1920s, you must take into  consideration the background of each character and their motivations (every  scene is important), then you will understand them more and perhaps gain a  bit of sympathy if not like for the character.  Even the Great Gatsby  has his faults (don't be fooled by the title).  When reading the story, a  question that you should try to answer is if this is truly a love story or  the story of two people who think their in love (consider motivation and  character).  Another question to ask is why this is titled the Great  Gatsby.  Overall, this is an excellent commentary on 1920s life through  the eyes of Fitzgerald.	2000-02-19

Still,  the book is a work of art and displays a powerful message, that there is no  American Dream.

Before you embarrass yourself by knocking this book, please keep in mind that it was #2 on the 20th century fiction list  For those of you with your nose too deep in the  Grisham and King to see for yourself, let me point out a few things that  make this such a great book.First please note the economy of the words of  the storytelling and the lyrical language used by Fitzgerald. It is a novel  that tells a remarkable story without a single excess word. (S. King take  note---a book does not have to be 1000 pages---get an editor, Big Guy) Also  note the the cleverness of having the narration from Nick's point of view,  which adds a lot to the book because of the interplay between Nick and  Gatsby. Notice also how  Fitzgerald handles the timeless themes of money,  power and class, while telling a great story.  Even if you don't have  time to read the whole book, just read the last page. It's as good as  anything that has ever been written.Hope you enjoy it!	2000-02-15

What I meant by that statement was that I really must have missed a lot  when I read this book.  The reason I say that is because I'm an avid reader  of classic fiction (great literature from the past and the present), but I  just didn't understand why this is considered one of the masterpieces of  the 20th century. I chose to read this book in part because of its  &quot;greatness&quot; in the eyes of most reviewers.  But I found myself  150 pages into it and still waiting for something exciting to happen.  It  started out slow and just got slower.  But I just didn't get it.  The  ending was definitely surprising (I won't spoil it for whoever's reading  this), but somewhat of an anticlimax.<br />What was the most depressing to  me is that I have read many other great books that my friends have hated or  found utterly boring, and I have just loved them. Examples include  &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; &quot;Great  Expectations&quot; and &quot;Ethan Frome.&quot;  But I must have just  missed something major in this book.  I understand all the fuss about the  &quot;American Dream&quot; and how this is about the hollowness of rich  living, but it seems that in writing about that hollowness, the book  becomes hollow too.  Well, I'm only 16 and in the 10th grade, so that  definitely must be affecting something.  I guess I'll just leave it on my  bookshelf for a decade and go back and then we'll see where I am.

At that time I was amazed by the absolute simplicity, yet the brilliance, of this novel. Fitzgerald weaves a tale of two worlds into a compelling  story. There is much to discover in this book, much to compare. Since high  school I have read this novel at least a dozen more times and every time I  discover something new about it. I love the symbolism, it is so complex.  From the contrast between East Egg to West Egg, to the colors used  throughout, even to their names, the symbolism runs deep and true. Readers  who do not like this book have not given it a chance. They need to go back  and read it again, and pay attention to each and every detail.	1999-12-23

In the story his over use of meaningless description and verbosity indicates to the reader that he was trying too hard, and it  would be unrealistic to believe that this is a natural voice.  As an  example of writing style, I would expect it from someone in grade 6, with a  dictionary.  The sentences are basic and blunt, and interspersed with  horrendously redundant words that were probably put there to make the  author look smart, since they were more than 5 letters long of course!.  If  the author was alive, I would suggest he re-write the story without the  blatant attempt at Dickens verbosity and write it in an actual voice that  is readable and consistent.	1999-12-16

It was a little bit too political for my taste.  It seemed to take a long time forthings to happen.  The book is very descriptive when it comes to  setting.  Every little detail is described, along with thoughts and  feelings.  I had a hard time keeping my attention focused.  There was a lot  of confusion as to what was going on with who, and where.  Many parts of  the book I had to go back and re-read to get a full understanding of it.  The plot was decent, aimed more towards romantics than others.  At times it  seemed like one big soap.  Overall if you have to read it, it is readable,  if you are interested in life and the times, you'll like it, if your more  into action and adventure, you won't find it here, however it's not a total  waiste of time to read.  The Great Gatsby is a very drematic book, and it  holds a lot of truth.  Many of the things discussed in it reflect on even  todays society.	1999-12-10

The book takes you back to the post-World War I era where you find the narrator, Nick Carraway, a young midwesterner moved to New york to find a home in  West Egg working as a stock broker. The book journeys through Nick's  experiences in high society at West Egg. When the narrator first arrives to  West Egg he meets up with his cousin Daisy Buchannan, and her quite wealthy  husband Tom. Shortly after coming to New York he attends the party of Jay  Gatstby, a racketeer of the 1920's. He then becomes fast friends with  Gatsby, and finds himself everly more intwined in Gatsby's life.  Overall the book was very good. I enjoyed the many themes at hand,  especially those about high society during the 20's. Such as the idea that  Gatsby's own constant reinvention of himself is what inevitably destroys  him. A fantasic book for those who enjoy books about people.	1999-12-09

Those who haven't read much (and widely) are less likely to be able to discriminate between what is significant and what is not. But even  experience and an open mind do not guarantee a positive response to every  classic. I always wanted to like The Great Gatsby because it was one of  those books in the canon of accepted 'great' American books, but repeated  attempts at the book still leave me cold. I don't find anyone in the novel  to care for and if one doesn't care about the characters, one doesn't care  what happens to them.<br />'Gatsby', I think, is a minor book about very  shallow people. Fitzgerald's language seems, to me, overblown and almost,  at times, adolescent. I think it is significant as a document - a  historical marker for a period in American history - but not as a great  work of art, or of entertainment.	1999-12-07

It is a prime example of how greed can control and destroy lives.  It is told from Nick Carryway's (Gatsby's neighbor and Daisy's cousin)point of view.  He is more  of a spectator and observer than a part taker; this allows the reader to  get a better understanding of what is taking place.  It starts out slow and  confusing, but once all of the scandals, parties, and affairs begin to take  place there is no way the reader will be able to put it down.  Jay Gatsby  is a poor army man when he falls in love with Daisy, and she is a wealthy  woman that doesn't want to change her way of life when she falls in love  with him.  So she marries Tom Buchanan, a wealthy business man, that can  provide her with the life style she wants; to Daisy money is everything.  Gatsby decides to spend the rest of his life doing anything and everything  to become rich and the kind of man Daisy wants.  Once Gatsby and Daisy's  lives begin to entwine several years later there is nothing to stop  them--at least they think so.  Every character goes through trials and  heatache that cause the reader to get so emotionally involved that he feels  as though he is there being a part of everything taking place.  Everyone  should read this book because it contains mystery, love, death, and  betrayal; all of the concepts that make a novel truely interesting.	1999-12-01

Scott Fitzgerald once described Scott's talent as &quot;perfect and delicate as the wings of a butterfly.&quot; Yes, and that is what the lucky readers get  in The Great Gatsby:that wonderful, exhilerating, lyrical delicacy shadowed  by tragedy. I keep re-reading this book. It contains four or five of my  favorite scenes in all literature: the scene of Daisy on the couch in the  cottage with the breeze billowing her dress; the car accident at the party  when we glimpse this dancing shoe emerging from the car; the great passage  about &quot;those thrilling, returning trains of my youth&quot; and the  scene where they're getting drunk in the hotel. There has never been a  better, more subtly written drunk scene. Many have called Gatsby the best  American novel of the century. It's not hard to see why. It's got  everything in it. And it still stands, fresher than ever, as the great sad  story of the American Dream gone sour.	1999-11-27

Attempting to descibing this book is like trying to explain what makes something art. Every word is so carefully chosen, each element so  intricately interwound, you can't help but feel your also glimpsing into  Fitzgerald's very essence as you thumb the pages. While I'm not going to  review the plot, it's actually a simple story of love's power and the human  desire to be more than we are. The real strength is the way Fitzgerald  draws you into a world of the bored rich and let's you see every detail  through the eyes of the narrator. Gatsby himself is the essence of a tragic  fugure.  So rich, so powerful, yet even he can't have it all.  Maybe my  love for this book comes from my identification with Gatsby.  How he was  determined to become successful and acheived his goal. Read this book, read  it slowly, savor the language like it is a fine port.  So many things  happen at once, you need to move through it carefully, so you don't miss  any nusances. Finally, I noticed that many other &quot;reviewers&quot;,  mostly pimple faces high school kids, absolutely hated the book.  Don't be  fooled.  There is nothing boring about here.  I read it in High School, I'm  now an attorney, and absolutely loved it even then.  The book is just too  rich to be appreciated by many kids who refuse to take the time to look  below the surface.  They want a fast plot, simple language and an exciting  story.  That's all they are capable of handling since they are exposed to  crap like &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Titanic.&quot; Anyone who didn't  care for the book is just showing their own shortcomings and lack of  intelligence.

A classic of twentieth-century literature. F. Scott Fitzgerald carefully picks his words as he depicts the breathtaking and fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his ventures and strong efforts to proclaim the love of the beautiful Daisy  Buchanan. A tragedy that is melancholy but funny; light but insightful; and  most of all, it's about something everyone can relate to: almost delusional  kind of love that in the end, whether rightly or wrongly, robs life of all  its purpose and vitality.  Fitzgerald very eloquently writes a  wonderful novel, that without a doubt, can be called a masterpiece. His  choice of words is very articulate and the description he includes in every  sentence is admirable. Fitzgerald helps the reader to become part of the  novel and associate with the characters; as well as be able to imagine the  story and picture it perfectly down to the very last detail. His use of  figurative language in this piece is what makes it flow and sound like  poetry.  He created somewhat fictional characters, such as Gatsby that  one can appeal to and enjoy reading about. This novel is hard to put down,  its very easy flowing and one can run through the pages like the waves  through the sea. The book is so entertaining that it's easy to miss the  fact that it's beautifully written.	1999-09-08

He came out on stage holding a copy of THE GREAT GATSBY, sat down on a stool, and told the audience that he had never really understood the book when reading it in school, and proposed that he and the audience read it aloud and discuss it, so that he could understand what it was all about. Maybe that is needed here.<br />I am not anti-kids or anti-teens. But high school students need constantly to remind themselves that they are not experienced readers, and that their opinions on books should be proffered with a necessary dose of humility--humility that they might not yet have learned to be a first rate reader.<br />To pass a judgment on THE GREAT GATSBY like \\"it isn't so great\\" or \\"this is a bad book\\" or \\"this is boring\\" says absolutely nothing about the novel but a great deal about the presumptuous oaf uttering the statement.<br />THE GREAT GATSBY--like ULYSSES, THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV, LOLITA, MOBY DICK, MIDDLEMARCH, or Proust--provides the measure of what a great novel can achieve.  But one isn't born able to read and appreciate great books; it is a skill achieved over the course of time.<br />My advice to all the high schoolers who want to trash this book out of revenge for having been forced to read it: wait a few years, learn to read novels, gain a little more understanding of history, grow up a little, and then go back to it. The book will have remained the same, but you will have grown up sufficiently to get the point. Hopefully.	1999-09-01

I don't care  what anybody says there are *SEVERAL* parts that *DO* seem to be  &quot;scribbled drunk&quot; and are nearly unintelligible.

Also when Tom talks about the &quot;Superior Nordic Race  nobody seems to care *IN THE LEAST* about the horrible things he is saying.  Nick's maid is refered to as &quot;my Finn&quot;, which is so racist as to  be almost unintelligible.  Daisy and Gatsby are proposterous characters.  The idea that they can never get together *MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE  WHATSOEVER*.  I don't care about society standards that is completely  ridiculous.  That Daisy would even think of staying with Tom dates this  book *HORRIBLY* at the very least and more realitically turns into *A  VIRTUAL CARTOON*.  How and why Gatsby would do what he did is not  believably in the least.  Gatsby would never have gone to Oxford if he had  truly cared about Daisy.  The Confrontation makes absolutely no sense.  Tom  calls Gatsby a bootlegger with a drink in his hand.  That is *THE WEAKEST  WRITING I HAVE EVER SEEN.*  Don't bother to read this book.	1999-08-11

Despite its brilliant description of the American Jazz Age and its equally skilful characterisation, The Great Gatsby is primarily a novel of ideas. Underneath its simplistic overtones, lies a novel rich with both physical  and symbolic action. Gatsby, the main character of the novel, is possessed  by a magical fascination of wealth -- the substitution of attractive but  false goals. In other words, he believes that youth (represented by his  object of affection, Daisy) can be perpetually recaptured if one can merely  make enough money. In this sense, Gatsby's vision is like the American  dream itself. However, Nick, the narrator of the novel, is able to perceive  and objectify Gatsby's idealism. He is capable of seeing clearly into the  self-destructible nature of Gatsby's fascination. The novel's success is  partially due to these two opposing sets of values and their clear,  unambiguous nature. To fully appreciate this novel, I'd recommend reading  scholarly critiques for a better understanding. You'd be surprised at how  much this novel entails.	1999-08-10

Normally even good books like the  HOBBIT and 1984 have moments that you wish could end so you could continue  with the book.  Not this one.  Fitzgereld writes only what we, the reader,  need to know.  Everything seems important and everything makes you want to  continue on.<br />My only complaint would be that very rarely does anything  truly spectacualr happens, which one would normally expect from a classic.  But in the end, it doesn't seem to matter.  It's a good book, plain and  simple.	1999-06-10

I first read this book about 15 years ago -  when I was 14 and had to read it for my junior high English class. At that  time, I too didn't &quot;get&quot; the book, thought it was boring, and  couldn't see what all the hype was about. Then I re-read it a few years  ago. I was simply amazed at how well-crafted, insightful, and yet SUBTLE  the book is. The reviewer who remarked that GG's structure is flawed is  especially misguided and probably didn't pay enough attention while  reading. In fact, the structure of this book is pretty close to being  perfect. The reviewer thought the narration of the events through the point  of view of the neighbor is a &quot;crutch&quot; and a worn-out device. Not  so! The WHOLE POINT of the novel is NOT, in fact, Gatsby's pursuit of  Daisy, as everyone seems to think, but the question: who IS Jay Gatsby? Not  only literally, i.e., what is his identity, but also figuratively, who IS  he as a person. The story is remarkable in that we never see Gatsby  directly; instead, his character is filtered through the views of the  people around him. Therefore, the narration of the neighbor fits in  perfectly with the overarching theme of the novel: he is left to sort out  his impressions of Gatsby much in the same way that the reader is. If the  story were told from Gatsby's point of view, we would get too close, know  too much about him, and the entire effect would be ruined. As it stands,  however, the novel becomes a comment on identity: who we really are, and  how other people perceive or misperceive us. (I won't spoil the ending for  those who haven't read the book yet, but once you do read it, make this  connection and you'll see how perfect the structure is.) That other  reviewer also made the comment that a great work of art should cause us to  think, question ourselves, etc., etc. GG does exactly this, but as I  pointed out, Fitzgerald's technique is very subtle - with the result that  some of the nuances may be lost on inattentive readers. To those who gave  the novel less than four stars: read it again, and this time pay attention  and look beyond the surface!n ourselves, etc., etc. GG does exactly this, but as I  pointed out, Fitzgerald's technique is very subtle - with the result that  some of the nuances may be lost on inattentive readers.

Maybe I'm not ready for it yet, I don't know (I had to read it for English class).  Fitzgerald's writing was very vague.  At times, a novel calls for vague writing, and it  works.  In this case, it did not.  He just skimmed over the important parts  and honed in on pointless details.  The entire book had a very ghostly  quality; I always felt like something was there, but it was mostly  undetectable.  Still, it has its good points - I liked the way Fitzgerald  protrayed Gatsby's fair-weather friends, and the tragic ending that could  be compared to a Shakespearean tragedy, when no one is left but the  narrator :).  I'm not entirely sure what to make of this book, I think I'll  read it again in a few years.  Until then, I shall be mystified by those  who gave this book 5 stars, and rename the book &quot;The Okay  Gatsby&quot;.	1999-04-29

Meaning, it contains three distinct  parts, a beginning,middle and end, lacking tongue and cheek wordiness.	1999-04-27

Most people have read it and most love it, but there seems to be a stubborn group of Fitzgerald-haters, so it's obviously not for everyone.<br />The imagery  stood out among all other good parts of the book.  It is very lyrical,  almost poetic.  If nothing else, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a beautiful  novel.<br />Gatsby is the best part of the whole thing, too.  Dark,  mysterious, and rich, we never really get a good look at him (don't watch  the movie for this reason), but he's an intriguing character, worth at  least a glance.<br />I don't know if this book is a classic, but I don't know  what makes a classic.  The story is well written and the scenery is  gorgeous even if the plot is a little convoluted.  This book won't change  your life, as is noted by another reader a few reveiws down, but is worth  reading once for any number of reasons.	1999-03-12

The '20's were a time of change for women.  They were cutting their hair, working for the right to vote and playing golf.  These  new freedoms were enjoyed by the character Jordan Baker.<br />The '20's were  also a time of getting rich.  Lots of people were making money on the  stockmarket, but only white people. All of the characters in the Great  Gatsby were Caucasian.<br />The '20's were a time of organized crime and  bootleggers.  Gatsby was rumored to be earning his wealth illegally.  Life  had lost its meaning for the rich.  Daisy Buchanan's life was filled with  material comforts and luxuries, and empty of purpose.  &quot;What'll we do  with ourselves this afternoon, and the day after that, and the next thirty  years?&quot; she asks one afternoon.<br />Nick Carraway, the main character,  symbolizes the average, middle class person who dreams of being rich.  He  moved East for a better job and more money.  During the course of the book,  he learns to know rich people.  (Daisy is his cousin.)  He realizes that  the American Dream is not as dreamy as it appears to be. In fact, part of  the American Dream is a nightmare.  Still the desire to be rich and have  the American Dream is strong and hard to resist.  Myrtle Wilson is treated  shabbily by Tom Buchanan a rich man with whom she is having an affair.  Still she prefers time with the rich Tom to the life she has with her  husband who is poor.<br />I enjoyed this realistic view of the American Dream  in the 1920s.	1999-03-08

I probably would never have picked up the Great Gatsby at my own accord, but thankfully I was required to read it for school.  The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite books now.  Its short, but full of substance.  I like  that it moves quickly when reading and how human the characters of Gatsby,  Daisy, and Nick all seem.  The reader can connect with these characters and  I think Fitzgerald did a wonderful job on creating this novel.  It is about  the great American dream, so I like it even better. However, Fitzgerald  does an expected twist at the end which makes the book even more effective.  I really like this book, I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes a  little bit of reality, humor, and a great American story.	1999-03-04

I hated it so much, I would have never recommended  it...Now, I'm 16 and I re-read it three days ago, and I have to say it's  the most wondeful piece of American Literature ever written.  It stands  above and beyond To Kill a Mockingbird (though that is VERY debatable), The  Grapes of Wrath, An American Tragedy, and even Old Man and the Sea.<br />I  would suggest reading the book if you are into a master perception of the  human character, and enjoy stories of rich people and greed and luminous  lifestyles.<br />At times, I wanted to tear the book right in half because I  got into it so much and actually had real emotions, which is something very  few books have allowed me to recieve.

Through the narrator, Fitzgerald  gives us the insight into Gatsby's true character that others in the novel  either don't pick up on, or ignore.  The only thing I didn't like about  this novel is Fitzgerald's ocasional use of the cheesy metaphor that  other's find so eloquent.

Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby is a most stirring novel. Every time after reading this book, I become lost in a trance, and only after navigating out of the Fitzgerald created haze, can I begin to examine his intent. There is nothing complex about this book, indeed his comment on the American Dream is straight-forward and easy to identify. Though this acknowledgement, for me, can only be truly realised on the completion and reflection of the work. Largely because Fitzgerald intices the reader to meet his characters, to feel the suffering and alienation of Gatsby, the ordinariness of Nick, and to be pushed slowly and gently by the rich current and bueaty of flow of his words.<br />A most moving book, that despite it's obviousness transcends to something more sublime.	1998-07-16

We had to read it in my high school English class and I loved it even then.  I've read it two more time in the three years I have been out of high school, and I plan to read it at least one a year.  I feel I have to, its like revisiting old friends who you wish you could help but you know you can't.  This novel is awesome in the way that the characters just pop off the page.  The Great Gatsby is so sad too because in the end no one &quot;wins&quot; except maybe for Nick who is a better man for having known Gatsby.  Eventhough Nick believes that Daisy and Tom can retreat into their money and forget anything ever happened, Daisy still has to live with the fact that she got the only man who every really loved her killed,  I don't think money could make her forget that.  Anyway I recommend this book to anyone who  hasn't read it, although if you read it when you were in high school, I suggest reading it again, because you probably missed how beautiful this book is in the rush to have it finished before the test!  Also, if any of you have not seen the movie go rent it or check for it on your local classic movie channel because I've seen the movie on one of those channels at least ten times.  The casting is excellent.  Mia Farrow was the perfect &quot;Daisy&quot; beautiful, delicate, her voice &quot;full of money.&quot;  Nick, sweetly played by the lovely Sam Waterston.  And lets not forget Robert Redford's portrayal of the great Jay Gatsby.  I thought he did and excellent job. This movie is very beautiful and if you don't cry as Daisy and Gatsby renew their love, or when George mourns over Mrytle's body, then you are not human!!  I could write all day about the book and the movie but I will just say that they are both worth checking out.  Lose yourself in the decadent twenties!	1998-06-09

It gives you a taste of what it would be like to live back then  and how society functioned.  It brought together the 2 worlds of Gatsby and Daisy and George and Myrtle and showed how much they contrasted.  Fitzgerald really does a great job of installing images into your head of what different scenes looked like-especially the huge parties Gatsby would have at his house.  I really liked the story itself although it could be seen as depressing.  Oh well, I guess all stories can't always have a happy ending!!	1998-06-03

US	52788426	RG3BMKX5IXZD9	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Over-rated	I believe THE GREAT GATSBY (that did not sell well in its day) is not Fitzgerald's best book. I think it has endured in academia because liberal professors like how it &quot;damns&quot; the American Dream. Gatsby tries to realize the American Dream by going from a poor boy to a rich man, and moving into high society. But he fails. (He never started down the American Dream trail anyway. Gatsby makes his money illegally, which is NOT the American Dream). Academics love when the American Dream is &quot;shown&quot; to be a house of cards. Then we can all embrace socialism.  Fitzgerald actually wrote better short stories (especially &quot;Absolution,&quot; which, ironically, was originally a childhood scene for THE GREAT GATSBY, but cut out). And Fitzgerald's contemporary, John O'Hara, said about Fitzgerald's later novel TENDER IS THE NIGHT: &quot;Compared with TENDER IS THE NIGHT, THE GREAT GATSBY is greasy kid stuff.&quot;  And O'Hara was absolutely right. TENDER IS THE NIGHT is a much better novel. Ernest Hemingway even thought TENDER IS THE NIGHT was Fitzgerald's best novel. GATSBY ain't bad, but if you want to read the best of Fitzgerald, check his other work out first.	1998-03-30

It is a pity that it is on almost every high school reading list because it is worth much more than the simple distaste that comes from most required reading.

His attention to details of characterization, rather than setting, avoid dating the book and help give  Gatsby as much significance in our time as it had in the Roaring 20's.<br /><br />Reading this novel, one is struck by the references to disturbing trends in our own times:  the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; and their desperate search for meaning in their lives, shady fortunes won and lost on the stock market overnight, and<br />the frenzied quest for personal satisfaction while  ignoring the needs of those around us.<br /><br />Yet Gatsby is redeemed -- as we all are, as America has been for over 200 years --  by his belief in a better future, a perfect life that is always just around the corner.  It is this quality which ultimately makes us understand and love Jay Gatsby.

When I read reviews that claim it is over-rated or trivial, I almost take it personally.  How can anyone miss the beauty, eloquence, and depth of this novel?<br />Fitzgerald creates some of the most magnificent characters and scenes in the history of literature in this book. Gatsby is the embodiment of the American dreamer. He is so insecure that he shrouds himself in glitter.  He wants one thing he can't have so much, he surrounds himself with every other possession.  He finds that getting what you want is often the worst thing possible, and that, to be very cliche but borrow from Fitzgerald's own images in this book--everything that glitters is not gold.  The character is classic because a part of him exists in so many people.<br />Daisy and Tom are also classic characters.  Haven't we all met this shallow type that takes what it wants at whatever cost and leaves the world to clean up their messes?  Sure we may feel sympathy for Daisy in some more tender scenes, but isn't that how people like her get away with hurting others?<br /> Finally, Nick is a wonderful character because he is so like the reader.  He is the man who can't help but stand on the side of the road watching an imminent disaster.  There is little we can do but watch and once it happens, we can't force ourselves to turn away.<br /> These characters are incredibly developed, and because they are so universal, so archetypal, we can identify society through them.<br /> I have failed to touch on the unity of effect of the novel, the poetic prose, or the incredible theme that permeates the novel, but I hope that readers will find these for themselves.  Let Nick take you for a xfat drive through East and West Egg; you won't be sorry you took the trip.	1997-09-11

US	52179239	RE9TTW339L1QX	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	1	1	N	N	The Underappreciated Classic	How is it possible to label as &quot;underappreciated&quot; a book that is routinely included in the American literary canon?  Understand this:  _Gatsby_ forced its way into the canon--with the pellucid beauty of its prose and the undeniable resonance of its theme--against the wishes of many, if not most, in the critical intelligensia.  In his time, Fitzgerald was regarded as a talented but irresponsible lightweight, a writer who dissolved his unique gift in expensive gin.  Today, his lifetime reputation as a dissolute drunkard continues to tarnish his litarary legacy, particularly in comparison to the other two members of the Trinity of 20th Century American Literature, Hemingway and Faulkner.  With some exceptions (most notably the fanatically devoted Matthew Bruccoli), critics and academics continue to regard Fitzgerald's work of love, wealth, and dreams as a shade beneath Hemingway and Faulkner, with their more gaudily &quot;literary&quot; themes of mortality, family, and death.  But _Gatsby_ makes liars and fools of those who remain intent on observing only a chronicler of the gin-soaked privileged classes.  Yes, there is wealth, and parties and cars and stars, but _Gatsby_ is a book that rewards not only the dazzling first read, but repeated readings.  Of course, the book features some of the best of Fitzgerald's spectacular, inimitable prose style, which even detractors acknowledge as unmatched in its poetic grace.  But there is much more underneath the fine finish, where so many have failed to look, distracted by the glossy exterior.  Dreams, ambition, financial and moral corruption, love real and imagined, morality, success, failure and death:  these are _Gatsby_'s themes, the themes of the American story--and are there bigger themes in Hemingway's bullfights and war, or Faulkner's incest and insanity?  Modern critics continue to insist that Fitzgerald understood only a certain class and time, but this assessment suffers from a failure of the vision and imagination that Fitzgerald possessed in abundance.  The very slightness of the plot of _Gatsby_ facilitates its analogy to contemporary America.  Just imagine how easy it would be for Hollywood to remake _Gatsby_ as a modern tale of a boy from the ghetto rising through raw ambition and illicit means, chasing a dream he left behind that was never within his reach.  In fact, Hollywood has made that movie, a hundred times over, because it is the prototypical American story, applicable to any time or place in the nation's history.  _Gatsby_ is really a perfect, particular retelling of the most enduring story in American mythologygination that Fitzgerald possessed in abundance.

In that, it is a velvet covered table upon which a small band of bored and privileged jazz-agers appear under the entertainer's deft hands. It is a metaphor of its age and an uncanny prognostication of our current malaise. What makes this book magical? When one steps back from the book, there's no plot, the characters are rather bland, they don't do anything particularly interesting, and what they do accomplish in the very short timespan we spend with them is so trivial or mean that we are left wondering why we enjoyed the book so much. But the craft of magic is never about the rabbit; rather, it is about the empty hat.

When<br /> he wrote in &quot;Gatsby&quot; that the rich are different, he seems to have had some<br /> sort of prophetic genuis.  They certainly are different.  The way in which Tom<br /> and Daisy were able to leave their problems behind is not so dissimilar to<br /> the kind of privilege which is flaunted by those who abuse such privilege<br /> today.

I ghosted my way through the book but I was totally unaware that &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; is one of God's favorite books !  My punishment for disrespecting 'His' favorite book was my being sentensed to actually LIVE the book !

She could do it by continuing to play the fool.<br />I think she took playing the fool too far & I still think she was a coward for staying in a loveless marriage with a husband that always cheated on her...especially when she had a way out with a man that adored her...but this helps me understand her a little bit more.is helps me understand her a little bit more.	2015-08-27

However, it quickly escalated into one of my favorite novels! I loved the style, the imagery, the characters. Everything. Even the end. The book never lagged, it never felt forced, and it never failed to keep me fully engrossed. Highly recommend this, and try not to think about any of the hype that constantly surrounds this book (much like it did Gatsby himself...)<br /><br />The most common complaint I hear about this book is that the characters are too shallow, self-involved, etc.  They definitely are, however using the narrative style of having an outside observer tell the reader about the characters, the lifestyles, and the events is perfect.  The observer is not particularly shallow or self-centered, he is more like an anthropologist observing an unfamiliar culture; he is not condoning or condemning, he is learning.  It's fascinating, and brilliantly executed.	2015-07-17

Gatsby brings love and generosity into a world that is more concerned with appearances and one's own pleasures and self-interests, and Fitzgerald uses events to portray how innocence is crushed by those who have a firm and &#34;realistic&#34; grip on the world. It is a sad story but one to wake up the more sensitive of us from our naivety and innocence.	2015-07-10

I remember seeing the movie with Robert Redford in it. That was it. And then I read the book recently and thought, nice, very nice indeed.<br /><br />The characters were not one-dimensional. They came with flaws and I think that made them real for the story. The plot was rather realistic, after I got through the end of the book and was able to assess the characters with the direction of the novel. Unlike most novels where the main character comes across unscathed and &#34;goes off in the sunset,&#34; that doesn't happen to the Great Gatsby. This novel is a case study in friends: how you get them and where they are when the chips all fall.<br /><br />I shall have to read some more of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books.	2015-06-25

Perhaps I did that the wrong way around! Reading the book did however clarify a few points for me that the movie seemed to leave a bit ambiguous (whether this was done deliberately I'm not sure). It's a bit dark but also a very honest view of how society and the class system worked back in the 1920s and also a bit of a scathing indictment on how society still works today, particularly for the privileged. Definitely an interesting read, even if the language of the time does make it a bit of a slow one, but I am not used to books written in this manner so people who are into classics will most likely enjoy this more. And a classic it definitely is, in my opinion anyway, and is still a must read for any literature fans.	2015-06-17

There is something very appealing about this story.  Fitzgerald has sort of a cryptic writing style.  Sections of the story seem to serve no purpose, but make sense later.  Some scenes to be out of place to set the context of the story.  But once you figure out Fitzgerald's style, you realize how effect it is.  Most of the time.  It's a an intriguing story of the rich, their motivation, and their feeling of entitlement.  The characters are portrayed to tell this story admirably	2015-05-31

I like the flapper era. I said it is Dark, and it is, as it ends in tragedy and the characters never see the Light and change their lives. And I would never want to model after any of them. They are all hopelessly entrenched in the lifestyle of the rich or wannabe rich and with the attending frivolous obsessions. Except for poor and stupid and lovesick Mr. Wilson. But if you want to see the Bible law of sowing and reaping at work, here it is. The writing is very well done. Very descriptive. Suspenseful as well as Dark. And it is Nostalgic if you know that era. I like the Charleston. I like girls with bobbed hair and helmet hats. I like Prohibition. At least I like reading about that time. The writer keeps dropping little bombs of explosive insights into the personalities, which keeps pulling us ever onward and changing how we feel about them. Overall, I would call it a tragic love story. One all mixed up with big money and outrageous lifestyles that could never allow for love to win out. And you wonder if they know what love is anyway, when you get beyond physical desires and an obsession to have things your own way.	2015-05-04

The multiple choices that Amazon is now giving for these reviews are misleading -- &#34;no sexual content&#34; would not be quite true, but &#34;some sexual content&#34; is really not right either.  The book was published in 1925 -- there is only a hint that Daisy and Gatsby were intimate and there is no description of intimacy or use of the word sex in the book.  If one used movie ratings, I think the book could easily be rated &#34;G.&#34;	2015-05-01

It becomes more brilliant, enjoyable, and astounding each time. As a wannabe novel writer, I am almost intimidated by the book's characters, plot, language, imagery... by everything. And I disagree with analysts who call this book a primarily critique of 1920s American culture. It is secondarily that, but primarily it is a love story, a romance. The motivator and the tragedy is Gatsby's quest for Daisy.	2015-04-26

The decadence and debauchery were not new in the 1920's, just more noticeable to the masses than in previous generations. The characters here could drop into almost an era in time and fill their roles. Great literature is about writing greatly about insignificant things. Fitzgerald created a masterpiece.	2015-04-19

Found this book hard to put down. It made some interesting points about the lengths some people are willing to go to continue their facades in life in attempts at getting, &#34;what they want&#34;. It also illustrates when you get what you want, sometimes, you are left just as empty and unhappy as when you started. I think the Great Gatsby is about the pursuit of something which may  be inherently illusory, happiness. Gatsby Tries to recapture his past, yet in the end, Gatsby is only chasing after the illusory illusion of what he remembers his life to have been, which, prevents him from finding happiness and love once more. Gatsby ends up dying in pursuit of both ideas which may make him really great in some peoples eyes or really mediocre, I guess this is a toss up for the readers to decide!	2015-03-21

I think it is very heavily influenced by symbolism. The green light, the rich dressed in white, the eyes of T. J.

That is basically my review. I don't get why this is such a classic, why people seem to love it so much, really I just don't get it. It is just a bunch of rich people in the 20's having parties and their nonsensical conversations. Throw in the fact that everyone cheats on each other and you have The Great Gatsby. There is very little actual plot and it is just this random hodge podge of conversations. I found it very hard to pay attention to what I was reading. I kept having to go back and re-read as I found I just read a few pages and could not tell you what happened. Then I would re-read it and think oh, well nothing really happened so no worries. Then I also would also go back and re-read parts as I was always feeling like I was missing something. It was just a strange read for me. Little character development, little plot development, really little plot and yet it is a classic. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I do think it will be way better than the book. I mean it has to have a more developed storyline than the book does right? We shall see.<br /><br />The book starts off with our narrator Nick moving in next door to Gatsby. He also has a married cousin, Daisy, who lives nearby. The first 3/4 of the book I feel like nothing really happened. I kept thinking why am I reading this? Why do people love this book so much? Then we get to the last bit and a few things happened, but I didn't really care. I didn't care about any of the characters as they were all so over the top ridiculous rich people that it was just hard to connect with. That and you didn't really get to know them at all so they are just random people.<br /><br />Before I read this I remember hearing it is this great love story. That to me is the most head scratching thing of all. I don't see how this is a love story. The characters were just cheating on each other which even if they would have been developed more so I connected with them, even if there would have been more of a story here, that wouldn't be a great love story for me. A very strange read and I just don't understand what so many people see in this book that makes it such a classic. Oh well, I guess I don't have to get it. It is just not for me.<br /><br />This review was originally posted to Jen in Booklandif there would have been more of a story here, that wouldn't be a great love story for me.

Even though it is set in the past it holds a lot of view on our world perspective.  The book is written from the perspective of Nick Carraway.  He was educated at Yale and had recently fought in World War I.  The story begins with Nick moving to West Egg, the rich part of Long Island.  Nick wants to learn more on the upcoming industry of stock trading.  He finds out that he is living next door to the mysterious, rich philanthropist, Jay Gatsby.  Nick has his connections of the East Egg and he begins to gain trust with his cousin, Daisy, who lives there.  Nick is told of the magnificent parties that are held at Mr. Gatsby's house.  Within the month he is invited to Mr. Gatsby's and he soon becomes friends with him.  Gatsby meets Jordan and recalls the love they had before the war and they begin to see each other again.  Tom, Daisy's husband, begins to be suspicious of the time that Daisy is spending with Gatsby.  Even though Tom has an extramarital affair, he claims that he loves Daisy.  In addition, Daisy admits that she loves Gatsby.  Tom confronts Gatsby and exposes his criminal activity.  Following that, Daisy decides that her allegiance belonged to Tom.  On the drive home Gatsby kills Tom's lover, Myrtle, in a car accident. Myrtle's husband, George, finds out it was Gatsby and kills him. Following the death of Gatsby, all of Gatsby's crimes are released to the public and no one attends his funeral except for Nick.  Nick loses faith in humanity and as a result returns home to the Midwest.<br /><br />I myself found this novel to be very interesting because of the differences we see now.  We see that the American dream of lower class people becoming rich is almost not possible within the terms of the law.  I feel like this is still very true today.  One thing that stands out to me even more is the fact that Gatsby was no longer accepted after his secret was revealed.  Gatsby was an amazing man even though he had made a living bootlegging.  This book taught me that people can be extremely selfish when it comes to money.s an amazing man even though he had made a living bootlegging.

In my hopeless clamour to read every classic book every, I most recently managed to get around to F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. On the surface a tale of an affair among the rich, the message underneath the novel's pretty standard story is that money can't buy happiness. There is a sad and beautiful portrait of humanity, manners, love, and bullshit in the book's few pages, and the more I think about it, the more I realise how great a book it really is. Ice it with Fitzgerald's beautiful knack for phrase and you have a hell of a read. Never thrilling, but perennially charming.	2015-02-24

It is the story of Jay Gatsby, a poor boy who made it rich, and his obsession with a girl/woman, Daisy. The story is about superficial, self absorbed, shallow people living empty lives. Jay seemed to be the centre of everything and provided entertainment for everyone who cared to come to his place. When he got murdered none of his 'friends' came to his funeral. When specifically asked they all made excuses. Written in 1925, it received very poor reviews, possibly as it was a mirror of those times.	2015-01-02

I know it's a classic, really tried to like it.  Started out thinking &#34;wow this Fitzgerald guy is quite a writer&#34;. Considering all of the description I suppose he is a literary craftsman.<br /><br />But as the pages went by nothing really happened. With the outpouring of words I never felt like I knew or cared about the characters. Maybe that's how the one percent live, maybe that's the point, but I just didn't get any energy from it. Certainly not any good energy. Not clever, suspenseful. The mystery of a rich, single guy's past can only carry a plot so far. Not particularly thought provoking. One can only take so much yearning and wistfulness.<br /><br />I must have set the story down and never thought to pick it up again. Maybe someday I'll get stuck in an airport and finish it. And maybe discover that it gets really exciting at the end. Somehow it doesn't matter. For me the energy was all wrong.	2014-11-26

This is a great piece of literature written in a way books aren't written today. The language used, the style of the prose, the ability of Fitzgerald to capture a time in America while telling us something about ourselves and people brought the characters to life. There's a reason why Fitzgerald was considered a great writer, and like many artists and painters his works grow in stature long after his death. I think this was his masterpiece. I would also place this under the &#34;must read&#34; category.	2014-11-19

This book is always among the first to be discussed during book club meetings and must be required reading in college. well, let me be the first to say it lived up to all the hype. Fitzgerald adroitly and masterfully weaves a story about love, sex, infidelity, and unfulfilled dreams into a timeless epic that'll never be forgotten. Fitzgerald uses first-person POV and with that unleashes a flood gate of suspicion that the story is in fact an autobiography. However, Fitzgerald must've been suffering from split personality because it is clear to anyone who has read about his life that, not only is the narrator a mirror of Fitzgerald's life, Gatsby himself is also. It is a fascinating read and i highly recommend it to any writer who wishes to see how the masters did it.	2014-11-14

Good read, classic book, still applicable.<br /><br />My step dad told me once that &#34;nothing changes under the face of the sun&#34; - a quote from someone wise, but I've since forgotten the source.  The Great Gatsby definitely speaks to human nature being one of those unchangeable things, as the characters behave much like those today - despite vastly different technology and culture.	2014-11-08

Ever since I was 10 years old, I had been in love with the 1920's. The glamor, the sophisticated style, everything about the Jazz Age fascinated me. F. Scott Fitzgerald brought all of this to life for me through this book. Having seen the movie first, I had an idea about what to expect. The movie itself is a masterpiece but the book is an outstanding work of literature that should be considered when watching the film. Fitzgerald depicts every single detail beautifully and takes you into the lavish world of 1920's New York.<br /> Readers are first introduced to the main character, young and ambitious Nick Carraway. It takes place in a turning point in America, the 1920's. Prohibition has been legalized but the people aren't listening. The usual style has changed and people are starting to be a little more daring. We then meet Daisy, Nick's cousin, and Tom Buchanan. Part of the plot is revealed when Nick crosses the bay to visit the two. Not long after, Mr. Carraway is invited to one of Gatsby's famous parties. Nick attends only to be hit in the face with so many stories and details. It is here that it's revealed that Gatsby and Daisy have a history. Readers follow a series of love stories, tragedies, and a bunch of other situations the 20's brought around in one single summer all through the eyes of Mr. Nick Carraway.	2014-10-31

Sadly theme book did not licensing those expectations, it seemed as though Fitzgerald indirectly characterized Mr. Gatsby through the descriptions of the other characters, and when we finally meet Gatsby himself it's rather anticlimactic. In my opinion the book was more focused  on the lives of everyone else (i.e., Jordan Baker, Nick, Daisy, George) rather on Gatsbys life. I was very disappointed in this book, I expected more from it.	2014-09-27

It's beautifully written, and is a quick read. It's said that this is perhaps THE great American novel. In that, I would disagree, but I do think it is a great American novel.There has always been a struggle between the old rich and the new rich, and this book touches on that subject in the most perfect of ways, from within a heart wrenching love story. I've not read much of Fitzgerald's work, but after reading this one, it is likely I'll continue to read and explore more of the author.	2014-08-25

This time, having recently again seen the DiCaprio film of The Great Gatsby, and owning the earlier version with Robert Redford and Sam Waterston, I decided to reread it and decide which film is the better treatment of this classic American novel (some would say the best American novel).  Without doubt, the Redford version is better, in part because of the more faithful treatment of Fitzgerald's novel and more use of his exact stunning language, and in part because of Waterston's excellent portrayal of narrator Nick Carraway.  Redford makes the tragic hero glimmer from within as well as with the golden aura of his money, while Mia Farrow is appropriately insipid as Daisy, &#34;a beautiful little fool&#34; as she says regarding her daughter's birth.  While I enjoy Luhrmann's films, I think in his version of Gatsby, there is a bit too much Luhrmann and too little F. Scott.  However, read the book, watch both films, and make your own decision!  I also strongly recommend reading Frances Kroll Ring's biography of the last years of F. Scott Fitzgerald's life during which time she was his secretary, Against the Current.  A truly intriguing read from one who was there until the end.	2014-08-18

Well.. it took me a few chapters to get into this but once I had a sense of who the narrator was I was able to fully commit myself to his life and what was going on and I absolutely fell in love.<br /><br />What a dramatic story! A tale full of love, loss, regret, fear, and just plain craziness. In short it has all of the emotions of real life all rolled up into one little tale about a man! It’s the telling of this man’s life story from a friend’s perspective and it was so unique, and written so well that I really did not want to put this down.<br /><br />Every character woven so dramatically around each others lives that the reader is left begging for more!<br /><br />The thing about this story is that you can feel the love from Gatsby as he agonizes over Daisy and every movement she makes. More than once my heart ached for him and I was curious and not very optimistic about how this story was going to end. But it was written so beautifully and harmonically that I just could not find myself leaving this story alone. And I know this is going to be one of my favs for years to come.<br /><br />I then immediately watched the movie. And how engrossed I was! The music, the tone, the performances, and add all that to the fact that the speech was nearly perfect to the book. This is one movie that I can say definitively, if you like the book, you’ll love the movie! Although I loved the fact that it was spot on, I also loved the cinematography. It was so graphically done, very reminiscent of The Moulin Rouge with scandalous attire, fabulous music, and wonderful plots! I was not surprised to find that Baz Luhrmann wrote both stories because I could just feel the exoticness in everything that was done, and loved it!	2014-08-06

This is a classic that contains so many beautiful passages that simply deserves a second chance from certain readers. I see now that this is a wonderful story that captures and holds so many different facets of topics and subjects set to the brilliance of the early 1920's. Like so many others, I was exposed at an early age to this work and needless to say I did not have a pleasant literary or learning experience with this book and it has just left an unpleasant taste for me. Perhaps this has happened to you and you can name a title that you were forced into endlessly dissecting or for whatever reasons and it all had unintentional results of creating rancor directed at a particular book. Perhaps this is that book, may I be the first to say maybe it's time to let the past go and give The Great Gatsby a second look.<br /><br />If you are like me you love concept of the story or setting and know the symbolism by heart and if nothing else may just read it for the history, expressive passages and dimensional characterizations. However wonderful the reading experience, this reader did notice some unanswered questions that lingered on the last pages that were hard to forget or ignore and a few confusing poetic metaphorical passages that left a sense of reading two incomplete books in one. I will be honest, I did feel that old frustration bubbling in the beginning but as soon as the descriptive section about the narrator's initial encounter with Mr. Jay Gatsby and his unforgettable smile that frustration fell away and the book seemed to say to this reader: \\"let's start over, old sport\\" and after that I just lost myself in the experience and rediscovered another classic.	2014-07-26

I read this book many years ago, and always wanted to see Daisy Buchanan show her face and at least some kind of remorse in this wonderful book, but Fitzgerald knew his people best....they were above being involved in anything tasteless or showing any kind of pity for those not \\"to the manor born\\". He had a beautiful talent for words. No one dare review this book unless they are used to pithy,tasteless romance novels being sold today.

This modern classic is one of the masterpieces of literature and a real pleasure to read. The plot is timeless, dealing with the social problems of greed and how individuals handle their place in a money based value system.<br />Fitzgerald is a gifted story-teller who uses the language as poetry. His images are carefully and skillfully drawn. The notion that our actions are monitored by all-knowing &#34;eyes&#34; pervades the book, from the superficial eyes of a minor (but significant) drunken character known only as &#34;Owl Eyes&#34; to the story dominating eyes on a billboard for an optometrist, Dr. T.J. Eckleburg. These haunting eyes were also the basis of the book-jacket picture by artist, Francis Cugat, a striking interpretation that evokes the debauchery of the times for the obscenely wealthy (including nudes reflected in the irises!)	2014-07-21

Like a lot of people, my first experience with The Great Gatsby was being forced to read it in high school. Honestly, it was one of the few books I read because I had to that I actually enjoyed. Twenty years later I decided I wanted to reread it after seeing the Baz Luhrmann film. I had bought a Kindle so that I could read while on the arc trainer at the gym, so I downloaded it. I loved the digital edition. The type was large enough so that I could read it while it was on the machine panel in front of me, and it was so easy to swipe from one page to the next. And I love the book so much, I found myself disappointed that my workout was over and I had to stop reading. Fitzgerald's language has a way of being straightforward and flowery all at the same time. And the story is so timeless, so tragic, but so engrossing. I truly believe this is a book that everyone should read at least once in their life.	2014-06-22

Daisy and Tom Buchanan ( &#34;the sort of people who break things and leave others to clean up the mess&#34;), the desperate Myrtle Wilson ( Tom's mistress), her husband George (she calls him &#34;too dumb to live&#34;), the ultimate free-loader Klipspringer, the gambler  Meyer Wolfsheim, the dishonest Jordan Baker and the hundreds of party-goers who find their way to Gatsby's mansion all have their real-life counterparts not only in roaring twenties East and West Egg but wherever users and those they use are gathered,<br /><br />Only the central character Jay Gatsby, the least despicable of the lot, remains faithful to his misguided vision and the narrator,Nick Carroway, who admires him even while recognizing his absurdity win the reader's sympathy.

Scott Fitzgerald is defiantly that! It’s a fictional story that gives the reader a glimpse into the roaring 20’s, a little of what life was like, the parties, the excess and attitudes.<br /> The book opens with the main character Nick Carraway still in the mid-west and consulting his family about going to New York. His family is agreeable to this because his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband are there also. So Nick ends up on New York as a bonds broker and renting a small house next door to Jay Gatsby. Of course he hears and see’s the extravagant parties and soon he’s invited as a guest. During the course of events everyone guesses how Gatsby made his money and many rumors go around. Soon Gatsby begins to reveal bits about himself to Nick, but Nick seems to know that it’s a lie that Jay has rehearsed many times over. Eventually Gatsby’s true intentions are revealed to Nick that involves his cousin Daisy. The story includes more the one tale of infidelity among those who are married, and how Nick Carraway gets caught up for a time in all the glamour and the secrets of peoples lives. Even though this book was written in the early 20th Century it’s still very relevant today in many ways.<br /> I love the way the book is written and how it all flows so smoothly together, along with many pointed quotes by the main characters are pointedly places through out the book. My favorite however sums up how some people really are. “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money of their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.&#34; (Chapter 9) Another quote is from Daisy saying about her daughter, &#34;I hope she'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool... You see, I think everything's terrible anyhow... And I know. I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.&#34; (Chapter 1) Maybe that worked for women in the past but certainly not in the present. It’s a wonderful read that I highly recommend!. I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.&#34; (Chapter 1) Maybe that worked for women in the past but certainly not in the present.

Great Gatsby -Scott Fitzgerald, A fantastic piece of literature which made Gatsby Great as well as Scott Fitzgerald. Gatsby is almost too fashionable with his high standard of morals. Always charming. Always the gentleman. He would be the ideal catch for a woman. He is kindhearted and an all-around decent man.<br />The setting is an entirely different era than we are now accustomed too, but it is a noteworthy time. Gatsby isn’t really all that different and neither s Nic Carraway as he narrates the story to the reader. In some way Carraway could be described as a voyeur. He watches Gatsby. They have much in common except Carraway is well grounded. He is self assured. Whereas Gatsby, though a decent man can be a little flakey. He is easily swayed and tempted by a woman who could easily tarnish his reputation In this pre-depression era, if a man is not trustworthy, he may as well tuck tail and runaway.	2014-06-20

F Scott Fitzgerald was just 30 when he wrote \\"The Great Gatsby\\" somewhat older than the generation of bright young things the creation of which New York Times later attributed to him, but still considerably younger than the world-weary Gatsby around whom the social butterflies swarm.  How does the tunnel of time and our own life experiences influence the way we judge Fitzgerald's masterpiece, I wonder?  This question occurred to me as I re-read this book decades after I first encountered it as a school set work.  I was left pondering which was the greater emotion I feel now, desperation for the Gatsby the driven youth or sadness at the older man's hubris.  Whichever it is, it is testimony to the power of Fitzgerald's imagination and his writing.	2014-05-27

Scott Fitzgerald<br /><br />The Great Gatsby (Gatsby) was published in 1926.  Heralded far and wide, it has been characterized as “the most perfectly crafted work of fiction to have come out of America…a modern classic, a key American novel…with technique as great as Turgenev…[with] prose as delicate as a garnet…”, but how does it read now, some 80 years later?<br /><br />Gatsby is a short novel, only 175 pages, that features just five, key characters (Jay Gatsby, Jordon Baker, Daisy and Tom Buchanan, and the all-important narrator, Nick Conway).  It conveys a profoundly disturbing message: The gaiety and dreams of youth are crushed by the weight and disappointments of life’s events and by age, itself – recalling Voltaire’s observation, “Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.”  Things achieved lose their luster; material possessions fail to satisfy for more than a moment, and Fitzgerald’s heroines (like his wife) always disappoint their men.  Fitzgerald and his wife were raging alcoholics.  Fitzgerald wrote obsessively about homosexuals and was notoriously sensitive about his masculinity.  (The evidence does not support Fitzgerald’s dim view of women; many women, of course, do not “disappoint their men”.  If he had been receptive to the right match, his life and prose would likely have enjoyed a more positive slant.)<br /><br />Was “the great Gatsby” really “great”?  Ah, there’s the rub; Gatsby, the man, was anything but great.  He was a colossal fake, a disappointing illusion, just like the material possessions so coveted by his (and most) generations, which is the author’s principle message about The Roaring Twenties (or, for that matter, for all of modern times).  Gatsby wasn’t even Gatsby; the name “Jay Gatsby” was a pseudonym for his real name, James Gatz.  He (like Fitzgerald) flat rejected his own parents, commoners and crude by his standards, and he rejected their beliefs and mores.  Gatsby’s money wasn’t “old money from the Mid-West aristocracy” but new money that he made, allegedly, from illicit gambling and likely bootlegging.  The story dwells on Gatsby’s great home on Long Island, filled to overflowing with the Long Island rich, who gossiped negatively about him in his halls as they enjoyed his frequent, massive parties, replete with live music and every conceivable amenity.  Gatsby star-crossed and ill-fated love is for Daisy, whom he met before she married the wealthy aristocratic Tom Buchanan.  Their “love affair” is much like a wet dream in which no climax is ever reached.  It disappoints Gatsby and his readers, but that, too, is The Point.  His “friends” were as fake and shallow as his past, and, when he was shot for adultery that he didn’t commit, his “friends” and business partner stayed away; only three people attended his funeral: his father, one casual acquaintance and Nick Conway, the narrator and the only stable and admirable character in the book.<br /><br />What might we say about the prose which is said to be “as delicate as a garnet” and on the same plane as Turgenev, one of Russia’s literary giants?  First and foremost, Gatsby is a page-turner; although there is no violence and nothing lurid, the reader is compelled to continue.  Second, it is brilliantly laconic, so short as to almost fall into the classification of a novella (akin to the style Turgenev, Chekov, Poe, O’Henry, et al), demonstrating amazing editing by Fitzgerald – and, also, the virtual absence of dialogue, which always extends the length of books, while developing full and believable characters.  Third, it does indeed give us a vivid and likely accurate picture of life for the rich in the Twenties, and there were many among the “rich” in that pre-Depression decade, thus making it historical fiction worthy of note.  As to the “delicacy” of the prose or a stature akin to Turgenev, this reader would respectfully disagree.  It lacks sufficient metaphors or the richness of vocabulary that lends the dimensions of 19th Century oil paintings, which we find in Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dickens, Mitchell, Bronte and the de minimus percentage of contemporary writers who can rise even briefly to those Elysian heights.<br /><br />F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) authored many short stories and five novels, including The Beautiful and the Damned, Tender Is the Night, The Last Tycoon, and his most famous Great Gatsby.  When he died “suddenly” and inexplicably (suicide?) in 1940, he was heralded as a literary giant as one who “invented a generation”.  His view of himself, as with most authors, resides within his characters and in none more than in Gatsby.  A Princeton man, as one biographer noted,<br /><br />“He grew up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken.”<br /><br />His greatest interest of life may have centered on his wife, Zelda Sayre, although their marriage was traumatic, and she suffered repeated “mental breakdowns”.  From the downside, Fitzgerald, in sum, was an existentialist (and likely nihilist) and, in the end, devoid of the hope that permits joy in our lives, a quintessential downer.  From the upside, Fitzgerald mirrored his times; he gave us history in interesting fiction, an up-close view of the Roaring Twenties in America, in all of its gaiety and with all of its warts and malaise, a literary history that both entertains and fills a void in our literary lives.  Such literary icons and the progeny of their pens demand the attention and quiet enjoyment of all who would claim to be adventurous readers.  Put differently, if wish to be viewed as “well read”, you must read this “classic”, but that doesn’t guarantee that you will like it.<br />​3 Stars  BookAWeekMan  (leeglovett.com)<br />​espectfully disagree.

His view of himself, as with most authors, resides within his characters and in none more than in Gatsby.  A Princeton man, as one biographer noted,<br /><br />“He grew up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken.”<br /><br />His greatest interest of life may have centered on his wife, Zelda Sayre, although their marriage was traumatic, and she suffered repeated “mental breakdowns”.  From the downside, Fitzgerald, in sum, was an existentialist (and likely nihilist) and, in the end, devoid of the hope that permits joy in our lives, a quintessential downer.  From the upside, Fitzgerald mirrored his times; he gave us history in interesting fiction, an up-close view of the Roaring Twenties in America, in all of its gaiety and with all of its warts and malaise, a literary history that both entertains and fills a void in our literary lives.  Such literary icons and the progeny of their pens demand the attention and quiet enjoyment of all who would claim to be adventurous readers.  Put differently, if wish to be viewed as “well read”, you must read this “classic”, but that doesn’t guarantee that you will like it.<br />​3 Stars  BookAWeekMan  (leeglovett.com)<br />​	2014-05-20

When the movie came out last year I got curious about the book. I read it in high school, but I know from experience that the finer points of most plots and social commentaries went over my head as a teenager. So, I reexamined it. It is disturbing. However, it says a lot about American culture at the time it was written.	2014-05-20

Instead, I found a quick and engaging read, that left me contemplating the meaning of life and pursuit of happiness in a profound way. I just finished reading a fictional novel that included Fitzgerald living in Paris as a character, and the character expressed the sentiment that it was difficult to start writing another story after Gatsby because the person of Gatsby, while dead in the story, was so real and alive in his mind that he could hardly start imagining a new story and set of characters. I can see why that is the case - Gatsby is such a full-bodied character, while still be shrouded in mystery.<br /><br />The e-book version of this book was a great way to read it.	2014-05-20

The book is so full of evocative and concise descriptions of surroundings, emotions and personality foibles that it ran away with me chapter by chapter. F Scott Fitzgerald can convey in one sentence what others take whole paragraphs to capture. Raced through it and at the end really wanted to start all over again just to be in the presence of wonderful, flawed characters who were all obviously products of their place and time.

Gatsby is a classic and was on my optional reading list for school. I had chosen another novel to read but decided to read this one too because there was a movie coming to theaters that I had a major interest in seeing. I heard from many people that this was “the best book they have ever read” and that it “kept them entertained for hours”. However, when I read it, I did not experience the same thing.<br /><br />Even though it was very well written, I found this novel uninteresting and hard to get into. Maybe it was because this novel is almost a century old and the diction of writers has changed since then. Maybe it was because I read it at a time that I didn’t have a lot going on and was using this novel to keep me entertained. Or maybe it was because I had such high expectations for it.<br /><br />Overall, The Great Gatsby tells a great story of a man and his parties. It is a deep novel that will invoke some deep thinking. I personally think the movie was more enjoyable than the novel, quite possibly because there was less description of what was going on and more dialogue. I have found that I enjoy novels with some description but with an equal amount of dialogue just to keep things interesting. I believe that if this novel were to have more conversational portions, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. All in all, if you are looking for a thought-provoking novel that must be read more than once to get the full meaning; then this is one for you!	2014-04-17

At first,  first, Da sey seemed quite charming, but soon fell from grace.  Tom, her husband, had no redeeming traits.  Jay Gatsby had the skills and intelligence to become successful, but lacked proper motivation.  The parties lacked the luster of interesting folks mingling although the other ingredients were present for a delightful evening.

Growing up, I remember the many times that my older sister gushed about her love for The Great Gatsby. I can't begin to count the times that I tried to start reading this classic, but could never get into it. Fast forward {many} years.

After watching the movie with my daughter, I decided to reread the book. The first time I read it I was in high school, and had no understanding of how the world really works. I didn't really like the book at all. I thought all the characters were appalling, and I saw no point to the book. Now, after rereading it as an adult I realize that Fitzgerald's point was for us to loathe everyone, except and including Gatsby. (Including Gatsby because he put all his hopes and dreams on someone who not only didn't deserve it, and being so naive about wanting to recapture their past. Except Gatsby because he was the most genuine even when he was lying about his past. ) I think my main problem with it was it's realism, and it's antithesis of a fairy tale ending. I didn't see the beauty in its tragedy.	2014-03-24

I had a tough time deciding between three and four stars, but I ended up giving it four, because for what it was, it was quite a good book.	2014-03-08

The drama keeps you reading because you want to know, who is this Gatsby. This book is not like the movie but it's still dramatic and pulls you into the world of these rich people. I read it as an assignment for class and expected to be bored but I ended up liking it. So, If you have some spare time, you should read this book.	2014-03-04

US	43164669	R1SSH0T3UPSPN9	B00EJRPZEQ	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Digital_Ebook_Purchase	4	1	1	N	Y	Detached	I didn't feel any emotional connection to any of the characters. The narrator, for some weird reason, is a passive observer barely relative to the actual story. I felt that the author had something to say, but failed to do it in a manner that could engage me. I felt that the author was enchanted with his own voice, but failed to enchant me with it.<br /><br />I expected more from the style. There are so many unnecessary flourishes and lyrical cadence. Too much, for my taste. The style overshadows the meaning, and often even obscures it. At times I even wondered if the overelaborate style is here to cover the absence of meaning, like the glitter covering the nothing underneath.<br /><br />I got the strong impression that the characters and plot were thrown into the furnace of preaching and symbolism. The author doesn't care about the characters, and neither do I. I finally felt a spark of emotional connection to the narrator (who's not even the protagonist) in the last chapter, because he finally got a semblance of a purpose which he half-heartedly pursues (trying to get people to visit the funeral). But by that time, it's too late, the story is over. Still, I added an extra star for that.	2014-02-28

A character in one of John Irving's books--Hotel New Hampshire, I think--commits suicide when she realizes she will never be able to write anything as beautiful as the ending of The Great Gatsby. While I cannot condone taking one's life, I sympathize with the reason for it here.	2014-02-15

One of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, The Great Gatsby lays bare the casual recklessness and unthinking cruelty of the privileged rich in the pre-depression, prohibition era of America. Set in the summer of 1922, the book portrays the brittleness of a society still quivering from the aftershocks of WW1 and looking fearfully towards an uncertain future. The hedonism and dazzling decadence of the \\"Roaring Twenties\\" is exposed as a thin veneer over a society riven by class division, old wealth and new, and showing the first signs of a breakdown in the old social order.<br /><br />The story is set in the fictitious areas of East and West Egg on Long Island. Facing each other across the bay that separates them are two mansions. The house on East Egg is the home of Tom and Daisy Buchanan, both born into wealth and privilege. On the other side lives Jay Gatsby, not just a self-made man, but self-invented. The narrator, Nick Carraway, is cousin to the Buchanans and neighbour to Gatsby, and finds himself rapidly becoming a conduit between them.<br /><br />To claim perfection for a book might be too grandiloquent (though I'm tempted), but I confidently claim that the first chapter of Gatsby is the perfect first chapter. We get to know Nick, restless from the war, running from his comfortable mid-western home to escape the weight of family expectations. But Nick is no country bumpkin - he is assured and confident, sliding effortlessly into New York high society while still retaining some of the clear-sightedness of an outsider looking in. We meet Daisy, beautiful, privileged and outwardly vulnerable; but already we begin to see the hard shell of self-preservation that exists beneath her filmy, gauzy exterior. We are shown Tom, seeking a way to fill his empty life now that his days as a football star are over - through him we see the fraying of the certainties of the established order. And as the chapter closes, we catch our first glimpse of Gatsby, thinking himself unseen, revealing his desire and his vulnerability in one simple gesture. All this in a few beautifully written pages, and with room too to give the reader a feel for the setting of the novel to come, both physical and emotional.<br /><br />Gatsby himself is one of the most unforgettable characters in fiction; a self-made man to whose lavish parties New York society flocks, exploiting his hospitality while gossiping shamelessly about his murky and mysterious background. But Gatsby doesn't care what the world thinks of him - only Daisy, the representation of all of his dreams and aspirations. For Gatsby, Daisy is the American Dream - the beauty, the wealth, the class, the privilege. And it was the odd democratisation of war that had allowed the Gatsbys and Daisys of this world to mingle - the uniform of an officer providing the entrance ticket that Gatsby's own background didn't give. This is a beautiful and poignant love story, but the Daisy that Gatsby loves is the memory of a dream; his pursuit is not so much of Daisy herself as of the time he holds most dear - the time when Daisy and he were in love.<br /><br />Through the contrast of the Buchanans and Gatsby, Fitzgerald blasts away any idea of American society as being equal or even meritocratic and shows that, just as much as in the Old World, there is an aristocracy and upper-class who will defend at any price the privilege that their name and old wealth bestows. Gatsby's name-change, his vagueness and lies about his background are partly to cover up the murky way he came by his wealth, but also to try to invent a background that will make him acceptable to this snobbish and exclusive elite. But he doesn't quite pull it off - his ostentation and stilted use of what he sees as upper-class language give him away at every turn. And yet, despite his shadowy past, despite his occasional vulgarity, Gatsby shows himself to have an integrity and honesty wholly lacked by the society to which he so much wants to belong.<br /><br />The first time I read Gatsby, I was so enthralled that I read it in one glorious sitting, breathless and amazed. It's a short novel, written with a wonderful economy that allows Fitzgerald to cast a laser beam at the divisions of this class-ridden society while still creating some of the most fully-realised characters in fiction, not to mention providing a well-plotted and deeply moving story too. A masterwork of fiction, this is a book I have read many times and expect to read many more with just as much pleasure. A truly great novel.ong.<br /><br />The first time I read Gatsby, I was so enthralled that I read it in one glorious sitting, breathless and amazed.

Every high school student or first-year college student has read it. So, when I say I didn’t think much of it, I’m treading on tenuous frozen water.<br /><br />First I’ll say what I did like about the book. The prose is excellent. Lots of wonderful descriptions. But that’s it. For example:<br /><br />He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass.<br /><br />But I didn’t like any of the characters. Gatsby had no sympathetic characteristics. In fact, so far as I could determine, he made his money as a crook. I don’t mind that, I wish it were brought out more. Nick is uninteresting, and Daisy is just a silly girl. there was no discernable story, and the dialogue was sprinkled with adverbs like fairy dust. For example:<br /><br />Looked at me challengingly<br />He sat down gloomily<br /><br />Nothing material happened until 80% of the way through the book. That’s when Myrtle Wilson was killed by being hit by Gatsby’s car, which was being driven by Daisy. Even at that point you have to read it twice to realize what happened. After that, Gatsby’s reaction was basically, oh, well, we hit her and killed her.<br /><br />Even when Gatsby was shot there was little description of it. That section likewise had to be read more than once to realize what had happened. It was a great chance for some tension. But it was hidden, and the climactic scene of the whole story was nearly invisible.<br /><br />Now, I understand that it’s a work of literary fiction, and that there are not going to be “action” scenes. But all that really happens is that Nick gets to know his neighbor, Gatsby, who has a big party every night. They run around carousing and having fun, and arguing amongst themselves. Yeah, there’s adultery, and an old love between Gatsby and another man’s wife that brings on a little tension, but it’s simply not enough. It’s largely kept as an undercurrent.<br /><br />In other words, it’s boring.<br /><br />I’m also aware of the symbolism. But who cares, other than Lit 101 students? Tell the story first, then worry about symbolism and social commentary.<br /><br />This book reminds me of The Emperor’s New Clothes. Someone has to tell him he’s naked.<br /><br />This book would never be published today.and an old love between Gatsby and another man’s wife that brings on a little tension, but it’s simply not enough.

Lampedusa and was struck by the description of the lavish balls thrown by wealthy Sicilians in the late 1800s amidst the poverty of the locals. The parties of Gatsby were even grander affairs, and all for the sake of winning back the woman he loved. I enjoyed reading this novel for its description of life of the affluent and not so affluent in the 1920s in NY. The story was intriguing and the prose succinct and elegant.

Knowing the story, I read slow, going over some passages amazed at the author's insight into the human mind and his technique to transport you to the different settings. I read with sadness for Gatsby's unrealistic dream and his impending tragedy and contempt for Daisy's shallowness and how her sort could turn a blind eye to the people whose lives they destroyed on their; no inconveniences allowed, path.	2013-12-09

Sadly I did not get an opportunity to see the movie but I was extremely glad for the opportunity to rediscover this novel.<br /><br />The first time I read The Great Gatsby was straight out of college. I had never been assigned to read this classic in high school and I sort of thought I was missing out on something. So I borrowed a copy from the library, read it and almost immediately forgot about it. I mean, I remembered that I read it and all but as far as the plot or most of the characters except Jay Gatsby and Daisy…it all kind of disappeared and I had the sinking suspicion that reading The Great Gatsby had been a waste of time.<br /><br />But I guess over the years I grew some fondness for the book. I ended up naming one of my two cats Gatsby (his brother’s name is Hemingway and I wanted to keep the literary theme going)…and I was more than a little excited the first time I saw the trailer for the new movie (oh okay, I just wanted an excuse to see yet another Leonardo DiCaprio movie).<br /><br />But anyway, I reread the book and I’m so glad I did…especially as I did not get to see the movie. This time around I enjoyed it much more, and understood it a lot better. I went into the book thinking that I was probably going to come away disappointed but I wasn’t. Not at all. Instead I realized that despite my first experience…I loved The Great Gatsby and it’s not difficult to understand why it’s considered a classic…it’s timeless.	2013-11-19

The Great Gatsby provides a critical social history of America during the Roaring Twenties, and while it might be a work of fiction, it has strong social and political messages.<br /><br />But don't forget that it's also a cleverly written story too; Gatsby is driven by his love for a woman who symbolised everything he wanted, even as she led him toward everything he despised.

I wanted to read something classic, but not dry. The Great Gatsby totally fufills that! Now, I'm basically going to do a character study so, enjoy!<br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />Jay Gatsby<br /><br />Gatsby is such a bloody multi-faceted character. He was in love with Daisy for years, and never truly gave up hope that she would one day return to him. He did eveything he could to make it possible for them to be together. He was so blissfully happy when his wish finally came true, that he knew deep inside Daisy would get back with Tom, but he was afraid to admit it.<br /><br />Daisy Buchanan<br /><br />Daisy is, first and foremost, an airhead. I do not like her at all , but I pity her deeply. All she truly wants is to be loved. She knows Tom doesn't care about her, so, when she realizes Gatsby still loves her, she reaches out to him.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is by far my favorite book. I would reccomend it to everyone.<br /><br />Aimee<br />Age 13	2013-11-04

Scott Fitzgerald lying in state in 1940. He was 44 years old.<br /><br />Few books have achieved iconic status as The Great Gatsby has. It consistently ranks as the great American novel. Mark Twain's Huck Finn and Salinger's Catcher in the Rye are its only rivals, so many find it hard to believe that it had sold poorly, less 25,000 copies, after its initial print-run in 1925. Fitzgerald fell into depression and into drink. Today, it is Scribner's most lucrative title and the numbers would make Scott spin in his grave in Maryland: 500,000 copies sell annually; 185,000 digital versions alone sold in 2012; and 415,000 movie tie-in editions have sold as of April of 2013. The numbers would make Meyer Wolfsheim grin with envy. That Meyer has human molars for cufflinks years before the horrors of the Holocaust is chilling.<br /><br />The traditional interpretation of The Great Gatsby is that F. Scott Fitzgerald glamorizes and pillories the boozy, glamorous Twenties, as Nick Carraway narrates, with nostalgia, the tragic love story of what one man did for the love of one woman. The American Dream is on display, or is it? The Great Gatsby has seductive language, but that is it. The book is about appearances and seduction, the superficial. There is no plot. The famous shirt scene serves no narrative purpose. It's an indulgence. As for love story: is Daisy worth it? She is married to Tom, a millionaire, a former footballer, and a proud philistine.<br /><br />As for the American Dream on display or criticized? I think what is on display is Fitzgerald's arrested adolescent development. I know that this is harsh, but the novel feels trapped in amber, the characters incapable of depth or growth. Simply put: can you imagine an older Gatsby, or a mature Daisy Buchanan, or a Jordan Baker with some depth? Is Gatsby social criticism? The argument would imply that Fitzgerald had the critical ability to see the wealthy as vacuous and vapid twits, but there is one problem with this position: F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda wanted to be wealthy, too, live the careless lifestyle. There is no doubt that F. Scott Fitzgerald was conscious of class distinction. His courtship and marriage to Zelda was a painful reminder of class consciousness. As for Scott's capacity for critical analysis, I read the oft-quoted remark between Hemingway and Fitzgerald not as a funny remark but an honest exchange. The quote is derived from Fitzgerald's short story \\"Rich Boy\\" (1925) and it goes like this:<br /><br />Fitzgerald: \\"The rich are different from you and me.\\"<br /><br />Hemingway: \\"Yes, they have more money.\\"<br /><br />The creative result is a juvenile cast of characters with a limited range of emotions who are not very happy people, forever stuck in the past, like those who condemn themselves to `remember the good old days' while the present passes them by. If and when Fitzgerald complained of failure in his letters or journal entries, he meant it in commercial terms. He never did recapture the monetary success or the critical praise (while he was alive) that he had had from his first novel. He perceived himself as a failure. He died believing that he had failed and wasted what talent he had. If The Great Gatsby was intended as a satire on nostalgia or a cautionary romantic rags-to-riches story, then why are all his characters the same? Why did he feel compelled to draw material from his own life? Was his imagination that limited? The difference between good musicians and great musicians is that good musicians play what they know while great musicians play what they don't. The same applies to writers.<br /><br />1945 marked renewed interest in Fitzgerald. The date is significant. World War Two ended. The Great Gatsby appeared as a distant and defiant answer to the sobriety (pun intended) of the Victorian age. It was light, festive, and fun. The Great Depression that followed the publication of the novel and Fitzgerald's subsequent works -- recasting the same story, with the same type of people, but mental disintegration replacing the car wreck that killed Myrtle Wilson - all seemed to be in poor taste. A nation in the depths of economic despair wanted happy endings, escapist fantasy, and found little to sympathize with in Dick and Nicole Diver and the troubled Rosemary Hoyt in the south of France.<br /><br />The Irony of Ironies is that Fitzgerald and Hemingway repeated the same themes over and over again in their works, but it was Hemingway who grew the most, dared to change, although readers would not know it about Hemingway until the posthumous publication of The Garden of Eden.blication of the novel and Fitzgerald's subsequent works -- recasting the same story, with the same type of people, but mental disintegration replacing the car wreck that killed Myrtle Wilson - all seemed to be in poor taste.

This book is centered around the mysterious character Jay Gatsby, he throws amazing parties but no one really knows who he is, there are only rumors. When the narrator, Nick Carraway, moves into West Egg, right next to Gatsby (Of course!), he is sent an invitation to one of his parties, and the mystery ensues from there.<br />It is a story that makes you yearn for a lost love and a past you haven't lived. The party scenes are so vivid you feel as if you are there and one of the guests. The entire book is so beautiful and at times heartbreaking. It made me laugh at the awkwardness, cry at the almost love and wish I had lived in the 20's. The only part I am conflicted about is the ending. The ending, yet beautifully written, is not what I wanted it to be, but, let's be honest, what great CLASSIC book ever really ends how you want it to?

It has been years since I read this book and I feel as if I was too young and immature to appreciate its beauty at the time I read it before.

It's not difficult to become thoroughly involved in Gatsby's life, his intense love for Daisy and his mysterious upbringing. Importantly, despite its being written many years ago, it perfectly translates to today. With the economic upheavals we are currently experiencing, it's good to have be reminded that money doesn't buy you happiness...and it never will.	2013-10-10

The story is a lot more simple than the diction lets on, and after reading every single sentence as closely as possible (an English assignment), I have come to the conclusion that the &#34;literary gurus&#34; that decided to call this book a &#34;classic&#34; looked into it way to much. I won't take away the author's syntax away from what my overall opinion of the book, as I have taken into consideration the time period in which it was written, but I'm still left with an overall impression that this novel sucked. With so many great novels, American and others, I can't comprehend why high schoolers are forced to read this one. For the counter argument that I can foresee coming, the reason why I dislike the book has nothing to with the fact that I was forced into reading this by my school system. Contrarily, I have found some of the novels we have read in high school, such as 'Of Mice and Men' and the holocaust novel 'Night', to be completely worthy of their popularity (Shakespeare not included, all his stuff all sucks). On a separate note, the movie is a lot like this movie, in the sense that they both suck.<br />P.S. I apologize for the repeated use of the word &#34;suck,&#34; that was just my go-to-word for when I think something... sucks.	2013-10-07

The message being you can't bring back the past.	2013-09-22

This wasn't required reading for me in high school or college, and I hadn't seen any movie adaptations but wanted to give this &#34;classic&#34; a try.<br /><br />Although I think Fitzgerald's prose is far more eloquent than that of authors today, I found his content jumpy and without connection at times. I also failed to make a great connection to any one character, including the narrator, although he was by far the most likable.<br /><br />There really existed no great story here and when something arose to that point at the end, so was the book ending - abruptly at that.<br /><br />Hopefully others can glean what Fitzgerald was hoping to accomplish with this book - going to excess and the endless drive for a chance to regain a lost love (is that it here?), but the story was lost on me.	2013-09-19

It didn't leave me wanting more. It didn't leave me routing for the characters. Gatsby was in love with a dream, not a flesh-and-blood woman. When he encountered her again later in life after years of having been separated, she was a disappointment, yet one he still couldn't shake loose. They were both shallow creatures. Ironically, he thought he could win her love and keep her if he had enough money and a fine mansion, but none of that mattered in the end. The only likeable character was Nick. To be honest, after hearing so much about how great this book was, it was a short disappointment. I did think the author handled the accident part well in reference to the drivers and how the scene unfolded. The author did a great job of illustrating a pathetic man. The description was well done, but it didn't capture my attention from the first page, and it didn't hold it raptly until the last, but there were some parts where I wanted to keep reading. I realize it was written years ago and in a far different style than today's books, so I rated it a four, but I don't see what was so great about this book that it had the whole world talking. I've read much better ones that left me yearning for more.	2013-09-10

I have read so many really, really great books, and this one was so bad.  Sorry, Fitz, but I'm not a fan. The story line was slow, boring and tedious.  The characters were shallow and self absorbed.  If kids are still required to read this in high school, that might explain some of the drop out rate.	2013-09-10

Scott Fitzgerald.<br /><br />I just completed my third read of The Great Gatsby. I did this to help expunge the vacuous, blaring bludgeon that is the 2013 movie version from my head. This third trek through it had the added benefit of revealing even more texture and richness than I had previously experienced. This time around I understood more about Nick Carraway and identified with his ability to become a confidant, privy to others' secrets. He has complexity thrust upon him when he would rather look at life from \\"a single window\\" but ends up a forced chronicler.<br /><br />Then there is the too obvious Daisy, \\"a beautiful little fool\\". This character is almost a disappointment. She comes across as a too-oft used stereotype until you recognize that every generation produces such women in liberal amounts. Her husband Tom is much more viscous than I recall. His frustrations result from protecting traditions he cannot live up to. Jordan Baker stood out in this reading like never before. Her dishonesty, the result of not wanting to be \\"at a disadvantage\\", actually reveals more about the period than any other character. Jordan's observations are both breezy and deep, \\"And I like large parties. They're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy.\\" and \\"I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone's away.\\"<br /><br />And what of Gatsby? He is so obviously a juvenile construct that it is amazing that people fell for him. However, money and self-interests are powerful tools for delusion and acceptance. Carraway's observation that Gatsby's biography was \\"like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines\\" is comically astute, yet he too gets sucked in. Gatsby's \\"Platonic conception of himself\\" is one he cannot evolve.<br /><br />Fitzgerald said, \\"You don't write because you want to say something, you write because you have something to say.\\" In this book he had something to say but most of it was in the form of a hidden joke for his own enjoyment. I cannot help but think he was having his own generation on by writing The Great Gatsby. One thing is for certain, he wrote one of the best closing lines to a novel ever.is book he had something to say but most of it was in the form of a hidden joke for his own enjoyment.

Scott Fitzgerald was an excellent author and this book gives a fascinating look into the world of the 1920s.  I usually read non-fiction military history.  Nevertheless, I decided to read this after seeing the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio.  I read this book on a Kindle HD.  There are no negatives with the Kindle version of this book.<br /><br />For a story that was written almost a century ago, it still manages to capture the imagination of the modern reader.  This story, which is not overly complex, is compelling enough to keep most people engaged.  The reader’s heart goes out to Gatsby and Daisy, two people who clearly belong together but are kept apart by the circumstances of their life.  The ending is just as poignant when no one shows up for the funeral.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is just a good story that will grab both the attention and heart of most readers.  As someone who normally reads non fiction, this was a good, thought provoking change of pace.	2013-08-25

And for a privileged few who enjoyed the lavish parties thrown by Jay Gatsby, it was a time of decadence, vibrancy, and texture.<br /><br />But who was Jay Gatsby?  Did anyone know? And how were all these hangers-on connected to him?<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00EJRPZEQ The Great Gatsby]] is a story narrated by Nick Carraway, who lived next door to Gatsby in a modest home, and who was a second cousin to Daisy Buchanan, who lived across the water with her husband Tom.  Some would say that Gatsby had purchased his home directly across from theirs for a specific reason.<br /><br />The story spans a short time in that Long Island summer season, with all the frivolity of blissful partying.  But this season would be very different.  Tragedy would conclude it, and the masses would disperse, almost as if none of them had even connected.<br /><br />And Nick would be left to piece together the tattered world left by those same oblivious masses:  especially the careless Buchanans.<br /><br />This was my first read of the novel, although I have seen one movie based on the story.  I am glad I read this, if only to experience firsthand the author's lyrical prose that digs deep and conveys so much about the glittering world populated by these dazzling and superficial characters.  This one definitely is a five star read.	2013-08-24

I would definitely recommend for those who enjoy reading a book a movie is based off of.<br /> When I saw the movie I was VERY impressed on how well it followed the book. I noticed there were a lot of parts that if you did not read this book, it would be overseen in the movie. I give The Great Gatsby two thumbs up!<br />  Disclaimer: I was open to why they changed what they did in the movie. It made sense from a cinema aspect.	2013-08-21

I have to wonder what books were being written at that time that made this book supposedly so outstanding.  It was good, but didn't grab me like current writers (Grisham, Flynn, etc ) do.

Yes it is a portrayal of a decadence in an age of affluence and there is a theme of love in the pursuit of a lover from the past, but there is little to love in this book and most of the characters are unlovable as well.  Perhaps the lavish films based on the book have added to its reputation.	2013-08-18

I gave this short novel a new try, but found it dated and frustrating.  The character's behavior and choices are unlike anything I have experienced. If you try to suspend judgement and focus on it being a period piece, when women had fewer choices and society was harsher and less forgiving, it seems more feasible.  The forced party happiness is pathetic, and then so are the drunken attendees. These characters are not likeable and not respectable in any circumstances or times.	2013-08-17

US	7013138	R1NKUSKSASJ5W0	B00BTJQF0A	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Digital_Ebook_Purchase	4	0	0	N	Y	Old classic	Spoiler alert! I read this book many years ago and had forgotten some of the detail but I really enjoyed it once again. I almost felt I was at Gatsby's parties they were so well described. We really got an insight into the fickleness of the 'rich set' who seemed to live only to have fun regardless of the consequences. I felt sorry for Gatsy and how naive he was. He was prepared to go to any lengths to be an 'insider' but for all his depth of character could not see how unworthy those people were of him, especially Daisy. He truly loved her and the reader too probably hoped true love would win and she would choose Gatsby above all else. Unfortunately money and materialism came first, without those things she was incapable of love and poor Gatsby could not see that. The reader can see how false everything is and what a hopeless and romantic Gatsy is and tragedy almost looms from the outset. It is a sad story but we learn a lot about people on the way.	2013-08-15

I loved the writing, but I have trouble saying &#34;I love&#34; a book, when it is so incredibly sad.

I am not one who believes that the &#34;rich&#34; are the bad guys.

A contrite story and a fairly elementary style of writing. I guess back in 1925 it would have been interesting, and it would be a good book for high-schoolers to read as a history lesson of what was going on during that time of our country.  But I was hoping for more depth. After reading the book, I have no interest in watching the several movie adaptions.	2013-07-29

I like reading the classics.  I like Dickens.  I love Shakespeare.  Catcher in the Rye made me cry.  However I found this story about as interesting as pushing through one of Victor Hugo's dry descriptions of French architecture.<br /><br />I think there are two main reasons for this:<br /><br />1. The writing felt emotionally distant.  It made me lose interest in the events of Nick Carraway's first Gatsby party.<br /><br />2. I could not relate to the main character - cynical Nick Carraway.  He seemed to identify himself as morally aloof from the other characters, and it made me less keen to follow his adventures.<br /><br />I'm sure that my complaints could be argued as relevant to the author's end goal, but if I don't enjoy the journey, then what's the point?	2013-07-24

What is not to like, I saw the old movie but had not read the book so I decided to read the novel before I saw this new movie.

I couldn't relate to the characters and I think I was too young to get why on earth someone could be so obsessed about a pretty vacuous person like Daisy.<br /><br />Many years later, having been obsessed and obsessed about myself and after watching Baz Luhrman's version of the Great Gatzby, I developed an understanding of what I think Fitzgerald was saying in this novel. I was inspired by the movie to have another read. I am about 3/4's of the way through [I'm pretty sure about what happens in the end]- and am enthralled with the prose and the story. And of course, I have the vision to go along with the words.<br /><br />If you want a well constructed, thoughtful story about class and money and the excesses of life- then pick it up and have a read. You won't be disappointed. It is a rich experience [excuse the pun].	2013-07-02

I particularly liked this on the kindle/ereader, because I could immediately have a word defined by highlighting it (trust me, this book has an extensive vocabulary!). So, I would also recommend reading it on an e-reader also. Just read it, old sport.	2013-07-02

I think my experience in High School was so overwrought with analyzing every aspect of the book that I missed out on actually enjoying this incredible novel. I purchased a copy for my kindle in April and have read it three times already. What a difference it makes to read a book with abandon and no analyzing! I absolutely adore this book now.

It's not long, and it's not the \\"hard read\\" that great literature is reputed to be...it is accessible and attention-holding, and a well-outlined portrait of a society that Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda were immersed in. He knew it thoroughly, and portrayed its shallowness well, at the same time showing the rancid underlives of its main characters.  Forget the movie, read the book!	2013-06-26

I'm not sure if it is THE great American novel, but definitely one of the best I have read	Certainly a great tease into the world of FSF fiction. Completely circular and incredibly finished, it is one of e few novels you will remember more by the things said in its contents as reflections and inner dialogues of its characters than by he story itself. An amazing read if you ask me, but the short-ride to that which I truly believe is THE great American novel, naturally by Fitzgerald, The Beautiful and Damned	2013-06-26

I like that the book has so much detail, and the way Nick looked at things was amazing. What I didn't like is that it did jump from place to place. I think it would have been even better than it already is if it was from Gatsby or Daisy's phone of view. Don't get me wrong it was a amazing book. I do not recommend it to children who read advanced books (such as myself). I do recommend it to people that love the littlest things in life. It is a great romantic novel.	2013-06-25

Poetic writing, irony, and story are absorbing and timeless as much of Gatsby's world is still around today. Lessons in character and an investigation of values make this book a learning experience.

This book comes from a time when readers more appreciated writing as a craft in itself in addition to the story or plot.  But, if you try to readjust your expectations and slow down intending to really see Fitzgerald's craft you will encounter: uniqueness, the depth and richness of phrasing, and the beauty of words arranged in often surprising and surprisingly vivid ways.<br /><br />I liked it.	2013-06-25

I read the book back in the day in high school & wanted to re-read it again to see if I liked it any better & plus, the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio was coming out. Let me say, that re-reading it again did NOT make me enjoy the book anymore. It's really a bunch of rich people partying the whole time & it's just a really slow read. Ohhh the problems that the rich had made me yawn because they were such small problems (i.e. air conditioning not working). The book in my opinion isn't that great of a read but for some reason people seem to glorify F. Scott Fitzgerald's work...for some unknown reason to me.	2013-06-24

A beautiful trip down memory lane is what transpired. An enthralling read 30 years ago as a teenager, I couldn't believe how much more I took away from this classic American novel as an adult with a little American history behind me. Beautifully crafted, with delightful images of the hedonistic lifestyle The Hamptons  juxtaposed with the harsh life of The Ashes. I am so pleased I took a few hours to take this trip down memory lane.	2013-06-21

Well written.<br /><br />An American classic.<br /><br />Dialog with an original, memorable ring to it.<br /><br />So what am I missing?<br /><br />Ten opening pages of conflict-free narrative and throat-clearing.<br />Long rambling descriptive passages.<br /><br />Unsympathetic, amoral, shallow characters.<br /><br />Dated.<br /><br />Anti-Semitic: how often must we be told that Meyer Wolfshiem has a big nose? With hairs growing out of it - just to make sure he is unappealing.<br /><br />To say this book \\"explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess\\" is being very generous. One could just as easily say that it lacks focus, meanders, and displays many of the traits of a first novel: vague protagonist, too much description, lack of conflict.<br /><br />Oh, it's literary.<br /><br />The only real conflict comes three-quarters of the way through the novel, when (spoiler alert) Gatsby's lover Daisy `accidentally' kills her husband's mistress. Now this was good and the drama and tension picked up sharply--only to be dropped toward the protagonist's naval-gazing.<br /><br />And, before someone tells me how wonderful the writing is, yes, it is, to a point, but please take another look at the number of sentences written in passive voice.<br /><br />Would have made an excellent short story, starting at page 120.<br /><br />If written today, I suspect this book would be most likely be rejected by NY.	2013-06-21

If the narrator to this audio was better then I might have enjoyed the story even more but he really was awful, especially when he lamely tried to speak a woman's voice. He botched Jordan, Daisy, and Myrtle's characters something dreadful.<br /><br />As for this classic by Fitzgerald, published in 1925, it was a sad tale of wealthy society and lack of morals all round. Seeing into the carefree lives of these couples via Nick's connection with Gatsby allowed the reader a glimpse into their consequences. It was pathetically similar to strata of some of today's society where morals fly out the window and tragedy is doomed to surface when free spirits are never grounded in being true to themselves	2013-06-20

We were/still are a country so consumed with the acquisition of wealth that is has virtually destroyed the soul of the country. The Yale-educated F. Scott Fitzgerald (a cousin of Francis Scott Key, who wrote the Star Spangled Banner in 1812) wrote the best novel about America in what has been described as the American century, yet the novel also proved eerily prophetic on several counts: it hinted at the destructive forces of the capitalist system, pre-dating the disastrous 1929 Wall Street crash that would bring about the Great Depression and World War II; there are descriptive quotations that mirror the racism and anti-semitism of the roaring twenties, and there is the constant clash of the establishment vs. the nuveaux riche, the class warfare of which Fitzgerald was a personal witness.	2013-06-17

My memory of the story line was dark and confused and i wanted to re-read before seeing Baz Luhrman's new movie.

I think that it was an extremely apt quote because it set the entire mood of the Novel.<br /><br />&#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; is like a rollercoaster ride of decadence, betrayl, love, hate, rich and poor, but most of all extreme amusement and a platter smorgasbord of words that i had forgotten even exist. It is written about an era by a man who who lived in that era which gives it an air of the historical realisim one would not find if it had been written yesterday. It has been researched that Fitzgerald felt much like the narrator of the novel  &#34;I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of lilfe&#34;<br /><br />Sugary Daisy, wild Myrtle and the shadey charm Jay Gatsby himself fly past you in a swirl of champange bubbles and false promises, all you have to do is hold on until the ride is over and you are left ruffled, dizzy and with the tremendous urge to do it again.	2013-06-16

US	7979332	R3PQ5PK1CU6BCS	B000FC0PDA	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Digital_Ebook_Purchase	5	0	0	N	Y	I Love Gatsby	This summer I’m reading some of my favorite novels again, and reading some new ones I’ve been told about. One of my favorite novels from AP English was The Great Gatsby, so I’m beginning with this one. I love this novel because it holds so many meanings at the same time. It’s a novel about longing to remake yourself into an image of your own choice and not the choice you were handed by  your background. That makes it a universal novel, but also, it’s such an American novel because of  the strong American myth about anyone being able to “move up” in the world with hard work and planning. In this instance, Gatz remakes himself into Gatsby. Nick is the narrator, and he meets Mr. Gatz, Gatsby’s father, at the end of Gatsby’s life.. From Mr. Gatz, Nick learns about Gatsby’s plans to better himself and get out  of the life he would have been destined to stay in if he hadn’t worked so hard to get out of it.. Gatz shows Nick a list his son had written in the inside back cover of Hopalong Cassidy: “Rise from bed, 6:00, Dumbell exercise and wall-scaling, 6:15-6:30” and more. So Gatsby reinvented himself and had the big fancy house and car to prove it. Throughout the novel Nick writes that underneath the glittery surface, Gatsby is insubstantial. He never talks about who he is. It’s like he only reflects the world around him. He longs for a woman he can’t have. He longs to belong to the upper classes, but he is never truly accepted. He longs for whatever the green light at the end of that dock means for him. We all as readers know that it means a lot more than the longing for the woman in the house leading up from that dock.	2013-06-13

The story is one of selfish, self centered, snobbish characters and not for me.  It's a true &#34;modern&#34; day tragedy.  I'm disappointed that a public school would find anything redeeming in the story for my step son to read it.  The only lesson in this story is money can't make you happy....	2013-06-13

The story haunts me and every so often I feel compelled to read it yet again. Fitzgerald's writing is clear and spare yet delivers an emotional impact. The characters are not easily forgotten. Gatsby endures as a character because, in his depths, he is a poor boy in love with a rich girl whom he can't have. And that truth never changes no matter how rich and intriguing he appears. Underneath the veneer lies a vulnerability that only love, or illusion, can engender. Nick, as narrator, gives the readers a person we can rely on even though we know he too is flawed. Gatsby tells a story that never ages: the pursuit of wealth and status, unrequited longing and the consequences that result when one's single-mindedness threatens the status quo.	2013-06-13

It deserves this title, as it is a truly fantastic book from start to finish! It revolves around the adventures of mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and the unlimited amount of hope he carried in his heart! Fitzgerald has crafted a book that perfectly captures the feel of the early 1920's and gives us a story that is intriguing, fascinating and brilliantly written. You fully engage with the characters and get caught up in the world they inhabit. A truly great read! Highly recommended!	2013-06-12

I bought it for its literary praise and sudden ascension in popularity with its recent movie adaptation.  As the review’s title suggest, this is about a love story, but not a cheesy chick flick, for it rather delves into the american aristocracy of the early nineties with its utter extravagance, narcissism and egotism.  The plot is interesting as we follow Gatsby’s story from his neighbor's point of view, Nick.  Everything that we are told about Gatsby comes from Nick’s personal encounter with him and what people have told Nick about their encounter with him.<br /><br />Read it for Fitzgerald’s mastery of language, the richness and depth of characters and for the voyage into the aristocratic nineties.	2013-06-11

I can see why it's taught in high school, it's got it all: symbolism, metaphor, social commentary; all presented in a novel that is beautifully written and mercifully short. It is Fitzgerald's crowning achievement, attained just soon enough to speed the dissolution of his and Zelda's lives, too soon to sustain his reputation as a great writer within his lifetime.	2013-06-09

Well, we never read it in high school.  Back in the 60s, this was considered as far too racy for us to read in a small Texas town.  And, I just never got around to reading it.  With the movie coming out, I decided to read it before I saw the movie.  [By the way, I loved this version of the movie.  And, I'm glad I read the book first, it really explained the movie.]  Having read some of the lead reviews, I agree that reading it at the age of 64 is totally different from someone reading it at the age of 16.  Then, I would have loved to have seen Daisy and Gatsby fall in love and live happily ever after.  Today, I can clearly see that everyone in the book, with the exception of the narrator, is totally self-centered, and cares about no one else.  There is an amazing feeling of sadness that surrounds everyone and everything.  Set in the current time, the 1920s, it is also easy to see how it is comparible to today's America.  Behind the glitz and glammer, there is nothing.	2013-06-09

Teachers deconstruct a novel like this to the point that students do not have to think nor appreciate the wonder of language.  That is what i rediscovered in reading Fitzgerald's work as an adult... language, beautiful language.  It appeared as ancient script with intense vocabulary and flowing descriptive narratives.  It was wonderful to see something so magically crafted.  The novels I have read over the years and recently do not compare.  It was another time when language mattered and conveyed the wonder of a craft al but lost.<br /><br />Frank Champine	2013-06-08

On the other hand, I probably would not have &#34;gotten&#34; it in high school, either. There is so much more here than there is in either movie. (The Robert Redford version is lovely, but does nothing to explain how/why Gatsby is wooing Daisy so heavily and there's no sense to the final tragedy. The Leo DiCaprio version is just to show us the bling of the period.)<br /><br />There's good reason why Fitzgerald is a highly regarded American legend. His pacing his slow, but not so slow to get boring. He has a way of showing us the excesses of the rich of this period with simple writing. His writing is simple; not florid, but you can see, feel, hear what is happening. And, he does this with seeming ease. No fancy language or literary tricks. He's just a great writer - plain and simple. He doesn't pass judgement on the characters but describes their actions so you can make your own decisions on these persons' sense of morality.<br /><br />I love this period of American culture and would love to be able to transport back in time to this period for just a few days so I could see what it was really like. Fitzgerald's writings only make this desire in me stronger.	2013-06-08

Fitzgerald's amazing ability with words alone is well worth the read.  It's a slice of history written at a time when a generation of young writers were breaking with American tradition which had been suffused with Edwardian sensibilities, right down to the flowery language in books and the shallow caste system that had existed since the early days of white America.  The novel remains timely because that caste system still exists in somewhat altered form.<br /><br />Other books to read are anything written in Europe by American expats at the time, like Hemingway and all those who were so changed by WWl and influenced by Paris between the wars.	2013-06-07

I didn't feel connected to the characters.  I think that was mainly because I didn't really get to know them.  I'm an avid reader and should have been able to read this in a day and it took me just over a week.  I'm not sure how this became a classic.  My daughter drug me to the movie after I read the book. I don't think I've ever said this before, but I liked the movie better.	2013-06-07

I never had to read Gatsby in high school and I'm glad. There's a good chance I would have hated it, unless I had an awesome teacher to bring all out. But I loved this book as an adult. I actually did the Immersion Reading with this one on my Kindle so Jake Gyllenhall narrated it for me as I read along. That was lovely.<br />I had no idea what any of the story was about. I found it all very interesting. There is so much to discuss in terms of excess, wanting what doesn't belong to you, undying hope, love, deception, the trouble that comes with boredom, self sacrifice and tragedy.<br />I think by the end  I wasn't supposed to like any of the characters, (as they were some very shallow people), but you know what? I did like Gatsby... the whole time... all the way to the end. Must be my shallow side coming out.:)	2013-06-06

The term 'great American/Irish/British' novel is bandied about frequently as commentators generally measure the health or otherwise of fiction. But Gatsby truly is in a league of its own. This wonderful tale of dreams and dreams crushed, of idealism and dissipation, is narrated by Nick, who finds himself a neighbour of Jay Gatsby, a man who likes to throw ravishing, magical, three-day parties to his hordes of admirers. There are few friends, as we discover, only the speculative new rich and aspiring rich who wonder about how he came by his wealth. It is assumed that he is corrupt. There is a love-story at the heart of the book too, and hints of racism and anti-semitism trickle through in a couple of lines (not authorial racism/anti-semitism so much as strands which are clearly a feature of this depiction of Long Island Jazz Age society). It is a novel you will think about long after you've read it. Don't see the Baz Luhrman movie. In comparison to this, it is rubbish, and it prettifies Daisy, the object of Gatsby's affections. Unlike in the movie, the book pulls no punches when it comes to a laying bare of human domination and submission, misogyny, corruption, some violence, and the general, rotten, uncaring quality of human beings when they are being fickle and selfish. It is also beautiful written, with exquisite sentences to chew over!	2013-06-06

I am an English teacher who is checking classics off my &#34;guilt list.&#34; I finally got around to The Great Gatsby and I honestly cannot figure out what the fuss is about? Fitzgerald has fun, little social observations that serve as great but brief asides, but the book, as a whole, is dry and lifeless. The characters are all flat and without souls. Since there is no real plot to speak off, this vehicle is character driven. I honestly hated every character who are all are more vapid and insipid than the next. Just a dull and utterly boring book. No wonder it was such a bomb when initially published. Read it to impress your friends if you want, but you sure aren't missing anything.	2013-06-05

Like so many others I read this in high school.  At the time I was moved by the tragedy of love lost; all that touches the heart and imagination of a young girl.

Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby in a two week mini course for 11th grade Literature.  That was more decades ago than I care to remember.  What I do remember is that Gatsby was always so cool, Nick was ripped of his innocence, Daisy's voice was full of money and Tom so did not get what he deserved.  As a high school student, all of the dark under tones of the story did not register.  As an adult, the adult situations were far too real.  I would not recommend this book for middle school study.  A related observation, is that the movie with Redford and Farrow was like an ice cream social with all the beautiful pastel colors.  I love that movie to this day.  The current movie with it's art deco and dark colors actually makes the story come alive.	2013-06-03

Love affairs and a nasty incident complicate the easy living summertime plot and force the characters to confront reality; however, being as self-absorbed as they are, reality do not last long and the characters soon return to their original state of selfishness.<br />In this novel, Fitzgerald captures the lifestyle and mood of the Jazz Era and develops his characters as great examples of the &#34;beautiful&#34; people of that era.	2013-06-03

Essentially, this is the prototypical Great American Novel - that old cliche of pop literary culture so often used by writers and laymen alike. The book conflates America's promise of the past, corruption of the present, and hope for the future. It is the beautiful and ugly side of American ambition, optimism, and sense of invincibility that makes so many Americans feel immortal.<br />The story, which Mencken inevitably declared to be a trivial anecdote, is nevertheless an exciting look into twentysomething romanticism. Glamorous parties, nouveuax riche and old money values colliding, the luxury of youthful idleness, whirlwind romance. This is the perfect book for a high school student with dreams.<br /><br />More than anything, this book struck me as a metaphor for timeless American ethos. Gatsby makes the paradoxical attempt to move against the tide of the future to bring back the past. He wants, like so many people, to bring back that magical moment in his life when he thought life was eternal, the world was beautiful, and he was the biggest man in it. He wants to recapture the love that opened a plethora of infinite possibilities, turning his back on the reality of changing times and changing people.<br /><br />Gatsby's greatness is in making himself and others believe the sublime fantasy that thinks itself real. He wants his Daisy as so many other people have wanted theirs - pure, perfect, and existing solely for him. The ambition to defeat life may become tragic, but it never gives up hope - the hope of a better, stronger tomorrow. And in the end, it is action that moves the world, but it is hope that keeps the world alive.	2013-06-03

These reviewers are completely missing the beauty of the book.<br /><br />The characters in The Great Gatsby were never meant to be likable (except for, maybe, Nick).  And the intention was never to dazzle us with awe or hatred of the fancy folk of Long Island.  This book is a tragedy. A tragic look into the hollow, lonely existence of these sad, lost, and desperate characters. And, along the way, Fitzgerald gives us some beautiful art in his sentences, in the word usage and structure, and also in the thoughts/feelings they convey.  Sentences/ideas that stay with you.<br /><br />Probably none better than the last few sentences: \\"...future that year by year recedes before us...tomorrow we will run faster, stretch our arms out further...So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\"  That really stays with me, and is profound and haunting.<br /><br />I find the book as a whole to be this way, haunting.  A masterpiece, nonetheless.	2013-06-01

It reads something like Robert Penn Warren's &#34;All the King' s Men&#34; , in that an introspective narrator learns an indelible lesson from observing and interacting with a character that seems, at least for a while, to be larger than life. In the process, we the readers can share in Nick' s discoveries about himself and about what in life is real and what is manufactured.<br />The whole thing is more than just a story, because the writing is at times so perfectly and poetically expressed.

A great writer is rarely recognised in his or her own time. They are often denigrated and their books misunderstood. Like Herman Hesse Fitzgerald suffered at the hands of critics, critics whether they are professionals or just amateurs are often the ones who are least capable of recognising genius because criticism is usually intellectual and the intellect can only grasp what it knows and can understand. I am so glad these classics are being discovered now by a younger generation. Maybe it will inspire better writing than we have today, when so much is merely fodder for short attention spans. I can think of only a handful of writers that fall into this category, Herman Hesse, Lawrence Durrell and a new comer...a new writer for our generation, which has not yet been recognised, Adriana Koulias.	2013-05-30

I remember really enjoying the book back in high school, but I couldn't remember anything when I read it this past week for book club.  It was like reading it for the first time.<br /><br />It was brought up that the characters were really well developed and that the novel was well written.  I found that the characters in fact were not well developed.  I walked away feeling like I really didn't know any of them.  The only thing I took away from the characters was that Nick looked down on everyone, and Tom, Daisy, Jordan, and Jay were very superficial.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby was very descriptive, which I enjoyed, but the thing that bothered me was improper punctuation.  I wanted to mark up the book with corrections!!<br /><br />The plot was really lacking for me as well.  There was a dinner, a couple of parties, a hit and run, and a murder suicide.  That may seem like a lot that happened, but it didn't really go into much detail of the events.  So, with that being said, I was really disappointed with the book this go around.<br /><br />My full review can be found at http://thebookwormrunner.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-roaring-twenties.html.	2013-05-30

This story portrays the tragedy of someone who tried.  The book is a whirl of lust and tragic death that climbs to the mountaintop of hope and possibility and then descends to the depths of despair when all the attempts to buy happiness fall to pieces.  This is a good wakeup call for those who pursue the American Dream with reckless abandon.  You cannot buy your family, a spouse's love, or a do-over for a mistake.  Money is a merciless god.  And it makes you miss the real and valuable relationships after all.  Nick is that one person who really cared and really tried to help Gatsby.  And Nick wanted to be a friend whether Gatsby had money or not.  So in the end, The Great Gatsby is a reminder of what is really valuable in life.	2013-05-30

Due to the new film that came out, I downloaded it on the Kindle Fire to re-read it, having not done so since middle school (in my mid 30s now).  I remember enjoying it as a child and loving what the instructor would point out, but now, decades later, so much more is to be found within.  While a fairly short novel, the amount of depth to each character is almost profound as one moment you like one and a few pages later you have a different view of them.  Flash forward and you think something again entirely different.  Without spoiling anything, what it says about the past, the future, money, wealth, love, loss, the 'American dream,' rich and poor, black and white, and countless other topics is awe inspiring.  As I said, nothing I wrote is anymore than what anyone else has written about it over the past near 100 years, but if you have yet to read it or if it has been awhile, do yourself a favor and dive into it.	2013-05-29

Scott Fitzgerald	Fitzgerald has a unique writing style and describes life prior to the stock market crash of 1929. His characters are described in such detail that they come alive.  However, this is not a feel-good book since their decadent life style leads to the unfortunate and undeserved death of two main characters.This classic is a quick read and well worth the time.

Gatsby is a troubled man who cannot see past regaining the love he lost years before. He made himself who he wanted to be; who he believes he should have been from the start. It appears that he is  a little shady in his business dealings as well. Gatsby moves across the water from his love (I won't mention her name), there he throws lavish parties in hopes to find someone who knows her, so that he can re-establish his their connection. There are multiple stories that come together in this short novel. Tom is married to Daisy, and is having an affair. Jordan plays the role of Nick's love interest, and facilitator, along with Nick, for Gatsby's pursuit. Nick is the narrator of the tale. All the lives intertwine, and an accident culminates the undoing of them all. It is a sad ending, a sparkling, larger than life personality, who believes beyond the reality that he can pick up where he and his paramour left off and regain the love of his life.	2013-05-29

Here they were, fresh out of gym class or a chem lab and all they could do, probably, was think about how hungry they were or what they were going to do on the weekend. ANYTHING but Fitzgerald. \\"Just shut up, man!\\" they probably thought.<br /><br />But I couldn't help it: there is such a texture to Fitzgerald's prose that it moved me every time I read it...year after year after year. What POWER Fitzgerald had, to be able to accomplish that. Gatsby LIVES in these pages: he has a vibrancy that touches me in so many ways. His love for her is so ideal, of course, that she would never have lived up to it, so it was ill-fated from the start -- Nick, and we, could see it plainly: \\"He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God.\\"<br /><br />But it's wasted on kids who only think of the moment -- and on high school guys in particular, who debase it further. We all know what they want...I was that way myself. I, too, was doomed from the start.<br /><br />So Gatsby, as it says in the opening pages, was a true tragic hero, ruined by his own \\"flaw\\": the quest he could never achieve. Though Nick tells us \\"he turned out all right in the end,\\" we all know that he will not survive these pages intact. He was in love with an image cast in his mind and heart, and no mere person could live up to it.<br /><br />One of the author's original wishes was to name this book UNDER THE RED, WHITE, AND BLUE, but reality intruded there, too: he was too late getting his wish to the printer and the cover had already been completed. As his title would have implied, this beautiful country of ours was built on a similar ideal, one it constantly transgresses (since those who propel it are, after all, human, and similarly flawed). Sadly, the \\"real\\" world intruded on his own life as well, and he died poorly, as Hemingway would say, never realizing his own true potential.<br /><br />Perhaps the only solace is that Fitzgerald DID achieve greatness, and of course does live on. The beauty of this work, as well as others he penned, will probably remain forever lasting achievements of great, classic literature. Despite the flaws of his own life, despite his misspent talent and its tragic outcome, he does live on in these works.<br /><br />THE GREAT GATSBY is a true gem. It's a testament to what literature can be, of the soaring vision mere words can bring to mind. Don't miss out on it.ate getting his wish to the printer and the cover had already been completed.

Although I loved the short stories by F Scott Fitzgerald, and I loved The Beautiful and the Damned.  His other works are lighter, less poetic and not so tragic.  The dialogue in The Great Gatsby was just too artificial and the many depths of meaning layered among the work allegory, symbolism, etc just too much to take in.  I just didn't want to work that hard as a reader.  I never liked the movie either.<br /><br />If you think you would like F Scott Fitzgerald, as a lighter version of social commentary on the 1920's, which was the time period F Scott Fitzgerald lived in, then read the short stories.  I also enjoyed reading F Scott Fitzgerald self-biography.  It was said that The Great Gatsby was somewhat biographical, and F Scott Fitzgerald was well educated, wealthy, and narcissist just like his character.  Although he later divorced I don't think F Scott Fitzgerald's own love affairs were quite as tragic as his main character.<br /><br />I have written a parody on [[ASIN:1444469118 The Perils of Pauline]] myself, entitled, [[ASIN:B008VYA4TE Pauline's Perils of Perplexity]] so I am intensely interested in the classics of American Literature, but The Great Gatsby is just too depressing for me.  But as a work of importance to understand the time period, it is worth reading so I gave it 3 stars.  All I can say is children do your homework and read the book, but you don't have to like it.	2013-05-25

That about sums it up. Era writing. Creative plot. Flare and color. Sigh.... Fiztgerald really captures the time period. Since it was his own time, I guess that's not so shocking. The movies always put a bit of their own era into the costumes, make-up, and music, but the book really takes you back in time. Daisy and Gatsby were long lost lovers. She married another man for wealth. He created it to impress her. In the end a tragedy deprives them both. While Gatsby does the heroic thing, Daisy disappoints. That's about all I can say since I don't want to give away any spoilers. The movies have already done enough of that.	2013-05-24

What was interesting to me was the look at the parties of the Roaring Twenties. What was not interesting or likable were any of the characters, with the possible exception of Gatsby himself. He was the only one who seemed to deeply care about anything, who had a big dream and was determined to make it come true, by any means necessary. Nick, the narrator, seemed all too conveniently accommodating and non-judgmental, without any passion or commitment to much of anything, a leaf swirled in the pond. He did not feel real to me. Daisy, Myrtle (?) and Tom were one-note caricatures, rather than having any dimension.<br /><br />I can't help but wonder if many of the people who LOVED this book haven't been sold by The Emperor's New Clothes syndrome - everybody else praised this as a classic, therefore, it HAS to be great. I'm glad I finally got it off my TBR list, but in many ways it felt like much noise and glitter about nothing. Perhaps this means it did perfectly epitomize that era.	2013-05-22

"	Having somehow not been forced to read this book, it never really crossed my radar as something that I wanted to read. And now with the film out, I decided to finally get around to the book. Happy that I did.<br /><br />The buzz words about this book go on about how it depicts the Jazz Age and a certain segment of NYC and the North Shore. It does indeed capture the zeitgeist of that time and that place. But what this book does do really well and what few others do so well is tell a story. And what a wonderfully written story it is. The words, the sentences, the metaphors all are crafted by a masterful writer. I was sometimes lost in phrases that I had to read over and over because they were that beautiful. Sentences like \\"So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight\\".<br /><br />Our story, told from the vantage of Nick Carraway is about love. Whose love? Why the love of the mysterious Jay Gatsby for Daisy Buchanan. Mystery seems to an aphrodisiac. An aphrodisiac that Nick is drawn to. Quickly he is caught in the orbit of the Great Gatsby. Into worlds of excess, decadence, and of course into worlds of love and adultery. To reveal more would give away far too much. Especially for a book that is under 200 pages and can be read in one sitting. But what can be said of the book is that it leaves one with an impression that lingers. Thinking about the story there's just something on the edge of your lips that you want to say about it but that you just can't unless the person has read the book too.<br /><br />It's a beautiful book, wonderfully well-written, and with engaging characters. Some of whom you may want to kill. What more could you want?	2013-05-22

Phrases from this book have stayed with me over the years:<br /><br />\\"Daisy and Gatsby looked at me remotely, possessed by intense life\\";and \\"Gatsby bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths\\"; and finally, the famous end to the novel: \\"so we  beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\"<br /><br />Such is the symbolic power of the story, taking us from the immense wealth of a Long Island millionaire  lifestyle into the industrial dumping ground of the Valley of Ashes,watched over by the huge eyes of a long-forgotten oculist, Dr TJ Eckleberg, that I believe The Great Gatsby is the kind of book we should be reading for our times.<br /><br />Read The Great Gatsby for a tragic contrast between careless hedonism/accumulation of vast wealth, and harsh reality.

This isn't the first time I've read The Great Gatsby. I read it in<br />high school, absorbed as much as I needed to pass the class, and<br />I remembered only as much as cultural references reinforced.<br />I decided to read the book again in preparation for seeing the<br />latest Hollywood version. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I'm<br />glad I read the book.<br />In high school, I didn't have the patience, the resources, or the<br />ability to fully appreciate the assignment. I'm sure I had plenty<br />of time, but I wasn't about to spend any more of it than<br />absolutely necessary on a then 40-year-old story, even though I<br />lived on Long Island and had actually been to Great Neck.<br />Patience was always in short supply when it came to school<br />work, but I was reading it voluntarily now, and I gave it the<br />effort it deserved. I looked up every word I didn't recognize, and<br />researched every reference I didn't understand. Language,<br />culture, and society have changed quite a bit in 90 years, so I<br />spent a lot of time on the Internet while I was reading. Each<br />chapter took at least an hour. But it was all worth it.<br />I'd give the book six stars, if I could. But I invested much more<br />time in this slim volume than most people would be willing<br />devote to it. What if I hadn't looked everything up? I'm pretty<br />sure my review would be unchanged. Most of my research<br />merely confirmed what I had guessed, and most of what I<br />couldn't guess was of no consequence. Everything in the book<br />was there for a reason, but the story is strong enough to<br />withstand a casual reading. In retrospect, I see it was strong<br />enough to withstand a casual and careless reading by a high<br />school student. How else can I explain the desire to read it<br />again? I could have just seen the movie.<br />I will see the movie, although I wonder how well it will hold up<br />in comparison to the book.

Bottom line: I was right when I was in high school. This just isn't much of a book. I understand why it might have been popular in the '20s, but it doesn't deserve its status as an undying classic. There's just not that much to it.<br /><br />I've always thought Hemingway and Fitzgerald were both better as short story writers than novelists. &#34;Gatsby&#34; reads like an overlong short story to me.

Fitzgerald's writing style is astonishing and drop dead gorgeous.

Your green light still shines across the water&#34;, I said to myself. Only 4.99? That's ridiculous! You could also buy a hamburger and fries for that price, but will a hamburger and fries feed your soul? NO, BUT THE GREAT GATSBY WILL.

Yes I think it is the great American novel. There is not one nice character in the entire book but what a interesting bunch of people. The writing is so spare and so beautiful, Daisy is so shallow and dizzy but what power she has, Tom is horrid, dangerous and vile, Nick is weak but knows he is better than most and Jay.........words fail me	2013-05-15

It hasn't. I still feel that writing about these two self centered people who care nothing for anyone but themselves is a waste of pen and paper. I did appreciate the art deco visuals and can understand why the movie will be a success. I'm not going but I saw the trailers and it seems that the producer made excellent use of Fitzgerald's elaborate 1930's art deco visuals. I'm still at a loss as to why it is sometimes called a classic. It can't compare with To Kill A Mockingbird, Of Mice and Men, Jane Eyre,  Picture of Dorian Grey or any of the &#34;real&#34; American classics.	2013-05-14

Somehow I managed not to read this book when I was in high school or college and wondered whether this American classic would speak to me.  Wow!  This is as near a perfect book as I've ever read.  The story is compelling, the characters alive, and the writing flawless.  F. Scott Fitzerald was a master at description.  And although the post-WWI 1920's was a very different time in our history, the Jazz Age, as Fitzerald described it, certainly has its parallels with our recent pre-great recession times.

I felt for Mr. Gatsby because he was a very tortured soul, and couldn't seem to comprehend the fact that in order to have real relationships you have to be a real person, and in order to receive love, you have to give it. He was delusional and stuck in the past, and unfortunately, there are a lot of people like that.

It charms you with some of the most elegant English prose ever published, making it difficult to discuss the novel without the urge to stammer awestruck about its beauty. It would be evidence enough to argue that F. Scott Fitzgerald was superhuman, if it wasn't for the fact that we know he also wrote This Side of Paradise.<br /><br />But despite its magic, the rhetoric is just that, and it is a cruel facade. Behind the stunning glitter lies a story with all the discontent and intensity of the early Metallica albums. At its heart, The Great Gatsby throws the very nature of our desires into a harsh, shocking light. There may never be a character who so epitomizes tragically misplaced devotion as Jay Gatsby, and Daisy, his devotee, plays her part with perfect, innocent malevolence. Gatsby's competition, Tom Buchanan, stands aside watching, taunting and provoking with piercing vocal jabs and the constant boast of his enviable physique. The three jostle for position in an epic love triangle that lays waste to countless innocent victims, as well as both Eggs of Long Island. Every jab, hook, and uppercut is relayed by the instantly likable narrator Nick Carraway, seemingly the only voice of reason amongst all the chaos. But when those boats are finally borne back ceaselessly by the current, no one is left afloat. It is an ethical massacre, and Fitzgerald spares no lives; there is perhaps not a single character of any significance worthy even of a Sportsmanship Award from the Boys and Girls Club.<br /><br />In a word, The Great Gatsby is about deception; Fitzgerald tints our glasses rosy with gorgeous prose and a narrator you want so much to trust, but leaves the lenses just translucent enough for us to see that Gatsby is getting the same treatment. And if Gatsby represents the truth of the American Dream, it means trouble for us all. Consider it the most pleasant insult you'll ever receiveever receive	2013-05-10

This isn't the first time I have read The Great Gatsby, but it has been awhile. It's pretty much required reading in lots of high school lit classes. I admit, this time around I was re-reading it in preparation for the upcoming movie. After reading I can totally see how a director like Baz Luhrmann would be perfect for a story like this. This is a story that just oozes with atmosphere. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master crafter of words. The back jacket of my copy explains that he produces \\"breathtaking lyricism.\\" I agree wholeheartedly. The writing in this short novel is absolutely beautiful. It seeps from the pages in a slow, lingering manner that pulls the reader out of the world we are in and into New York of the 1920s. I really, really loved the way that this story was crafted.<br /><br />Here's the short story of what this story is:<br /><br />Daisy is married to Tom.<br />Tom is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson. Everybody knows. Except for Myrtle's husband (maybe).<br />Gatsby is in love with Daisy.<br />Daisy is in love with Gatsby ... and Tom (sort of).<br />Things are going to end badly for lots of people here.<br /><br />That's the basic story. It sounds like a soap opera, doesn't it? Well, in reality this is a story that makes the roaring 20s come alive. It was a time where the rich grew richer, often without thinking of the consequences of any of their actions. It was a time where people enjoyed life to its fullest ... while living in misery at the same time. Appearances mattered, and Gatsby was a master at creating the reality that he believed the people around him wanted to see. The whole story of his life is such a terrible American tragedy. What could have been the story of a self-made man who pulled himself out of poverty into a world of excess and wonder became the story of a man who was torn apart by a reality that he created in his own mind. His obsession with Daisy was so, so sad. Every decision he made in his recent past was made because of this vision of her that he had created in his head. In reality? She was selfish. Horribly, horribly selfish. In my opinion Daisy and Tom were the true villains of this story. They took what they wanted from life and never stood up to accept responsibility for any of their actions. I didn't like this pair at all. I wish that I could say that they got their just rewards at the end. Sadly ... not so much.<br /><br />I can see why this is an American classic. It has an almost magical quality to the writing. It doesn't flow as quickly as many of the modern stories that readers gobble up like candy. It takes a bit of time to set up the story. But once the characters have been established and the atmosphere has been set up, the story flows very quickly. It did leave me with a lot to ponder as I finished. The parallels to the world today are almost frightening in some ways. I love a book that makes me think deeply about greater themes in life.

Since the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio is coming out soon,  the hype for this book will build again. I read it and did not like it at all.  The author's descriptive skills are fine.  He really can describe a hot summer where you can feel the sweat on the characters.  My problem with the book is the subject matter.  Rich snobs behaving badly. Oh my God, who cares!!! I wish more of the characters would have died.  They all deserved it.  These type of books are popular with the lemmings who wish they were rich, and so badly want the lifestyle of the rich and famous.  I would stereotype these people as ones who also dream of living inside a J Crew catalog.  Pul...eease!  Our American society is materialistic enough as it is.  This book only makes me mad.	2013-05-05

I was just a little disappointed that there was not more mystery, drama and intrigue as the movie trailers suggest. It should make for a great movie because of the visual attraction from the roaring 20's. I did expect more from the book though as it is a classic. I had to go to the cliff notes to see if I was missing something. They said it was a social commentary and a great work of American fiction about the decline of the 20's and social issues, and a cross section if American society. Ok - so there you go...it was a very quick read in just a few days.	2013-05-04

This is by far my favorite novel, and I have my junior high school English Lit teacher to thank.  It was a book we had to read, and I'm so thankful we did.

F.Scott did an excellent job of presenting the mood of America in the period after WWI. We were excited about our future as a nation and intoxicated by our new found wealth and global adoration.

I find it strangely parallel with the consumer lifestyle and society driven world of the present which is what makes this such a timeless read.

I absolutely loved this book. The Great Gatsby does not just contain one genre, but many including lust, desire, lies, murder, acceptance etc. This book contains so much symbolizm, it was difficult to keep track of it all. It felt like every page contained a much deeper meaning, almost as if there was another story behind what I was reading. Gatsby's story, from beginning to end, showed me how much we all have a desire for acceptance into our society, and how money can never really buy you happiness. I would strongly recommend this book to readers looking for something out of the ordinary. This was book seriously makes you think!	2013-04-26

Fitzgerald paints a beautifully horrific picture of a 1920's society in which, with chilling similarity to our own, people are lost with an emptiness trying to be filled, and being self aware only makes it worse. Its imagery and symbolism combined with witty yet elegant story telling makes the book a slow heart break all the way to the end. It was an amazing read and I highly suggest this book! Read it!

Wow Gatsby spent most of his life focused on getting one girl even when she was not on the market to be gotten. In the end it cost him his life and no one cared. I ask myself why didn't anyone care? They didn't care because they knew he didn't care about them, he didn't build any relationships outside of those that would get him closer to what he wanted &#34;Daisy&#34;. Even then those relationships weren't strong because the people knew that Gatsby was only using them. How sad to have wasted what could have been a good life on an unattainable relationship and not taken advantage of those around him he could of had relationships with.<br /><br />This book made me stopped and think about what I spend most of my time focused on &#34;getting&#34; and how I treat those around me on my journey to getting that thing no matter what it is. Funny how a book will make you appreciate the relationships you have and make you reach out to others to build new ones, so that at the end your life, when ever that is, your life will have mattered to someone and people will notice or even care when your gone!	2013-04-13

I wouldn't have appreciated the art of the English language or the smoothness and brilliance of Mr. Fitzgerald's characterization and plotting. Luckily I waited until now, a year and a half into this new journey I've taken in writing fiction and appreciating the classics because this has to be one of the best books I've ever read. It is one part romance, one part mystery, and one part satire and together they are weaved with a subtlety and elegance that kept me glued to my kindle. It is the quintessential American novel, depicting all that is spectacular and dreadful about the American Dream.<br /><br />The mystery is first of Gatsby; who is this man who hosts these extravagant parties? How is he so wealthy? The rumors are he \\"killed a man\\" and as Mr. Fitzgerald peels back the onion I became more interested in finding out about this man and his past.<br /><br />The romance also involves Gatsby and, to a lesser extent, the narrator, Nick Carroway, as Gatsby rejoins with his love, the ethereal Daisy, for whom all his troubles are in an effort to obtain, while Nick meets the athletic and gorgeous (and stuck up) Jordan Baker.<br /><br />\\"Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where \\"Three O'Clock in the Morning,\\" a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby's party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. What was up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marveled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.\\" -Nick Carraway referring Daisy, his second cousin once removed.<br /><br />The satire, perhaps my favorite aspect of the novel; did Fitzgerald know the US was just four years away from the great crash and the great depression?<br /><br />\\"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made. . . .\\" -Nick Carraway<br /><br />My guess is, no, he didn't, but when he wrote this he could have had the crash of 1907 or any of those great bank runs of the 1800s in mind. There is always a reckoning for the party, particularly in this wonderful system called capitalism that works so well for many (but not all) and can take it all away in a flash. And isn't it interesting how it's usually the rich who create the disaster, and then leave the rest of us to pick up the pieces? (And by rich I'm talking John Paulson rich, and by disaster I'm thinking crash of 2008-type of mess). And that's how the story of Gatsby unfolds; extreme highs and lows that feel like the American system and way of life. Which leads to the final point; \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" quite simply, is the embodiment of the American Dream.<br /><br />\\"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms father. . . . And one fine morning-- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" -Nick Carraway<br /><br />The bottom line: if you appreciate fiction at its finest give this one a shot. If you're from New York, especially the island, this one is a must. And finally, give some thought to the current state of affairs of the USA in the context of this classic; the paradox of record users of food stamps and record levels in the stock market portends a Gatsby-like ending, in my humble opinion, but who am I? Party on, America.<br /><br />-Raeden Zenassic; the paradox of record users of food stamps and record levels in the stock market portends a Gatsby-like ending, in my humble opinion, but who am I?

The book exposes human nature and hints at its despicable motifs. It resonates well with most people's desire for riches and comfort, and the willingness to be fooled into believing a lie. Nothing ground shaking, but I love the eloquence and realism of the book.	2013-04-02

They remain part of the fantasy life in our head that dies with us.  Most of us, however, do not act out that obsession with the opulent and garish extravaganzas that James Gatz (aka Jay Gatsby) was able to do with his gangster money.  Most of the idle rich who frequented his parties are by implication assumed to have received their fortunes through inheritance or some corrupting connection.  But Nick Carraway glibly reveals all the hypocrisy and corruptibility around him though he does not presume to judge.  Yeah. The last hope that Jay may find one true love disappears when Tom and Daisy plan their getaway after the manslaughter.<br /><br />The durability of the novel lies in its' perspective on a peculiar condition of the heart cast with poetic language.	2013-04-02

Fitzgerald manages to fix East Egg and West Egg as two places worthy of a visit, if only to see the spectacular wealth flowing in these two fictional locations.<br /><br />The characters, including Gatsby (perhaps most of all Gatsby), are empty shells; in pursuit of wind; always looking for the next thing to curb their boredom. It never happens though. They remain bored; they are self-centred thrillseekers who never find out that their pursuits cannot and will not bring them fulfillment.<br /><br />The narrator of the story is the only sensible character. He enshrines Gatsby for some reason, but sees the emptiness of the rest clearly, and it seems to disgust him.	2013-03-25

But maybe that's the point about this tale of a group of young socialites on Long Island in the 1920's with too much money and too much time on their hands. There are strong parallels with the celebrity society of our own age where young people have nothing better to do that indulge themselves in narcissistic pursuits. The Great Gatsby is worth reading though if only to understand that then as now, the rich are indeed very different.	2013-03-12

I didn't get much out of it and was disappointed with the ending. I remembered it being about lost love found again, and hoped that Daisy Buchanan and Jay Gatsby would run off together and live happily ever after. The End!  I just re-read it, and wow, what an absolute masterpiece--a story of the unhealthy obsessive-compulsion of Jay Gatsby, & the selfish immorality of Tom & Daisy Buchanan.  Gatsby was willing do literally ANYTHING to get his lost love Daisy back; and in the end he made the ultimate sacrifice for her. The Buchanans hopefully lived with horrible guilt over the outcome for the rest of their lives--but given their wealth and lack of common decency, THEY probably lived happily ever after.  I admired Nick Carraway for finding his way through the muck & mire and getting out of Dodge with his morality intact sans Jordan Baker who was inextricably linked to the lifestyle of the Buchanans.  F. Scott Fizgerald's outstanding talent with the English language goes without saying.  He kept dropping subtle hints all along, like jewels, about the characters throughout the whole novel, making me linger on the importance of a word, a sentence, or a paragraph.  I'm so very glad I rediscovered him as an adult.	2013-03-11

Excellent writing and style. You feel immediately immersed in a different time and place and the strength of the characters take the story to another level. I can’t wait to see the new movie adaptation coming out this May because I feel it has a very “cinematographic” feel. Short, visual, clear scenario and an intensity to be carried out by the characters. 8/10	2013-03-03

The themes of The Great Gatsby: wealth, beauty, greed and power mirrored the society of the Roaring Twenties perfectly. I did feel that one or two of the major revelations were dealt with too quickly and that more could have been done with them to add to the narrative. F. Scott Fitzgerald had a unique talent with words making his sentences beautiful and lyrical. I had a very clear picture in my mind of the world in which these characters were set. Also, through accurate, but succinct, descriptions I could imagine what they looked like, how they moved and spoke.	2013-02-27

Enter nosy neighbour, add a bad boy, throw them all into the same place at the same time and watch the fireworks. While the formula is a known one, it is F.

I often hear people say that this is the greatest novel ever written. Although I like the book, I think that is taking it a bit far. My suspicion is that it was quite unique when it was first published, and that the style has been copied so many times it now seems more ordinary. The only thing I don't like is that the language in parts is so &#34;flowery&#34; that it risks distracting from the story itself, but surely this is a matter of taste. Probably, it now finds its most enthusiastic audience among aspiring writers who want to learn how to spin a great story, and people with general literary interests, but I think most people will find it capturing.	2013-02-14

I read this when I was a teenager and certainly didn't pick up on all the nuances or the impeccable way Fitzgerald crafted the story. I know this book is taught in high school--although I don't remember it being part of required reading for me at the time. It was just a book that you read, like you had to try smoking cigarettes at that age. I think I was too young to get it. I didn't understand Daisy or Gatsby, and especially Nick. It seemed to me everyone was his or her own worst enemy, except maybe for Jordan who got short shrift. The whole scene, dissolute rich people in the 1920s, was beyond my comprehension. One of the only scenes that stuck in my memory was that of Gatsby flinging his numerous clean shirts around his bedroom to show off how wealthy he'd become. Reading it now, as a supposedly mature adult, I was touched by the masterful descriptions and the economy with which Fitzgerald communicates his characters' emotions. I had never realized the implications of where Gatsby's wealth came from, and totally missed the desolation of the funeral secne. The book was maybe too subtle for me as a teen. I was moved by it as an adult. I recommend it, even if you've read it before.	2013-02-12

Now that I am a little older and wiser, I understand what Fitzgerald was getting at.  Many American's have their own green light, their \\"American Dream\\" that they are always reaching for, but may never attain or may attain only to be left wondering, like Jay Gatsby, was it worth it?  This is a great reflection on the American Dream, as all the great works of American literature are.  The tragedy of Gatsby's life and longing are only enhanced because of the fact that every American has their own dream.  And Fitzgerald's reflections on the moral wasteland that made up the wealthy's lifestyle in the 1920s has as much resonance today, post-2008 stock market crash, as it did 90 years ago.  And while I wouldn't go so far as to call this book \\"The Great American Novel\\" as others have, I do believe that a new generation of Americans, traumatized by the Wall Street bailout and the economic disparity between the rich and the poor in this country, will find new meaning in this classic work.	2013-02-10

I, however, found it enthralling from start to finish. Fitzgerald has a gift for writing. He really does. Nick Carraway, the first person narrator, describes his surroundings so well that you immediately have a picture of what's going on. The story builds up and develops characters, and keeps the strong characterization completely through the novel. There are a number of quotes from this classic that are very well-known, but reading the entire novel is better than that. This novel is magnificently written.	2013-01-25

I wanted to get reacquainted with it before the movie comes out and I'm so glad that I did.  When I was younger, I was so enamored by the lavish, 20's lifestyle that these characters lived- almost as if I was an outsider invited to tag along with them, just like our narrator, Nick.  Reading it now, I have a much more skeptical but mature reaction.  I felt sad for how lonely and stuck all of these characters were in their life choices.  The only person who was able to realize this early on, and know when to say when, was Nick.<br />While ultimately a sad story, I really did enjoy it and happy that I reintroduced myself to Fitzgerald.	2013-01-16

It is beautifully written, with a delicate, light, captivating and enchanting touch, much like Daisey's laugh. Hemmingway's remark that Fitzgerald wrote like the gossimer wings of a butterfly is completely accurate. Even the gritty and morally dissolute segments which provide a balance to the unreality of the upper class dream world of Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom are rendered vividly but lightly. The meaning of the novel is multifaceted as all truely great books are. Enjoy!	2013-01-13

I still don't get what makes this book so highly acclaimed.  As a Christian, I do not condone the adulterous affairs portrayed in the novel, one character beating his girlfriend, nor the rumored illegal means by which Gatsby earned his wealth.  Perhaps if I didn't care about those things, I would have felt more favorably about Gatsby and the other characters.<br /><br />I did find the narrator, Nick Carraway, somewhat likable.  Nick observes all the immorality around him, and he seems to keep himself from being sucked into the abyss; however, his being seeing as an outsider was likely due to his modest means compared to most others in the story.  I was happy to see Nick had a sense of honor about him and his chosen profession of selling bonds.  It seems his independence separated him from the filthy rich, but he was friendly enough that people entrusted him with their secrets.	2013-01-08

Historians see it as a mirror of those who lived during the Jazz Age. To me at a deeper level, it deals with the issue of what you want in life  or out of life, and what you do when you find you can't get it, and you realize you can't. And, no amount of money or power or friends can get you there. To those peers living during the self-indulgent Jazz Age, the Great Gatsby speaks prophetically about the realiy of not finding satisfaction through indulging. The way to realization of goals is to be ethical and principled. The only one in the book who is that and is thus the hero turns out not to be Gatsby, not matter how great, but the narrator who is the &#34;least among these&#34;, telling the story and is a distant observer of those caught in the chase. Anyone contemplating setting out on life's journey to find fame and fortune ought to consult the Great Gatsby before going too far down the  road.	2012-12-24

But now i have read it again with a more mature state of mind I really find it like a soap oprah... there was evidence of gossip that placed a &#34;umph&#34; to the supension I had when reading. The love story between Daisy and Gatsby, with Nick and Jordon, Tom and Myrtle, and Daisy too, interuptions not to mention their individual ives, and how FItzgerald cleverly used elements of prose and literary devices, to convey confusion and suspense highlights the fact that this story was well written and will remain one of the best years to come.	2012-12-22

The Great Gatsby is widely regarded as a great novel and has been widely acclaimed as such, but having read through it twice I cannot agree. I am merely a well read person and lay no claims as to literary erudition but this book did not live up to my expectations. I found the writing very adjectival with constant use of metaphors, some of which seemed trite and effeminate. In addition the story moves at a slow pace, particularly in the first half of the book where there is much description and virtually no action. Obviously Fitzgerald depicts the period of the early twenties with prohibition allowing quick acquisition of wealth, but the fact that Gatsby returned from military service penniless and alone makes his construction of such a huge fortune in a few years seem unbelievable, even in that era. Gatsby is the least believable character in this whole novel. For much of the time he is a shadowy figure moping around in his infatuation with a woman he was parted from for five years. His behaviour verges on that of a love-sick teenager rather than a war hero. Of course the book depicts the decadence of the wealthy during that period superbly and at times the prose is beautifully descriptive, but the \\"Great American Novel\\" ???	2012-11-01
US	34608620	RGOSQ5ZFJ2SWJ	B008ENGJ9G	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Digital_Ebook_Purchase	5	0	0	N	Y	A trully great book	Reviewing \\"The Great Gatsby\\" feels a bit presumptuous and for sure somehow redundant. What can one say that has not been said already about this seminal story?<br />To avoid being totally repetitive I will start with some personal perspective. I read this book the first time as a teenager in my native Bucharest, at a time when I knew little about life in general and almost nothing about New York or United States.  When I finished reading, I was left with the impression that this was about some people quarreling after a car accident. What a difference 40 years make. Reading it now, I felt great empathy for the plight of the characters and I believe I recognized at least some of the universal themes pursued by the author. It seems to me that Fitzgerald advances here a very pessimistic premise about people's behavior and what they can expect from life, namely that those who are self-absorbed or just selfish will always end up better off than those who, in pursuit of valid or absurd dreams, insist on fighting the reality on behalf of their dreams.<br /><br />As we follow the story, Gatsby's dream of recapturing the lost love of his youth, Myrtle's dream of becoming a respectable bourgeois matron, Wilson's dream of being a successful business owner, all become vehicles for the ultimate destruction of those who dream them.  In the meantime the monumentally insensitive Tom and the cowardly shallow Daisy continue to prosper in the big city, not perturbed in the least by their heavy responsibility for what has just happened. Learning his lesson, the narrator, Nick , gives up on his dream of becoming a well-adjusted East Coast money man  and decides to go back home to Mid-West.<br /><br />Some people will see here a class contrast element. After all, Tom and Daisy are rich while their unintended victims are low or lower class. I believe that the essence of the story transcends class. In my experience, people like Tom and Daisy can be found in all strata of society, irrespective of income or status.<br /><br />The pleasure of reading this book is enhanced by Scott Fitzgerald wonderful gift for using little details like a gesture, a word, a simple noise or a clever comment by the narrator in order to bring depth to his characters and advance the story. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" effortlessly transports us to the \\"roaring twenties\\" in New York City, a time and place of great optimism and sudden prosperity for many. The author viewpoint is less rosy. He spots human frailty and suffering even in the middle of the most lavish settings. In a symbolic way, Daisy's car crash portends historical events still to come.  Ability to prophesize aside, Fitzgerald remains himself a product of the era. Within the story, he casually stereotypes Jews as shadowy money grubbing characters with hairs coming out of their noses and he is not above using variations of the \\"n\\" word when he thinks necessary. No matter; this is a remarkable novel, one of those ten or twenty essential books that everyone should read before claiming they know anything about human nature. I highly recommend it.ve of income or status.<br /><br />The pleasure of reading this book is enhanced by Scott Fitzgerald wonderful gift for using little details like a gesture, a word, a simple noise or a clever comment by the narrator in order to bring depth to his characters and advance the story. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" effortlessly transports us to the \\"roaring twenties\\" in New York City, a time and place of great optimism and sudden prosperity for many.

Over the last three years I have slowly developed a taste for it. Because I am such a novice to literary analysis I am not sure how beneficial my review will be, but I will give you my thoughts on this important work. I never had to read this book in High School but I decided to read it in preparation for teaching a High School history class on the 1920's. F. Scott Fitzgerald's book is an important social commentary on his own time. For that matter there are things in this book that are applicable to the world that we live in. It is is a book that is essentially centered around morality and the woes that come to us when we throw off moral restraint and embrace hedonism.<br /><br />The 1920's was a fun period in many ways but it was also bloated. This was an age defined by crime, the tearing down of old social mores, and excess. F. Scott Fitzgerald has strong feelings about this issue. The characters are hard to like and yet they are hard to completely hate. The main character, Nick Carraway, is a small town boy that moves into a nice neighborhood in the city. He is relatively naive in his understanding of the world. He is attracted by the glitz and glamour of city life but soon finds that he is confronted with moral dilemmas that place him in an uncomfortable situation. His cousin Daisy is a fun-loving swinger who seeks, fun, thrills, and financial security even though she is not happy. She is silly and frivolous and likely stands to represent the spirit of the era.  Her husband is an arrogant, bloated, racist, hypocrite who expects his wife to live by standards that he himself does not keep. His attraction to racist ideology reminded me that it was in the 1920's that the KKK was expanding as well as the eugenics movement in Europe. Jordan Baker, the friend of Daisy and the girlfriend of Carraway, is the quintessential carefree Flapper girl that was fun to be with but not necessarily \\"the marrying type.\\"<br /><br />Gatsby is the center of the story. He is the wealthy neighbor of Nick. I thought that Gatsby was the hardest character to analyze. He is at certain points a likable character and yet while he is a better guy than Tom, he seems to have become caught up in the lifestyle he has made for himself. He is empty and hallow and seems to lack a strong moral compass. At times he is commendable and chivalrous. It makes you believe that underneath what was apparent was a person who had the potential to do well. Yet the way he made his money and the seedy, gritty nature of his business showed another side to Gatsby. Nick becomes a friend who feels both admiration and disgust. The most interesting character is not even a character but a pair of eyes on the billboard in downtown New York City. The T.J. Eckleburg sign is in my opinion representative of the eyes of God who sees the entire scenario and silently watches everything.<br /><br />The book was well-written but one of the negative aspect of the book for me was the fact that there were places where it was easy to get lost, and a few times I did become disoriented as to what was going on. The book is thick with symbolism and I found this to be both unique and cumbersome. I am sure there is so much to this book that I was not able to really explore. I was hoping that I would find a unique passage that I could have my students analyze but the book did not really offer a section that was reflective. For example: Dostoevsky in his book \\"Brothers Karamazov\\" has the great writing called the \\"Grand Inquisitor.\\" This is a piece of literature that can be isolated from the book and examined as it provides great insight into the issue that Dostoevsky is attempting to address. Fitzgerald chose not to do that with this book. However, despite these small issues I am certainly interested in reading more of Fitzgerald's works as it is apparent that he has a lot to say to his generation whether they wanted to hear it or not.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby gives us the message that not everything that glitters is gold. The 1920's look fun and carefree but not everybody thought they were a healthy time. It is message about the emptiness that comes from opulence and indulgence and warns not only his time but every generation of the danger it brings. Wealth and power often bring corruption and while they appear enticing they offer very little. It is a warning of what happens when people throw off moral constraints to rush headlong into a life of pleasure and party. Overall, the book was well done and gave me a good look at one of the ways that people living in the 20's saw their own time. School textbooks tell a \\"Disney\\" version of history where everything is good and everyone is having fun. The Great Gatsby challenges that idea by offering another perspective of the time. I think this benefits students to enable them to see events through various sets of eyeballs. Needless to say, this is well worth the read.ar it or not.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby gives us the message that not everything that glitters is gold.

I read the book on paper once 10 years ago, but apparently found the book lacking enough substance to remember I had read it.  The second time through, I read it on Kindle.  You'd think in starting a book a second time that something would click, but when you read a book such as this... a book that works as a character study in a setting I've read about multiple times (I find this book similar to The Sun Also Rises), the book starts out a bit typical to the point I passed off the familiarness to the genre rather than to having read the book before.  It wasn't until the climactic scenes at the end of the book that I realized I had read this before.<br /><br />Of course, we often read books twice when we like them, and we even occasionally find we like things on a second go around.  In this case, I found I didn't like the book on the second go around.  The book is a character study on a man named Gatsby whom moves into the \\"neighborhood\\" of his former girlfriend in the pursuit of ultimate happiness.  In this pursuit is where the character flaw begins.  It boils down to the ideal that money can buy happiness. And, of course, we often see that greed is more of an addiction that can rarely be overcome, and Jay Gatsby has that greed.<br /><br />The setting is in the jazz era of the early 20th century, and of course Jay Gatsby isn't the only character stricken with greed.  The book is simple as far as plots go, and the plot wouldn't even be all that out of place now nearly 100 years later.  The biggest strength of the book is really in the intricate weaving of characters surrounding Daisy Buchanan, the girlfriend Gatsby pursues.  While Daisy and Jay are the most important characters in the book, it is what I call the character flaws for all the characters including those two that give any interest to the book.  It is unfortunate that as the book progresses it is Jay Gatsby who dominates.<br /><br />I know the book is a classic, and I know many people like it.  I am actually surprised I don't; I liked The Sun Also Rises, which seems to be the opposite of many people (many like this book and not that one).  I'm not sure what it is.  I really seemed to me that liking one should lead to like in the other, and in that regard giving the book a second chance was worth it.  My biggest complaint is that the book is in someways too simple.<br /><br />Gatsby is a complicated character, but we are never fully given a view into his complicated mind.  I was left at the end of the book wishing I knew more about him especially what happened to him before the novel.  Of course there are hints and background, but I felt like I was wanting more.  The book almost seemed too simple and in some ways too predictable.  Perhaps that is unfair too having read the book twice, but I remembered feeling that way at the end both times I read it.  Gatsby and Daisy were relatively likable characters (not lovable for their various flaws), and I felt they deserved a bit better.<br /><br />Of course, it isn't Hollywood, and the ending provided only enhances the novel since as far as plot goes the ending makes the novel.  Never-the-less, I felt like there could have been more; more insight into the characters, more to the plot, more resolution, etc.luding those two that give any interest to the book.

I had to go on schmoop after (a great site with summaries of classic novels) to find out what I was reading. This is a classic but far from what I consider great reading.

This review is not about the book itself, but about the Kindle Edition method of purchasing it. I love this book dearly, I really do, but seriously.

To whoever it was who set these prices: I think it's disgusting that you would pull a dirty trick like that on your customers, knowing that a lot of people buy the Kindle edition first, without looking at the paperback. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.<br /><br />This book would have been an easy sale to me, Amazon, because I would really prefer to have it on my Kindle.

This was my first time reading \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and it certainly won't be my last! The book is beautifully written and the author writes in a powerfully evocative way. Fitzgerald sets up a scene with such skill that I truly felt I was part of the story.<br />The Great Gatsby is set in the 1920s American Jazz era. It is narrated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's neighbour and trusted confidante. The story follows Nick as he embarks on a new life in New York. Slowly, but surely Nick gets to know his neighbour; the flamboyant, ridiculously wealthy Jay Gatsby who is madly in love with Daisy Buchanan. The love story between Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan perfectly portrays the infatuation and obsession of first love.<br />Fitzgerald's beautiful writing and incredible character descriptions immediately drew me into the story while the plot kept me glued to every page. It was such a pleasure to read a book that is so well written and I agree that it certainly deserves its high praise and accolades as \\"the great American novel.\\"	2012-07-17

Like so many others, I read it in high school and tolerated it, letting the experience of being forced into the book color the book itself. But as years have gone by, I've often thought the book deserved a fresh read. And now, whether it's because I'm older, I gave it more benefit of the doubt, or I'm just a wiser reader, I finally understand what an incredible work of fiction the novel truly is. A far more complex and nuanced book than I remembered it being, Gatsby is neither a love letter to the 1920's nor a pure screed against them, and that sense of ambiguity and complex feelings is part of what makes the book so moving. It's hard to find characters here to admire; from our narrator, whose claims of his own honesty and lack of judgment are quickly revealed to be less than accurate, to the apparently wonderful but ultimately shallow Daisy, and even to the well-intentioned but deeply flawed Gatsby, the characters all defy easy characterization, instead becoming symptoms of a moral laxness that permeated the times. And the prose - my god, the prose! The valley of ashes, the silent eyes of an abandoned billboard, the painful meeting of long-separated lovers - Fitzgerald does it all beautifully and simply, telling a massive tale in a surprisingly few pages. Singing the praises of The Great Gatsby hardly feels necessary - is there anyone who was waiting on my thoughts to change their mind? But it's the kind of book that demands such praise, leaving the reader in awe of its greatness after you finish its deceptively slim length.	2012-05-28

Although the characters and the period are dated, the craftsmanship of F. Scott Fitzgerald cannot be equaled. I defy anyone to pick a better word, for ANY word that Fitzgerald used in this epic novel.<br />Though it was not a monetary success when first published (Fitzgerald actually made a living by writing short fiction for magazines and was paid enormous prices for his work when America was in a depression) the fact that it still sells the huge volume of copies each year speaks to its appreciation by those who love perfect prose.<br />With the ease of writing these days (he wrote in long hand) it is a shame that there is not one novelist today who can match Fitzgerald's genius for putting words together.	2012-01-05

Turns out, Fitzgerald had a powerful and complex imagination.  I tried to re-read Gatsby to see if my opinion had changed.<br /><br />It didn't.  Leave Gatsby to those who think Catcher In The Rye is a passable book.  Yes, I think Catcher is insufferable.<br /><br />Fitzgerald can really write, so 2, maybe 3 stars.

Let's hope either the $1.99 version gets sensibly reformatted or the $19.38 version comes down in price drastically. Personally, as I am not a starving student who has to read GG right NOW (the audience this version may have been prematurely pushed out for?) I will wait. I DO laud Amazon for enabling one to preview these books as I've saved $1.99.	2011-12-17

The love story is kinda wishy washy and the ending is a downer.<br />At least I can say I read it.<br />*****<br />This is a review of the kindle version of the book. $11.99 I paid for this book. This old book that was written in the 1950's. Why would publisher's raise the price on this? Also, there is no audible speech for this book. $11.99 and I can't plug it in and listen to the story while I am driving?<br />The publishers should rethink their price for this book and enable the audio.	2011-10-31

I find that it centers me and allows me to then read other books that may or may NOT turn into classics themselves.<br /><br />Crisp descriptive writing that is full of symbolism.

At the instigation of an Amazon friend, I am about to read a noted novel of the Jazz Age, \\"Manhattan Transfer\\", by John Dos Passos.  Before doing so, however, I decided to re-read what is commonly regarded as THE novel of the Jazz Age, THE GREAT GATSBY, which not too long ago I had proposed to another Amazon friend as one of the ten best American novels.  I did so based on having read it in high school and then, over the years, having from time to time heard it nominated as \\"The Great American Novel\\".<br /><br />Well, upon re-reading it, I now would dispute it as THE great American novel and I no longer would propose it as one of the ten best.  For one thing, it is somewhat superficial.  For another, it does not really hang together.  For a third, its characters tend towards the one-dimensional.  (But then, its author was only 29 when he wrote it.)  But, despite its flaws, THE GREAT GATSBY is powerful.  There is something mythical about it.  And it is a distinctively American myth - about mammon and materialism; dreams and desires; craving and crassness.  And it ends in operatic tragedy.  So even if it is NOT one of the ten best American novels, it IS quite possibly one of the ten best novels ABOUT America - perhaps not America as many of us would like to envision it, but America nonetheless.	2011-02-10

Pay attention to every line or you may miss something.  The over arching message is universal, that wealthy people can make big mistakes in life too...The author seems to want to blame wealth for irresponsibility...a theme that is difficult for me to buy.  Everyone can be there no matter what station in life.  The real tragedy was Gatsby's investment in worthlessness.  For that point I commend the author.	2011-02-01

The language is vulgar and archaic, with words such as &#34;gay&#34; and &#34;excitement&#34; used completely erroneously. Fitzgerald could not even be bothered to spell gaiety correctly, though I suppose that is as much his editors' and publishers' fault as his own. This book was unpopular when it was written and is unpopular now, so why do we teach it in our schools?  Do we really want our children to emulate ANY of the characters or &#34;virtues&#34; conveyed by this book? First, we have the main character, Nick Calloway, who is so spineless and passive that he doesn't speak up even when it would have saved Gatby's life.  Next, we have Tom and Daisy Buchanan who are so out of touch with reality that they can't even realize how pathetic their marriage actually is.  Last, but certainly not least, comes Jay Gatsby, also known as James Gats.  Gatsby is living a seventeen-year-old's dream whichwould be fine, if he were seventeen rather than thirty, but is total folly at his age. Besides these few specific characters, the cast as a whole demonstrates a blatant disregard for laws big and small, from abolition to murder.	2009-01-23

I couldn't put it down from the second I started reading it. The characters are finely crafted and the storyline a hit as you meet Nick and Gatsby and the different lives they lead until one day they are both wonderfully and tragically intertwined. I found myself saddened to both the book ending and the outcome of the story but I have a greater respect for both F. Scott Fitzgerald and the 1920's because of reading it.	2008-09-01

The most notable is the occasional<br /><br />insertion of multiple paragraph<br /><br />breaks within a sentence.  There are also occasional misplaced paragraph breaks in dialog paragraphs, which sometimes leads to confusion about which character is speaking.<br /><br />I downloaded the free sample of the Scribner Edition and although that is only a short sample, it appears to be a much better quality transcription.<br /><br />So since there are several Kindle editions available, you might want to avoid the Old Landmark Publishing Edition (the one with the car on the cover) and try the [[ASIN:B000FC0PDA Scribner Edition]] (the one with the dark blue cover with a face superimposed).	2008-01-25
