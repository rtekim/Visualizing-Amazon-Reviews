This is a memorable novelette that seems every bit as relevant, as it was during the height of the Cold War when it was published. The story follows a young woman, named Oedippa Maas, who through luck(not all of it good) was bequeath the vast estate from the deceased Pierce Inverarity. What follows is a vast uncovering of truths, complications, and revelations that everyone seems to have a stake in. Ms. Maas finds herself running from the Italian Mafia(involved in the fertilizer business, of course); meets up with the secretive Inamorato Anonymous(consisting of people addicted to love); finds a key to the secret of Maxwell's Demon, and finds herself brought to the attention of renegade postal carriers, and ultra secret society, Trystero.

This is opposed to the year 1966, when an unnamed critic from this same magazine, in reference to this same book, lamented, \\""What is the meaning of the gibberish literature that is currently being published as fast as it can be gibbered?\\""  I mention these things for two reasons: Mainly because I found the snarky commentary by Time's unknown reviewer to be funnier than anything I read in 'The Crying of Lot 49', but also because I suspect that the opinion on this book still ranges between classic and gibberish.      Despite its intricate wordplay and oddball narrative - characteristics that certainly have their charms - there are several reasons why I didn't connect with 'Lot 49'.  The primary one is that Mr. Pynchon's writing comes across as very self-satisfied.  I could probably study 'Lot 49' for a long time, and find something new years from now, but I just couldn't muster much interest in the clues he left during my first reading.  I found myself racing to the end of this short book, on past the standard post-modern ambiguous ending, and glad to move on to something else.    Oedipa Maas, housewife, is asked to serve as executrix for the estate of her former lover, the mutli-millionaire Pierce Inverarity.  As she delves deeper into the labyrinth of Pierce's holdings, she discovers (maybe) a strange conspiracy concerning an ages old postal feud, one that, once noticed, seems to stretch into every facet of life.  Aside from some rather dated commentary on the lifestyles of the mid-sixties, the book's main thrust appears to be not so much the mystery that Oedipa uncovers, but the existential effect it has on her.      I feel like much of 'The Crying of Lot 49' is cleverness for cleverness' sake (like the names Oedipa Maas and Pierce Inverarity, for example).  In this way it reminds me of David Foster Wallace's fiction - original, skillful, but ultimately unsatisfying.  (I suppose I should say that Wallace reminds me of Pynchon, since Pynchon came first - but I was already familiar with DFW).  Actually, I've come to realize that I feel this way about most post-modern lit, and certainly about 'Lot 49' - that it lacks substance (my disclaimer here is that I often feel like these books would have held a lot more appeal for me when I was a younger man).  It's as if the author, highly educated and incredible facile as a writer is at a loss for something pertinent to say, and, in order to avoid churning out a morality play, instead turns to self-absorbed tales of highly educated and incredibly facile characters who are at a loss for something pertinent in their lives.  This sort of writing would naturally appeal to highly educated, incredibly facile people - especially those who feel they're still missing something from life.  But while they may identify with the situation, I don't think they'll find any balm for their misery except company.",2010-03-27

I wonder why I have even finished reading it. Probably because I wanted to find out what all the Pynchon-hype is about, or because I just expected that the book would take a turn for the better.     Some say that if something is hyped, then it is probably bad. Reading Pynchon has taught me that there is some truth to that. To compare this book or draw an analogy to Ulysses is not only wrong, but also an insult to one of the greatest writers ever.    The book is about a woman who might have or might not have uncovered a conspiracy. In other words, it is about a woman who tries to find meaning in something which probably does not have any. Well, that is certainly reminiscent of Kafka or Beckett. Only that Kafka or Beckett open new doors leading into a different direction on every page, add layer after layer, and truly disturb the reader. In Pynchon, there are no multiple layers. He only scraches the surface without ever adding any depths to his ideas.    \\""Crying of Lot 49\\"" is for readers who are very amused about names like Fallopian or Genghis Khan, and think that an idea like the \\""Maxwell Devil\\"" is incredibly creative.

I've read all the classics, have a degree in English, write my own novels -- this is the one book I yearn to emulate. I happen to think, also, it's the only really memorable book Pynchon will ever produce. Like F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby,' it is short, tight, and focused. Its bigger sibling, 'V', is an unfocused meander. Gravity's Rainbow is the one other candidate for lasting fame, I think. Yoyodyne is an underground trope, as I have learned, and that's straight out of TCOL49. So why? I'm not sure, but I know I feel about this book the way I feel about my wife -in love for life. What surprises me most is that nobody has attempted to make a movie of it, and that's probably good since it would most likely be a horrible botch. Maybe Ridley Scott could pull it off (my favorite director, and Blade Runner is my all-time favorite film). And again, it's chemistry. What works for me may not work for you. And that's how the universe is meant to be. I guess maybe if I place my favorite movie, Blade Runner, in the vanguard of Faustian tropes and call it a replay of the Frankenstein theme, I might see Oedipa Maas as a kind of Mesopotamian adventuress in the mold of Gilgamesh, wandering through the terrifying echoic forest of Huwawa, which is the ur-(no pun intended)-adventure of us all. Apres nous, le deluge...anyway, the sailor who transcends the burning bed, or the notional rebirth of dandelions in their wine as the season of their spring flourishes, those are among the many memorable notions from TCOL49.

The first suggestion that CL49 involves a similar departure comes by way of its protagonist's very name, Oedipa Maas.<br /><br />Fatuous and Improbable, Oedipa is not so much a name as a signifier that directs readers to other texts, bringing to mind Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, Freud's Interpretation of Dreams, and perhaps even Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia. So extensively does the text prompt such sleuthing for cross-references that diligent readers soon find themselves immersed in something much like the mind-bending discovery phase of Oedipa's effort to execute the will of a former lover, California tycoon Pierce Inverarity.<br /><br />\\""As things developed, she was to have all manner of revelations. Hardly about Pierce Inverarity, or herself; but about what remained yet had somehow before this stayed away.\\"" A northern California housewife holdup in the suburbs at the novel's outset, during the 1960s, Oedipa, educated, childless, and very much a ward of the 1950s, sees herself as being like Rapunzel, imprisoned in a tower and waiting for someone or something to free her.<br /><br />Once, years before her feckless marriage to Wendell \\""Mucho\\"" Maas, she had seenInverarity as the agent of her liberation, but \\""all that had gone on between them had really never escaped the confinement of that tower.\\"" Her effort to uncover and settle Inverarity's vast, shadowy, and complicated holdings launches her into what might be called an epistemological mysteries trip in which every revelation begets a riddle and ever riddle becomes a clue to some deeper mystery leading her to wonder whether she had lost her mind, stumbled on a global conspiracy, or fallen for a cruel hoax.<br /><br />As hyperbolic as her situation may seem, it presaged a real-world case in point. Three years after the book's 1966 publication, it was rumor that The Beatles' Paul McCarney had been killed in a 1966 car crash. Evidence of both his death and his replacement by a look-alike, it was said, could be found when certain Beatles songs were played backwards and when various Beatles album covers were examined closely.<br /><br />In the mass mania that followed, the turntables and styluses destroyed by playing records backwards were innumerable, as were the hours spent pouring over album covers. For some, as with Oedipa, everything, even the slightest coincidence, got immeshed in the conspiracy; and the weight of it all was more than they seemed able to bear.<br /><br />Whether madness, hoax, uncanny coincidence, or conspiracy, Oedipa's trip permits this observation: Such meaning as one finds in life springs from the same human tendency as that which makes the Big Dipper and Orion, the hunter, appear in the night sky: that 20-watt apparatus between ones ears connects the dots even when no such connections actually exist.<br /><br />Nor does restricting the mind's operation to the norms of science offer an escape from uncertainty and the prospect of illusion. Instead, such efforts confine the self to a realm that admits nothing that can not be objectified. Yet those other things--such as love, community, and hope--would always remain at the twilight edges of awarenesswhere, under the circumstances, they can only induce dread.",2014-01-03

I spit my coffee out all over myself . . . (you may notice from my other reviews that spitting my drink all over myself is basically how I measure whether something is hilarious or not.

Maybe to excess: how could he not, seeing people poorer than him come in, Negro, Mexican, cracker, a parade seven days a week, bringing the most godawful of trade-ins: motorized, metal extensions of themselves, or their families and what their whole lives must be like, out there so naked for anybody, a stranger like himself, to look at . . .\\""<br /><br />Unlike some other readers/critiques that I've read elsewhere, I don't get the sense from this book that life's meaning is lacking. Oedipa is not engaged in a futile game (whether put on by herself or her ex-lover Inverarity).<br /><br />Instead it's more like the Ultimate Shades of Grey: meaning lies in the neglected middle. So if you're too caught up in a set perspective / B&W thinking / or mental heuristics - then you'll never find it. Her search looks confusing because it is confusing. That's the thing about the neglected grey areas, sometimes what you're seeing has significance and is relevant to your search other times it probably is just random stuff.<br /><br />Kinda reminded me of an old alchemy drawing I saw once, where a bunch little people were standing on various high points of a maze looking for the way out of it. The text with that pic indicated that most of them will not make it out.<br /><br />A former resident of California myself, I've seen the hieroglyphic streets. They exist! This book and my own experience with them reminds me of the Egyptian practice of putting hieroglyphs in the tombs of the dead so they can navigate the afterlife successfully.<br /><br />Is that what Pynchon is doing for us?
