What he means is that there is no overt subtext, no brilliant deep thoughts, no sublimation of hidden desires deliberately put into the story.  The story is simply what it is.  This is what Nabokov himself claims, and I am not in a position to dispute his own analysis.  I am inclined to agree - but that is not a criticism.  In fact, I quite admire the author's purity in his storytelling - he very much creates a situation and his characters and then sets them free to act as they naturally would.  Similarly, written in the 1st-person, he does an admirable job of distorting all his secondary characters through the lens of the main character's prejudices and world-view.  It is a self-contained unit and it tells the story it means to tell, and that is all.<br /><br />Of course, such an analysis does not include any mention of what the story is about, or if it is worth telling.  Certainly the subject matter is troublesome.  Although never called that (perhaps the term is more modern), the main character is a pedophile, of a very specific type: he likes thin and precocious prepubescent girls.  He calls them &#34;nymphets&#34;.  The character (although, I think, not the author) tries to rationalize this through a pseudo-Freudian analysis of a frustrated liaison with a young girl when he himself was a young boy.  When young Delores Haze, nicknamed Lolita, falls under his care as the daughter of his recently-deceased wife, Humbert Humbert finds an initially willing accomplice to his pedophilia.  Yes, dear reader, Lolita in fact initiates their first sexual encounter and then enters into a sexual relationship with her movie-star-good-looking, literature-professorial, tennis-playing step-father.  Humbert knows that he will lose interest in Lolita as she grows into womanhood and out of her nymphet stage, so he intends to get all the gratification that he can as soon as he can.  The pair then journey on two cross-country driving trips and in between live a furtive existence in a small boarding-school town, as Humbert Humbert satisfies his urges through bribery, threat, rape, and pity.<br /><br />This description makes the book sound like a sordid pulp sexploitation story.  It is not.  In fact, the book is only incidentally about sex, and certainly is not about love (no matter that it is marketed as such).  It is about an obsession, specifically one that is not socially acceptable.  Humbert's quest for satisfaction at the hands of Lolita is his obsession, and he cares for nothing else.  TO be clear - Humbert does not love Lolita.  He thinks he does, but what he loves, in fact, is his own satisfaction.  He is a profoundly selfish character, as I suppose all monomaniacs are, and as the book is written in the first person, his is the only character that is well-developed.  Thus, Nabokov's prose must serve to immerse us in the obsession, which will be unnerving for readers since the character is necessarily glorifying the sexual objectification of a young girl.  It also makes the main character inherently unlikeable (at least, I didn't like him).<br /><br />Does this make the book itself unlikeable?  Perhaps.  It is certainly well-written and &#34;literary&#34; (sending me to the dictionary as often as a Shakespeare play!).  As mentioned above, the book follows a logical and devastating path, but it never cheats and the ending has a kind of weird satisfaction that comes from a well-scripted character study, even if (as you know from the very beginning) the main character ends up in jail and impossibly distant from any method of satisfying his obsession.  It is inevitable that Humbert end in jail.  It is inevitable that the reader will not sympathize with his plight.  It will depend on the individual reader whether they think that the journey (of reading the book) was a worthwhile use of their time.",2015-07-28

The book is short, just over 300 pages but the memoir moves very slowly as the narrator Humbert describes things in great detail and often with direct asides to the reader and makes hundreds of interjections in french.

Clever wordplay abounds.","To some, &#34;Lolita&#34; is an instruction manual for child abuse. To others, it is a work of literary mastery. I fall into the latter category, and first read Lolita in high school, several years before the controversial Adrian Lyne version of the movie was released (full disclosure, I'm Team Swain and Irons all the way, as they perfectly capture the narrative and world Nabakov created, and I find Kubrick's take to be silly and badly casted). As I was studying French and seeking any opportunity I could to practice the language, I found the humorous asides in that language and the wordplay overall to be an absolute delight. It took me several more years and many more reads to truly get inside the head of Humbert Humbert and see the full extent of his villainy, but that's just another reason for me to love this book: it gets better with each read. Recently, I read it again, and allowed the full horror of Humbert's delusional narcissism and criminal mind to enter my conscience. It was as good as the last time, except better.<br /><br />Nabokov, who did not grow up speaking English, is undeniably a master of the language. His turns of phrase are so clever and unique that they stick in my memory long after I've put the book down. He is also a master at fully occupying the brain and soul of a criminal mind, bringing Humbert to life as a three-dimensional human being who fancies himself the handsomest man in Ramsdale (and Beardsly), and totally entitled to sexually and emotionally possess a pre-teen girl. As I read, I wonder how anyone can justify such sick and self-aggrandizing thoughts — even the quirkiest people among us simply do not think or experience the world as Humbert does. My one quibble is that parts of what make Lo's character tick are left out, forcing the reader to construct her from Humbert's unreliable narration. However, that is a major point of the plot and the narrative, and so I do, which enables me to see the horror that is this poor girl's life,raped and controlled by her only living &#34;parent&#34; in this world.<br /><br />The ending, for those who haven't read it yet, is undeniably sad, although I won't give away exactly what happens. It made me rage against Humbert and his taking of Lolita's childhood for his own selfish means. It also made me feel that there is some justice in this world, although to find out why that is, you'll have to read the book. Some reviewers felt that the pacing of the book took a turn for the worse once the duo settled in Beardsley, but I don't agree. The turn of events in that town is absolutely critical to the plot, and to the development of the main characters. If you are easily offended or insist upon viewing this work of art as a &#34;how-to&#34; manual for child rape, please avoid reading at all costs. But if you realize, as most of us do, that no sane person holds Humbert Humbert in reverence or thinks what he's doing is okay, treat yourself to this landmark work by one of the greatest authors of the 20th century.

Not every story has to have a happy ending or a reliable narrator. Yes this is a disturbing story, but that's part of what makes it a classic. Humbert is an arrogant, sick bastard. You hate him but yet feel a little sympathy.  Not an easy accomplishment!  That in itself is part of what makes this book great. The same goes for Lolita who you instantly want to protect and keep away from Humbert, until you start to realize that she is a master of manipulation, who shows no remorse at the death of her mother. In a way they deserved each other.<br /><br />The subject of pedophilia is deeply disturbing, but does that mean we should ignore it? I hope not. What Nabokov has accomplished is bringing an awareness to the topic.  If you find this book so upsetting then I would suggest you stop watching the news, get off the internet and move to an underground cave where you won't be exposed to anything you deem offensive or disturbing.

The novel has a reputation for its controversial subject matter. The story follows &#34;Humbert Humbert&#34; an English lit professor, who has certain sexual appetites of a paedophoric nature, and who develops an obsession for a 12 year old girl named “Dolores Haze” for whom he has a pet name of &#34;Lolita&#34; (in film adaptions of the book Lolita was  circa. 14 -16). Humbert’s faulty moral compass becomes increasingly evident when he ingratiates himself with the widow Charlotte Haze, contributing to her accidental death, in order to ensnare Lolita. One of the subtleties of the book is that the reader might find themselves sympathising with the narrator, Humbert, for his humour and wit, despite his lecherous and revolting behaviour. While reading this book I found myself reflecting on whether or not Nabokov might have injected some of his own penchant into the story.  Apparently Nabokov said that he was “most proud of Lolita as it was the most removed from what he knows and took a great deal of engineering (paraphrasing),”  which if it is true, means he is a genius ... and if it isn't means he is a liar and a degenerate pervert. Undoubtedly Nabokov’s writing is an inspiration; he writes with exuberance and with the sensibility of a poet, but I struggled to find sufficient entertainment value from this book. It is tawdry book that masquerades as an erotic novel, but it is no less controversial then more recent contributions to the literary canon such as “50 shades of Grey,” or “Dexter.” Lolita’s popularity possibly points to society’s appetite for the depraved. As for theme of the book someone once posed the question: “Is Lolita the story of an adult who corrupts a young child or is it about a corrupt child that controls a weak adult?” Such is the popularity of the book that various Nabokovism’s have entered into the cultural idiom such as “Lolita” (meaning a precocious girl) and “nymphet.”ral idiom such as “Lolita” (meaning a precocious girl) and “nymphet.”",2015-04-22

The reader readily buys into Humbert's idea of himself even though all evidence proves the opposite. One cannot continuously cause harm with little to no regard for the person being injured, but call oneself a good person [on the inside]. But again, the irony is that the reader accepts his assertions because he tells us to. He likes girls between the ages of 9-14. He's behaved badly well before meeting Dolores and her mother, but poof it's forgotten before the paragraph ends. He continuously pokes fun at US citizens and thinks himself above them, but no one notices. He has a particular disdain for US pop-culture, but uses it to seduce the reader and Dolores.<br /><br />We're made to believe that Humbert's story is one of love, but based on what? We know from the opening lines where Humbert has found himself, so the story described is clearly being used to gain sympathy. The reason we know this is because throughout his re-telling there are certain moments where he can be nothing but brutally honest about his behavior towards his Lolita. It should quickly become clear to any reader that this isn't a story of love. Humbert loves the idea of Dolores; she's Lolita only to him and him alone.

There is a scene where he explains that he wanted to drug her and &#34;just&#34; fondle her. If someone said this to those of us with children, we'd probably freak out and call the cops...or that person would need an ambulance a/o a body bag. However, the reader readily consigns on Humbert's behavior. I won't lie, as a high schooler reading this story this scene had me sympathetic toward Humbert's plight, however, as an adult I sacrastically thought, &#34;Well, aren't you merciful?&#34; He's even more thoughtful when he makes her do &#34;little favors&#34; for him when she wants something.

With Lolita, the point and messages of the story weren't lost on me, nor was Nabokov's brilliant writing, but for me, none of it was worth the journey.    Sure, I understand why some consider this to be a masterpiece and of utter brilliance.  And I feel strange disagreeing on a book so well written and undoubtedly this masterful, but to me it was simply in no way worth it.  This book was sickening and not in a tasteful way.  It being told from the point of view of the pervert, a lot of it just sounded like an old man writing poetically in retrospect of this event in his life and trying to justify his actions to the reader, which was a bit odd.  It made sense why, of course, and the limited point of view leaves a lot up to the reader, but this story to me just dragged on and was gross and uncomfortable, and I honestly wish I hadn't wasted my time with it when I could've been reading something that is incredibly well written AND enjoyable and worth it.  Nabokov's style also made it seem like he was very pleased with himself, very much showing off his cynical brilliance with full intention, and for some writers and in some books this works, and maybe for some readers of Lolita it worked because to them it really is a brilliant masterpiece, but it was just one more thing that I didn't like about the story, personally.    This isn't for everyone, clearly, but there is a brilliance to it that shouldn't be denied, even by people like me who aren't too afraid to say that I sort of hated it from a personal standpoint.",2015-01-16

Whether that love squicks you the hell out is entirely incidental to the obvious fact that Humbert's got linguistic game.<br /><br />Still, even more than the language, what struck me rereading this time was how much Lolita is a novel of the anticipation of loss. Humbert knows his emotional center cannot hold, that the object of his fascination is ever-receding from her state as a nymphet, but he cannot act other than he does; yet all his efforts serve only to create in his mind a Lolita who never truly exists.

But that's about it. This book made me sad and irritated a lot of the time. (&#34;this book is about forbidden love&#34; --the people who say this are full of crap) This book is sad because basically this girl is orphaned because her mother dies and is left with a middle aged man who is infatuated and obsessed with her. Her mother was evil, though. She was just pure evil. She did not give a damn about her child. So, okay, throughout the first hundred or so pages, H.H writes journal entries from when he is living in this house with Lolita and then while Lolita is off at summer camp (meeting other people who want to take advantage of her, but you don't find this out until the last hundred pages) H.H decided that he will seduce her mother just to get to her. Now, their married. Then somehow he comes to the conclusion that he must kill her mother just to have Lolita. But he &#34;can't do it&#34; when the opportunity presents itself. So later (that day?) the mother finds in his desk, his journal with all the 'Lolita' entries and then freaks out. Because this grown man wants to have sex with her twelve year old child? No. Because he doesn't want her. Then she runs out into the street to send some letters BUT because of her hysteria fit she doesn't look to see the car the is about to kill her.<br /><br />SO, now where at the part where the mother is dead and H.H is going to pick up Lolita from summer camp. By the way, he plans to tell the administrators and Lolita herself that her mother is in &#34;critical condition&#34;. That is just what he does. Later that night, at a motel, he claims that Lolita seduces him, and they have sex. Later in the book she goes on to say that he raped her (but only in their private conversations, I believe she was actually just taunting him with information that could basically screw up his whole scheme). They continue to travel through the states until H.Hfinally decides that they should actually enroll Lolita into a school (Lolita throws a fit, BECAUSE SHE IS A CHILD). NOW THEY LIVE SOMEPLACE.<br /><br />So they move into this place right across from this all girls boarding school that Lolita attends. Then this part of the book happens.<br /><br />Then we come to the part where an administrator of the school call in her &#34;father&#34; (Oh, that might just be the most disturbing part of the book. The entire time--including when they're have sex--Lolita still refers to H.H as her &#34;father&#34; or &#34;dad&#34;) to discuss something. So, he is freaking out thinking that he has been discovered when in fact the administrator is just telling him that Lolita is unusually withdrawn from the entire aspect of sex. Was I the only one who was thinking &#34;well maybe that's because this guy is having sex with her&#34;. (A few times the text makes me believe that it was forced.)<br /><br />So, because of this H.H coerces Lolita into another road trip. This part is very interesting because throughout the latter half of it, H.H starts to act insane. (you know, other than being attracted to a twelve year old. Oh right, she's fourteen now.) He believe people are following them, which later you actually find out their was someone following them.<br /><br />So, this is basically all I had to rant about. I'll let you read the rest of the book. I felt extremely sad for Lolita, because her mother hated her and everyone else wanted to take advantage of her. She had absolutely no one. (And while H.H claims he actually loved her, I could beg to differ.)<br />The end.",2014-11-01

That sounds like a dismissive judgement, but it's closer to the mark than the majority of assertions made by famous literary critics and writers<br /><br />In the short essay at the end of this edition, Nabokov says there are three kinds of novels: (1) topical trash; (2) Novels of Ideas; (3) his kind of novel.<br /><br />Why do so many literary types find it impossible to accept the author's own version of what LOLITA really is?<br /><br />It certainly isn't &#34;topical trash&#34; a la C.P. Snow, and as for &#34;Novels of Ideas&#34;, we know what Nabokov thought of Thomas Mann; so why not admit that, as Nabokov said, that LOLITA is not a &#34;realistic novel&#34;, that it has &#34;no moral in tow&#34;, that it's not about his &#34;love affair with America&#34;, bur rather his love affair with the English language?<br /><br />LOLITA is not about &#34;reality&#34;; it's an aesthetic vision entirely and demands to be read as such.  The &#34;characters&#34; are not &#34;real&#34; so the crimes and misdemeanors won't fit in any moral scheme.  To be crude, you might as well think of Lolita and the others as characters in a Tom and Jerry cartoon, but a cartoon that's weighed and measured to produce what Nabokov called &#34;aesthetic bliss&#34;.<br /><br />LOLITA, to sum it up, is not a commentary on reality, it's a reality apart, a thing-in-itself.<br /><br />It's pathetic to see a great critic like Lionel Trilling, for example, straining to wring some moral meaning out of the book.  It's not about eros, he says, it's about love.  Alas, no, it's about Nabokov entirely and what he conceives as the ideal kind of novel.<br /><br />One minor quibble: you could ask yourself why the then obscure writer chose &#34;nympholepsy&#34; (pedophilia, technically) for his subject?  Did he foresee that such a putative &#34;subject&#34; would not only rescue him from his middling existence as a professor but make him a very rich and independent author.

Everything about 'Lolita' kept me needing more (not like Humbert Humbert, though).  I am giving this wonderful piece of literature a two-star rating because of a recent incident I experienced while on jury duty.  The case was simple, you see.  They had finally captured the Scranton flasher.  The prosecuting attorney was representing a sweet woman of nearly 60 who went by the name Phyllis.  She had been flashed by a mustachioed pervert with glasses in her office's parking lot while entering the building.  The defendant gave off the same creepy aura that Humbert exuded throughout much of the book.  His lawyer, Prude of the firm of Sue & Prude, stood boldly in front of the stand and read this entire novel, somehow making myself and the rest of the jury feel an immense amount of sympathy for the Scranton flasher.  Despite being a fantastic piece of literature, I cannot (notice that I used &#34;cannot&#34; instead of &#34;can not&#34; to show my emotion) support a book that makes twelve individuals--myself included--sympathize with and find innocent an obviously terrible man who shows sweet women his genitalia.<br />With that said, I do applaud Prude's way of handling the case.  Rumor has it that he only works cases of a sexual nature and reads this book aloud at each trial.

Lolita has been coined as a ‘love story’ and even ‘erotic’. In all honesty, this was simply Humbert attempting to convince himself (and others) that his actions were normal and completely justified. By the end pages, I could honestly say that Humbert believed wholeheartedly he truly loved Lolita, that he always had the best of intentions for her and that he was a good father to her. His version of love was of course far from normal and was quite sick and twisted indeed but because we’re only seeing this story from his point of view it’s obviously a biased and glamorized interpretation.<br /><br />‘We live not only in a world of thoughts, but also in a world of things. Words without experience are meaningless.’<br /><br />But to me that was the most amazing part of this story. When you really think about this story as a whole, you know what he did was wrong, you know that he changed that 12 year-old girl irrevocably and you can almost despise him for the fact that he blamed her for seducing him initially. However, despite all that, I know I’m not the only reader that struggled to not feel at least a slight bit of sympathy for him. And that’s the true brilliance of it.<br /><br />‘And the rest is rust and stardust.’<br /><br />Lolita is a truly remarkably written story that was undoubtedly shocking after its initial publication in 1955.

US,31314771,R1UKVDW1LLCUGP,0679723161,636015448,Lolita,Books,5,3,4,N,N,"Aesthetic and Psychological Masterpiece","While this is going to be a difficult read for anyone less than the most aesthetically and psychologically attuned literary reader, there is no doubt that this is a read well worth attempting.  It's merit as a novel does not reside in its story; so, if you read reviews that say something to the effect, \\""is this memoir of a pedophile supposed to be a classic?\\"" you have run into an extremely low-level reader, incapable of appreciating what the story content permits in the less tangible aspects of literature.  Having a window into the mind of someone like \\""Humbert Humbert\\"" allows for a literary voice to bring out the sinister enthusiasm of an individual afflicted with a taboo passion, which immediately allows the reader to exist in this mental space where there is some amount of empathy, which, for most, will immediately result in a large degree of discomfort.  This window puts us in a space in which we are at once confronted by this beautiful passion that instantiates in the mind a kind of revulsion.  Nabokov does not apply a normative standard to the novel, because the conscience of Humbert Humbert is the only thing that can speak to the reader, acknowledging, at times, the egregious nature of his desires that are suppressed by rational thought compelled by social convention, on the one hand, and, on the other, the ecstasy of genuine impulse of passion.  The object of that passion, a young girl named Dolores (\\""Lolita\\"") Haze, is what brings the conflict and turmoil down upon the reader.  It is the unorthodox, taboo nature of the subject, facilitated by the aesthetic portrayal of the protagonist's (really, antagonist's) world that allows the reader to be drawn into psychological space that is, simultaneously, warming, moving, and consequently dissettling.<br /><br />In defense of the book, and in a similar vein as Nabokov's on defense, this novel is not \\""pornographic\\"": \\""in modern times the term \\""pornography\\"" connotes mediocrity, commercialism, and certain strict rules of narration.  Obscenity must be mated with banality because every kind of aesthetic enjoyment has to be entirely replaced by simple sexual stimulation which demands the traditional word for direct action upon the patient.\\""  In other words, the allusions -and they are only allusions, e.g., \\""sodomy\\"" is only used once in the book in Humbert Humbert's indictment--are all very much contained to extremely poetic and suggestive language.  If ever there were a valid instance for the employment of Michael Savage's phrase, \\""psychological nudity,\\"" this is it.  What, I think, tends to disturb most reserved and/or conservative readers is the way in which Nabokov's words can and do put us in touch with a perspective so extraordinarily alien to our reason that we are moved to feel things we would otherwise not, and this is not a welcome feeling for those reserved and conservative readers.<br /><br />The last substantial point I have to make is how Nabokov is able to get the reader to a particular psychological state, and he does this through language.  Beautiful, magnificent, sometimes waxing poetic language.  I cannot express the pleasure I took in running my eyes over the words, sometimes reverting back to the beginning of sentence upon finishing it.  The turns of phrase, expressions, and auditory qualities of Nabokov's composition strike me as unparalleled.  I have read much in my life, but I have read nothing like this.  His ability to ecstatically present the sensuous phenomena, Humbert Humbert's object of desire, is what makes the novel work, and affords for the wildly psychological nature of the text.  Crack the book, read a sentence, and you will see what I mean.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend this to all, but I would recommend this to all of sufficient maturity and reading ability.  I will not put an age on the lower bound of whom I think should read this; I imagine some fifteen-year olds could be mature enough, though it may not be advisable, in general.  Likewise, I can imagine there are some fifty-year olds not mature enough for this novel.  I will simply say that intellectuals, students of all ages, and scholars of sufficient literary aesthetic sensitivity, reading ability, and maturity should give this book a go.  I also recommend it to religious individuals who might like a window into the psyche of someone typically depicted as the enemy of society, because this book, better than any other I have ever read, has the ability to put the reader in touch with the humanity of someone in struggle, and who happens to be encumbered with passions that oppose various religions' or societies' values.<br /><br />A note on the edition: The 50th anniversary edition, printed by Vintage International, is a good edition.  The typeset is very clean and readable, so I can only recommend it, only having seen, otherwise, the Everyman's Library edition, which is almost as good.  I would suggest Everyman's Library for one reason only, that the introduction is very nice, placing the novel in quite a bit of context.

Wonderful writing; stellar stylistically, each paragraph a work of art. Is this really Nabokov’s second language? you wonder, and he throws in a lot of saucy French just for fun, taking the prose to ever new heights. In terms of style, Lolita is off the charts. The prose is poetic – fluid and original. Page after page, wow, wow, wow. Martin Amis doesn’t list Vladimir Nabokov as a top influence, but Lolita reads like an Amis novel, with less gallow’s humour and more fluidity. The story itself, however, is pretty bloody twisted. The protagonist, Humbert Humbert, is a child molester. I like novels with anti-heroes, ones where you find yourself cheering on or empathising with an ethically bereft protagonist even though you know you shouldn’t. But HH is a whole other type of anti-hero. He’s an enlightened, refined, and eloquent pedophile, and as impressive as his French his, he’s a criminal and admits he should be given 35 years for rape. Lolita’s nightly sobbing is eminently disturbing.<br /><br /> And not much happens in the novel. After Humbert Humbert attains his prize, the novel becomes fictional travel literature (better than most real travel literature!) before switching back to drama (guy loses girl is replaced by child abuser loses victim). There’s a decent ending, but a bit of a clich&eacute; one (as Nabokov practically admits), and that’s it – plus a word from the author explaining how everything you’ve probably thought about the novel is meritless; he didn’t mean it like that. He bedevils in the telling, and then bedevils in the explanation. Nabokov plays with you, and you let him because he’s such a good writer, but you cringe, or should, at his honeyed poetry’s horror.<br /><br />Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the World",2014-04-23

I can't say I had an enjoyable time reading this..it's melodramatic at times, creepy, and often disgusting; but it does serve a point. I view it as a writer (Nabokov) challenging himself to write a piece of complex literature that is linguistically impressive enough to force the reader to feel empathy towards a detestable character.

There is no doubt Humbert has true love for Lolita, and his remorse and small attempt at atonement in the last 1/4 of the novel reveal this love.

A self-obsessed neurotic pervert who believes himself better looking and more cultured and more intelligent than everyone. Yet, H.H is beaten by a young girl. I don't want to go sifting through my thoughts to create allegories or metaphor that I don't think were there. I believe most of the story is to be taken at face value.<br /><br />The power of \\""Lolita\\"" comes much from the word play. I probably understood less than a third. A dictionary was a must. I felt stupid many times -- H.H's purpose? -- but also positively mesmerized. I tried to write the words down that I learned, but beside languor, which becomes a favorite of his, I would still need a dictionary.<br /><br />I must settle for four instead of five. I love it because it takes risks. I love it for the wordplay. I do not love it for the dips that do not impact the story. Nabokov writes in this fiftieth anniversary edition that he is in the first place a Russian author; that it wasn't until recently that he tried becoming an English one. A very precise obsessive man like Nabokov -- known for studying butterfly genitalia to some scientific acclaim regarding migrations - wrote on some ethereal level most of us will never touch.

Novels of this type are rare; books where the prose is not so dense that it will take you three years to finish it; its first chapter is not in Greek or Latin; you do not need to buy another book to explain what you're reading or to translate each sentence for you from English to English; it is not a book to be slogged through, and no one should expect a trophy for finishing it.<br /><br />`Lolita' by Vladimir Nabokov doesn't so much hit that sweet spot, as much as it define it.  For readers like me this novel comes close to perfection. (It does use a lot of French phrases-I'll read it again when I'm through with Rosetta Stone Français.)<br />The qualities that make it such a unique mixture of pleasure and art?  Well- first up- it's not boring.  The prose is so thick in spots it is like mad poetry, but it flows off the page with such melody that I found myself slamming the book shut sharply or bowing my head and closing my eyes trying to decide should I read each page twice or wait and read the book again after finishing.  (I've done both, several times.)<br /><br />It also has the thing left out of most serious works- it's funny.  Joseph Conrad's maxim that, \\""Any work that aspires, however humbly, to the condition of art should carry its justification in every line.\\"" is followed here, but also the desire to be hilarious in each chapter holds true as well; the humor matches the tragedy and the brilliance of the prose.<br /><br />For those new to the novel and looking for some broad information and its story line I will give you a quick introduction.  (It is not a spoiler, since it is revealed in the introduction)  The novel opens on page one with all the main (and some of the minor) characters already dead and buried.  It is narrated by a self-professed child molester telling us of his quest to coerce, bribe and sexually possess a preteen girl, Delores Haze, nicknamed `Lolita'.<br /><br />So- one of the greatest novels, if not the greatest, in English is written by a Russian about a middle-aged child rapist. (Although, as a child, Nabokov could read and write in English before Russian.)  As Humbert Humbert, the `hero' of this book freely admits, the story is skewed towards a more flattering version of himself and, indeed, he succeeds, as he's certainly the most likable child raping murderer that I can think of- although admittedly I don't haven't met any.<br /><br />OK, OK- too glib for such a disturbing subject, but so is Humbert, who details in brilliant lyrical prose his history of a childhood in Europe, his ostensible reason for his lust for young Delores (a dated contrivance I think- Lolita as a substitute for a lost love- but I'm no psychiatrist), and of his journey through the mythical America of the fifties trying to escape capture for his crimes followed by his doppelganger, the specious playwright Clare Quilty, the man desired by Lolita who spurns her as equally as she spurns Humbert.  It's more a proxy threesome of aversion than a love triangle.  `A' loves `B' and `B' loves `C' and `C' loves... we've all been there.<br /><br />Then there is the post-war America that Nabokov expounds on in the way only a foreigner can, describing the cheesy roadside attractions and modern fifties life that the US so desperately wants to be real.  (That world was real for me, and so many others.  Is something an illusion if it's all you've ever known?)<br /><br />Nabokov reveals to us the falseness of America in the fifties- the hypocrisy and isolationism of our American cocoon from the perspective of a member of a fallen aristocratic family, viewing us through the prism of the hardened immigrant.  (A recent biography shows us just how exciting Nabokov's life was; a father shot and killed while jumping in front of an assassin's bullet; being shot at as he escaped on the last boat out of Sebastopol; fleeing German troops out of France to America, etc.)<br /><br />For those of you that despise Humbert's frivolous treatment of his crimes against Lolita, there is only the fact that the story is told from Humbert's point of view.  The enormity of what he has stolen from Lolita- her childhood- finally dawns on him near the finish of the book.  His crushing realization of what he's done hits him as he stands by the side of the road, listening to the laughs and cries of children in the distance of a nearby town.<br /><br />If you've read anything about this book before reading it then you no doubt know that it is not, in any sense, an erotic novel.<br />Buy 'Lolita'.  Read the first few pages.  If the writing doesn't grab you right away, put it down and pick it up again in a year or two.  Keep it visible, and don't read it until you long for every page, every sentence.  Don't force yourself to read it; that is to say- don't ruin it for yourself.  I've never understood why people that love books insist on pushing books they love when they're thirty or forty or fifty, onto 20 year old college students.

Sorry to say, but I have read, or perused, but one. And that one, in English, was given to my grandmother Sophie, Vladimir Nabokov's first cousin (they lived almost on the same street in St. Petersburg as kids) by the writer himself around 1957. He lovingly inscribed it to Sophie including his signature drawing of a butterfly. This was supposed to be a rare honor.<br /><br />When she read it she would blush and mumble and appear disturbed. When I asked why, being a very young man, she just stated that she didn't understand how Volodia (short for Vladimir) could write such \\""gadost\\"" (roughly \\""trash\\"" in Russian). This, of course, piqued my interest. But this interest was cut short by the seemingly impenetrable prose confronting me at the time I had a chance peek at the \\""gadost\\"".<br /><br />Over the years it became known within the family that \\""gadost\\"" had made Volodia extremely wealthy and even famous, for lo and behold he was now being courted by Hollywood moguls for the right to make a movie.

But can he stay free of the law?  How far will his lust take him?  And can he control the strong will of the child?  Even though the destination was unspectacular, the tension was strong and kept me flipping pages.  Thankfully it didn't devolve into soap opera or porno.  In fact, the plot was all foreplay, all on the edge, all constant frustration.

While Lolita is modern America personified--messy, coarse, spontaneous, and outwardly perverse.  Each was fascinating to watch as they struggled with inward desires and outward pressures.  But even more fascinating was their relationship.  Just who was in charge?  Who was using who?  And who was the hero and who the villain?<br /><br />3) Theme (4 stars) - Love, and its many close cousins: lust, compassion, jealousy, control, power, tenderness, manipulation, giving, score keeping, guilt, loss.

In fact, besides the fear of getting caught by the law, these are the basic themes in any dysfunctional relationship.  So perhaps there's a statement in here about how we shouldn't judge love by its outward appearance, but instead by its inward poison or sweetness.<br /><br />4) Voice (5 stars) - The story is told in the frantic, fervent, lyrical, lustful voice of the main character pleading his case as if to a jury.  The sentences sing (and this is Nabokov's third language!).<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - America in the post-war abundance, candy-bloated, movie star obsessed, Route66 motel-filled era.

Reviews of 'Lolita', both professional and popular, tend to focus, apart from on his humorous European observations of American life, and his incisive social commentary,on the fact that Nabokov was able to evoke sympathy for the most despised among humanity, namely the paedophile. In the 1950s it must have been a signal literary achievement. At least one person has suggested that 'the theme of Lolita is not the corruption of an innocent child by a cunning adult, so much as the exploitation of a weak adult by a corrupt child'. And that 'whilst this is not a pretty theme, it is one with which social workers, magistrates, and psychiatrists are familiar'. (Robertson Davies -see Wikipaedia). These kinds of points are valid, and recognise the iconoclastic air of the 1950s. They merit as much consideration now as then, and are helpful in the field of social policy. However they do seem to me to dodge what perhaps would be the central question that a modern reviewer would ask. How well does Nabokov understand the mind of a man who is besotted by a twelve-year-old child? Humbert's yearnings for a 'nymphet' are repeated in the novel ad nauseam, but I do not feel any nearer, as a result of reading Lolita, to an understanding of what is going on inside the mind of the main character. The only clue we are given is that Humbert's obsession with young girls arises out of the death of his childhood sweetheart.  From what is known of the author's life, he would appear to have had conventional sexual orientations toward adult females, so anything he has written is hardly likely to have been born out of personal experience. He provides few clues as to the 'why' concerning Humbert. Nabokov's starting point seems to be that paedophiles are, and always will be. And he proceeds from there. Modern readers must increasingly be asking themselves where such an erudite thinker as Nabokov might have stood, for example, in the genes versus nurture debate, which is just one of the agonising questions which would be de rigueur to any modern treatment of the subject.",2013-08-16

So much has happened in our culture re child abuse and shifting sexual mores, that I had a tough time not considering Humbert Humbert a monster.

Sometimes it is difficult to forget Stanley Kubrick's superb casting in the movie, and not picture James Mason, Sue Lyon and Shelly Winters, and of course, Peter Sellers, but that's not an unbearable burden.

However, I dropped it in the middle, surprisingly, not because of the controversial theme of it, but rather because I couldn’t relate to Nabokov’s writing in general, and to Humbert in particular. Even his wit and his twisted logic weren’t enough to draw me in.  <br /><br />Fast forward a few years, I decided to give it a second try. Well, this time around, I was able to finish and slightly more enjoy it. But I still think it’s overrated. Yes, Nabokov’s literary skills are impressive, and his use of the English language is beautiful. However, after about 100 pages, I grew tired of Humbert’s twisted logic and colorful metaphors. Perhaps, it’s because I always enjoyed a more direct and simple writing style, such as Hemingway’s, which couldn’t be more different than Nabokov’s. “Lolita” should be read, and I suspect most people will even enjoy it more than I did.<br /> ",2013-06-27

This sets the backdrop against which Lolita becomes the novel about a love so powerful that it endures everything including contemporary society.<br /><br />In the first short paragraph of the novel, Nabakov describes the pleasure his middle aged man-in-love gets from just saying the name:  Lolita.  Humbert has repeated her name to himself so many times and with such attention that he knows exactly the trip of his tongue that allows him to say her name.  How many of us love our mates so much that we get that kind of joy just saying their name?  Though flawed, this Humbert is a man passionately in love.<br /><br />So in love is he with Lolita that he marries a woman he doesn't love just to be around her; he dismisses her slights to him with love, and in the end, allows himself the supreme act of love for his Lolita.<br /><br />From the 1950's until now, people have gotten hung up on the age difference when they should have been focusing on the love story.

Only the fact that its opalescent prose brought me to tears? Or the fact that its gruesome obsession made me want to turn myself inside out and purge the very idea of such lechery out of my system, now and forever? How may I even begin to phantom to describe what this story is about when the very fabric of its composition borders on divine? I don't know where to begin. Lolita is poetry in prose. Lolita is tenderness wrapped around engorged lust. Lolita is everything and anything and nothing at once, an ethereal creature conjured in the mind of a hopeless romantic caught in the elusive dream of his childhood. Lolita is an exercise in seeing the world of magic in minute details, with disturbing clarity and lewdness. Lolita is the epitome of what true possession means, starting from the heart and continuing to the very marrow of the bones, corrupting one's spirit. The spirit of Humbert Humbert, the squallid monster of a man whose duality will puncture your mind with sharp spikes of impossible horror.<br /><br />I would say, Lolita is a story about love, albeit a forbidden love, yet still, it's about love taken to the highs of mania. In this sense, it's perfect. The characters come alive on page, burst from it, pulling you in by the throat and making your heart beat faster. The exquisitely woven descriptions intermingle with smart humor, a parody on consumerism, and general comedy on life, with satire lashing out at every aspect of it, from pitiful marriages, to thinly veiled politeness that means nothing, to a landscape of road-trip America with its cheap motels and simple-minded people. Above all, it's erotic in a sick yet exquisite kind of way, the kind that makes you want to gag yet at the same time keeps you reading. Because you're unable to stop. Because in its wrongness, Lolita is art. And perhaps thats why is strikes you hard. In the end, when you know that Humbert Humbert is a pervert in the truest sense of this word, he confesses to loving Lolita, and you can't, simply can't, judge a feeling.truest sense of this word, he confesses to loving Lolita, and you can't, simply can't, judge a feeling.",2013-04-21

To society at large, this middle-aged college professor who seduces and kidnaps a schoolgirl is a monster of depravity, but, strangely, to the reader of his memoir he is an entertaining and even endearing charmer rather than a disgusting pervert.  How does this come about?  Well, at the start at least Lolita is half the wooer.  When Charlotte Haze, Lolita's mother, is about to drive her daughter off to camp to keep Humbert to herself, the girl impetuously keeps her waiting to dash back into the house and embrace her elderly lover: `A moment later I heard my sweetheart running up the stairs.  My heart expanded with such force that it almost blotted me out.  I hitched up the pants of my pajamas, flung the door open: and simultaneously Lolita arrived, in her Sunday frock, stamping, panting, and then she was in my arms, her innocent mouth melting under the ferocious pressure of dark male jaws, my palpitating darling!'  That the girl later wearies of her ardent pursuer - and he resorts to bribing her with expensive clothes and jewellery, not to mention the long trip across America and back - is another matter.  Selfish and obsessed, Humbert constantly tortures himself rather than the girl, whose attitude to him during the long escapist trek after her mother's death swings wildly between affection and contempt.<br /><br />`I am trying to describe these things not to relive them in my present boundless misery, but to sort out the portion of hell and the portion of heaven in that strange, awful, maddening world - nymphet love. The beastly and the beautiful merged at one point, and it is that borderline that I would like to fix,' Humbert explains to the reader. The novel is one vast apology for his life and the obsession that gives it meaning.  It's at once absurd, comic, pathetic and sad, but always entertaining and even enlightening.  The contrast between the protagonists assures that their intimacy will never be dull.  Lo is a far from innocent, feckless American brat being cosseted and indulged by a sophisticated European.  Alone together the sparks are bound to fly.  Whether Humbert's resort to firearms are: one, justified, and two, convincing in the final scene of carnage is another matter.  But after all, the setting is gun-toting, wild America with all its gewgaw distractions.  Here, anything goes; why not a little harmless incest?nd even enlightening.

This was written for the base animals that believe that those we covet are so incredibly innocent that we believe we take their virginity with each simple kiss.<br />This is, perhaps, the truth that is shrouded in the controversy of the story.<br />We like to think it's all about this dirty old man and his contrived machinations against an unsuspecting, innocent little girl when, what we are really talking about is the way humans manipulate their fellow man (or woman, as it were), to exploit the gains they seek for themselves.<br />In the end, are we really talking about a dirty old man? Somewhat, yes we are. Are we also talking about a girl that has designs on her future and who believes this man can provide them?

And like most of the readers of this book, I got some of the puns and allusions, and surely missed many others; only the most erudite professor would catch the majority of them.<br /><br />But I'll focus for just a moment on the beautiful use of language in the book. Nabokov wrote \\""Lolita\\"" in the third or fourth language that he learned, after his native Russian and subsequent French. (His German is pretty darn good, too.)

I've highlighted dozens of similarly evocative phrases, any one of which is better than anything I've ever written.<br /><br />The other thing about the book -- and this goes back to when I read it as a college undergrad -- is that Humbert Humbert is so warped and unreliable that it's hard to know what's real in the story.  I distinctly remember wondering if he had actually had sex with Dolores at all, or whether he was basically fantasizing almost the whole thing.  That is, he kidnapped her for a couple of days and fondled her, and that's as far as it went.  Everything else was in his head.  Now I realize that's definitely not the obvious reading of the plot, but Humbert spins out so many things that it's hard to get any true \\""read\\"" on it.

I got to say this is the diary of a self-centred, selfish, perverted and illusional sex pervert lusting after young girl.<br /><br />Probably best sum up as his imagination, which i hope, in his private life, he won't be daring enough to try that out, or has he?<br /><br />It's a hard and slow read because seriously the author is dragging the plot or his imagination, whichever way you see it and difficult to read because of what he intend to do with the child. Hanging onto her for his selfish reason and giving excuses that he love her when he don't, just to keep her by his side to play out his sexual fantasy part. It's quite heartbreaking to hear from Lolita herself that the other man who got her pregnant, one who she is only ever crazy about, breaks her heart but for him, he break her whole life. I think Lolita also felt disgusted at some point for letting him touch her but not knowing how to get away from him, since her mum's accident, he's her only guardian yet the only next of kin to sexually abused or taken advantage of the whole situation, also put a bad spotlight on 'decent stepfather'. He never ever love Lolita and that's a fact. He only love what Lolita can play out for his imagination. If not, Lolita wouldn't have go off disappearing on him just like that with a stranger man. She just couldn't wait to get away from him and be more sane than she would be when she was with him. Still, he got his 'soft side' when Lolita was pregnant and wrote to him for money, which he gave it to her, although i believe it's from her mum's apartment finance. Speaking of mum, the author quick and convenient way of getting rid of the mum by her own action of irrational behavior, with wanting to send letters to her daughter, arrangement, a divorce, etc, does make me feel appalled too. At least he make it speedily and didn't want to drag on that 'stay married with the mother's torturing part' for too long.<br /><br />To cut the review short, as most reviewers had said what i wanted to say but the final closing of the book confusely mention that if the story became reality, then i guess the consequences of alot of what is been describe into the situation would be seriously dreadful. Like lust bring a man's downfall. So it's a warning not to become like what the narrator of the story's imagination or else face the music. The question is: Does he want to be or not? Is this supposed to be an educational part for people who intend to prey on innocent young girl for sexual problem? Most importantly, would someone with such livid imagination uses plot like this in his everyday lives, to ruin everything that he had or naively think he could still do a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde? The writer seem to give the impression he wishes to be Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. He play out his fantasy, very wordly i must say and before he ends, he give out advice on the rights and the wrongs. Like Shakespeare play: To be or not to be?<br /><br />Read only if you had the time, since it can be kind of draggy and complexing, you had to think through what the writer wanted to portray but seriously fail to speak across directly, he just go around it. Whatever his intention, it has become a classic. I wonder if those in the past (esp. sexual predator) read this book. And Lolita does encourage certain darker side from a human's life and mind. If it's educational, it's not a fully positive one. It can be negatively if people put their mind and action on the wrong side of it.",2012-12-15

A Masterpiece!","At some point, my father told me that his mother would not allow him to read LOLITA.  I cannot remember if it was before or after I chanced upon the Jeremy Irons rendition of the film.  Either way, that started my love affair of LOLIA.  Something that could grab my father's attention, bring my grandmother's disapproval, and capture Jeremy Irons had to be worthwhile.  However, for some reason or the other, I never got around to reading the book.  A few weeks ago, after reading an article on my phone, Lolita was brought back to my mind.  Spending a few minutes on my local library's website, I was happy to learn that they had a copy of the book!  And thus began my adventure with Lolita and the lovelorn Humbert Humbert.<br /><br />LOLITA is a hard book to discuss.  The subject matter alone is enough to cause one to curl their toes in disgust.  The idea of a 37 year-old man falling in love with a 12 year-old girl is rather startling.  More so was his devious way of getting close to the young girl, becoming her stepfather, and taking her on a cross country road trip after her mother died.  However, for all of the fault people can and will find with this book, I found myself enjoying it.  Vladimir has a way with words.  The prose in this book is simply remarkable.  Even though, at some level, I wanted to despise Humbert, I found myself feeling somewhat sorry for him at the end.  To me, that is the mark of a master storyteller.<br /><br />Reading a lot of reviews, people are torn between the true villain in the story.  Some believe that Humbert was just Lolita's victim and not at fault for his actions.  While some view him as the ultimate sexual predator.  While I read this book, I kept both view points in mind, and I think both parties fall short.  Even though his actions were deplorable, I place a lot of the blame with Lolita's mother, Charlotte.  I am not sure where it started, but, by the time Humbert enters the picture, Charlotte seems to be fostering severe feelings of hate for her daughter.  She is constantly picking on Lo, she fills out surveys to describe the girl as horrid, she makes of a point of calling Lo \\""plain,\\"" and so on.  When it is obvious that something might be brewing between Humbert and Lo, she quickly sends the girl away to summer camp because she does not want competition for the affections of a handsome European.  Further, she seeks to send Lo away to a boarding school until she graduates.  Even Humbert himself remarks on these actions towards the girl.  When Charlotte discovers incriminating evidence in Humbert's desk, she still seeks to blame the child.<br /><br />Coming from a family life where she lost her father at a young age and living with a mother who hates her, it is easy to see why Lo grabs onto Humbert.  He is a dashingly good looking European male.  He seems charming and gives her attention.  He does not scold her for normal childlike behavior.  It makes sense to me that she would flirt with him and so forth.  However, at some level, I think she knew full well what game she was playing.  That being said, at 12 years-old, she had not way to understand the ramifications of the game.  And, as the story progresses, I was left to wonder whether the child was horribly damaged by other past occurrences--things that would make a young girl think the only way to get attention from a male was through sex.<br /><br />None of this is to say that Humbert was in the right.  From the onset of the book, he makes it clear that he knew he was in the wrong.  Knowing and continuing to act on something is disgusting!  Further, his constant justifications disturbed me.  Just because a love affair with a 12 year-old was common in the Middle Ages doesn't mean it is acceptable now.  (Also, the comment about Sade's Justine made my skin crawl.)  At many points during the book, I found myself wishing that Lo would tell one of her friends or someone would find out.  It was not fair to rob Lo of a childhood, because Humbert was in love with her.  That being said, I found myself feeling somewhat sorry for Hum at the end of the book.<br /><br />The beginning and ending of this book will stay with me.  I am not sure how to describe the ending without giving anything away.  Let's just say, when all was said and done, in his own way, Hum truly loved his Lolita.<br /><br />I truly loved this book.

Although Humbert is convicted for murdering Quilty (presumably to bury Quilty's - not our - knowledge of Humbert's repeated rape of Lolita), Humbert emerges from insanity by surrendering himself, finally, to life's immutable design; and in the process he receives a jolt of self-awareness: \\""Had I come before myself, I would have given Humbert thirty-five years for rape, and dismissed the rest of the charges.\\""<br /><br />Nabokov chased after butterflies a good deal of his life, fascinated by nature's hidden patterns, the grand design that lay beyond our struggles with ourselves. Is this enough of a foundation for great literature? I don't think so. When we sweep away the pleasures of Nabokov's brilliant (if arch) writing style and pyrotechnic wordplay, we are left with caricatures instead of flesh and blood characters. As you read \\""Lolita\\"" isn't there a voice in the back of your mind telling you that Humbert and Lolita cannot possibly exist as real people?

As with his audio of \\""Brideshead Revisited\\"" (also reviewed by me), he's perfectly matched with his elegant, dry, astringent, pained, self-justifying, convincing tone to the content of this famous tale. I heard this on series of long drives, and took along Alfred Appel's \\""The Annotated Lolita\\"" (compiled in league with Vladimir Nabokov, if he's to be trusted!) to check the passages in other languages, the recondite references, and the pop culture nods that since postwar America's turned into strip malls, tracts, and big-box stores have diminished in visibility or meaning.<br /><br />I'd raced through the novel, no notes, in college and remembered it fondly, especially for its evocation of seedy roadside America.

The first thread was the actual story as it unfolded linearly--how the characters experience the story. The second thread was the writing style/narrative--how the author experiences the story. The third thread was the way I felt about the narrator, Humbert Humbert, and the book at large--how I experience the story. All three of these met in a synergistic yarn which caused the three elements/entities (characters, authors, reader) to be interconnected in such as way as to make the existence of each impossible without the existence of the others.<br /><br />Throughout \\""Part One,\\"" I was absolutely entranced and delighted by the writing and, much to my chagrin and confusion, felt just as charmed by the pedophile Humbert Humbert himself. The book takes a sharp turn at Part Two. This was an interesting and ingenious division for the book: the change from Part One to Part Two is that Lolita finds out that her mother is dead. Charlotte actually has been dead for quite some book-time. Both the reader and Humbert know the mother is and has been dead. Only Lolita didn't know, and when she finds out, everything changes.<br /><br />\\""Part Two\\"" begins the slow decline of the regard in which Humbert is held by Lolita, by Nabokov, and by the reader. His charm and wit have worn thin with his self-awareness and, later, his inability to deprive himself of self gratification. Confidence has become smarm, which soon gives way to patheticalness. The writing seems to become long-winded and cloying. I don't fault Nabokov for this, as some reviewers have. Rather, the culprit is Humbert's increasingly desperate attempts at justification for his actions that plays out via the narrative. I began to hate him, began to hate what he had to say, began to hate his every action, and in turn began to hate the book and the writing itself--but I was so mired in the story that I could not put it down. Likewise, Lolita was mired in her own situation that she could not escape. Even when she thought she did escape, she just got into another situation that was equally unhealthy for her. She never really escaped at all until her death (which we learn about at the beginning of the book, but actually occurs after the book is over: she dies in childbirth). The reader gets to escape the misery of the story at the same time both the characters do; but only death is a strong enough reprieve from the torment they've been subjected to by the hand of McFate and by their own designs.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, I felt immensely uncomfortable and confused at how much I was enjoying reading this book about a \\""nympholectic\\"" pedophile. It made me feel dirty, decadent, and debased. But the way I felt throughout the end of the book completely reconciled my emotive response to where it \\""should\\"" have been through the incredible feat of making me strongly desire to read a book I was, at points, loathing.<br /><br />There's so much to say about this incredible book, but I haven't fully been able to wrap my brain around it all. I just wanted to write a few words about my response as a writer. What I'm taking from this is how your narrative design can affect the interconnectedness of character/author/reader--and the tremendous effect that interconnectedness can have. I've also learned about creating unreliable narrators, and the power of both sides of that coin: when the unreliability is only hinted at, or unknown completely, and when the unreliability is undeniable and almost excruciating to the reader. Nabokov used that tool to effectively manipulate his readers emotive responses as if he were creating the responses himself.<br /><br />I love when you finish a book and you feel like you have \\""traveled\\"" - through time, through space, and through that intangible journey that is experience.<br /><br />Read it.><br />Read it.",2012-07-13

However it takes courage, open-mindedness, and a fundamental strength in one's basic convictions to actually read something you may disagree with and discuss exactly what is offensive and where the line between so-called pornography any great literature lies.<br /><br />Nabokov's writing in Lolita is perhaps the best I have ever read. This fact is made all the more remarkable considering he is not a native English speaker - Lolita was written in English and then translated by him into his native Russian. The prose simply sparkles with intricate wordplay, and is absolutely beautiful to experience firsthand. Perhaps the most amazing thing about Nabokov's skill is that despite all fore warnings he is still able to seduce us, whispering into our ear through unreliable narrator Humbert Humbert, and draw us into an extremely controversial story that is impossible to put down even though we personally may be disgusted and repulsed by the content. How does Nabokov achieve this magic? It is something that you must read for yourself to fully understand.<br /><br />Humbert, as an unreliable narrator, tells the story through his own eyes and we understand things they way he understands them. Although we may not agree with the sick twists and turns of Humbert's dark mind, we understand them and we comprehend how and why he thinks the way he does. This type of approach to storytelling is very unsettling to many because it lures you into a false sense of security and lets you identify with Humbert before his thoughts and actions turn to the unspeakable. The unreliable narrator is an amazingly effective plot device - perhaps too effective for some who might put the book down in the middle out of sheer horror.<br /><br />I recently discovered that Nabokov had synesthesia, a condition where numbers, colors, shapes, and music often interrelate and overlap. I have had synesthesia my entire life, and it was an added bonus for me to read many of the author's especially lush, lovely, and vibrant descriptions brought about by this fascinating aspect of his personality. \\""The afternoon drifted on and on, in ripe silence, and the sappy tall trees seemed to be in the know; and desire, even stronger than before, began to afflict me again,\\"" is a good quote. Silence is \\""ripe\\"" and tall trees are personified as being \\""sappy\\"" and \\""in the know.\\"" Another good example comes from Nabokov's book Bend Sinister, where Krug perceives the word \\""loyalty\\"" as being like a \\""golden fork lying out in the sun.\\"" He hears \\""loyalty\\"" and unconsciously pictures the golden fork. Nabokov uses his synesthesia to great effect, not just writing descriptions but creating entire paintings with his words, right down to the subtle textures and shifting hues in a scene.<br /><br />You do not have to agree with a book's content to appreciate the superb skill and craft of the writing contained within. Lolita is great literature, and perhaps decades of ongoing controversy are testament to this fact. Love it or condemn it, Nabokov's Lolita is one of the finest novels ever written and it demands to be read.

It must be noted in advance that the book is however quite distinctly different from the movie in the following two senses. Firstly, Lolita is twelve years old in the book and around some four feet tall. In the movie, she was fifteen and much taller. But on another level, and this is what is reinforced by the author's notes at the end of the book, is that there is no reference at all to any description of child sex whatsoever in the book, and this is why the author found his detractors' objections so unfair. The book for me was very much a study of the inner workings of a paedophile's mind. And while I did not judge poor Humbert Humbert's sexual proclivity and his affinity for \\""nymphets\\"", as he calls them, I did find his fascination on a personal level with child sexual attraction somewhat weird. But that is how I feel, which is really completely irrelevant, and which shows that the author has succeeded in his subject matter in bringing Humbert Humbert's feelings alive. The point being is that this book is high art, and in art anything goes, even paedophilia. But the book however is not some sort of treatise on the subject of child-love; it is more an explanation of why Humbert Humbert is the way he is.<br /><br />Poor Humbert Humbert. I did feel sorry for him. I even understood him. But, none of what he did or thought or felt, did I find to be comedy or even black comedy, as some reviewers have stated. To me, it was just sad. A sad and doomed and impossible relationship from the start. My question is: what did he really get out of her beyond the artistic child-love obsession? Because he conceded she was mentally dull. And the sex? He had to make \\""deals\\"" with her in order for her to comply sexually. So how enjoyable could that have been when she was never really party to it? I had a gay friend once who was in love with a much younger man. I asked him what was it about this young man that held him so? He told me it was all about the beauty of eternal youth.<br /><br />Humbert Humbert seems to have felt the same way, except that Lolita was over the hill in his mind when she was only in her late teens. One must also not forget that Humbert Humbert was in and out of mental homes throughout his adult life and this could go some way to explaining his unique psychological make up which put him on the border-line of what society would deem madness.<br /><br />At any rate, it is a fascinating and beautifully written and evocative book about a subject that is taboo.

Yes, the book is about a pedophile and his love affair with a 12 year old girl. Many people tend to discredit the book simply because of this, but I implore you to give the book a chance. The book is not about a man who goes and savagely takes advantage of a young girl. It is a very in depth book into the whole story of the factious Mr. Humbert and Dolores Haze (A.K.A Lolita) and their love affair. The book does not try to say that pedophilia is alright and nor does it try to say that pedophiles are deserving of sympathy. These are common argument I've heard against the book from people who have failed to even read the first two words of it. The way the book is written is very unique and a retelling of the events, as Mr. Humbert recalls them. Though Humbert does implore some sympathy towards himself, he in no way claims to be a good person that is being mistreated. He accepts that what he has done is wrong. I tell you this bit of spoiler to let you know a bit about Mr. Humbert if you are on the fence just because of the whole Humbert being a pedophile bit. I tell you this much about Mr. Humbert as many people have read reviews stating that he tries to garter sympathy for himself in a manner that he thinks he is innocent and wanting to escape all punishment. This is not true.<br /><br />All in all, this is a must read for anyone who loves to read. The book isn't a difficult read and isn't terribly long.

I wondered how that could be, given the topic, and I listened to a highly praised audio version in my car, hoping to be wowed by exquisite prose, and a vision of an unusual sexual relationship that nevertheless was full of beauty.  Alas!  my new-found expectations were sadly disappointed.  The prose was okay, but not, I thought, outstanding.  The subject was not one I was used to, but even with a deliberately open mind, I did not find it beguiling.  The characters were believable, even though the plot was less so: the girl's mother disappears far too conveniently, and the kidnapping of Lolita goes on for much longer than anyone would think possible in a country with any kind of child welfare system.  The narrator's character is believably drawn, but it's very hard to find a pedophile wither interesting or attractive.  Lolita, too, believable as a character, but I could not suppress my horror at her fate, even while noting that as a portrait of a very young girl, she was not particularly attractive.  What goes on as the narrator and Lolita travel round the US by car, always feeing discovery by any kind of authority, is the repeated statutary rape of a minor (when she willingly 'sells' herself) but also (worse in my view) the repeated violent taking by force of an unwilling child - even if she were not exactly 'innocent'.  I believe that Nabokov could not have gotten away with publishing this account today for a general readership as I think that our society is now more conscious of child abuse and would not have sanctioned it in the grounds of literary value.

Even as I type that last part, I cringe, wanting to distance myself as far away from Humbert's horrible actions as possible.<br /><br />Humbert's actions are execrable; his obsession with little girls--their clothes, their childlike nature--are disgusting. However, in the form of a gifted author, Nabokov has made Humbert's character relatable. Humbert tries to excuse himself for his actions--she was precocious, he really loved her--in a way that everyone can relate to in one way or another. Humbert at times tries hard to rebel against his desires. And the ending shows that he has grown somewhat.<br /><br />Many authors wouldn't have dared to write a protagonist the way Nabokov has. Many authors wouldn't want the trouble of trying to make a hideously flawed protagonist relatable.

Humbert isn't completely horrible; Lolita isn't a perfect princess. And I think that is what impresses me most.<br /><br />The story takes its time getting to the meat, and once it does, it tends to meander around, not much different than the cross-country journey Humbert embarks on.

I knew that many readers raved about how wonderful it is, in spite of its controversial subject matter.  Well, a couple of years ago I started making it a point to read more literature, and books that people considered important ones.  Lolita was on the list, but I didn't want to read it.  But I read A Clockwork Orange, which had a protagonist that is arguably far worse than Nabokov's Humbert Humbert, and in spite of the terrible things Alex did in that story, once I had finished it, I was really glad I had read it.  So maybe I could handle Lolita, I thought.  A year or so later, I finally checked this novel out of the library and gave it my attention.  And it is a good book, maybe even a great one.  But tough to get through.<br /><br />I loved the character of Lolita.  I didn't expect to, since the only lens we ever see her through is the obsessive gaze of Humbert Humbert.  I expected her to be a nonperson, just the object of Humbert's sick fantasy.  But over the course of the story, her character shines through his twisted fantasy of her.  Lolita is a girl who is trapped.  In spite of the narrator's assertion that is was she who seduced him in the beginning, it is painfully obvious that she doesn't want to be used the way he is using her.  (I'm not really someone who cries when reading, but some of the later scenes in the book brought me pretty close.)  I am glad that the author shows the effect of Humbert's actions upon Lolita.  He really messes her up, and in the end he knows it.  But during the course of the story, he has no idea just how much damage he is inflicting on her.  You, the reader, watch her character being undone by this creep who keeps telling you how much she means to him.<br /><br />I had heard that this was supposed to be a funny book, and there is some black humor here, especially in the beginning of the story.  The way the narrator hides his nature from the world and basically has a solipsistic view, where he is the only real person (until he falls in \\""love\\"" with Lolita) reminded me of Jeff Linsay's [[ASIN:0307473708 Darkly Dreaming Dexter (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]].

It makes one question the motives of the main character, Humbert. The story is narrated from the point of Humbert; and his account about his life events, mostly dealing with Lolita. It also plays with the ideal of how much information is he giving that is truthful and not manipulative. He often calls the reader the jury and likes us to believe that he is okay with us judging him. I also found it interesting that Humbert starts his story of Lolita by explaining his childhood and life experiences. It seems to humanize him as an individual; it draws one in and motivates one to believe how Humbert might have behaved the way that he did and how he could have developed such an obsession with the girl, Lolita.    I found this book to remind me of another book entitled \\""The Collector\\"" by John Fowles. It explains how a man who in completely obsessed with a girl he watches and kidnaps for his own enjoyment. The difference between the two is that \\""The Collectors\\"" obsession is mostly personal, and \\""Lolita\\"" obsession deals with sexual experiences. Both deal with obsession, the question of love, and going against our perception of what is normal. The novel of Lolita has these same topics of discussion, and is very stimulating to the reader.

The conflicting emotions that ran through my mind make it impossible to place it any specific genre of novel. Mysteries are supposed to surprise the reader, comedies are supposed to delight the reader, dramas are supposed to move the reader and thrillers are supposed to get their pulse racing. Where does that put Lolita? It manages to move, disgust and make me giggle, sometimes all three in the same chapter. No wonder I was confused about how I felt for most of the book.    The second part of the book was somehow more tolerable than the first. The overarching themes of the story - obsession, desperation, isolation and the resulting fear and paranoia make for compelling reading. Compared to the second part, the first part was a confusing jumble of emotions as frivolity and humor mingle with the disgust I felt at the narrator. In retrospect, I think they two halves of the novel necessarily play off each other. The first half is all about the savage and cruel frivolity of narrator's monstrous nature, while the second is all about it's dark and tragic consequences. Even among the doom and gloom, the penultimate chapter made me smile. Like I said, this book will put you through a crazy jumble of emotions.    On reflection, I have to say it's not the book I thought it was, and I suspect that is true of many people who have only heard of it in fleeting. The title has such cultural connotations that are in no way supported by the text of the book itself. The narrator is a cruel and selfish man who destroys the childhood of girl he is obsessed with, and even he realises it.

However, after looking up the synopsis and hearing about controversy surrounding the subject matter, I decided I would not read it.  Then, I read posts from many readers that I have grown to respect and decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  While the subject matter is distrubing, Nabokov does a brilliant job of taking the reader inside the mind of a pedophile.  My fear, based on things I've \\""heard\\"", that it bordered on pornogrpy was unfounded.  What Nabokov does do is incorporate all of the \\""excuses\\"", deceit, tactics, and \\""justifications\\"" that are still used fifty years after publication for such actions.<br /><br />In the opening chapters, Humbert relates his first romance and how deeply affected he was by her death.  He supposes that this is the genesis of his desire for \\""nymphets\\"".

As I read this book I wondered if some of the outrage over the book came from a suspicion over Nabakov's intimate knowledge of the mind of a pedophile.  He certainly does not shy away from detailed accounts of what a pedophile thinks as he looks at a young girl and seems to know it well.  I think that leap is short-sighted.  Adding to the breadth of Nabokov's style, I have to admit that for such a serious subject there is a great deal of humor through situations, attitudes, and wordplay.

The picture we get of each is reflected in the other: Humbert never ceases his rants about Lolita's every feature, but Lolita also explains Humbert to us in very minute ways, for example, in mocking his personality ticks.  It's impressive in that what is so commonly referred to as an \\""unreliable narrator\\"" ends up painting such a believable picture of this relationship.<br /><br />The book is full of unexpected twists, but ends up feeling somewhat slow due to the deep prose and constant refrains in French, as well as the many literary references.

I liked Stanley Kubrick's production (but then again I liked all his works except for \\""Eyes Wide Shut\\"") -- it was ironic and silly, and I could see why Vladimir Nabokov would want to disown the script.  I had mixed feelings about Adrian Lyne's 1997 version, thinking it a faux literary movie which tried too hard to stay loyal to the sentiments of the author.  After watching Lyne's production, I concluded that Nabokov's novel was essentially about a man who became imprisoned in an adolescent state, forever and tragically marred by his unconsummated first love -- there was something poetic and ultimately poignant about Humbert Humbert's lifelong search for those fleeting summer days of his youth.  Imagine then my horror and mortification then when I actually picked up the novel, and began reading it.      I was dumbstruck when I realized that after a few pages that Kubrick was in fact loyal to the novel, and that Nabokov disowning the script could have just been a cheap publicity stunt.  Humbert Humbert is just a ridiculous narrator, and his descriptions of his lust for nymphets struck me as obscenely stupid rather than as dangerously disgusting -- he read like a man who was pretending to be a woman desperately in love with another woman.  If that's a case, then Adrian Lyne's production is a counter-argument to Kubrick's production, and now I seriously wonder if Adrian Lyne had himself understood the novel.    What ultimately redeems the book is Nabokov's musical ramblings -- there's no doubt that the man is a master stylist.  The plot and the premise are absurd -- the feel of the book is as if John Milton, for whatever reason, felt compelled to do a good job writing articles for \\""Hustler.\\""       The most literary dimension of the book is the duel between Humbert Humbert and Claire Quilty.  Both are gifted literary perverts, and both seek the love of Lolita.  Humbert seeks to put her on a pedestal whereas Quilty wants her rolling in the mud.  Quilty thinks Humbert a perfect fool and has his fun with him -- Humbert sees Quilty as his personal Satan, and makes it his last mission in life to slay the monster.  Given that the two are so similar and how ridiculous and melodramatic the book is you have to think that maybe \\""Lolita\\"" was just a bad dream that Humbert Humbert had while on a train before his next lecture.

Lolita was one that I admittedly avoided for quite some time, primarily because of its subject matter.  Did I really want to read a novel about a middle aged man who has a sexual relationship with a pubescent child?  But still, Lolita, by all accounts, is one of the most revered novels of the past century - and so, I finally relented and read it.<br /><br />And I have to say - the first half of this novel is extraordinary.  Half way through Lolita, I was convinced that it was going to be one of the best novels I'd ever read.  Unfortunately, the novel loses its way in the second half.  I think that a big part of the problem lies in Humbert's obsession.  Unfortunately, anyone who is obsessed with anything will inevitably bore those around them about it.  It's just the nature of obsession.  It's such an all-consuming state of being that it can't help but become tiresome for anyone else to hear about over and over again.  In the first part of the novel, Humbert's obsession is new and while distasteful to the reader, compelling.  By the second half of the novel, Humbert's ramblings about how captivated he is under Lolita's spell gets a little old.<br /><br />Another flaw with the second half of the novel is the relative lack of plot development.  In the first half of the novel we learn about Humbert's past, his early awareness of his sexual preferences, how he came to America, and his developing obsession for Lolita.  The story moves along quickly as Humbert manipulates and then marries Lolita's mother, how she then discovers what he is, and then her sudden death.  The second half of the novel becomes something of a dreary travel log, as Humbert and Lolita spend much of the latter part of the novel travelling across the United States, nearly getting caught in compromising situations and visiting kitschy tourist sites.<br /><br />Not a lot actually happens in this part of the novel although there is a change in the dynamics of the relationship between Humbert and Lolita.  Humbert remains deluded in his obsession for the young girl, convinced that their dysfunctional abusive relationship is actually a great love affair, or at least in time will become one.  After their first cross country trip, Lolita learns to manipulate Humbert and gradually gains the upper hand in their relationship, while remaining trapped in its cycle of abuse.  Humbert's obsession becomes amplified with paranoia and jealousy that gives it a desperation that manages to be both unpleasant and tiresome to read.  And this too drags the second half of the novel down.<br /><br />On a positive note, Lolita is an extraordinary well written novel (with its deliberately pretentious prose).  Humbert is an arrogant and manipulative protagonist.  His efforts to rationalize his destructive behavior are deplorable, and yet (for the first half of the novel at least) he manages to be an engaging narrator.  His sardonic wit is often very funny and the reader can't help but admire the poetry of his prose.<br /><br />Readers concerned about the content of the novel should note that while the subject matter will (and rightfully should) make most readers uncomfortable (or worse), the novel doesn't celebrate pedophilia, nor does it try to normalize it.  Yes, Humbert's actions are deplorable and he ruins the life of a young girl for his own selfish needs, all the while rationalizing his behavior, but there is no shortage of novels that feature similar criminal acts.

While it is stunningly performed, I needed to purchase a print copy because the language is so complex, such a high standard of excellence that it simply goes by too fast in spoken format and, for me, I wanted to dally over the exquisite use of language. While Jeremy Irons is the perfect narrator for this (and I have not seen his version of the film) too much gets lost. So: if you just want to be entertained and listen to a beautiful voice, do get the recorded version. But for me, I needed to buy it in print (and I ended up being about 50 pages behind in print) because I need to be able to coherently discuss the book for book club. This is a book that is poetry, even though it is about a pedophile, the language is so beautifully structured that it merits a print read. It is a 5 star production of a 5 star book, but for the serious reader (or student) this is a book that needs to be cherished in print. Also, the afterward is not included in the Audible format, and the reader for the forward was jarring to listen to. These are mild complaints, so it still gets 5 stars for the material and 5 stars for the performance. Oh, and unless you speak (or understand) French, you will need to either not worry about the French that is liberally spoken or you will need a print copy to translate. Nabokov does insane perhaps better than anyone else. It is a marvel to me that English is not his first language.<br /><br />However you choose to enjoy this book, just do yourself a favor and read it. It is glorious and it's amazing that the author is able to take such a raunchy subject and turn it into poetry.

It doesn't take a genius to perceive that Humbert Humbert is not a valid role model for his readers! He is a degenerate with a hopelessly pathetic obsession with his nymphet. He is never arrogant about it but is certainly capable of the worst deception- for example, kindly supplying Lolita with a whole new summer wardrobe while postponing the truth about her mother's death. Yes, he terrorized her and blackmailed her into submitting to him and keeping things secret by threatening her with bleak and dishonorable \\""orphans' homes\\"". But he never wished to obtain sexual favors by brute force, and instead resorted to bribes like money. I wasn't surprised that Lolita, who grew up fatherless with a rather dispassionate mother, turned out sexually precocious and learned to survive by manipulating others. Our culture has a fascination with the crustier aspects of human behavior, and I don't believe every author is obligated to supply only moral or uplifting themes. It takes all kinds to make a world, they deserve representation in media and literature, and one might get something out of reading vastly different perspectives. Another thing I really enjoyed about this novel was the gorgeous descriptions of nature and of various hotels and eateries. This was a window into a European immigrant's impression of a unique foreign land. I also enjoyed descriptions that bordered on fetishistic: Lolita's beautifully patterned dresses with flared skirts, her accessories and facial expressions and postures. All Nabokov's \\""Lolita\\"" is, is a story of one corrupt man's hopeless obsession with a too-young girl. Humbert's oblivion regarding Lolita's feelings was not lost on me, and yet, I didn't feel moral outrage while experiencing this great novel.

Written as a sort of diary/pseudo confession by sexual deviant Humbert Humbert, the author, Vladimir Nabokov, utilizes the English language in the most elegant and descriptive manner that I have ever encountered.<br /><br />This work, in my opinion, stands in stark contrast to the jarring and filthy prose encountered by readers of Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer.  And while there is certainly room for both approaches, Nabokov's writing shines even brighter when following that of Miller.  Most important to my reading pleasure, however, is the presence of an actual story and plot in Lolita which was missing in Miller's stream of consciousness screed.<br /><br />Any reader of even casual literary interest is well familiar with the plot of Lolita, a name which has entered the 20th century lexicon as a buzzword for budding, pre-pubescent willowy females of entrancing sexual allure.  Some may have seen the old movie (starring James Mason and Shelley Winters), that while entertaining, fails to capture the viewer as does Nabokov's peerless prose.  That Nabokov can so skillfully address such an emotionally and politically charged issue in such a seemingly effortless manner speaks to his skills.  That he does so in, essentially, his third language is stunning.<br /><br />Broken into two parts, the first details his introduction to and pursuit of young Dolores Haze (Lolita).

All of these questions - and many more which I would have to return to the novel to remember (and I have no intention of doing that) - spoiled my 'enjoyment' of the work and interjected a draft of cold wet reality into the fun so that I lost interest.     Nabokov's stylistic brilliance was used only to serve up HH's non-stop sardonic and caustic observations on American middle class life, and they became ennervating over the long long haul.  And pleading Nabokov's psychological insights doesnt help much.  Is this a comedy, tragedy, psychological portrait?  It fails on all those counts because it is tiresome, shallow and obtuse.  But I guess I DID learn a lot about motels in middle america in the 50s.

What is most definitely is not is pornographic: it doesn't contain a word of even mildly bad language, nor is it a trashy series of sex scenes featuring a girl of that name. In fact - surprise, surprise if you've never read it - Lolita doesn't even contain a girl called Lolita.<br /><br />Writing in the first person, Nabakov does not directly tell the story of his famous heroine, but that of Humbert Humbert, a man obsessed with the memory of his dead childhood girlfriend, Annabel, to such an extent that his life is dominated by her loss. As his teens pass, and then his twenties, he fails to mature beyond his loss. When he meets a girl of twelve, Dolores Haze, who resembles his lost love, he attempts to posses her, body and soul, and in his obsessed mind he re-names her \\""Lolita.\\"" The final result is that both he and Dolores are destroyed, along with several other characters.<br /><br />Is it a sad story of an unfortunately obsessed man, who should perhaps be pitied as much as condemned? No, for there is more to it than that. Is it a simple story? No, for Nabakov is not a simple writer, telling a plain story of black versus white. If he were, then Dolores would be a naïve and innocent girl, and Humbert an absolute villain.<br /><br />But Nabokov is not a limited moraliser, wagging a solemn preacher's finger at a wrong-doer seeking his evil way in a world of innocence. Instead he examines the complexities of both love and lust, for Humbert finds that his hidden, furtive desire has met its mate, as he discovers that Dolores has an open, natural tendency to depravity to match his. Moreover, most of the characters that the two are in contact with are flawed, and some are so self-deceiving and tacky that the reader may be drawn into preferring Humbert's admitted lechery, and the reader, not allowed to deal easily with absolutes in a simple situation of right and wrong, is made to journey in an intriguing world of comparisons.<br /><br />Whereas Dolores's nature is a mixture of easily given love and defensive cynicism - she rapidly falls in love with the handsome, exotic Frenchman - Humbert is cowardly, conceited and stupid, with a talent for bungling everything he attempts, from emotional relationships to violent crime, a failing that he does not notice.<br /><br />Failing also to see that Dolores is attempting to seduce him, he seeks to trick here into a physical intimacy that she would have awarded him willingly. As his stupidity becomes more apparent, so does his indifference to the well being of others, as he accepts marries a woman he detests to gain control of Dolores, and later contemplates murdering her.<br />But all his desperate, bungling manoeuvres fail, until to his surprise - Dolores casually offers herself to him, after revealing that she has already had a lover.<br /><br />Technically this is the climax of the novel, and here Nabokov ends the first of the two books into which it is divided. Some critics say that the latter half is too long, and I agree with them, remarking however that it may merely seem to long, due to being the record of a highly unpleasant relationship.<br /><br />When the death of her mother gives Humbert total control of Dolores, he has achieved his great ambition, but proves utterly incapable of living with his success. Dolores, sullen at the wandering life that they adopt, but entirely dependent on Humbert, strives not to regain her freedom, but for the two to lead some kind of stable life. But Humbert, living in a world of his own, composed of ecstasy and fear - he has gained Dolores, but is terrified of discovery -  fails to listen to her, or realise that the actuality that he has gained is living Dolores, not imaginary Lolita.<br /><br />Trapped in his conceited self-image - he is a pedantic scholar, who has produced no work of his own, but imagines himself a sophisticated artist -  he fails to communicate with Dolores, or lower himself from his pretensions to her simpler, healthier attitude to life - \\""speak English!\\"" as she says at one point - and he destroys what remains of her love for him.<br /><br />As Dolores grows older she is able to gain more control over her affairs, and she tortures him as he has tortured her, and eventually escapes him.

His choice of wordage is so utterly perfect that i found myself constantly thinking that i had never before heard the English language used in this way. He uses phrases so witty that i would continuously pause my reading to dissect and appreciate the craftsmanship.

Humbert Humbert is potentially the greatest literary creation of the 20th Century. He is the snake in the garden of good and evil; a vain and enigmatic character with whom you will sympathise, through no choice of your own.

It is a love story with the power to raise both chuckles and eyebrows. Humbert Humbert is a European intellectual adrift in America, haunted by memories of a lost adolescent love. When he meets his ideal nymphet in the shape of 12-year-old Dolores Haze, he constructs an elaborate plot to seduce her, but first he must get rid of her mother. In spite of his diabolical wit, reality proves to be more slippery than Humbert's feverish fantasies, and Lolita refuses to conform to his image of the perfect lover.  Playfully perverse in form as well as content, riddled with puns and literary allusions, Nabokov's 1955 novel is a hymn to the Russian-born author's delight in his adopted language. Indeed, readers who want to probe all of its allusive nooks and crannies will need to consult the annotated edition. Lolita is undoubtedly, brazenly erotic, but the eroticism springs less from the \\""frail honey-hued shoulders ... the silky supple bare back\\"" of little Lo than it does from the wantonly gorgeous prose that Humbert uses to recount his forbidden passion:     She was musical and apple-sweet ... Lola the bobby-soxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its juice ... and every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beauty--between my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock.   Much has been made of Lolita as metaphor, perhaps because the love affair at its heart is so troubling. Humbert represents the formal, educated Old World of Europe, while Lolita is America: ripening, beautiful, but not too bright and a little vulgar. Nabokov delights in exploring the intercourse between these cultures, and the passages where Humbert describes the suburbs and strip malls and motels of postwar America are filled with both attraction andrepulsion, \\""those restaurants where the holy spirit of Huncan Dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottage-cheese-crested salads.\\"" Yet however tempting the novel's symbolism may be, its chief delight--and power--lies in the character of Humbert Humbert. He, at least as he tells it, is no seedy skulker, no twisted destroyer of innocence. Instead, Nabokov's celebrated mouthpiece is erudite and witty, even at his most depraved.

As people have said throughout the decades, it is the witty quality of writing that makes the book so great and the expression of the incredible obsession of love and lust that consumed our protagonist. In the first half I would say that the story line was not really even that interesting compared to the more typical fantasy stories. It was really just so much of ordinary life, albeit not typical. By the end, I realized that was one of the things that is so incredible about the story. It's so real. By the end of the book, I have been convinced that to really have given it a chance, one must read it to the very last word (or listen to Jeremy narrate it in this case). This was some real 'quality' writing. It does beg the question, how does one come up with this stuff? This book will leave you thinking, for sure.",2007-06-12

Words -- but there is nothing that Nabokov cannot do with them.<br /><br />When I first read this book 50 years ago, buying a banned copy in Paris, it was frankly for titillation; its pornography was oblique, to be sure, but to an adolescent with no experience whatever, it seemed to open a whole world. And the fact that Lolita was so very young was scarcely shocking to a reader not that much older. Now 50 years on, I have a daughter of my own, and Humbert Humbert's nympholepsy appears as the horror that it is. But LOLITA is more titillating than ever -- only verbally, not sexually. Solely by the use of words, Nabokov keeps you reading, through the horror, through the dread, drawing you in, stirring your sympathies, moving irresitably towards a conclusion that is clear from the beginning, even though reached by an upredictable path. Despite everything Nabokov does to reveal his hand (even writing a preface explaining what will happen to the characters after the story ends), this is more suspenseful than any suspense story. Despite having a psychopath for a hero, it says much about normal human psychology. It is a perfect time-capsule of postwar America, satirical but gently so. It is a virtuoso feat of linguistic juggling, a witty paean to the English language. It is nothing short of a masterpiece.",2007-05-17

Stylistically, it is a very complex read. It took me quite some time to get into the rhythm of the almost-surreal style the Nabokov uses. The only thing I've read that took me more time to decipher was Toni Morrison's Beloved. There are entire paragraphs and pages in which the narrator digresses into monologues of disillusionment that are dedicated to describing his abstract thought process in lofty, flowery detail. Do not get me wrong: this is in no way unpleasant. The style is specifically and painstakingly written in a way to meant exhibit the truly complex depravity of Humbert Humbert's mind. His earnestness forces even the most unwilling reader to feel empathy toward a character that could easily be written off as plain montrous and repulsive.    The plot is a bit cumbersome, chronicling events that are on the forefront rather dreary and commonplace (extenstive travelling, living arrangements, etc).

Again, I was struck by the perfect casting of Jeremy Irons as Humbert, not only in Lyne's movie, but also as Humbert as narrator. He truly embodies the character and makes you feel like Nabokov's brilliant prose is a living thing -- a breathing, bleeding passionate thing -- rather than something static on the page. I doubt that anyone could do better. It's an audio book masterpiece, which must be something of a rarity. It doesn't hurt, of course, that they were working with one of the essential novels of the 20th century. Suffice to say, that Irons -- who was sadly overlooked by the Academy due to the film's distribution difficulties -- gives an award-worthy performance.    Oh, and I find some of the prudish customer comments about the book both hilarious and baffling. Were they reading the same book that I read? Did they actually finish reading it? What were their expectations when they picked it up? That an incarcerated Humbert would avoid temptation and renounce wickedness in plain Christian prose. I'm guessing some people read Lolita fully expecting to find it morally reprehensible, but when they get a taste of Nabokov's poetic passion for such transgressive subject matter it pushed their buttons, maybe aroused their own latent desires for forbidden fruit, and made them want to cleanse their palette by writing a 1-star review.",2006-07-14

The story in many respects isn't an easy read.  The extensive vocabulary and obscure references insure that there was much I probably missed.  But it did not take away from the awe of Vladimir Nabokov's incredible mastery of the English language along with sprinklings of French and German as far as I could decipher. <br /> <br />Story-wise, the cold and calculated way Humbert Humbert goes about seducing 12-year-old Dolores is difficult to endure especially as the reader is privy to every manner of plan and execution.  Of course as this is almost entirely from Humbert's perspective, the reader is only able to glean Lolita, his private name for her, and other characters from that perspective notwithstanding his own scrupulous attempt at objectivity.  From this perspective we discover a Lolita in many ways a typical 12- year-old of the times yet with a beguiling precociousness.  She's brash and bratty and not shy about her sexuality, burgeoning though it may be.  There is Dolores' mother Charlotte, needy and in a hateful rivalry with her daughter for Humbert's affections.  Humbert himself is erudite, superior and routinely disdainful of all who pass his way.   Yet under the spell of his own longing and desire for Lolita, becomes the very entity he scorns. <br />  <br />What stands out and continues to draw me to this work is the depths of emotion Humbert subjects himself to albeit much of it through his obsession for Lolita.  It made me question the idea of love and what it is supposed to mean.  It's clear that Humbert's feelings for Lolita are profound but one could not but question whether this love is centered more on an ideal Lolita rather than the real life Dolores.  His ongoing obsession with \\""nymphs\\"" and \\""girl children\\"" finally finds release in the ideal form, in many ways, of Dolores Haze.  Ideal because she was a willing participant at least initially and fit the criteria of being a young girl, an ideal nymphet in that regard.   Yet this nymphet turns out to also be impudent, petulant with banal tastes, not exactly a fantasy combination for the highbrow Humbert.  Yet his declarations of love and devotion is always steadfast and much to his surprise goes on to extend past her \\""nymphage\\"" years.  At the end, I was left with the unsettling thought that perverted and unseemly though it may be perhaps it could be qualified as love.  Not the not-so-common pure and selfless kind but the sullied and soiled kind where self-interest, manipulation and in Humbert's case ultimately murder is par for the course. <br /> <br />What is even more fascinating about this book is the twist taken by Nabalov with the character of Lolita.  By taking the child abuse scenario in a different direction and not making her the frightened, quivering Little Red Riding Hood to Humbert's Big Bad Wolf.   Nabokov still does a remarkable job of keeping her as a believable young girl, not totally innocent but clearly not grown-up either.   He is skillful at interweaving her precociousness with an obvious emotional immaturity. At age 12 in the early 1950s, she is knowledgeable and experienced in the ways of sex but in a childishly oblivious way.  She is aware of the concept of incest, breezily admits to having sex at camp with her and another girl taking turns with a teen-aged boy and is the one to initiate the first sexual contact with Humbert whom she assumes is clueless about this activity which she summarizes as being \\""rather fun\\"" and \\""good for the complexion.\\""     She then has no compunction about needling him, calling him a \\""dirty old man\\"" and slyly telling him that she's going to call the cops. During their travels, she has a lot of say in where they will eat, what they will do, where they will stay.   Granted this more than likely stems from Humbert's desire to appease Lolita in Humbert's words \\""from kiss tokiss.\\""  But through out it can be sometimes difficult to discern where the balance of power really does fall.  It is interesting though the fact that despite Dolores' growing ambivalence if not outright distaste for Humbert and his foppish ways she continues the sexual relationship without much fuss considering she has no problem heartily refusing other demands made by Humbert such as reading more books, despite his pleas and threats.  Perhaps sex does not have significance for Dolores one way or the other.  Perhaps she knows it's a powerful leverage with Humbert although it wasn't until later on that she appears to actually start using it as such and even then still in a limited manner.  The fact that everything is pretty much related from Humbert's perspective had me at times, longing for a bit more insight into Dolores' own inner thoughts. <br /> <br /> <br />There really is a lot to this book and it would take another entire book to analyze it all.  The subject of the story may be taboo but it is done in what I think is a very tasteful and non-offensive manner.  It delves into so much more than a pedophile's lust for a young girl that it's hard to even know where to start.  But it definitely got me thinking not just about the complexity of the human experience but the skill that it takes as a writer to express it in such an eloquent and exceptional way.  As I got this as an audio-cassette, hearing Jeremy Iron and his way of bringing to life Nabokov's words allowed me a means of appreciating it all the more so. His ability to infuse the book with the sarcasm, humour, despair and vulnerability so prevalent in the book makes the writing that much more memorable. <br />",2006-07-08

It evokes sexual jokes as well as literary criticism. However, for those who truly understand literature and the masterful works of Vladimir Nabokov, this name cannot be replaced with any single word, but rather emits a conglomeration of ideas regarding the inner psychological workings of man and the resulting acts of violence. Nabokov's startling manipulation of language takes the reader through the harrowing physical and emotional journey of a man fervently obsessed with his stepdaughter, only to leave the reader as confused and questioning at the end as he was at the beginning of the journey. This controversial novel about Humbert Humbert's desire for young girls is not only an aesthetic contribution to all forms of literature around the world due to the sophistication of the prose, but also has the unique ability to force readers to empathize with the most questionable of characters. <br /> <br /> <br />The sophistication of Lolita lies in the fact that Nabokov does not apply a consistent style throughout the novel. Instead, he elects to use different language techniques all under the narration of the middle-aged and sexually frustrated Humbert. The erratic style is coupled with the unexpected interference of fate. For example, it is fateful that the house of the family he is originally meant to stay with when he first came to Ramsdale burned down, leaving him to board with the flirtatious Mrs. Haze and her \\""nymphet\\"" daughter Dolores Haze, whom Humbert fondly refers to as Lolita. Nabokov also divides the novel into two parts, thereby providing a sanction between the passionate love that Humbert develops for Lolita and the paranoia and frustrations that she forces him to undergo. At the start of the journey they embark on across the continental United States, Humbert provides meticulous descriptions of the sights they have observed. However, the descriptions become less floweryas the two visit more and more places and they are soon reduced to incomplete sentences and terse phrases. The stream-of-consciousness style that Nabokov employs indicates that Humbert does not find the extensive road trip or the places they visit important and thus blurs them all together, but rather the fact that he is alone with Lolita. These various style techniques contribute to the overall understanding of the complex relationship between Humbert and Lolita and compel the reader to give avid attention to every detail in order to see the big picture.  <br /> <br /> <br />Despite knowing fully well that Humbert Humbert is a man with a tendency for violence and pedophilia, Nabokov's poignant writing allows the reader to empathize with a man who is writing a confession from jail, where he is held for murder. The descriptions of Humbert's fascination with Lolita's body is not met with abhorrence, but rather appreciated for its artful depiction of childhood innocence. The novel also leaves out any crude sexual imagery, and instead focuses on the powerful emotion of desire. Humbert's love for Lolita is so strong that he willingly gives in to her demand for money and payment for any sexual favors. Unknowingly, he has become her slave despite his belief that she is under his control. The reader feels the strongest pity when Humbert goes on his crazed search for the mysterious Clare Quilty, a movie producer whose love for Lolita provokes the insane jealousy of Humbert. Throughout the novel, he is not portrayed as a typical maniacal pedophile, but rather a lover of beauty and perfection. It is out of this need to capture aesthetics like the youth of a beautiful girl that sympathizing with Humbert's plight becomes a natural thing to do.  <br />  <br /> <br />The factor that makes Nabokov's Lolita one of the greatest novels of the 20th century is not only its profound meditation on obsessive love, but also its fantastic language. From the startling clues he leaves about fate to the Freudian stream-of-consciousness narration, it is obvious that Nabokov's goal is to leave the reader guessing from beginning to end. However, the reader must remember not to overanalyze the details of the places the two visit or the diary Humbert kept when he first moved in with the Hazes, because these could all be whimsical additives meant to distract the reader from unlocking the true secrets of the novel.

Much has been said about underlying political metaphor in having  Humbert as the european intellectual drifter \\""romancing\\"" Lolita, his foster American child, and about the morality of the whole saga. With or without refering to these metaphors, the writing retains its charm for the engrossing word play.<br /><br />There are no graphic details of sexual acts, and this is no easy read for those who consider pornography as literary composition. This is not a two cent sex thriller as sometimes the colloquial references make it seem. This is not about escapades of an old man travelling around the United States with a young nymphet. This is not even like Lady Chatterley's Lover, which sizzles with the passion of its protagonists. Lolita is about that love, that fire which consumes everyone that comes in contact with it. This is a feverish tale of a seemingly perverted Humbert sinking deeper and deeper into his fascination with nymphets.<br /><br />The novel is rich in wit and satire, many descriptions of nature or Humbert's thoughts and feelings are sheer poetry, and the narration is both fascinating and intriguing. Intriguing in capturing an array of ideas and acts that are not only difficult to put on paper, but as history testifies, immediately make the author target of ridicule and condemnation. Like most others, I started reading the book with some prejudices and some precepts. Little did I know that my flight in a plane would show me the outer space: such is the power of the book.<br /><br />Yes, the book lives at the very edge. Nabokov romances with the baseline. Small errors could have meant the ball landed out of the court, and the game wouldn't be as exciting as it is now. There is a suspense that thrives on our knowledge of HH's ideas and motives, and our knowledge that none of the other characters share the information the reader has. There is a sadness that is undercurrent of most love stories. There is a sense of disgust, for the whole idea of a twelve year old being ploughed by an old man is sickening to people of our generation and our education. Like Nabokov points out, till fifty years ago, a girl would start procreating as soon as she hit the teenage. There is an awe imposed on the reader by the way this taut story proceeds, the choice of sentences, dialogue, words reflects why Nabokov's Lolita occupies such a prominent place in the world literature.<br /><br />Pray do read it. Read it piecemeal. It is a difficult but fascinating read. Recommended highly for everyone. It does not matter how you perceive Humbert or Lolita or anyone in the novel; you could run into similar characters on the street. Make allowances for HH's obsession, Lolita's nature, and then you will see Lolita is like a lotus blooming in the mud of passion and perversity. To pick this flower, you need to wade though the mud, and I believe it will be worth the effort. Reading this novel, like the story it tells, is full of torment. It will test and tease your own thoughts about morality, sexuality, sensuality and love.

Fifty years after its initial publication the name alone carries a variety of connotations. Nabokov hooks you early with all the dark but titillating subject matter and all the clever wordplay. And his allusions to Joyce, Proust, Flaubert and just about everything under the sun, should keep lit profs and lit critics busy for centuries. But I am but a humble reader, and for me the story flags near the end, just as I most want to know what's going to happen.     Nevertheless, I can honestly say I've read very few books as beautifully or cleverly written in the English language. With the exception of Shakespeare, whose English is of another era, only Dickens has a greater command of the language and compares favorably. But it's not always clear what Nabokov is saying, let alone what he is alluding to. You really need a strong background in world literature to get the full appreciation. The references come often, and they often come in French. Of Proust I've only read Swann's Way, and I've only read a couple of Joyce's short stories. It certainly would have helped me to have been better grounded in world classics. It was fortunate that I had recently read Madame Bovary, as he makes references to it as well. He also alludes to his own works.       But please don't be put off. You don't have to speak French, and you don't have to be a lit prof to enjoy the story.  The annotated version won't enlighten you as much as you hope.   Still, above all, read it especially for the language. I don't usually recommend books for their writing alone. This is a rare exception. Sure, the insights into a criminal mind and the look at America from a European's perspective are interesting, but the language, oh my god, the language. It's mindboggling! Considering that English was a second or third language for him, I can only imagine what Nabokov's writing must have been like in his native Russian. Twain, Hemingway, Faulkner, Poe, James, Steinbeck, Updike, Oates -- when it comes tobeautiful writing, none of them can hold a candle to Nabokov. He puts them all to shame.

Nabakov's \\""Lolita\\"" presents the confession of one Humbert Humbert, a self-delusional French scholar, who pens this manuscript from his prison cell.  With literary flair and grandeur, Humbert painstakingly details his ineffable lust for \\""nymphets\\"", originating with an unconsummated childhood romance with Annabel and culminating in his two-year love affair with Dolores Haze (a.k.a. Lolita).  For it is with Lolita that his undying love and eternal flame of passion burns red-hot.   <br /> <br />With elegant prose, the reader delves into the mind of a classic pedophile whose only attraction lies with nymphets - prepubescent girls whose time is fleeting, for they will soon become a woman, the \\""coffin of coarse female flesh within which my nymphets are buried alive.\\""  Although Humbert's actions are deplorable, one can't help but feel a twinge of sympathy for him.  Indeed, if Lolita had been ten years older, this would have been a classic love story, for he instantly falls for her \\""pure young forbidden fairy child beauty\\"" at first sight. <br /> <br />Throughout the novel fate plays a vital role.  Indeed, fate is given an almost human quality, as \\""McFate\\"" is personified as an elusive, yet edifying force that drives Humbert and Lolita down their inevitable courses.  It is blind fate that has made possible their initial meeting.  It is fate that has led to the deaths of the women in his life.  If it weren't for these \\""acts of God\\"", which seem so improbable yet so sudden and real, Humbert would still be lusting over prepubescent girls in a playground and never able to acheive hiswanton desires.  If life is fleeting, then fate will lead us and control our destiny in our short lives. <br /> <br />Obviously, this novel has a dark undertone which may trouble some readers.

Humbert becomes oblivious to Lolita's unhappiness, as she cries herself to sleep every night and she soon tires of doing \\""dirty things.\\""  And since she has no place to go, for she is a de facto orphan, she basically prostitutes herself for gifts and money from Humbert, although he still deludes himself into thinking he is showing her a good time.  Indeed, Humbert still sees his Lolita as a pure, innocent nymphet who loves him deeply and is passionately jealous of any boys or men who may attempt to steal her away from him.  It is this jealousy that leads to his eventual downfall. <br /> <br />Lolita is a true masterpiece.

It is not a soft-focus sort of viewpoint, nor a highly-charged shocker.

Why do you think Nabokov made Lolita so young? Because as a metaphor, she represented the allure of a comparably immature America to Europe at that time. America was in the throes of teen-aged rebellion, remember? And adults were also wallowing in the excess of the times. Humbert was both disgusted and seduced by what America offered him. Read Lolita (and all lit) with the context of history in mind, and you should be able to appreciate it more fully.   <br /> <br />Nabokov's poetic command of the English language should be experienced by all; Lolita is probably his best and surpasses most contemporary fiction.  <br /> <br /> <br />",2006-01-31

Obviously Vladimir Nabokov is an excellent writer and the story just races along. He has an active imagination and the book is entertaining. It is more a story about the main character, the aging Humbert, than it is about Lolita, the object of his lust. The book is not erotic per se. I read the book once then skimmed it a second time and read the author's comments by Nabokov at the end. He said that many expected an erotic book and were disappointed with the read and stop part way through. But he acknowledges that the subject is taboo, but he still had a passion to write the book. He thinks that this subject, along with happy atheists, and mixed marriages were also taboo at that time. He wrote a short 30 page European version first in Russian, and later wrote this book while living in Ithica, NY around 1949.<br /><br />Lolita is the object of his passion apparently still lingering from his youth.

The language is so rich that it somehow spills over the sentences - there's more to them than you can easily ingest. The writing makes the whole thing a pleasure to read, and in a lot of ways puts Nabakov in control from the start - there isn't a lot of room to imagine motives since Nabakov explains so much. I should point out that were a lesser writer spend any time at all writing in a language I can't read, I may have been tempted to put the whole thing down, but that here, despite entire passages in French, it never crossed my mind to do anything but read on. <br /> <br />There is a recurring temptation to read this as a love story. Humbert Humbert is lovingly obsessed with Lolita. Since he's the narrator of the story, his passion is the lens through which everything is viewed. But Nabakov allows just enough of the unfiltered (fictional) reality through to make it pretty clear that this is a story about a frightened, terribly abused little hostage and her tormentor. The constant flips between seeing Humbert as unfortunately in love with the wrong person, and him as a monster sucking every bit of life out of his prisoner is what is so frightening. It begs the question - how much of reality could we all reconfigure to fit our obsession, or even our love? <br /> <br />The characters, at least Lolita and Humbert are brilliant and true. Lolita is deeply sympathetic, and at points, so is Humbert. The place of the book is everywhere in motion, and little pinpoints across the country are written about with confidence and clarity.

What first appeared to be love is rather a sickening obsession based purely on his own impulses and self satisfaction.

There are clever and witty passages that lighten the mood of the book, but the overall tone is as somber of that of a Dostoyevsky novel.   Russian-born Nabokov's mastery of written English is colorful and intricate though he does make occasional errors in his attempts at American colloquialisms.   If your eyes glaze over at the sight of sentences like \\""When I try to analyze my own cravings, motives, actions, and so forth,  I surrender to a sort of retrospective imagination which feeds the analytic faculty with boundless alternatives and which causes each visualized route to fork and re-fork without end in the maddeningly complex prospect of my past,\\"" don't bother with the book.  And be forewarned that the novel is peppered  with French words, phrases, and lengthy sentences, none of which is translated.  The story is written in the form of a first-person narrative as told by Humbert Humbert, a middle aged man who has a history of psychiatric hospitalizations and who is sexually involved with Lolita.  She is twelve at the start of their affair and fourteen at its conclusion.  Humbert's feelings of arousal and shame are powerfully described, as are some of his exploits with the child.  He is a believable if bizarre character who is likely to be regarded with a sort of fascinated revulsion by the reader. Unfortunately, there is not one likeable or admirable character in the novel.  Nabokov shows every one of them as either monstrous or ridiculous, with the single exception of Lolita herself, and she isn't believable.  It may be that Nabokov simply can't describe children realistically.  At one point, he quotes a long letter that Lolita has received from a teenage girlfriend, and it reads as though it were written by a bright but stuffy forty-year-old woman.  His portrayal of Lolita, it seems to me, is the fatal weakness of the book.Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote of \\""that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment that constitutes poetic faith.\\""  When that suspension of disbelief collapses, the reader's involvement in the story fails as well.  For me, the critical moment came with Lolita's declaration to Humbert that he was not her first lover.  Of course there are sexually active twelve-year-old girls out there in the real world, but I do not believe for one moment that they talk or behave as Lolita does.  She is far  more receptive to Humbert's sexual overtures than would be likely of any prepubescent girl, and her initial reactions to sex with him are too casual and superficial to be believed.  This failure of literary characterization amounts to a moral failure, as well.  Throughout most of his book, Nabokov seems to be strangely  blind to the terrible damage that sexual abuse causes in children, though he must be given credit for Humbert's anguished confession of \\""terrible evil\\"" toward the end of the novel.  Victims of childhood sexual abuse and readers who have seen children scarred for life by sexual victimization are likely to be justifiably angered and disgusted by \\""Lolita.\\""  I am glad that this classic 1955 novel is still available, but I doubt that it could be published today and I think that is probably a good thing.",2005-10-17

Nabokov crafts his narrator to be charming, witty, and extremely punny. The reader would have to actively attempt to dislike Humbert in order to not fall under his spell.

The reviewers that keep writing that kind of commentary - have they actually read the novel or only heard somebody else's distorted summary of it?<br />1: the book is presented as a first person narrative. And that's what makes it disturbing, and also a great work of art. Had the novel been presented through a third person perspective, it would be too obviously pointing out how sordid and horrible and criminal everything is, but it would be the same as reading the crime section of the New York Post. Nabokov is not a journalist. He takes you by the hand inside the mind of a criminal. That's why he takes the pain of making he sometimes witty, sometimes dumb, sometimes darkly funny: to keep you reading. There is no risk of a book \\""influencing\\"" a real life criminal: he is already one. Literature opens a door between you and a possible [or fictional] world, but reading Moby-Dick does not really make you a whale hunter, does it?<br />2. In any case, nobody asks you (like some other reviewers try too hard to believe) to \\""sympathize\\"" with the narrator. Oddly enough, the title of the book is \\""Lolita\\"". Humbert is the criminal's pen-name and, quote: \\""for some reason I think my choice expresses the nastiness best\\"". He's not trying to lure readers into following his steps. He's the bad guy, and he knows it.<br />3. The rule of thumb for those who like \\""moral\\"" tales is that the bad guy be caught in the end. Humbert is not only caught. He dies in prison (as is stated in page 1).<br />4. When he sees Lolita again in the end, and although she has long ceased to be the nymphet of Humbert's dreams (and he does say a couple of times that Lolita is beginning to \\""age\\""), he realizes that he is really in love with her. Some people don't take into consideration the fact that years have passed since they last saw each other. Lolita is no longer an object of desire, but of \\""true\\"" love (as Nabokov says in \\""Strong Opinios\\""). This does not redeem Humbert of his past crimes, nor we start liking him because of it, but it is the point of the novel's theme, like they say, that man destroys the thing he loves. He has nothing left to live for. There it is: the bad guy ends bad.<br />5. At least you have to give Humbert credit for taking revenge upon the other pedophile in the book, whom otherwise would have escaped unpunished. Quilty functions as Humbert's \\""successful\\"" double along the story (he is a known writer, Humbert only a critic and a teacher - Lolita does fall in love with Quilty at some point, but never with Humbert). Quilty's punishment is only the prelude for Humbert's.<br />6. *CAUTION: SPOILER AHEAD*<br />Finally (and some people seem not to get this): Lolita dies giving birth to her baby (a still-born girl), which is not Humbert's. This is actually mentioned in the second page of the book, only she appears under her husband's name. She can't live outside the limits of that nymphet-world in which Humbert wished to have kept her forever. And her death -again another masterful touch- is not related to the various sufferings she has endured. It's something that would have happen anyway had she led a \\""normal\\"" life. It's as close as a 20th century writer can get to the idea of destiny without abandoning realism, verosimilitude, or whatever name you want to give it.<br />*END OF SPOILER*<br /><br />But the true morality resides in the care and respect that Nabokov shows for his material. Lolita has been constructed with painstaking artistry and devotion - it was not written in a day, nor in a week, nor in a month, nothing even near that, and it wasn't conceived as a way of making quick money, not knowing if he would ever find a publisher for it (all the things that you can say about porn fiction).<br />Blaming a work of fiction for any crime perpetrated in the real world is wishful thinking.

A story about a smooth-talking rapist and the victim he holds hostage","I give a star for that mostly intelligent and somewhat humorous writing, because with this story line the author could've made the writing really ridiculous and/or over the top and sickeningly sweet.  Nonetheless, the story borderlines on sickeningly sweet, which makes this book all the more revolting. There is absolutely nothing beautiful, nothing loving, nothing caring and nothing sweet about a man who's main attraction to this child is only her age. If it wasn't for her age, he could care less about her, he wouldn't have at the slightest an interest in her or trying to kill her mother to get close to her. Imagine that: a man so sick-minded that he wants to kill the child's own mother so he can get close to her before she turns into an adult, so he can rape her all the time while she is still of a certain age to fill his criminal urges. It's hard to have respect for this book or the author of it when all this book is trying to do is convince you that Humbert is genuine and this is true love and somehow this relationship should be seen as acceptable. That's why we have laws on child rape: because there is no excuse good enough to justify it being good, and even if there was such an excuse, it doesn't make the act itself good for the child. Any portrayal of child rape is inexcusable, just like any act of child rape gets is inexcusable in real life. Why else would so much time be spent on showing us how Humbert, the man with the weirdest name i've ever heard by the way, loves Lolita, if not to try to win people over so they'll throw their morals and respect for the law out the window? If people can feel sympathetic for a child rapist and murderer in a book, who is to say they couldn't for one in real life? When you put the book down, it's not like you are returning from another planet where such crazy acts of \\""love\\"" don't occur and you can rest easily after reading such a tale. Keep in mind that you are reading a celebrated book on a rapist where on any given day, real rapes are occuring right next door to you among the family with young children next door. I really hope that all who finish reading this will follow-up on some books about how child abuse and sexual assault of women have perpetually been the most underreported crimes in the world. It will really help put LOLITA in perspective. The only reason so many people approve of this book is because it goes to such great lengths to make artistically written excuses that can appear impressive and clever on how this behavior should be acceptable. After all, what languages do psychopaths know besides the manipulative kind?    The book and movie Lolita has done a very unfortunate thing, it has done more for the personal justification and satisfaction of pedophiles that it has done for anything else. It has glamorized the obsessive mentality of the average pedophile, making their obsession appear normal and realistic, and has gone to extraordinary lengths to glamorize the isolated fantasy life the  pedophile must live in order to avoid being caught penalized, making Humbert appear attractive because he lavishes Lolita with fantastical gifts in order to keep her part of that isolated detached lifestyle. Furthermore, the story has made the destruction of a wholesome and healthy parental and community unit look like a positive thing, like it's benefting the child to live with a crazed wealthy sex offender. Humbert feels he is more sophisticated and smart than any other adult caretaker in Lolita's life, and he tries to convince her that she should believe in him. She should listen to him over a doctor, a teacher, and so on.  If some of you can read about a person like this, does that mean you would tolerate a person like this in your real life?   If some of these reviewers here are parents, or have children in their life, I would be absolutely astonished if you approved of this book.  If you are a parent, I dare you to admit it if you approve of this book.     Regardless if the bookitself a fiction, it was produced by a real person who had real thoughts on this matter, and people are deluded enough to believe that a book so popular as this one indicates that society must have acccepted this type of relationship between a mere neglected child and a self-centered jerk of an adult who only cares about his own interests.      This relationship, regardles of what form it is depicted in, fiction or nonfiction, is totally unacceptable and always will be. Just because it's a fictional account should not mean that people need to change their attitudes towards this and be accepting because it's \\""art.\\"" Art is part of real life too, and should be treated the same way you'd treat any real life event.    To the people who believe we should believe that Humbert admitted he is wrong and is not a pedophile because he can profess  love to Lolita as an adult --why do you expect readers to believe him? Lolita doesn't even believe him when he comes to her! She thinks he is pathetic, which he is. There is no way we could believe him because he is such a disrespectful man and showed no respect for any woman in this book, only the desire to control them. He was merely feeling lonely, and that loneliness was being portrayed as love. He was feeling unlovable and wanted to be loved by her because no one else was going to love him, since anytime he wants to be loved by someone he has to force them into it. He killed fellow pedo-psycho Quilty out of rage, not guilt. He does not believe Quilty's interest in raping children is wrong. He believed his interest in Lolita was wrong, and was jealous.     There is not one single positive trait about Humbert, contrary to readers thinking this one of killing Quilty was. So he killed Quilty, and now Quilty can rape no more. That doesn't mean Humbert won't continue raping. And more importantly, it should remind readers that if it wasn't for him killing Quilty, Humbert would of never been caught for anything at all. No one would've known he had raped Lo countless times. He would've walked free. That is to me the most upsetting instance in this novel: the fact that Humbert has been walking free his whole entire life and never once getting caught for his crimes against children, and never being held accountable for them even after he gets caught due to Quilty.  I just can't get over some of you think Humbert being caught somehow puts a positive twist on this story, when he didn't even get caught for the right crime! The murder of Quilty, a grown man and a serial rapist himself who had every chance to defend himself from attacks,  pales in comparison to the numerous accounts  of rape to a mere defenseless child. Who in their right might would disagree with me there?  Remember, he said his first love was the one who died, and he was really just looking for a replacement of her --Lolita being that. And now he could be off to find a replacement for Lolita. So his pattern merely continues. Once the girl leaves him or dies, he finds a new child to replace her, convincing himself he is just doing this out of undying love for the one is no longer there, instead of realizing he is just a pedophile and this is what people with that problem do: keep finding new kids to abuse after the kids become adults.

I have read it many times over, and I often revisit particular passages. Nabokov's complete understanding of the English language, and his frequent flouting of its rules, make for prose that is astonishing in its originality and evocative power.  <br />  Humbert's highly intellectual narrative voice is by turns creepy, pathetic, darkly humourous and lyrically ecstatic. His obsession with Lolita is repellant, and his treatment of her often exposes his cruel nature, but he is a fascinating narrator.  <br />  Lolita herself is more of a symbol than a fully fledged character; she embodies pubescent beauty, but her sulky and strident personality is dismissed by Humbert Humbert as unrefined; as a result, his interest in Lolita is primarily expressed through his descriptions of her appearence. He only describes her feelings when they directly affect his own; for example, he complains of the way she weeps after he has satisfied his lust for her. <br /> <br />I recommend this book, particularly to people who study the english language. The contraversial plot may offend some, but that is their loss; the story is not only well written but also psychologically interesting, and readers should remember that they are not asked to condone Humbert's actions.",2005-07-25

So when I heard about him I was eager to give this book a try.  Considering all the Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Gogol, and Chekov I read, I thought I'd be in for a treat.    Boy was I wrong.    Nabokov's novel 'Lolita' about an old man who lusts (that's right not loves LUSTS) after a pre-pubescent girl, is the most banal boring prose I've ever come across.  Nabokov's narration while sometimes creative just goes on... and on... and on..  plus he gives no insight into his characters at all most simply because they have no dialogue what so ever.  Perhaps the only dialogue I seem to remember from this book, was the words \\""you rapped me\\"".  So how can I feel for any of the characters in this book after that?  huh?   Would I want to identify with the main protoganist who just can't stop thinking of his sick ways?  I don't think so.    I suppose many decades ago you could write a book like this and get noticed with the shock value, but if this book was released now, no-one would even pay attention to it, it would be passed off for what it is, toilet literature, and then be relegated to the garbage can.    I also realised Nabokov's insights are completley uncomprensible in his literary approach.  In some of his out of print lectures that I've read, he thinks Dostoevesky as a weak writer with the exception of perhaps \\""The Double\\"".  As someone has already mentioned, there is more development and briliance in ONE PAGE of Crime and Punishment compared to this trash.    So instead of me wasting time on this book here are some real Russian authors and stories that you should read over this junk.    Dostoevesky -    Notes from Underground, The Idiot, Crime And Punishment, Demons, The Brothers Karamazov (these are masterpieces!)

It is a story of twisted, jealous obsession, rape and deception, artfully rationalized by the very memorable Humbert Humbert, the predator with the self-described \\""movie star\\"" good looks.    What WAS convincing is the nightmare the narrator calmly describes in very rational terms, as if you're in complete agreement with him about his obsession with Lolita and the logical necessity of his raping the child and holding her an unwilling but resigned prisoner for two years. He offers it to us as a chillingly sensible sequence of events. On one level, he really knows he's a sick criminal. On the other hand, he romanticizes his feelings toward Lolita (leaving me with a rising scream in my chest!) as if it's \\""love\\"" to hold a 12-year old captive and subject her to your constant sexual demands.    You can't really love this book, I don't think. You can appreciate it and admire the skill of the author -- but the story makes my skin crawl.

The book is important because I'm certain it must have opened peoples' eyes to the rationalizations and the single-mindedness of the child molester in the 1950s, when people weren't really aware of such things as they are now. The author was exceptionally brave to have tackled this topic at that time, probably realizing it (not surprisingly, really) would be treated as pornography.

However, this is a product of prejudice and \\""judging a book by its cover\\"". The book only states that Humbert had sex with Lolita but never describes the actual action of sex. Yes, it does describe a twelve-year-old girl's body parts and the sexual desires a 40-year-old feels, but this is just to illustrate the mind of a madly-obsessed man. The idea of a new highly-controversial topic and Nabokov's excellent use of prose surely makes \\""Lolita\\"" one of this century's best books. <br />  <br />\\""Lolita\\"" is about passion, obsession and love. It is never pornography that is used to entice one's sexual desires. Nabokov came up with this topic to show the nature of human's minds and their psyche. The book shows how strong a person's obsession might reach and that it might conclude in ruining one's life when obsession is uncontrolled. Humbert, the main character, failed to restrain his overflowing emotions and this resulted in statutory rape and murder. However, his flowery tone and writing seems to induce the feeling of disgust because Humbert or Nabokov expresses the acts so positively and it seems that Humbert didn't do anything wrong. This is an act of humans trying to justify and defend themselves. When people write or talk about themselves, they tend not to write negatively but positively. This book shows a perfect example of this. Nabokov's writing is so convincing and beautiful that people might even feel sympathy for Humbert. Readers who read this book carefully cannot hate Humbert because the tone is so positive towards him and negative towards his enemies and adversaries. It makes us seem that Quilty and Charlotte, examples of the victims of Humbert's madness, are bad and that they are suffering Humbert when Humbert may be the one who has caused all the problems. Nabokov is surely a master in prose-writing.  <br />  <br />This book is magnificent, interesting and entertaining. It is difficult and somewhat boring but if it is carefully and slowly read, consuming all the details, the book becomes very easy and extremely enjoyable.

Fleeing a bad marriage from France to America, Humbert rents a room from Charlotte Haze where he becomes obssessed with Charlotte's daughter, Dolores (aka, Lolita).  While Lolita is away at summer camp, Humbert marries Charlotte.  When Charlotte discovers Humbert's diaries and their lacivious fantasies about her daughter, she is enraged and runs out into the street where she is struck by a car and killed. <br /> <br />Humbert fetches Lolita from camp, takes her to a hotel where they begin their sexual relationship before he has even told Lolita her mother is dead.  He then takes Lolita on a year-long journey across the US in an effort to avoid the discovery of their relationship and any intervention by the authorities on Lolita's behalf. <br /> <br />At the end of the year, Humbert settles down with Lolita in the town of Beardsley where he sends her to an upscale private school for debutantes.  Humbert and Lolita battle fiercely over her allowance and her behavior with boys, culminating in Lolita's insistance that they go back on the road. <br /> <br />Humbert complies and quickly figures out that he and Lolita are being followed.  Lolita's suspicious behavior suggests to Humbert that she is complicit in this and her sudden disappearance leads Humbert on a chase to find Lolita and exact revenge on her new lover. <br /> <br />As a novel, Lolita is intriguing on many different levels.  The book is so disturbing because Humbert is so decidedly NOT crazy.  It's certainly true that age of concent is cultural and that some children (what Humbert calls \\""nymphets\\"") do radiate a certain <br />unconscious charm and sexuality. <br /> <br />But don't get stuck in the trap of thinking of this book as about sex or as an apology for child molestation. The real source of Humbert's madness is his narcissism, his obssession with carving Lolita up into body parts in his mind, with the transitory <br />nature of innocence. <br /> <br />It's a fascinating study of a manipulative abuser who truly believes he loves his victim. Particularly how Nabokov emphasizes Lolita's power in the situation because the abuser needs the abused (possibly for self-definition? Does Humbert even know who he is if he doesn't have a nymphet/victim that he can control <br />by allowing his obssession with them to, in fact, control him?) <br /> <br />Lolita should never be considered pornography. First because that allows the role of sex to take too much emphasis over other aspects of Humbert's relationship with Lolita and his own wounded psyche. Notice Humbert NEVER describes the sex act in the book. We know a few places where it happens but it's entirely left for us to infer. Porn is never that subtle, not even soft core. This book isn't a masturbation aid; it's the mind of a man so obssessed with the girl he loves that he has made that girl a figment of his own imagination. <br /> <br />Second, the novel doesn't serve the same purpose as pornography. Not just because the book isn't a masturbation aid, but because pornography relies on deceiving its consumer, giving a false impression and false \\""high\\"" in place of the real experience. Usually with sex -- naughty, dirty scenes that stimulate arousal without any of the real-life messiness of sex (no worries about impotence or being able to orgasm or accidentally being squashed or having your hair pulled by your partner), all the things that make real sex so much fuller and more real than porn images of sex. <br /> <br />Whether Lolita \\""led him on\\"" depends on how reliable you think Humbert is as a narrator. It struck me that Humbert was scrupulously honest, but deluded by his own narcissism. Which means his facts about Lolita would be meticulously correct, but his interpretation of them would not be. <br /> <br />We have to assume that Lolita was neither innocent nor virginal. Humbert wasn't herfirst partner and he wasn't even her first adult male partner. Spontaneously and passionately French kissing an adult isn't the usual way teenage girls exhibit their crushes on grown men. Lolita definitely knew how to seduce and how to manipulate (e.g. Humbert denies raping her at first, but by the end of the book believes that he did rape her forcibly as she <br />claimed; we're never told for sure what the truth is, but Humbert's compulsive personality seems to suggest he isn't hiding any facts, so I concluded from this that Humbert is so obssessed with Lolita that he eventually accepts her accusation as the truth). Knowing to manipulate by accusing a man of rape is not <br />indicative of a demure and innocent child. This kid not only knows how to play a grown woman's game, she knows how to play a scarlet harlot's game! At age 12! <br /> <br />And this is where it gets sticky and challenges all our ideas about victimhood. Because Lolita is undoubtedly Humbert's victim. The real Lolita (whoever she is) doesn't exist for Humbert. He <br />sees in her only what he wants to see - the object of his passion and obssession. We assume too easily that victimhood is an either/or proposition -- either one is pure, blameless, and deserving of unqualified sympathy OR one is complicit, guilty, and cannot be considered a victim. Real life is messier than that.  And Lolita challenges it. Because she's by no means an innocent little girl, but she is ALSO a victim. The two aren't mutually exclusive. <br /> <br />But I don't see how we can doubt Humbert loves Lolita.  This is a guy who can ramble for three pages about the downy hair on his beloved's arm. He's passionately in love with her -- the problem is, he never really SEES her, despite his meticulous recall of every inch of her body. The trouble with a narcissist is that they can't see anything except through the filter of themselves and in relation to themselves. <br /> <br />I suppose it's possible to argue then that a narcissist isn't capable of real love. But I think that would be a dismissive by-product of our therapeutic culture that likes to box every human experience into neat, diagnosable packages. Mostly for our own comfort -- if THEY are crazy, it means *I* am not. And it's not that simple. Granted, we aren't all capable of child molestation nor as extreme as Humbert, but we're all capable of being so enamored with something that we can't see it for what it really is. Humbert's narcisstic blindness is tragic for both him and for Lolita. <br /> <br />Lolita has been criticized as not only too salacious for the masses, but as an anti-American screed -- Humbert symbolizing Europe and Lolita symbolizing America and the overall story symbolizing Europe victimizing and screwing (literally) America. <br /> <br />Nabokov vehemently denied that he had any anti-American intent in writing Lolita. In fact, he said it pained him to be accused of anti-American sentiment and that he purposely set the novel in the US because the beauty of American landscapes made a good backdrop for Humbert and Lolita's affair.  Obviously, he pokes fun of some of the commercial, consumerist, and low-brow aspects of American culture.  But only Americans who confuse defensiveness for patriotism would really consider this anti-American. <br /> <br />This novel shouldn't be summed up as \\""a love story\\"" anymore than it should be summed up as \\""a sex story\\"". It's both, but it's so much more challenging than either.  It's a moving and fascinating exploration power, love, and self-deception.",2005-05-15

All I see is the beauty and passion of obsession.   <br />      <br />    Hesitant to begin at first since I was under the impression that Lolita was not a novel for the easily appalled more conservative reader, Nabokov's words soon lingered inside of me, the images of Annabel's skin with the \\""crenulated imprint left by the band of her shorts\\"" as vivid to me as the book I was holding.  Resisting the temptations of the language, the \\""Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three on the teeth,\\"" became as difficult as Humbert denying himself of Lo.   <br />      <br />     If all readers sat down and read simply to enjoy, not analyze or question, then Nabokov reaches a perfection that so many authors fail to reach.  I used to read Austen and admire her language, her use of the words \\""fastidious\\"" and \\""felicity,\\"" but Nabokov's achieves a level of beauty in writing that is unsurpassable.

He weaves words together in a pattern that produces only the most exquisite tapestries, only the rarest fabrics.   <br />      <br />     Even though my own life is so far from Humbert's, so different in its morals and values, I could identify with the purity of emotion that Humbert experiences.  His obsession and weakness is nymphets.  They infiltrate his being.  He sees them as shadows through closed curtains, as children playing in the park.  His unfulfilled desires are so real and vivid in writing that they come alive through the text.  The beauty of the words makes only the passion real, allowing the reader to suspend moral judgment for a moment.  When Humbert finally attains Lolita as his personal nymphet, his purity of lust calls into question the idea of living a life where we forego bodily temptations in order to satisfy our own constructs of moral righteousness.  While it is impossible to say that people should in fact act on their every desire, Nabokov reveals that there truly is something beautiful in obsession. <br />      <br />     I wish I had become acquainted with Lolita sooner so that I could already be intimate with the words, remember each image as vividly as the next.  Nabokov is a master of aesthetics.  He manipulates the English language so elegantly that each sentence is in itself an individual piece of art capable of heightening every sense.

I just finished reading LOLITA for a class I'm taking this quarter, and I am one of those people who absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Most people who object to LOLITA object to it because of its subject matter; the novel chronicles the \\""memoirs\\"" of \\""Humbert Humbert\\"", an aging European obsessed with pubescent \\""nymphets\\"" (sexualized young girls from the ages of 9 to 13).  Upon arriving in America, \\""H.H.\\"" meets Charlotte Haze and her 12-year-old daughter Dolores, with whom he becomes immediately obsessed.  His feelings for \\""Lolita\\"" are so passionate that they prompt him to marry Lo's mother so he will never have to leave the \\""light of [his] life, fire of [his] loins.\\"" When Charlotte unexpectedly dies, Lolita is left in the care of her stepfather, who, unable to believe his terrific luck, takes her on a year-long cross-country trip.<br /><br />People who are critical of the book without having read it, however, will be surprised to learn the pains Humbert takes to preserve his pubescent angel's innocence.  He never intends to rape her; his plan consists of drugging Lolita and fondling her in her sleep--clearly still a reprehensible idea, but nonetheless not as vile as blatantly defiling his stepdaughter.  In actuality, it is Lolita who seduces him and begins their lengthy, illicit affair.  It is clear that Humbert is in love with Lolita--a love that unquestionably borders on obsession:  \\""Did I ever mention that her bare arm bore the 8 of vaccination?  That I loved her hopelessly?  That she was only fourteen?\\""  Thus, Humbert begins to be a sympathetic character as readers see Lolita chastising him, gamboling about with other boys, and remaining totally unresponsive to his efforts to show her affection.  I'm not saying Humbert's actions are justified--just that Nabokov has created a deeper, more textured story than many people imagine LOLITA to be.  What a gift this is, the ability to make readers sympathize with a self-professed pedophile.<br /><br />Nabokov is an absolute genius of prose.  The novel, written from Humbert's perspective as a sort of testimony, has an open, honest, unapologetic, unashamed voice.  The novel is unsettling, disturbing, tender, passionate, and surprisingly funny.  Although Nabokov was a self-professed dissenter of symbolism, it's hard not to recognize the obvious symbolism in LOLITA: clearly, Humbert represents something old-world, ultra-civilized, refined, and European, while Lolita, a little bit edgier, represents exuberant, unabashed post-war America.  Nabokov's novel chronicles the story of what happens when two such worlds meet.<br /><br />Hidden within Nabokov's prose are countless references to well-known literary names:  Keats, Joyce, Poe, Shakespeare.  Abounding in detail, LOLITA is demonstrative of the English language at its finest.  I was hooked from the first paragraph:  \\""Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins.  My sin, my soul.

I read it again as a mature adult and saw it through different eyes, particularly when I read all the way to the last page.

Could a no-talent singer like Britney Spears have hit the top of the charts without her schoolgirl fantasy video?

The subject matter and even the very book cover of the Vintage edition itself makes 'Lolita' a book that is, like Humbert Humbert himself, slightly awkward and embarrassing to be associated with in public.  And yet, 'Lolita' has endured for over fifty years as a classic of literature because of Nabokov's fine mastery of prose and a story that never ceases to suck the reader down into H.H.'s gleefully obsessive, beautiful, grotesque, ironic, and lyrical world.<br /><br />In many ways it is amazing that this novel saw the light of day; Nabokov willingly admits it deals with one of the \\""three taboo\\"" subject matters of the day (and remains as taboo, if not even more so, today).  The book is rich with allusions to history and other works of literature, yet it does not rely on these allusions for understanding of the work, just for its full enjoyment.  As Nabokov himself remarks, it is a mistake to over-symbolize the book as Old Europe (Humbert) exploiting (or alternately, being exploited by) Young America (Lolita).  Instead, this book should be best enjoyed for what it is--a masterpiece unto itself.<br /><br />If you're reading these reviews but have not read 'Lolita' yet, let me add my voice to the hundreds already here in praise of the novel.

Fifty years after it was written, the name alone carries a variety of connotations.  Nabokov hooks you early with all the dark but titillating subject matter and all the clever wordplay.  And his allusions to Joyce, Proust, Flaubert and just about everything under the sun, should keep lit profs and lit critics busy for centuries.  But I am but a humble reader, and for me the story flags near the end, just as I most want to know what's going to happen. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I can honestly say I've read very few books as beautifully or cleverly written in the English language.  With the exception of Shakespeare, whose English is of another era, only Dickens has a greater command of the language and compares favorably.  But it's not always clear what Nabokov is saying, let alone what he is alluding to.  You really need a strong background in world literature to get the full appreciation.  The references come often, and they often come in French.  I haven't read any of Proust or Joyce for instance.  It certainly would have helped.  It was fortunate that I had recently read Madame Bovary, as he makes references to it as well.  He also alludes to his own works. <br /> <br />But please don't be put off.  You don't have to speak French, and you don't have to be a lit prof to enjoy the story.  Still, read it especially for the language.  I don't usually recommend books for their writing alone.  This is a rare exception.  Sure, the insights into a criminal mind and the look at America from a European's perspective are interesting, but the language, oh my god, the language.  It's mindboggling!  Considering that English was a second or third language for him, I can only imagine what Nabokov's writing must have been like in his native Russian.  Twain, Hemingway, Faulkner, Poe, James, Steinbeck, Updike, Oates -- when it comes to beautiful writing, they don't hold a candle to Nabokov.  He puts them all to shame.

It is the narration of a bright, occasionally witty and intellectual man who becomes obsessed with a 12 year old \\""nymphette\\"" and involved with her some time later, leading to extraordinary pleasure, suffering, abuse, manipulation, betrayal and tragedy. Of course, the idea of Lolita being some kind of \\""dangerous\\"" book because it \\""promotes\\"" pedophilia is just as ludicrous as saying that Dostoyevski's Crime and Punishment promotes murder. However, it is seeing why this book packs such a punch that reveals what I think are its strengths. <br /> <br />Nabokov insists that his work is not a piece of didactic fiction and I agree. Many people who have read the book comment on the interplay with the reader hating Humbert the narrator for what he is doing but still finding him witty and charming. Myself, I did not find him charming at all, but rather it was a tale so ugly that it became beautiful. The poetic manner of Humbert describing his most horrifying passions makes it seem like a modern-day story a little bit in the traditions of Greek or Shakespearean drama, with vibrant, exaggerated emotions and situations and a pathos that is interestingly portrayed amongst a \\""banal\\"" landscape of being on the road in the US in the late 40s, with motels and the like. <br /> <br />Nabokov is known for a large amount of layers in his fiction and Lolita does not disappoint, being a semiotician's wet dream. Even Humbert himself says that his account would prove fascinating to his psychiatrists and the legal system (he's writing whilst institutionalised). Rather than go into how wonderfully symbolic the book is in its alleged portraying of Old Europe debauching America (or the other way around), I want to share how Lolita got me thinking about truth. Many novels have an \\""unreliable narrator\\"" - it's a good way of creating good fiction judging by the many other works using this technique. Here though, we have a narrator who is more even unreliable than most, AND who is self-reflexive about it, perfectly understanding that his relationship with Lolita was immoral and harmful. This means the whole book is a tangle in which we can try and reconstruct what \\""happened\\"" and what was Humbert's \\""subjectivity\\"" (and the book wonderfully blurs the line). The most horrible moments I found were ones where the true monstrosity of Humbert is exposed briefly, for a few lines, before returning to a more poetic/subjective narration. <br /> <br />If ever I was to become a boring advocate of \\""you have to read these books to know what the 20th century meant in literature,\\"" I'd include Lolita amongst the top of the list.

Despite the fact that he was born in Russia and spent much of his time around Europe, Nobokov managed to create a classic American novel.

To some, this will be child abuse, and maybe, in it's own sense, it is. But I found it refreshing and at the same time torturous that Humbert does really seem to care about Lolita. Of course, his way of caring for her is possessive, and at times it seems it isn't Lolita he cares about, but sex. However, at the end of the book, we are able to see that he does care for her in his own way, and we must remember that there are a lot of different ways of caring for someone. This last part is particularly sad, because where as other books and movies make us believe that you can only truly love a person if they love you back, here Nabokov tells us exactly the opposite, that it is possible to adore and worship somebody who you know will never love you back. The thing that gets most people is that he seems to care about his Lolita so much that it becomes sort of unbelievable, and many will not believe it.

Many readers, I expect, pick this up expecting pornography. Of course, it's nothing of the kind. Shocking in many ways, yes, but not dirty. Even though Nabokov had a hell of a time getting it published at all. But American society in the early 21st century has become far more straitlaced, more puritanical than even in the mythically more idyllic 1950s, and I suspect this book shocks more readers now than it even did then.<br /><br />Humbert Humbert (the narrator's adopted nom-de-perversion) is perfectly aware of his socially unacceptable sexual appetites. He tries, unsuccessfully, to control his perversion through marriage, attempts to identify its origins in a near love affair at the age of thirteen, calmly describes his series of breakdowns and bouts of insanity. But he so often seems to be the victim himself, it's hard to hate him. Given his predilections, Humbert is terribly naive about children, especially the psychology of adolescent girls, while Lo can be both endearingly innocent and shockingly slutty, \\""swearing at me,\\"" he says, \\""in a language that I never dreamed little girls could know, let alone use.\\"" But he learns just what he has taken on. \\""A combination of naivete and deception, of charm and vulgarity,... Lolita, when she chose, could be a most exasperating brat.\\"" And there follows a description of her mercurial temperament that any parent of teenagers will recognize instantly.<br /><br />Humbert's early adventures are nothing if not varied. His involvement with an Arctic scientific expedition, however, was not a success, if only because there were no desirable young girls to observe. \\""Nymphets do not occur in polar regions.\\"" Throughout the book, Nabokov is a master of delightful and witty word-play, delivered in gorgeous style. Then, while searching for a small New England town in which he can hide out to pursue his academic research and writing. But Charlotte Haze, who offers him a rented room, turns out to have a luscious twelve-year-old daughter named Dolores -- Lo, Lola, Dolly,... but always Lolita to him -- and Humbert finds the focus for his unhappy life. He actually marries Charlotte just to gain access to the girl, and a few weeks later the mother is struck and killed by a car shortly after discovering just what it is her new husband is after. Lots of ironies here.<br /><br />The precocious Lolita actually seduces middleaged Humbert as much as the other way around, but for her it's just a lark, a test of her sexuality, a temporary adventure. For him, it's the fulfillment of all his desires. His fantasies are more than fulfilled, but in the process, and especially during their year-long drive around the country, she becomes psychologically warped not only by his physical demands but by his manic possessiveness. And before she's fifteen, Lo has found a way to disappear. Humbert is crushed and spends the next several years searching for her, and for Quilty, the equally perverse playwright whom she allowed to spirit her away. And by the time he has found her again (married and pregnant), and takes bloody revenge on Quilty, Humbert has come to realize just what he has done to his beloved Lolita -- because, he discovers, he truly does love her.<br /><br />Throughout, believe it or not, this is a very funny book. There's this, during their first long journey: \\""I deplore the Mann Act as lending itself to a dreadful pun, the revenge that the Gods of Semantics take against tight-zippered Philistines.\\"" Or, in the midst of a long, long list of tourist sites visited, \\""Mission Dolores: good title for book.\\"" There are also plenty of purely literary jokes -- to which the college student must pay attention but the ordinary reader need not -- including character-doubling (a parody of the traditional German doppelganger theme), the repeating of minor themes (the house/hotel room number, the dog in the street), and Humbert's playing with his own name (Hum, Humble Humbert, Humbug/Homburg). Even the irony that nearly everyone in the story dies, is funny in a slightly warped sort of way. The opening paragraph of this marvelous novel, by the way, is one of my favorites.

My sin, my soul\\""(9).  This book is not meant for a conservative, young reader.  The ideas dealt with are mature, shocking, and somewhat perverse.  Despite some graphic content, the novel provokes questions about society's beliefs on relationships and life-choices.  Nabokov uses an elegant writing style with an overall interesting plot to make Lolita a recommended read.<BR> Lolita is not outwardly pornographic like one may think at first glance.  Humbert tells the reader about the unconventional love story between he and Lolita in a diary-like format.  Humbert is a lonely man who is unsuccessful in marriage and frequently hires young prostitutes to satisfy his lust for juvenile \\""nymphets.\\""  He meets Lolita by chance and decides to marry her mother, Charlotte, in an attempt to be closer to his young, forbidden fruit.  When Charlotte dies, Humbert assumes illegal custody of Lolita and they travel aimlessly across the United States with nowhere to go except away from the police.  Lolita serves as his unwilling sex slave throughout the journey, but secretly plots her escape.  Eventually their sexual escapades come to an end, \\""...how long did I think we were going to live in the stuffy cabins, doing filthy things together and never behaving like ordinary people?\\""(158).  The end of their love affair leads to the compelling climax of the novel.  <BR> Nabokov set out to write a book that challenges our views of sexual predators and he does this well.  He portrays the protagonist as an obviously mentally ill man who is aware of society's disapproving view of his actions.  Humbert does not care what others think about his illicit love and follows his heart rather than society's morals.  All of us want to be individuals that follow our own beliefs, so the reader can almost relate to this madman's struggle-not a feeling one would suspect to have toward an admitted child molester.  Nabokov gives Humbert an elevated writing style that makes the twisted desires seem more reasonable.  To think that such an eloquent narrator would commit such crimes seems unrealistic because we as a society tend to trust the educated and knowledgeable.  The only aspect that the book lacks is Lolita's perspective on her kidnapping and rape, which would entertain the reader, but destroy all empathetic feelings for Humbert.  By design, Lolita proves to be a clever read about a desperate man seeking an unattainable love.  <BR> This novel deals with complex issues from a new perspective, giving the reader a clearer insight to his or her own beliefs, especially on the topics of rape, fate, and women`s role in society.

True, there is not much that I can add to the substantial literature available on Lolita, or the volumes of Vladdy in general.  But I can say a few things about what I liked about the book, sprinkled here and there with some minor criticisms, mostly based on personal biases.  <br />First, Nabokov is as much a master of the English language as anyone before or after, as far as I can tell.  Lolita could be read at many different speeds.  You could speed-read it, I suppose, if you have cultivated that ability, but you would only get the outline of the story, which is a good one, to be sure, but you'd miss some of the finer details - the nuances of word play (there must be fifty examples of themes based on the words \\""Dolores\\"" and \\""Haze\\"" - I became a bit obsessive-compulsive after finishing the book - no doubt because of the contagious neuroses of Humbert Humbert - and spent twenty minutes trying to decide if Nabokov, in the afterward (in my edition, there is a six or seven page note written by V.N. a year or two after publication), was teasing the reader with the use of the word \\""daze\\"" - a final amalgamation of an ongoing thread?); references to Joyce, (thanks Adan) among others; allusions to cultural confrontations, including the confused traditionalism of Europe having to reconcile itself with the nothingness/everythingness of America;  and examples of self-reflexivity that would make Brecht blush.  You could spend a year reading this book (another type of Joycian reference - or homage, perhaps), analyzing it sentence by sentence, seeing if there is something within the microcosm of the page that reflects the universe of the book.  But you don't need to get down to this level of detail to get a reward from this book - I think a steady, conscious reading can bring surprises on every page; this is how I read it, and it's what I'd recommend to most readers.  <br />The question of whether H.H. truly loved Lolita - or whether he was simply in love with her ability to transport him to a nostalgic past - is an interesting one, but I don't know if there is a satisfying solution.  It kinda depends on what your definition of \\""is\\"" is.  Is there any other kind of love than that which takes you somewhere happier?  <br />Another obvious question is: Was H.H. a homosexual?  There seems to be ample evidence of this, albeit mostly circumstantial.  But his similarities to the undeniably gay Zemblan king in Pale Fire make me think that H.H. was a sort of prototype for Charles Kinbote.  But, if this is the case, Kinbote's homosexuality could be just a variation on a theme of sexual deviancy.  <br />As a contemporary reader, I find it difficult to create the character of Humbert Humbert in my mind.  Or, better yet, I find it difficult to believe.  He seems an impossible combination of old-world European (which has probably ceased to exist), ultra-literate intellectual, and pedophile, capable of superhuman acts of vice and destruction.  One could argue that such a complex characterization makes him more real; but I think the better argument is that the surreal nature of Humbert Humbert makes a sharp and intentional literary contrast with the banal normalness of America.  Lolita, the American girl, is the subject of a deranged and futile 19th-century European man's scrutiny.",2004-02-17

Humbert Humbert's personality reminds me of a Leftist zealot, and considering that Nabakov lived through the Russian revolution, I would not be surprised if he intended the similarities.  Humbert is smugly intellectual.  He describes America in terms of crass commercialism.  He mocks the simple desires of those he meets - Charlotte Haze especially - as if they are dullards who lack his sophisticated insights.  Like an east-coast intellectual visiting a NASCAR event, he invites us to laugh condescendingly at the banalities around him.  <br />He writes his story as if addressing the jury, and like a defense lawyer, he tries to seduce his readers with his fluid prose and repeated literary references.  (Of course, Nabakov is fully aware that Humbert is addressing a sympathetic audience since literary-minded people are the ones most likely to read a book like \\""Lolita\\"".)  Humbert professes a love for his Lolita much as a Leftist proclaims a love for the \\""people\\"" or the \\""working man\\"".  He never sees Lolita as a subject in her world, but solely as an object in his.  She is the reincarnation of his lost childhood lover, and, despite all his protestations of love, he knows nothing about her.  He is uninterested in her own past, so we learn nothing about it.  He is uninterested in her present, except to ensure that she does not meet other boys, does not form other relationships, does not leave him, and does not grow up.  He treats her simply as the raw material from which to sculpt an ideal that he loves.  And so he exhausts himself preventing her from reaching any independent conclusions of her own.  He uses her for sex, isolates her from other children, destroys her childhood, and occasionally strikes her.  Why?  As Humbert writes, \\""because she has absolutely nowhere else to go.\\""  She cries herself to sleep at night and flees whenthe opportunity arises.  Only in the solipsistic mind of Humbert could this be construed as a love story.  Tellingly, toward the end, when he asks her whether he had ever made her feel special, she ignores the question as ridiculous.  <br />In short, Lolita is an abstraction to Humbert, much as the proletariat was an abstraction to Lenin.  Love in the abstract is useless, and it is all Humbert has to offer.  However, Nabakov relates Humbert's self-absorbed rape of another's person's life so intellectually that many intelligent readers will finish the book genuinely unsure whether they had just finished an unusual but touching love story.  Aesthetics and ethics have never been contrasted so beautifully.  If you read this book, I urge you to ask yourself whether you found this exquisitely sensitive destroyer of lives sympathetic?  Do Castro's oft-claimed concerns for the people resonate with you as well?  They were both cut from the same cloth, lovers of concepts who destroy actual, living human beings.",2004-02-15

I would recommend keeping a dictionary nearby, I was constantly running into words I had never in my life heard of.  Besides his amazing vocabulary, Nabokov is also able to write in a manner that truly manages to convey the inner emotions and thoughts of his characters.  John Updike described his writing as \\""ecstatic\\""--I completely agree.  I found myself underlining passages every couple pages or so, something I rarely do.  <br />Another interesting facet of this novel is its dealing with a moral issue in a highly non-moral, non-judgmental way.  Going into a story about child molestation, clearly I was expecting a cut and dry line between good/evil, right/wrong.  However, at the end of the book I wasn't sure who was the corrupter and abuser...Humbert Humbert (old European) or Lolita...The larger theme of this novel is the clashing between old European and new American ideals, although Nabokov remains ambivalent about the 'winner.'  In \\""Lolita,\\"" both are self-destructing at a furious pace.<br />My one criticism of this novel is its slow pace near the end of the book.  It was difficult for me not to skim at parts.  Also, it would be handy to know some French, I think.  I just skipped all the French phases, of which there were plenty.  <br />Overall, highly recommended; not necessarily light reading.",2004-01-06

What the author accomplished so well was not so much in the exploration of a pathological obsession, but the firm establishment of a logical, thinking, reasonable person in love. Mr. Humbert takes the reader along a reminiscent journey of passion and fixation, of love and lust, of control and vulnerability.

It's certainly a book that crops up in conversation a great deal. I watched the James Mason film version of the book years ago--perhaps that's what put me off. I recently watched the Jeremy Irons version and loved it. I suppose part of me asked why myself why I'd want to read a book that is essentially the ramblings of a middle-aged pervert. Anyway, I decided that I'd procrastinated long enough, and it was time to get serious and find out what all the fuss is about.<br />The story is narrated by middle-aged Humbert Humbert. He's a pedophile--although he's tried denying it, tried disguising it, and tried channeling his baser instincts, but as luck would have it, Humbert finds himself as the lodger at the home of a buxom, lonely widow, Charlotte Haze and 12-year-old daughter, Lolita. Humbert doesn't particularly even like Lolita--he actually finds her rather dull, but she becomes a vessel for the fantasies left by Humbert's unfulfilled first love affair.<br />Due to the subject matter, the book was, at times, rather difficult to read, and it is a tribute to Nabokov's skill as a writer that I was gripped by this story. Humbert Humbert is at his most 'human' (introspective) during his pre- and post-Lolita phases. Once Humbert crosses the boundaries of ethical behaviour and begins a physical relationship with Lolita, there is no going back. At times, Humbert congratulates himself for his cleverness and calls himself a \\""magician,\\"" and then at other times, Humbert seems to realize how despicable he truly is. Unfortunately, the occasional flash of insight is too pale and fleeting to release Humbert from his obsession with his \\""nymphet\\"" and so Humbert accepts his enslavement and ultimate fate. As the novel develops, Humbert relates his seduction of Lolita and his subsequent relationship towards the child. His manipulative behaviour with Lolita was nauseating, and he acknowledges that Lolita has \\""absolutely nowhere else to go.\\"" Humbert keeps it that way--and turns Lolita into his personal prostitute.  Vain, selfish Humbert is a despicable character and at no point did I feel one iota of sympathy for the man. His ability to focus solely on his destructive, obsessive needs is chilling.

After all the litigation and fervent rebuking of this book and its author, how could the novel not be detestably lascivious?  I was positive I would be repelled by Nabokov and his obscene lil' book, but I was thankfully wrong.  The novel is hardly as licentious as its detractors once purported (it certainly fails to reach the apogee of sexual expatiation established by Miller's \\""Tropic of Cancer\\"").  History would have you believe that this book is appealing solely to the prurient interest.  That's unfortunate, because Nabokov brings an immense beauty to an otherwise hideous subject matter.  His inimitable prose is remarkably unique - he is unquestionably one of the best writers of the century.  The very fact that Nabokov can arouse an ounce of sympathy for the despicable Humbert Humbert places his artistic integrity far above that of his peers.

It is also a comedy of satiric and ironic proportions the like of which one would be hard-pressed to find.  The subject matter in this book is at once very offensive, but the first person narraration is so convincing that the reader will eventually adapt to Humbert's narraration style and only then will s/he appreciate what the story is really about.  Once, you get past the fact that Humbert is a madman in love with a child then you can take the story for what it really is - a love story, albeit a tragic,  psychotic, and terribly unhealthy love story.  I for one had some sympathy for Humbert for the sheer reason that he had a short love affair with a girl in his boyhood Europe who he lost because of typhus.  He even said that without her there would never be any Lolita.  Nabokov's writing style is extremely eloquent and almost stream-of-concsiousness.  I have never read another book where I found a character who was not only so deeply in love with another, but also who could articulate that love into words.  Nabokov does this with ease and the amazing thing is that English isn't even his mother tongue.  I have only read this book one time, but I'll read it again because I have an intuition that it works on many levels simultaneously.  It can also be a criticism of new-world American culture from the perspective of an old-world European.  It is also funny.  I found myself laughing aloud at some points in the novel only to be reminded in the next page that this was a deep and tragically sad love story.  Why read Lolita?  If your intersted in an honest and hilarious account of a madman's affair with a young girl, then this is for you.  On the other hand, if you find yourself throroughly repulsed by a pedophile, then perhaps you should stay away.  I find it more worthwhile to try and understand this madman despite all the sick, meandering thoughts that can go through his head in a single spell.  Nabokov's brilliant and evocative mastery of the english language is on fine display in this novel, and that alone is reason enough to read it.",2003-07-28

Furthermore, with that said, I doubt that any novel reviewed on this website will be devoid of those one and two star cynics....it's just a matter of taste and some people just have poor taste.<br />But as for Lolita, I will merely state that it is a literary paradigm.  I'm sure by now that you probably have a ostensible idea of what the novel is about, so I will address the subject matter as an ancillary concept.  What is most important about this novel is the prose.  Even if you are so narrow-minded as to become disgusted with the subject matter -- which is matter-of-factly portrayed with an ecstatic sense of urbanity -- you will at least walk away from this book with a greater appreciation for the English language, a broader vocabulary and the satisfaction of knowing the difference between a mediocre writer and a truly great one.<br />In addition, on another note, I would like to address some of the arguments of the cynical and callow reviewers.  First, dialogue is overrated -- if you have to read a novel that is filled with dialogue and suspense in order to maintain your reading interest, then you obviously either have a very low intellectual capacity or some sort of attention deficit disorder, and so I would suggest that you either improve your education or seek psychological help.  Secondly, didactic techniques should be used as subtly as possible...no author can change the world or the way society functions, so he should keep his own political agenda to himself and not use his novel as a platform in order to voice his (or her) deeply-rooted beliefs; i.e. if you need a book to change your life for you, you should re-think your philosophy and find out why you're so insecure about who you are.  Nabokov is genius, without even a diminutive doubt, he is the greatest writer of English prose to ever be published.  Furthermore, in Lolita he is not trying to debase women -- he had a very healthy relationship with his wife, Vera, whom he devoted every one of his novels to and openly stated that he would not be the writer that he was if it were not for her.  What he was doing, however, was writing from the perspective of Humbert Humbert...it's called thinking, or rather writing, outside of the box.  Too many writers narcissistically write about their own lives, rearranging the plot a bit and re-naming the characters -- an easy way of being unoriginal.  Nabokov, on the other hand, used a rare tool called imagination, and wrote about other people, showing their perspective on things.  He does not share the same views as Humbert Humbert, they are two totally different people and anyone who has read his biography will know that.<br />Anyway, in conspectus, it is a very worthwhile reading, if for no other reason than to expand your vocabulary and appreciation for the art of literature.  Don't listen to the critics, read it for yourself and form your own opinion...Nabokov unfortunately passed away in 1977, therefore even if you are disgusted with the novel, he will never receive a penny of its royalties so you will have not even contributed to the cause of an author that you dislike.  And oh, by the way, when you get to part two -- the part that all the cynics claim is too long and boring -- look for the little descriptions of all the secondary details in the travel scenes, they're obscenely beautiful and reminiscent...it's exactly those kinds of little things that we overlook in life and take for granted, yet in all certainty they are the most significant, causing life to have meaning and depth.",2003-07-03

Once banned and now available to the general public, I don't think many would argue about its divisive nature. Some feel that the subject matter in of itself is enough to deem it a \\""bad book\\"" while others praise its style and literary content. A few others feel that it's a love story while others claim it misogynistic.  <br />Any book, no matter how well written, centering on the abusive, sexual relationship between a middle-aged man and teenage girl will cause a controversy. Some see this as being portrayed in a light, comedic manner but I see the opposite. Humbert is a sad shell of a human obsessed with a prepubescent girl, Lolita. The extent to which he lowers himself to maintain his perversion only reinforces the fact that he is sick, highly intelligent but very sick. I don't see how this is portrayed as a love story that so many claim. <br />His obsessiveness carries over into his description of all that is wrong and middle class with American society from the viewpoint of a classic European aristocrat. He makes countless references to the tacky inns, objects, and people they encounter during their trek across America. Readers may be confusing Nabakov's wit and motives behind his highly satirical style as condoning pedophilia. For me this is just further evidence of Humbert's malaise: It's the only way he can hang onto his sense of cultural superiority amidst depravity. By the way, theyfre hilarious. <br />It is Nabakovfs ability to take such a controversial subject and turn it into an extremely enjoyable read that sets him apart. His writing style while mostly narrative based is magnificent.

The characters of Luscious Lo and Charlotte Haze are delightful, and Nabokov's digs at the vapidity of American popular culture---the kind of generalization that usually rankles me---doesn't overpower the enjoyment of the story, mostly because he balances his criticisms with just as pointed digs at the European culture that seems fascinated with anything American.

Nevertheless Lolita has achieved that rarest of feats by becoming even more controversial now than it was when it was first published in 1955.<br />Written in an almost velvet style, from the first page the authors obvious love of the English language makes this work beg to be read just for the beauty of the prose never mind the story or the allegorical aspects.  Although the influence of F. Scott Fitzgerald is clearly present in the text, Nabokov avoids the more flowery language of Fitzgerald, favouring a more sensual and tactile style, which I personally find much more satisfying to read.  Wickedly funny in places Nabokov makes you laugh out loud and then in the same breath make you question yourself saying, \\""This is terrible! Should I really be laughing at this?\\""<br />One critique of Lolita whose author escapes me, referred to it as \\""Nabakov's classic novel of paedophilia\\"" this entirely misses the point of the story, the fact that Delores is 12 years old when she and Humbert meet for the first time, is in my opinion nothing more than a way to focus the gaze and eventual blame of the reader on to Humbert and his overriding obsession with his little nymphet rather than seeing Lolita as an agent in her own downfall.  Nabokov is writing here about the power of love, it's ability to transcend circumstances and morality and the danger of obsession and it's destructive power, in this context age is truly irrelevant.  <br />Try to forget what you've heard people say about Lolita and approach this book with an open mind.

The marvellous prose is magical: alliteration, puns, word-play, allusions, metaphor, simile, poetry, lyricism, humour, wit, sarcasm...this and much much more make Lolita a delight to read just for Nabokov's astonishing use of the English language with its veritable palimpset of verbal textures. He is THE master of language--bar none! In this respect the work becomes precisely that rare thing: a piece of literature which is also a work of Art.<BR>To some extent then the plot of this masterpiece is not as important (in my view) as the style is so astonishing, so beautiful, so clever (so clever in fact that there exists an Annotated version to explain all of Nabokov's hints, references and allusions in his text) that the poetically inclined reader will enjoy its many hidden pleasures regardless; however the plot is also tightly controlled and the characterisation is also brilliantly done--especially of Humbert Humbert and Lolita although the secondary myriad of people who crop up in this tale are also well-defined--such that although the subject matter is paedophilia (hence the notoriety the book has achieved) --and incest --this does not prevent one from simultaneously understanding and feeling pity as well as poignancy and revulsion for the male protagonist whereas in a less well written work dealing with this taboo subject it would be very easy to decline into stereotypes and portray the paedophile as a unidimensional evil villain. Likewise the nymphet is portrayed with a variety of personae-reflecting real people rather than just a stereotype!--and not just that of a helpless victim or a seductress. This is a remarkable achievement and, for once, --from all the novels I have read which are considered 'classics'--this one really deserves the accolade.

Another questions is that of whether Humbert is a pedophile or not.  This is hard to put your finger on.

One of the amazing things about this book is that he is able to perfectly describe a predominantly erotic and sexual relationship without, as he points out in the forward, using any four-letter words. <br />Many have said that, for a foreigner, Nabokov was able to capture American life on the road better than anyone.

A nymphet could be described as a girl between the ages of 9 and 14 who demonstrates some \\""fantastic power\\"" unbeknownst to most her age.  Humbert never got the chance to consummate his relationship with Annabel and grew up longing for a sexual relationship with young women who reminded him of her.  Throughout college he studied and had prostitutes in and out of his life.  He had a short term relationship with one prostitute named Monique, but said she lost her ability to be a nymphet and moved on.  <BR>Humbert immigrates to America after college and is in search of a place to live.  Charlotte Haze offers Humbert a room which he is about to turn down until he sees Haze's daughter, Lolita.  Lolita reminds him so much of Annabel that he even marries Charlotte to get close to Lolita.  Charlotte hates Lolita and sends her away to boarding school.

Charlotte finds the journal and is disgusted by Humbert, but before his secret gets out, she is hit by a car and killed, leaving Humbert and Lolita alone.  For a year the two travel around and posing as father and daughter, but really are on and off lovers.<BR>Throughout the novel there are many characters that symbolize the different sides of Humbert.  Nabokov does an extraordinary job of making the reader believe Humbert is  a descent human being.  Humbert is intelligent and good looking, so his relationship with Lolita doesn't seem like a man desperate for love and only finding it from a young girl.  At some points Nabokov almost made me think that Lolita was the seducer and Humbert the victim.  <br />Humbert's mind and his way of words makes the pages turn.  This character has no edges to him and rarely puts himself first, though he fights uncontrollably with his feelings for Lolita.  Towards the end of the book it seems almost as if the view changes and instead of being told by Humbert, it's as if someone else is telling the story because you begin to see the darker side of Humbert and he doubts himself and his actions.<BR>Overall I would recommend this book.

The coincidences that fitfully help point A get to point B are not, in the case of Lolita, a contrivance meant to speed the action along, but baffle poor Humbert certainly more than the lax reader peering voyueristically into his life as these ridiculous ordeals appear to have actually happened to him--or at least that's how his fevered brain remembers them.<br />This book proves a powerful point regarding individual human perception.

Well-educated and good-mannered, Humbert was born to the upper reach of European social strata. His father was a mixed French and Austrian descent who owned luxurious hotel on the Riviera. Young Humbert lives a joyous life until the loss of his puppy love Annabel who dies of typhus in Corfu. The excessive desire for Annabel's image rekindles when grown-up Humbert Humbert met 12-year-old Dolores Haze in America. Lolita, or &quot;Lo&quot;, as Humbert addressed her, is what Humbert called &quot;light of my life, fire of my loins&quot;. The scenes where Humbert Humbert contemplated a way to get Charlotte Haze (Lo's mother) out of the picture were brilliant. The scenes where Lo seduced Humbert Humbert to making out were equally impressive. Humbert Humbert's passion for little Lo simply reflected his infatuation for his lost love Annabel: obessive, devouring, doomed and addicted. Part I of the book devotes to Humbert Humbert's infatuation of the numphet; while the second half tells of Humbert and Lo's romping around the country. The entire book fills with passionate, explicit, and beautifully-written prose, page after page. Afer all, Lolita is more or less, a twisted kind of love story.

His prose is stabbingly funny and sick. Humbert Humbert is viciously portrayed by himself, and Lolita is diabolical in her treatment of him. However, Nabokov's obsession with American versimilitude bogs down nearly the entirety of part two. The 'travel book' he and Lolita carry with them is referred to often as their guide, and is virtually regurgitated for the reader. Sadly, despite his mastery of the English language, there is a distinctly alien feel to all the characters. The locales are distinctly American, but the people are not, at least until the confrontation with Clare Quilty at the end.

The so-called \\""shocking\\"" and \\""perverse\\"" nature of the sexuality that Nabokov explores is lost if the nymphet is a sexually mature teenager.  Incidentally, by the time they are wheeling across the country, Lolita apparently gains sexually maturity, as evidenced from the first sentence of Chapter 33, Part One which reads: \\""In the gay town of Lepingville I bought her four books of comics, a box of candy, a box of sanitary pads....\\""<br />Humbert's sexuality is actually a strategy in the evolutionary game.  Instead of waiting until the female is sexually mature, the Humbert Humberts of the world pre-select their little darlings so that they are already in position, so to speak, when she reaches sexual maturity.  Society, of course, cannot buy this.  Its abhorrence is but one of the myriad taboos it concocts to protect itself from the evolutionary mechanism, a mechanism that cares not at all what society thinks, thumbing its nose, so to speak, at all societies and their ephemeral prejudices.<br />Among the most chilling sentences in the novel are these at the end of Part One after Lolita learns that her mother is dead.  Humbert narrates: \\""At the hotel we had separate rooms, but in the middle of the night she came sobbing into mine, and we made it up very gently.  You see, she had absolutely nowhere else to go.\\""<br />Also chilling is this from Lolita (half in jest, half in bitter revelation) the morning after their first night together: \\""You chump...You revolting creature.  I was a daisy-fresh girl, and look what you've done to me.  I ought to call the police and tell them you raped me.  Oh, you dirty, dirty old man.\\""<br />As a literary artist, Nabokov might be compared with Anthony Burgess.  Both are strikingly original stylists and gifted masters of the language, and both had one very popular novel that made them famous (which of course neither thought was his best work), and both have written many erudite and precious volumes.  Although I usually find Burgess's style a little too dense for me, his A Clockwork Orange was excellent.  Also both Lolita and A Clockwork Orange were made into movies directed by Stanley Kubrick.<br />While one might imagine that women, especially feminists, would positively despise Lolita, it ain't necessarily so.  I know one feminist English prof who teaches it at the university level.  Understandably they emphasize the depravity of Humbert and his virtual enslavement of Lolita.  But those women who do resist the novel do so because the story reveals a disagreeable fact of human sexuality they would prefer to forget, namely that for most males, youth itself is a supreme value in the old sex game.  By the same token most young men do not like to see aging rockers or graying Richard Gere types or fat Hollywood producers walking off with beautiful starlets.<br />Although Lolita was (and is) ahead of its time, it is necessarily a \\""fiction\\"" with the central character necessarily an \\""antihero\\"" for the sake of the prejudices of society.  Nonetheless, one of Nabokov's motivations in writing \\""Lolita\\"" was to show that, however strongly society condemned their love it was a real expression of human sexuality and not a Freudian type \\""perversion.\\""  (Nabokov despised Freud and considered psychoanalysis a \\""racket.\\"")  Unfortunately (but understandably!) he was not able to overcome the taboo himself and come out of the closet.  (If indeed he was in the closet.)  Additionally, he discovered, I suspect, in writing the novel that not only would society (and his readership) accept only a tragic version of the story, but that inevitably, given the mores of society, such a version was the only one possible.  To write the story with a happy ending, with Humbert the proud father paying for the wedding, perhaps, and sending his little love off to middle class banality with some \\""Dick Schiller\\"" was unthinkable artistically and psychologically.  Indeed, it would have been the common place resolution of the usual \\""family affair.\\""<br />By the way, Nabokov wrote a precursor of Lolita, a rather longish short story entitled \\""The Enchanter\\"" which was eventually published in English.  \\""The Enchanter\\"" is interesting but doesn't have the delicious ironic humor or anything like the scope of Lolita.<br />The edition with annotations by \\""Alfred Appel Jr.\\"" adds to the enjoyment of the novel especially if you don't know French. Most of the French phrases are translated.  Be aware however that \\""Alfred Appel Jr.\\"" is really Vladimir Nabokov himself in pseudonym!

He takes a horrible deviant man and by adjusting the frame around him creates a work of art.  What annoys us most about Humbert is our struggle to vilify his character and de-frame him from the story that Nabokov so brilliantly composes.  Nabokov somehow creates a tension in the reader: how much should we judge and indeed convict Humbert Humbert (as we are left/invited to do at the end of the novel)?  While our judgment is secure in claiming his actions are completely wrong we cannot help but sympathize with the narrator.  <br />It is widely agreed that Nabokov is a master prose stylist.  His prose is beautiful.  I find that certain parts sound wonderful when read out loud.  Nabokov's use of alliteration helps this vocal sense of his work (e.g. `The distraught father went on to....fetch his delicate daughter').  It is possible to hear the narrator speak rather than the reader read his words off of the page.<br />The most pleasant surprise for me was the humour of this work that is intertwined throughout most of the novel.  Humbert's portrayal (usually negative) of the characters he comes into contact with is very funny.  The puns and wordplay contribute to the playfulness of Nabokov's language (one look at the Annotated Lolita and I see how many puns I missed).  It is this humour that draws in our sympathy unawares.<br />Nabokov is not satisfied with just having the reader deal with the Humbert/Lolita relationship.  He is also critiquing postwar America.  His description of motels and their evolution into hotels illustrates the dynamic scenery in the novel.  The background continually changes but the main drama remains static; Humbert is just as fallen at the beginning of the novel as he is at the end.<br />Vanity Fair calls `Lolita' the most convincing love story of our century.  Debates will continue to rage regarding whether Humbert loves Delores.  Can a sinful, obsessive, deviant man love?  Is Delores made into an object? Is she an object of love?

It appears that he either has been or will be convicted of a capital crime and is addressing both the interested reader and his lost Lolita, who he knows will never read it.  He traces his attraction to \\""nymphets,\\"" pre-teen girls with the uncommon libido to enchant older men, back to his first puppy love, Annabel, who died tragically young.  Since then, girls of Annabel's age have become his ideal of femininity and sexuality.<br />After an unsuccessful marriage, Humbert moves to New York to work for his uncle's business and remains on the prowl for nymphets.  A sojourn in New England brings him luck:  The house he is staying in, owned by a harpy-like widow named Charlotte Haze, contains the nymphet of his dreams, Charlotte's daughter Dolores (Lolita).  The attraction is mutual, unbeknownst to Mrs. Haze, who has her own eye on Humbert and a jealous, contentious attitude towards her daughter.  Mrs. Haze sends Lolita to summer camp and proposes marriage to Humbert, who accepts because it will keep him close to Lolita.<br />Mrs. Haze soon dies --never mind how for now -- leaving Humbert free to take his \\""hot downy darling\\"" Lolita with him all over the country in Mrs. Haze's car, \\""Melmoth\\"" (as in the Wanderer).

Humbert's passion for her is so strong, so possessive, that any interference in their relationship could drive him to criminal acts of desperation.<br />Nabokov understands, better than most writers, what makes fiction fun, and he employs the right devices to secure the reader's interest.  For example, Nabokov is arguably the master of the art of foreshadowing; attentive readers will be able to connect current events to previous clues as the story continues to unfold.

While Nabokov himself states that there is within Lolita \\""...no moral tow\\"", one cannot help but feel as though a moral lesson has been taught. Nabokov's work is a story that can be related to in the sense that it describes so perfectly something that even when possessed, is still unattainable. Nabakov writes this book with an inherent psychoanalysis of the doomed H.H. within. After reading this captivating story, the reader has to ask himself if he [the reader] personally believes that the antagonist in this book is H.H., who takes the childhood from this girl of twelve, Quilty, who takes this child from H.H. and causes a few years of hellish regrets for H.H., or if the true antagonist is Lolita herself. One of the quirks about Nabakov and his style of writing is that he puts meaning into even the smallest of details. For instance, the name Delores, Lolita's legal name, is of Spanish origin and is taken to mean \\""Lady of Sorrows\\"". Was H.H.'s sorrows caused by Lolita, or did they go back further, to his childhood, when he lost his first love, Annabel?

Much of this praise derives from Nobokov's reputation as a writer, his frequent literary allusions, ample dashes of French, and his clever use of the English language. However impressive, in my mind these attributes aren't enough to compensate for the deplorable nature of his subject matter (dressed up pedophilia), and his offensive depictions of women as sex objects (Dolores/Lolita) or brainless slugs (his two wives).<br />So what if Nabokov has written other notable novels? So what if he is fluent in three languages and writes well in English? So what if his characters are rich and three dimensional?

The poet was smart enough not to mention Lolita. I confessed to my colleagues that I had just read the novel. Three of them admitted that they had tried but could not venture far into the story. The \\""controversial masterpiece\\"" bored me. It took three months for my usually voracious mind to read it, and I fully understand why a Russian woman would quickly abort it. Early in the book, Nabokov delivers a punch to our gut with this statement, \\""In my self-made seraglio, I was a radiant and robust Turk, deliberately, in the full consciousness of his freedom, postponing the moment of actually enjoying the youngest and frailest of his slaves.\\"" This twisted sympathy with the Ottomans would be enough to send the book to the kindling pile of any dacha. Nabokov's blows continued until this line near the end of the book--\\""which reminds one of the tenth or twentieth soldier in the raping queue who throws the girl's black shawl over her white face so as not to see those impossible eyes while taking his military pleasure in the sad, sacked village\\""--forced me to recognize that time had wasted away on his fantasy. Perhaps the Russian women were smarter than I am by abandoning the book more quickly. <br />Were people so ignorant of sexuality and race in the mid-20th century, or was Nabokov just a pretentious pedant? I suspect the latter since my mama ain't nobody's fool. The writer/reader in me can respect the author's attempt to probe the recesses of the male mind. However, the educator role that played in a men's prison teaching GED skills knows this preoccupation with the sexuality of pre-adolescents as an evolutionary obstacle. But tradition seems to indicate that it's quite normal. In fact, in most states child molestation carries a sentence of one year or probation, while burning an unoccupied building locks a man away for twenty years.(What percentage of judges is female?)<BR>The references to people of African descent in only derogatory terms boiled my blood.

If he is not trying to teach, inform, or entertain, then this book was only written for his wife, controversy or literati masturbation. The first reason would be charming if he had not been promiscuous after their meeting. The second provides insight to the capitalist culture and the continued discussion of this book in the US.

The fundamental paradox here is the juxtaposition of the apparent innocence of the heroine, and the fictional author's longing for that innocence; and the result that he regresses into something inferior to his naive state with his childhood sweethart, and Lolita is thrust into an adulthood that her negligent mother and automatic culture had not prepared her for. Ultimately, a satire on the stagnation of the post-war world; Humbert himself originates from a Europe that he detests for its degradation; but the chief concept in the book is the loss of innocence in the modern world, through the ready acceptance of all the adult cliches by these children unsupported by any pertinent history. Lolita herself is the far from the ultimate model of innocence; and although Humbert is undoubtedly the instigator, her exposure to the modern world allows her to simultaneously appear mature to Humbert (he describes her as seducing him) whilst remaining the perpectual child. The love affair almost genuinely attains the innocent state that the fictional author would have: it is the clinging together of two children: Humbert utterly dependent on her for all that constitutes his purpose, and she unable to live as an orphan without him. The most distrubing aspect of the book is unequivocally the voice of the narator; and although we should expect his integrety to be highly compromised, the casual cruelty he demonstrates towards almost all the characters (especially his first and second wife) constantly reminds us that we deal with someone who is driven by his desire to regain the innocence that he has lost. This innocence can never again be attained: and so it is through a powerful self deception that he projects his apparently innate and immutable state to the reader. This is ultimately the only indication of Humbert's guilt: the entire novel is supposed to have been written in retrospect, and the initial lust that he feels towards Lolita is still present long after his loss of her and his apprehension by the police; note his sly assides about the girl scouts in his prison encyclopedia. This first struck me when he describes how his first wife had an affair with a ridiculous russian general, who now drives a taxi. In his private narration, he informs the reader: \\""I was happy to wait until we were alone ... and then really hurt her\\"". <BR>For me, one the most fascinating aspects of the book was the introduction, written by one of the fictional characters in the book; and hence controlled by Nabokov. Although the cause of a considerable amount of confusion initially, it provides a valuable insight into Nabokov's purpose for the book. Essentially, it constists of an enormously pretentious psychatrist's analysis of the account of Humbert, and the old cliches (\\""...Lolita represents a warning to all of us, parents, moralists ...\\"" etc.) indicate that this is Nabokov's method of pre-empting the expected rush of interpretations. The most interesting thing about it is, however, how subversive it is: when discussing Humbert, the character asserts: \\""although we hate (Humbert), his singing violin can evoke a love of his (Humbert's) devotion\\"" (I paraphrase, since my memory is not entirely effective). It is this dismissal of the novel as merely abstracted art, and the naked lust Humbert describes as a form of artistic love, that constitutes the subversive element: and the fictional writer is guilty of the same brand of self-delusion as Humbert imposes upon himself, by depicting the activites of Humbert as the descriptions of an anguished lover. Humbert is no less cruel about Lolita herself: at one point he purchases \\""some bananas for my monkey\\"", with the conscious understanding of his power over Lolita; himself as the organ-grinder. We must be clear on this when we discuss the book: Humbert's obsession is not beutiful or transcendental, and however scintilating the language the Nabokov employs, it ultimately is designed to portray Humbert as the pretentious, self loathing, self deluding molester that Humber labours so hard to hide from us. The book is fascinating in its fantastically successful attempts to describe a man's pathological obsession with the innocence that that obsession has ultimately removed from him: and as such, is a parable for modern life, even in non-sexual terms. This book is the most modern I have ever read: the author has a preoccupation with the effect of constant analysis of narative, which both Lolita and Humbert have been over exposed to: and, even ignoring the sexual aspects, is enormously contemporary.",2002-04-14

Obviously, the subject matter of \\""Lolita\\"" has always left some readers uneasy, to say the least, but as a European, I took it for what it was, a brilliantly written story of love, with a somewhat shifted specific gravity of emotion. The protagonist is in a way [handicapped], for his emotional development was arrested somewhere in the early teens, and ever since, despite the burden of consciousness that adulthood brings, he is unable to restrain his lust whenever the special circumstances arise - that is whenever he finds himself in the vicinity of a nymphette, as he explains the phenomenon to himself, or in fact any young girl resembling his object of love from the past, to be precise. Faced with the loss of the beloved, he constantly seeks the same tint of emotion, making him more and more ridiculous the older he is. Here lies the tragedy of arrested development, for not only Humbert has a serious problem, which he is unable to resist to get into repeatedly, to finally succumb to passion for Dolores, the famous Lolita, but also because he is aware of the wrongness of his actions, his tendencies, his life - for we have to realize that for Humbert, all other things ceased to exist, his life evolved around only one planet, like an abandoned moon in the far corner of the galaxy, where the rest of the society never ventures, although being at the same time aware of the moon's existence. It's a classic tragedy, a modern counterpart of the Oedipus myth, viewed rather from the perspective of the elder, not the younger.<br />If you haven't read the book, you might wonder about the origin of the immense popularity of \\""Lolita\\"", a book which was successfully filmed twice, despite the relatively disturbing subject matter. Nabokov displayed an enormous civil courage, having dared to publish the novel while the book might just as well turn out to have been his literary grave. The novel is still popular because many people recognize the helplessness of the protagonist, who found himself facing the insolvable problem, exceeding his abilities to resist. The subject may be easily extrapolated to all other phenomena of humanity, for the human being is fundamentally weak, prone to both a mischief, and a cardinal sin of all possible flavors. Ever since the publication of \\""Lolita\\"", the characters from this novel became immortal, having entered the mass conscience, augmenting the vocabularies of all nations - exactly what we think of the archetype, the image so convincing that all that is conceived later in the imagination of other authors, is referred to it, where the image serves as a basis for comparison from which there is no escape. <br />Only one question remains to be answered, and that is why is it that no other book involving a similar theme ever enjoyed such popularity, why weren't these books as revered as \\""Lolita\\"" has been. The answer, simply, is that no one ever came close to the literary genius of Vladimir Nabokov, and what under his pen appeared to be a masterpiece, coming from other authors appeared to be a kind of deviant tripe, a good example may be one of the earlier novels by McEwan, namely \\""The Cement Garden\\"". Nabokov's book is a psychological study and a beautiful love story, something we can't deny despite the inevitable uneasiness, whereas other attempts to write about that specific gravity of emotion were nothing short of obnoxious. <br />Finally, I think that there is no point in recommending this book to anyone. Some readers will have a strict opinion before they attempt to read this novel, if ever, and others will be attracted to the subject matter, and will never finish, because their expectations of the sensational material will never be met. Yet others will pass on this book, and that's just as well. I think that if you like excellent writing, if you like good literature of the highest order, you will not only read Lolita, but also other novels and stories by Vladimir Nabokov - and you will not need a recommendation to do that; you will explore Nabokov on your own, guided by the longtime reader's intuition.",2002-03-27

I feel that after reading the book neither movie gives Nabokov's complex plot or characters justice. This book is something you have to read the grasp.<BR>  The book starts slow and honestly somewhat dull with the main character, Humbert Humbert, alluding to the fact that he is in jail for the murder of someone and was promted to write down his tale by his lawyer, John Ray Jr. It starts with a flashback to the days of Hum's youth and his first love-Annabel. It leads up to years later his first encounter with, \\""Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful\\"" Dolores Haze or Lolita as he calls her. Humbert quicklyfalls in love with her and begins a relationship with the 12 year old. The story tracks their affair and the eventual downfall of their romance.<BR>  I really liked this book. One reason is because the writer uses all types of literary games. For instance certain names have secret meanings-if you rearrange the character Vivian Darkbloom's name (and change one o to an a) it spells out Vladmir Nabokov. The author uses certain coinages such as \\""nymphet\\"" to describe a certain type of desirable girl between the ages of 9-14. He uses sharp contrasts to present the extremity of certain points such as when Lolita and Humbert are together on vacation Humbert describes it as their, \\""Paradise lit with hell flames\\"". The autor messes with words and sayings in English as well as French (the author learned both). He creates lyrics with puns to create small poems throughout the book, \\""The Squirl and his Squirrel, the Rabs and their rabbits, have certain obscure and peculiar habits, male hummingbirds make the most exquisite rockets, the snake when he walks holds his hands in his pockets.\\"" This example is a nonsense poem Humbert writes to Lolita to make her laugh. It seems nearly impossible to find all the jokes throughout Lolita. The writers of Time magazine were quoted saying that \\""Lolita is a major work of fiction; it is also a shocking book...both intensely lyrical and wildly funny.\\"" It is quite an amazing book full of word-play and is especially amazing when you consider that the man who wrote it learned English as his third language (Russian and Frnech were his first 2). Nabokov actually described Lolita as his love affair with the English language.<BR>  I also like tis book because the character Lolita is a symbolic representation of America. The write who was born in Russia satires America's vulgar and commercial excess while still showing the beauty of it all and his faithgul adoration of it. He does this be having young Lolita love bland pop music, junk food, Coca Cola and movie star magazines. The character Humber refers to Lolita saying, \\""She it was whom ads were dedicated: the ideal consumer, the subject and object of every foul poster.\\"" In this way Humbert sees Lolita as Nabokov sees America-filthy and beautiful, flawed and sweet. The book show the love-hate relationships that occur with one's facsination in a certainthing, and hopefully balance out in the end.<BR>  Many peoploe though this book was uninteresting due to it's lack of sexual content. Many more people felt it was extremely immoral to write a book with a plot concerning a man's desire for a 12 year old child, when the book first came out in 1955 it broke many taboos held standard in society and literature. Nowadays, with sexuality of every kind being presented in the media this book, which in fact never directly mentions the act of sex, is quite tame. Yet I feel it is not just the \\""classic story of sexual obcession\\"" as some have suggested, or a story of a perverted & twisted old man Humbert. It is a story written by the charcter Nabokov created who is trying to record and find outwhat happened, where he went wrong, and finally how he can learn toforgive himself for robbing Lolita of her normal childhood. It is about love, self-exploration, and revenge. It maps out 42 years of a man's life-journey and is struggles with mental illness throughout, as he tries to learn how to stop loving the things he can never really have.<BR>  This is an awesome story & I reccomend it to any mature older teen. When I first picked up this book I thought it'd be O.K. but it surpassed my expectations and raised my standard of good literature.

Only the wide awake need attempt it.<br />Vladimir Nabokov did not write novels.  He crafted jewels, star sapphires that seem at first to have hard, mechanical, intellectual surfaces. But as the attentive reader turns them over, noting the reflection of one facet in another, the fire in the gem's core ignites, warms the soul as well as the mind, and grows in value with each re-inspection.<br />Lolita is one of his crown jewels. He never wore his considerable heart on his sleeve, but he perhaps came closest in his afterword to this book, when he wrote of \\""what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss, that is a sense of being somehow, somewhere, connected with other states of being where art (curiosity, tenderness, kindness, ecstasy) is the norm.\\""  That credo is also the key to understanding the sense in which, despite Nabokov's contempt for \\""morality\\"" in the censors' understanding of the word, there are deep moral underpinnings both of Lolita and of his whole body of work.<br />Humbert Humbert is a fabulous monster: an endlessly charming ogre, a dangerous pervert, a seducer as much of the reader as of the doomed and triumphant Lolita. The author has been generous to his dark creation, endowing him not only with erudition and wit, but - to run through the catalog - with genuine tenderness, with a capacity for ecstasy, and a wide ranging curiosity.  But he lacks all kindness, until it is far too late; and his curiosity has huge blind spots, that allow him neither to see his \\""darling\\"" whole, nor to see the humanity in much of anyone else at all. <br />On a first reading, all his positive endowments nearly win us over to affection for Humbert. We are intended to fall into this trap, one which Humbert himself deconstructs with little clues along the way, and with nearly frank admissions of guilt at the end. On better acquaintance, none of his rationalizations or seductions work on us anymore. Nothing redeems him, because nothing can restore Dolly's stolen childhood. What transforms him from a mere monster into a human monster, and allows him to retain something like sympathy from the re-reader, is his act of writing the book. He becomes determined that, since he cannot give Lolita back her innocence or her lost time, he will give her the poorer gift of immortality.<br />Ultimately, besides being a love letter to America and the English language, \\""Lolita\\"" is a poignant meditation on time, and immortality, and the connection of art to each. What has made Humbert into a monster is his drive to stop time, to catch and freeze the butterfly at the moment it emerges from the chrysalis. The other, simply human, characters differ from him in accepting time's flow. Let me give one example, out of dozens, of the way the theme surfaces.<br />For several chapters at the start, Humbert looks forward to a promised picnic with Lo and mother Charlotte on the beach at \\""Our Glass Lake.\\""  It's a mirage. When, finally, he gets to the beach, Lo is gone off to camp, Hum is stuck with Charlotte for company, and the lake's real name turns out to be \\""Hourglass.\\"" A bait-and-switch has magicked his motionless, timeless, glassy idyll into a timepiece. He makes up his mind to drown Charlotte as they swim there, but can't bring himself to do it. When the two get back to shore, another beachgoer points out to Humbert that he's made the mistake of wearing his watch (a gift from Charlotte) into the water. She taps his wrist and announces, \\""Waterproof.\\""  Humbert may be forgetful of time, but he can't help taking it with him wherever he goes. And it keeps on ticking. Was it really her new husband's conscience, as he would have us believe, or was it Charlotte's being at home with fluid time that made her \\""waterproof,\\"" despite his homicidal inspirations?<br />Dealing with one's reactions to Humbert can be unnerving, and may put off some readers who might otherwise have learned to appreciate Nabokov. I'd suggest starting with a (relatively) straightforward work like _Bend Sinister_, or _The Defense_, to get a feel for the kind of active reading that this author demands, and the delight he gives in return. If you like those, you will love Lolita, and you will eventually want to get the annotated edition from Vintage.<br />Five stars are not of course enough. I would like to award this book a sixth, grey star, outshining all the hosts of heaven.",2002-02-18

While Humbert's conflicts and motivations are always in the foreground, you have to dig a little deeper to get to the heart of Lolita and Quilty. Obviously, Humbert doesn't delve into their psyches except in their relation to him, so this can be quite a scavenger hunt.  Many interesting questions are raised: Did Lolita bring this upon herself(she had had sex at least twice before Humbert, once with a boy and once with a girl) ? Did she intentionally seek this depravity? Was she anticipating her \\""rescue\\"" by \\""Trapp\\"" from the onset(she has know him since she was ten, two years before Humbert, remember)?

All symbolism aside, Nabokov's was a mind of the highest order. He wanted to present a love, while immoral and illegal, as just that: love. Nabokov wanted us to come away from his work questioning why we have some of the structures in society that we do. Blind faith and acceptance of such ideas can lead to absurd assumptions about things in our world. We might begin to take everything for granted, and that is what Nabokov wanted to expose and challenge.

Of the readers who are APPALLED by the pedophilic (sp?) aspect of the story, I wonder if they realize that the novel is esentially a comedy. The book is loaded with humor, with the situation between Humbert and young Dolores satirizing several things. Mainly, (and just off the top of my head), the fact that Lolita is such an ordinary, bratty girl makes Humbert's overblown fascination seem funny. Not only is she the wrong age for him, she's so shallow and mundane that she doesn't seem worthy of worship. Doesn't this say something about pop culture, and about whatever your own sexual obsessions might be.....how the most ridiculous, ordinary things can reduce us to dithering idiots? In a broader sense, the book satirizes that whole genre of novels in which innocent American girls (such as DAISY MILLER) go overseas, only to end up being ruined by suave, continental men. In LOLITA, a sophisticated European comes to New England and is demolished by the girl next door. A girl in roller skates with scabs on her knees.<br />What makes the book haunting, though, is the dark sadness that runs beneath the situation. Because Humbert Humbert and Dolores Haze are so terribly mismatched, (their age just being part of it), they can never achieve true love. And even if Dolores could return the older man's affection, he'd stop loving her as she grew up. Yes, if the story were taken seriously, it would be disturbing. But who's taking it seriously? And what no review can convey is the quality of Nabokov's prose - - his sheer gift for the use of language. The words carry you like a river.<br />Incidentally, if you respond to Nabokov's tone, you might check out another book that made me think upon reading the first page, &quot;God, this writer is a real craftsman.&quot; I AM MARY DUNNE by Brian Moore.",2001-09-02

After that you can continue on with Pale Fire, Ada, Speak Memory and his last novellas. Lolita is the one though if you only want to read one. Judging by this book Nabokovs stay in America was one that was at least amusing. The critique of middle American life in the fifties is very very high comedy. Nabokov shares the jokes and they are written in the very finest English as were his remaining works so he did admire something we possessed. As the novel progresses and Humbert's fine mind begins its gradual, inevitable decline America no longer really feels like America but more like something Grimm may have conjured to scare Europeans from coming over here.

I'm sick and tired of how often young women are harrassed and sexually abused in this culture and throughout the world.  This book is not funny.  And the genius of the prose does not compensate for the weak, pathetic excuse of a man that Humbert is described to be.

Our social and moral walls prevent even the most flexible and ethically pliant person from fully accepting or condoning Humbert's actions as understandable.

This is creepy and wrong, and the first person narrator knows it, but can't help himself. The book leaves moral paradoxes and sorrow in its wake, not to mention a general feeling of having just participated in something very special. The themes of the novel are never as simplistic as the set-up would suggest, and the characters have far more dimension than one would expect from the types that Nabokov creates.

Puns abound in this novel, and in fact Humbert's quite the amusing speaker. Nabokov's first language was not English (Russian), and his magisterial command of English here butresses his already well-known genius<br />I would also like to repeat the notion that LOLITA is a love story. Critics of that idea, aghast, claim that because Lo is too young to love and because Humbert treats Dolores as mere property, it's not a love story. Those people are ignorant of the relationships of the world, having fled into the shell of romantic daydreaming.

Which brings me to the next point -- it's a cultivated art, the ability to pay equal attention to both prose and plot and excel brilliantly in both. Lolita is a shining example of that. I must admit I haven't read much about the impetus behind Nabakov's inspiration to write a novel about the raunchy lust of a 40-year-old man for a 12-year-old nymphet, but here is my offering: Any story less wild, less haunting, less surreal, less un-moral than that would not have served to be as appropriate a backdrop for Nabakov's literary wit, sardonism and acrobatics. His timing was unfortunate -- the repressed Pleasantville era of the 1950s -- yet I wouldn't doubt that that might have been his exact intention. You will be shocked, enthralled, and disgusted by this novel -- but I think that is what critics really meant when they say a story is &quot;engaging.&quot; Too often, with today's contemporary fiction, there isn't a sense of interaction with the words running across the page. There's a barrier to literature, and our great masters never meant for it to be that way. And at the end of it all, Nabakov offers his definition of true love (without lauding it as the end-all of all human emotions, mind you), but you must push your way through the novel before you get to this carrot.

Nabokov's prose is sublime, which is all the more amazing given that English was not his mother tongue.  He delves straight into the mind and heart of the enigmatic Humbert Humbert, stripping the anti-hero's soul bare for all to see.  Perhaps only in Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov have the inner workings of a criminal's mind been so thoroughly explored.<br />Some people have objected to Nabokov having even dared to mention Humbert's crime.  But do these people object to depictions of Raskolnikov's awful deed?  What scale does one use to weigh pedophilia vs murder?  Humbert's crimes were not described in detail, and often merely alluded to.  They are not condoned, or glorified in any way.  To propose that merely describing a hideous crime is grounds for censorship (as was often done when this novel was first published) would imply that many of our greatest novels would be banned.

Match this with the controversial topic, and you have a masterpiece that will never disappear from the reading lists of scholars.  Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment  effectively puts the reader in the mind of the troubled Raskolnikov and makes the reader feel compassion for his troubled soul.

Humbert is an excentric middle-aged European emigré to America, who rents an appartment at a boarding house and falls desperately in love with the beautiful daughter of the widow owner. He devises a plot to be able to live close to the object of his obsession, and then Fate makes a trick. This will make Humbert travel around the United States with her, fulfilling his sexual fantasies. No good will come out of this slippery slope, but the plot is not the most important thing about the book.<br />What's remarkable is not that the book tells such perverted facts, but the way in which Nabokov almost convinces the reader that the affair is legitimate and desirable. The reader comes to wish that Humbert gets what he lusts after, even if reason keeps reminding us that something is very wrong in the sexual relations between a grown man and a child. Beyond that, the form of the book -its literature- is the subject. It is a perfect mix of fine irony and infinite and desperate tenderness. The metaphors Nabokov uses are practically insuperable. It is a disconcerting, unforgettable and lovable novel. Every paragraph has an intrinsec beauty to it, that you'll find yourself rereading many of them. It is a book to be rejoiced in, to marvel at the power of words to create, recreate and leave the reader in total awe. All the praise this novel has commanded is justified; all attacks on its subject are unjustified. However distorted and reprehensible, Humbert's love for Lolita is absolut. The narration, in the form of a self-defense addressed to the jury, made me feel so happy about not being part of it: I would have acquitted the defendant, even if I knew he was guilty.

He dubs these youthful temptresses, &quot;nymphets&quot; and uses the term constantly throughout the book.

We get a glimpse inside the psyche of the type of a person society tends to condemn, and we actually can begin to understand it.    <br />Nabokov said that he wrote Lolita as a love story, not as cheap pornography as many people claimed.  His intentions of showing Humbert's extreme frustration come across as clear as crystal.  It certainly seemed that Nabokov was exorcising his own frustrations in the writing of this book.  It would be difficult for me to believe that Nabokov could express such strong emotions using his writing so clearly, without feeling them at one time or another in his life.  Nabokov also intended to show the human being's eternal desire for something that society has told them they can not and should not have.  Symbolic?  The entire novel seems to be.  Of course Vladimir Nabokov says that he detests symbolism.  A very interesting concept in my own opinion.  <br />Nabokov achieves these intentions with Lolita much, much more.  Nabokov brilliantly displays our weakness for temptation and our usually weak methods of justifying giving in to temptation.   Lolita is often funny and always interesting, but at the same time wracked by feelings of disturbing sadness.  Without a shadow of a doubt Lolita excels in nearly every way.

Almost. Humbert Humbert is a slave to his desires, too weak to pull himself away from the actions he then takes that even he realizes are dispicable.

Dolores is psychologically ruined. Humbert was never stable and degenerates quickly. Nabakov does not endorse the morale ambiguity of Humbert Humbert, who knows he is a monster himself.

Of course, she's only twelve, but our intrepid hero plots to marry &amp; murder her mother &amp; so gain access to his &quot;Lolita&quot;.  When an accident removes the mother, Humbert Humbert &amp; Lolita set off cross country on a motel jumping jaunt, until finally Lolita escapes with another pedophile.

Indeed a recent movie version could not find a distributor.  And this is entirely appropriate.  It should be difficult to publish a work about pedophilia.  However, this is undeniably a great work and deserves to be widely read by adults.  Humbert Humbert's obsessive passion may be for young girls but Nabokov's is for the English language.

I expected to be repulsed by this book, and although the topic is very disgusting, the story is told so beautifully, so pure, so heart-wrenchingly sad in some parts and so doubled-over-with-laughter funny in other parts that I couldn´t help but love the book. As the narrator warns in the beginning, &quot;You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.&quot;<br />The story, for those unfamiliar with this classic, is the aging Humbert Humbert´s fanatical obsession with twelve-year-old Delores Haze. The book tells of his pursuit, conquest, and loss of her with perfect emotional and intellectual captivation. Lolita´s character is painted so clearly that I kept thinking I saw her face on the street, that I heard her voice in my head. Nabokov has such a beautiful writing style that the story and its characters were always with me. I finished this book a week ago, and I keep picking it up to reread parts because of his delicious story-telling. I also keep remembering parts of it in my head. <br />Instead of painting the narrator as the ruthless vicious person the reader would expect a pedophile to be, Nabokov has Humbert tell his story as a victim, of someone who is kept away from the love of his life by mean things like laws and ethics. He is also incredibly funny, and in the middle of telling a horrible detail about the characters´ relationship, the author will insert hilarious ramblings like &quot;I don´t care if these verb tenses aren´t right&quot;. <br />This story captivated me, and now I have such an interest in Nabokov that I want to buy all his books and savor them one by one.

Nabokov chose his subject as carefully  as he chose his words, and the primary intrigue of Lolita on a bookshelf or  website is a &quot;road-kill&quot; one - the vague thoughts and comments we  have heard before suddenly come filtering back to this focal point of  controversy, a novel about paeodophilia. One which we cannot help but stare  at; one which I, at least, had hesitations about picking up and  purchasing.<br />But I have a suspicion that as far as the subject itself is  concerned, Nabokov had very little interest beyond the most superficial. He  does not seek to address the ethical questions which raise themselves with  such a topic. Rather, he uses a controversial story as a medium through  which to convey his true purpose - joy in a language not his own, and a  deep love for the complexity of the weak inner person balanced with the  strong outer individual. Whereas most writers use language and character  development as media through which to tell a story, Nabokov works the other  way round.<br />This sense came to me towards the end of the novel. I had  struggled - the writing resembles the progress of a very long river, at  times torrent-like, at times threatening to dry up completely. Similes fly  by at absurd points; short, comprehensible sentences follow impossible and  insane ones, forcing you to keep moving even if you haven't a clue what  happened. It is a mood piece: the novel as a piece of canvas with far too  much information to absorb point for point, step to step.<br />Hence, the  writing is disjointed temporally, with flashbacks interrupting what in  other novels might be called the flow of the story. Brief glimpses of the  contemptible, villainous, valiant protagonist Humbert Humbert mask the true  genius of the writing - that our hero lies (exists...but also deceives?) in  every word. Self-description is deceptive, and yet so masterfully that you  cannot immediately understand the implications of this, even though you  know from the start the narrator's condition and some of his history.<br />For  me, the moment of &quot;realisation&quot; - what was really a combination  of rapture and panic - came with four simple words. A simile, stating that  the sun was &quot;like a burning man&quot;. Until then, I had doubted the  value of the piece, which felt too fragmented...I was struggling to get the  sense of what was happening, and this made me less interested than I was  sure I should have been. And suddenly that phrase - not overly significant  in itself. But, there was such an absurd simplicity, a sheer poetry that  communicated more in four words than four novels could do about the  situation at that moment, the character, psychology of the individual, the  nature of words themselves, language...you get the idea. It froze me, and  in the fashion of the best literature, taught me about myself as a human  being tied inextricably to the mad, bad Humbert Humbert.<br />Allegory is  present throughout this work - but don't waste your time trying to wrench  meaning out of the paedophilia scenario. That is real, and is exactly what  Nabokov meant to write about. Rather, the allegory lies in the words  themselves, in the language, and the character of a disturbing (not least  because he is occasionally disturbingly reassuring) lawless man.<br />And,  Lolita also works as one paradigm for something not yet mentioned, love. It  is a soul-wrenching book, and I recommend it tentatively, for it is not for  all, but with complete satisfaction.ully that you  cannot immediately understand the implications of this, even though you  know from the start the narrator's condition and some of his history.<br />For  me, the moment of &quot;realisation&quot; - what was really a combination  of rapture and panic - came with four simple words.

This is the only thing by Nabokov I  have ever read (but will not be the last unless I die suddenly in the next  few days) and his prose is extraordinary.  It's direct, biting, and yet as  lyrical as poetry.  This is a book that can be read many times without loss  of richness.  <br />The content of this book is notorious.  It is also very  touching.  It's a perfect tragedy.  Now then.  Lolita is far from being a  sugary sweet angel.  She has had sex before, she is manipulative,  self-contained, seductive, crass...but  so clearly through the voice of  Humbert (the older man) you can see how young she is, how horribly abused,  and how he is slowly destroying her.<br />Why would anybody ever want to read  such a thing?  For two reasons (in my opinion).  Firstly, as I mentioned  above, because Nabokov is a great artist.  Very few books I have read come  close to his craftsmanship in terms of stringing words together.<br />Secondly  because abuse happens.  People will gain control over others and then not  act in their best interests.  It happens, it can be horrible, and so it  makes sense to examine it as part of the human condition.  On the cover of  this paperback edition, Vanity Fair claims it is &quot;the greatest love  story of all time&quot;, which seems a little weird, given that this  &quot;love&quot; is completely one-sided and involves assaulting, trapping,  manipulating and destroying a young girl. <br />But don't get the wrong  impression.

I do not recommend attempting to read this book using a dictionary, as many of the expressions used are slang. In addition to using French expressions, Nabokov also employs words that are, for all intents and purposes, dead; alludes to obscure (and not-so-obscure, but one won't need help with the latter) literary works; and invents books and expressions. <br />A good example of this can be found very early in the book, when Nabokov mentions a book entitled \\""La Beaute Humaine,\\"" by Pichon. Clearly, even if one doesn't speak french, one can assume that \\""La Beaute Humaine\\"" means something to the effect of \\""The Human Beauty.\\"" This assumption is correct. The annotation, however, reveals that this book is a joke, of sorts. Nabokov invented this volume, and the author's name, \\""Pichon,\\"" is a play on the French word for breast, \\""Nichon.\\""<br />Such obscure wordplay occurs throughout the book, and is quite satisfying and often funny on the rare occasion that one \\""gets the joke.\\""  While the annotated version is helpful -- and at times invaluable for such references -- it also reveals key plot details, a significant caveat.",2000-08-03

But Humbert is the narrator giving his side from his  mentally sick point of view. Being only slightly familiar with the story, i  was aware that Lolita did flirt with Humbert and give in to his desires,  but until i read the book, i did not know that Lolita allowed herself to  show some fragility.

He is<br />the Victorian author whose novel began &quot;It was a dark and stormy<br />night...&quot;, a beginning that has become a byword for bad, overdone<br />writing, to the point that Scott Rice of San Jose State University<br />holds an annual contest to see who can intentionally write the most<br />Bulwer-Lyttonesque opening sentence, the opening to the worst of all<br />possible novels.

Finally, the sensualist in me (a great and insane monster)<br />had no objection to some depravity in his prey.  But somewhere behind<br />the raging bliss, bewildered shadows conferred -- and not to have<br />heeded them, this is what I regret! Human beings, attend! I should<br />have understood that Lolita had ALREADY proved to be something quite<br />different from innocent Annabel, and that the nymphean evil breathing<br />through every pore of the fey child that I had prepared for my secret<br />delectation, would make the secrecy impossible, and the delectation<br />lethal.<br />As I say, these are simply passages taken almost at random:<br />open to a random page, and look for a suitably overblown descripion<br />nestled in a suitably complex sentence.

That is all.\\"" --Oscar Wilde<br />Often banned by those who consider it \\""immoral,\\"" LOLITA is far better than just \\""well  written.\\""  Stylistically, there are few novels in English that match  Nabokov's masterpiece for the seriously playful love and use of language.   And English was at least Nabokov's third tongue!  LOLITA is neither a moral  nor an immoral book.  It is brilliantly written.  But Wilde was slightly  off: that is NOT all.<br />French academic Humbert Humbert comes to America to  renew his life after stagnation and divorce in Paris.  He soon meets the  12-year-old Dolores Haze.  Lolita.  She who reminds him so powerfully of  the young Annabel he so innocently fell in love with on the Riviera when he  was thirteen.  The trouble is, Humbert was thirteen twenty-five years  before and he wants to love Dolores as if he were thirteen again.  It's  just not so innocent this time around, and the fact that he knows this does  not stop him.<br />That LOLITA is a love story cannot be convincingly denied  any more than that it is a twisted tale of illicit, deranged  obsession--novels, like life, often revel in ambiguity.  Nabokov encourages  these multiple shades of gray by employing one of the most enchanting yet  unreliable narrators I've ever encountered.  We see not only his obsessive,  unheathily insatiable lust for the young girl, but also what life with him  does to her: how she cries at night despite her brave front during the day,  how she learns to manipulate him, how she grows to hate him.  How much of  what Humbert says can really be believed?  Trying to figure that out is  part of the enjoyment.<br />The whole book is a story of decadence and  decline, of the beautiful ugliness of corruption.  LOLITA is an aesthetic  dream gone horribly wrong under the bright hot sun of the highways of  middle America.  It is also a treasure of twentieth century literature, a  work of genius in how it persuades us, from time to time, to sympathize  with its charming yet ruthless villain.  But to say that Nabokov endorses  pedophilia would be like saying that Sophocles endorses patricide and  sleeping with one's mother because he wrote OEDIPUS REX.

Like Joyce's Ulysses it is a tour de force of language seldom encountered in English outside the works of Shakespeare.  It is a carefully crafted novel rich in irony and atmosphere, a novel of great psychological insight and poignancy, a novel to rival the masters of the nineteenth century and those of the twenty-first.  Some have called it \\""The Great American Novel,\\"" that mythical tome of authorial genius that everybody was trying to write after the second world war, and the best novel about America ever penned.  Certainly Lolita can feel comfortable alongside The Scarlet Letter, Huck Finn, Moby Dick and a few others as a top drawer classic of American literature.<br />Of course what sets Lolita apart from other novels, at least at the time of its publication in the fifties, is its theme.  A grown man making love to a pre-adolescent girl was quite a shock for a prudish America weaned on Ozzie and Harriet and Dwight Eisenhower.  As such it was a courageous novel and a bit of a daring-do.  It was the novel of a man ravenous for the fame and fortune he thought his talent so richly deserved, and so he took a chance.<br />Originally Nabokov had intended to withhold his name from the title page while dispersing throughout the narrative cryptic evidences of his presence, should he later want to claim authorship; but somehow, even before the novel's first publication in France, he was persuaded to admit paternity.  Even so he remained uneasy about Lolita throughout most of his life, maintaining that other, less appreciated works of his were superior, especially Ada and Pnin, while insisting that Humbert Humbert, his nymphet-enchanted antihero, was no part of himself, merely a puppet on the master's string.  After the rush of fame had subsided and he was comfortably ensconced en chateau with his fortune, Nabokov even grew weary of the attention Lolita commanded from critics and public alike, attention he saw as detrimental to his scholarly work, his autobiography (the splendid Speak, Memory) and his other works of fiction.  I wouldn't be at all surprised to learn that more than once he spoke aloud the ancient warning and lamentation: \\""Beware of what you wish for.  You may get it.\\""<br />Still, one can survive such annoyances, and nowhere in Nabokov's life was he seen as more than slightly troubled by the very real belief that such a penetrating revelation of character (Humbert's) could only be achieved by having part of that character as one's own.  This he denied to his dying day-as well he might and should.  The \\""biographical fallacy\\"" has a place in literary criticism, perhaps, but not here.  His denial, while politically correct, was unnecessary since girls are desirable, and one can feel that desire without being a lecher.  What is needed is the understanding, as with avocados and the rising of the sun, that there is a time appropriate to every purpose.<br />While reading Lolita for the first time, as with any rich piece of literature, you do yourself a favor and don't try to catch all the subtleties.  Just read it through.  Those familiar with Nabokov know full well that he plays games with the reader just as he does with his characters.  He likes to show off, and besides few of us are as erudite as the very learned professor himself.  You might want to take a note or two to record how you feel about Humbert and his little charge, and then compare those notes to how you feel after a second reading.  Like others, I found myself moved from the amusement and tolerance of a first reading to a fully sober appreciation, after a second reading, of what a \\""brute\\"" (Lo's fair description) Humbert Humbert really is.  It is a curious coincidence perhaps, but this is exactly what happened with the cinematic interpretations of the novel.  The first, by Kubrick from the sixties, is a brilliant comedy that has us identifying with the tragedy of Hum's obsession, while the second, Adrian Lyne's more graphic recent production, makes it clear how violated and used and ultimately destroyed Lolita really was.<br />If you're writing a paper, buy the annotated Lolita with notes by Alfred Appel Jr.  Although the annotations add only a little to an enjoyment of the novel, and in some cases seem a bit of a pedantic stretch, they will satisfy a scholastic urge.

Like a rock star, his only problem is how to escape them as they make their advances to him.  But he doesn't even  like women.  Only one thing turns him on - a thin, cute little girl,  perhaps as old as fourteen or as young as nine.  He calls these little  girls &quot;nymphets&quot; and he obsesses on them.  Yes, little girls are  cute and sometimes precocious.  Juliet was twelve.  It's so easy to just  revert to name-calling, call Humbert a pervert.  Oh no, he's nothing like  the rest of us, he's a perv.  Well, he's something like the rest of us, but  he takes it way too far, and in our rush to distance ourselves from the  sexual practices of the ancients, the pre-Christian ancients, we have to  pretend that the Juliets of the world aren't sexy.  But they are, there are  some very sexy 12 and 13 year olds, and Mr Humbert is just in the wrong  place at the wrong time, a time and place that vilifies him.  Not that he's  any great shakes himself.  He knows that his little Juliet is bothered by  his advances but he can't help himself.  The poor creature is desperately  both in love and in lust with his Dolores Haze, his Lolita.  And in his  case, lust definitely wins out when it can, when her body is so close.  I  feel sorry for Mr Humbert, not because he is mentally ill.  I don't think  he is, though the author tells us he is.  I'm a lot more charitable to Mr  Humbert than he or his author are.  I feel sorry for him because he is so  desperately in love with a girl who doesn't love him back, and because he  loses his love.  The tragedy is that she is not the one for him, she is  repelled and disgusted and depressed by him, and she's just too damn young  for him.  But the poor man loves her to distraction.  The story line is  compelling, even moreso when Lolita finds herself attracted to a different  older man.  So - with our same young Lolita now in love with aman as old  as Mr Humbert, age suddenly takes itself out of the equation (though the  author tells us that Humbert destroyed Lolita, which I don't buy).  Lolita  just isn't into poor Hum.  She wants to be the one who loves, not the one  who is loved, so she can't respond to a man who desperately loves her.  Hum  played his cards wrong with this girl.  He should have played hard to get.   Let her continue to be the one making the advances, as she started out  doing, and keep her on a string.  He shouldn't have made any sexual  advances to her.  She wasn't ready for that.  He should have just let her  lead, sometimes allowing her to do what she wanted, sometimes not.  I think  in this way, sooner or later he would have had her for life, perhaps when  she hit her later teens.  It reminds me of what Proust says about love  being kindled by pain, and of the Proust characters who are afraid to show  their loved ones how much they care.  Not sorry to be so politically  incorrect on this book.  I'm not gonna line up with the rest of the rock  throwers taking aim at a pervert.  I just feel sorry for the poor man.  And  no, I don't feel sorry for some sleezeball who rapes little girls.  Mr  Humbert isn't that.  He is Romeo, only older, and doesn't know how to win  his particular Juliet, though his rival sure knows how.  Another case of a  young girl failing to appreciate the man who loves her, and instead falling  for a guy who doesn't really care and just wants to play.

It's incredible to me that Nabokov's breadth of vocabulary was this  wide, this complex, this difficult.  These are SAT words on steroids.   Here's a sample: meretricious, pharisaic, prehensile, purlieus,  valetudinarian.  If you didn't have to consult Daniel Webster's bestseller  for the meaning of those words, well, I'd probably call you a liar.  Just  think that English was not this man's first language!

(It was the rebellious thing  to do back then in my circle of friends; a few years later, the clandestine  read was Peyton Place which paled in comparison.) I make it a point to get  back in touch with my adolescent feelings as an American girl growing up in  the 50's by picking up Lolita again every five or ten years for a fresh  re-read.<br />As one matures, one's perception of this novel also matures.   The poignant irony of its language continues to be Lolita's enduring best  quality. I never had much sympathy for Humbert and, even as a teenager  reading Lolita, I could recognize that he made too many apologies for  himself.  But presenting the story from Humbert's self-serving viewpoint  was Nabokov's peculiarly brilliant means by which a straight, non-perverted  reader is taken to secret places she/he might otherwise dare not go.<br />In  those simpler times - the 1950's - in which the story takes place and when  this novel first appeared in the English language, Nabokov gave us  archetypal characters that mirrored the secrets of 1950's American society.   Humbert, suave monster that he is, could have been the man next door or  sitting on the park bench across from my school back then.  Charlotte, the  lonely lady putting up with an adolescent daughter who was fast becoming  her rival even before Humbert came along, was struggling with a single  parent and her place in '50's society as a woman.  Lolita, the obnoxious  little girl who's 11 going on 18, then 14 going on 24, as much loses her  childhood (innocence) to what money can buy (the symbolism behind the  pair's car travels from motel to motel across America) as she does to  Humbert's disgusting obsession.<br />Flaws of this novel: Quilty's  contribution as a character is wasted, even irrelevant.  As another  reviewer pointed out, the ending is weak, even anti-climactical.  These are  the novel's flaws. But they are so few.<br />I recommend Lolita to the reader  who first loves words and, secondly, to the reader who read between the  words.  Lolita has within it at least the following emotions and  experiences to be discerned:  sense of irony, pathos, illicit pleasure,  poignancy, dismay, outrage, humor, dark comedy, sadness, superficiality,  loneliness, loss of innocence, and loss of what-might-have-been.

I do think the book was poetic, and some of the descriptions were quite beautiful and memorable.  However, I'll admit I was bored by some of the travel scenes.<br />I was surprised to find that people  found it &quot;hysterical&quot;.  I suppose I thought it was witty in a few  instances, but not even &quot;funny&quot;.  <br />I enjoyed the idea of the  &quot;unreliable narrator&quot;.

As a  detective, I enjoyed picking apart his madness.<br />But what pushed me to  write this review was my amazement that anyone could call this a love  story!  Certainly the relationship was horribly one-sided, Lo had no love  for HH.  And I strongly believe he did not love Lo.  The obvious being that  he is a kidnapping pedophile, aroused by all nymphets.  But beyond his  glaring sickness, he didn't even KNOW Dolores (I don't think that any of us  did).  Near the end, he overhears Lo talking to a friend, making an  intellecutal comment on death, and realizes he knows nothing of her.

Of a tragically  &quot;romantic&quot; and disturbing nature, &lt;Lolita&gt; captures the  essence of perversion and obsession through the story of Humbert Humbert  and his pre-teen nymph Dolores Haze, aka Lolita.  The nature and  consequence of Humbert's doomed passion is not meant to be judged; as a  lost European romanticist, Humbert comes to encompass the fading European  sensuality as he attempts to grasp his own lost innocence.  His troubled  adulthood is, according to Freud, the distorted extension of a nightmare  never fully awaken from.  After the failed romance in his childhood,  Humbert grows into a tattered frame looking for protection in a daughter  figure--Lolita.  The true disturbing aspect of this masterpiece is the  concept of &quot;double seducer&quot;.  Instead of presenting the mere form  of child molesting, Nabakov further highlights the darkness of obsession  and perversion by having Humbert seduced by a blossoming American girl  eager to weave her net of \\""amor\\"".  The combination of Europe's weakening  sensuality and America's burgeoning sexuality proves to be deadly as  Humbert marries Lolita's mother in vain.    What exactly make a nymph?  <br />\\""Slightly feline outline of a cheekbone, the slenderness of a downy  limb, and other indices with despair and shame and tears of tenderness  forbid me to tabulate-the little deadly demon among the wholesome children;  she stands unrecognized by them and unconscious herself of her fantastic  power\\"" <br />Lolita is not a mere juvenile character; the darkness of her  soul, unclouded by Humbert's blind passion is of such shattering force that  she transforms from the offended to the offender, the tormented to the  tormentor.  When I mentioned howHumbert was seeking a daughter-figure to  assuage his anguish and incomplete development, Lolita is at the same  finding the father figure in her \\""lover\\"".  Nabakov may not have intended a  propaganda message through his bewitching prose, yet lurking hideously  between the lines is the truth about children's seemingly untainted hearts.   Oh no, no one is born free of sin, it takes only a spark to unleash the  demonic nymph who is made to woo, to be wooed, to destroy, and to be  destroyed.  Humbert on the other hand, is far more than a mere spark; he  sought the undying flame of beauty.  Truly, unlike common criminals who  consciously shatter the bounds of law and order, Humbert commits  &quot;crime&quot; to attain beauty in a very ignorant yet sincere fashion  that the disturbing way he accomplishes his goal appears pitiful.<br />If  there were a boundary to love, would it have been drawn far far away from  where Humbert and Lolita lay?  Although the brutality of Humbert's passion  eventually drives Lolita into the arms of another man, and consequently a  different hell of ignorance and of pain, their story might as well been  labeled as a surreptitious romance about a man and a woman finding SELF in  each other, except the man is a middle-aged European and the woman a  teenage American.  Many argue that &lt;Lolita&gt; is a work of mere mental  games and psychic labyrinth with an added advertisement for the American  highway system, depended on which Humbert and his child-love traverse the  entire country in order to escape and to embrace \\""beauty\\"".  But what  Nabakov intended was an art piece, destined to dazzle and to puzzle the  world with its bold exploration into some forbidden corner of the heart,  and Hummy and Lo no larger than two mere figureheads made to laugh away  down the highway of immoral passion.  \\""The hell with morals,\\"" they sing.",2000-03-22

Vladmir Nabokov has style like none other in literature history and I am in complete awe of the fact his first language is Russian and he wrote this book in a foreign language  (English).  The depth of Humbert Humbert's (the main character and some  believe his name suggest the book was meant to be funny) adoration for the  &quot;nymphet&quot; (Vladmir studied butterfly's which explains his choice  of a word to call young children - is it possible Nabokov is living through  Humbert?) Lolita is fascinating yet deeply disturbing because society  teaches us not to have sympathy for men in their 30's who have a strong  affinity for young children.  Some of the language that Nabokov uses to  convey Humbert's obsession for Lolita is almost hilariouse because this  love struck man is battling with innate (or perhaps is it because of his  prior experience with Annabell?) emotions that are considered plain  disgusting by our civilized world. This book is full of description and  poetry which is beautiful at the very least.  I'm sure you're wondering why  I didn't give this book five stars and will probably be surprised to know I  was close to giving it only three instead of four.  Let's look beyond  Vladmir's way of sculpting words like the finest potters sculpt clay -  let's look at this from little Lo's (Humbert's nick-name for Lolita)  perspective.  Lolita loses her mother who isn't much of a care-giver to  begin with.  She's left with this strange man (Humbert) who only marries  her mother to get to Lolita in the first place.  The two go on a road trip  where he sleep with this 12 yr. old child (Humbert claims Lolita seduced  him and she was not a virgin to begin with - which eats on his credibablity  as a narrator considering this is a first ppv novel).  One warning to some  of you who might be reading this - Naokov preserves the purness of Humberts  love for Lo by never going into scenes where Humbert sleeps with Lolita or  any vulgarness of that sort (One redeeming factor for Nabokov) this has  often been the basis for calling &quot;Lolita&quot; a classic.  Anyway, I  feel so terrible for Lolita and I began to despise this disgusting and  terrible man the more I thought about poor Lo. This book is the marvelously  written yet I can't condone Humbert.  Read it for the experience but don't  let Humbert put you so deeply under his spell that you can't see the  reality of his actions.  ~15 yrs. (10th grade)",2000-03-13

I was familiar with  Kubrick's work- Dr. Strangelove, Clockwork Orange, of course, Full Metal  Jacket, and The Shining. More of his recent work. Well, Dad's an English  and Lit. major and he told me about one of Kubrick's earlier films entitled  Lolita. He said it was about a middle aged man who's pathetically  infatuated with a young 12 year old girl. Pedaphilia. Very Kubrick, I had  thought. But what had interested me most was that the novel upon which the  movie was based on, written by Vladimir Nabokov had ranked so high among  the top 100 novels of the 20th Century. That was what engaged me into  interest with the book. It's written so poetically, with such fervor that  you tend to believe that Mr. Nabokov does in fact have Humbert's tendencies  and mannerisms. The novel is quite funny, too. The scenes where Humbert  Humbert contemplates a way to get Clarlotte Haze out of the picture are  brilliant. The sex in the novel is unrestricted and even shocking if you  (and you won't be able to help doing it) really visualize it. The dialogue  between Humbert and Lolita is brilliant as are the moments when the  shadowed Clare Quilty presents himself.<br />So it's smut, huh? Well, I  wouldn't call it smut. Not at all. Believe it or not, this novel is a 100  percent love story. The old saying: &quot;True love never dies&quot;, which  I never really acknowledge. Humbert Humbert's desire for her was a result  of the permanent damage caused from losing someone he had cherished in the  past. Losing her, her youthful beauty, plummeted him into such a state of  grief that he could only find escape with another &quot;nymphet&quot;, as  young as she may be, who could capture the image, that subconscious or  maybe strongly conscious image that he adored. And though most can't relate  toHumbert Humbert's odd infatuation, many can relate to his ability to  feel passion for somebody. He is your average Romeo, ready to die or kill  for his love.

Just like when Humbert tells you that he was  seduced by Lolita, giving you the impression that she was sexually mature  and a willing partner. Contrast that with his throwaway mentioning of her  &quot;performing&quot; for him in exchange for treats, and watching  television as he took his pleasure in her.

It's difficult to imagine Nabokov writing anything of poor quality. His prose has a natural flow and an effortless sophistication that I have never seen in any other writer of  the English language. He writes with grace and maturity that lend his prose  a certain amount of authority. Once can hardly question the master, and  this may be why I was seduced by &quot;Lolita&quot; the first time I read  it.<br />During the first reading, I was swept away by the caricature of  Humbert Humbert. His old world manner, his cool, self-justifying narrative,  and his academic contempt for trendy concepts such as Freudian Psychology  and Existentialism were humorous and refreshing. I was seduced by the  characterization and language in the novel and hardly thought of it in  realistic terms. This perspective was only reinforced by seeing the  original film with Peter Sellers and James Mason. Like my first reading of  the novel, the film had a gentle and irresistible current of humor that  made it difficult to imagine the events actually occurring in the lives of  real people.<br />The second time I read &quot;Lolita&quot; I had a far more  troubling experience. I still enjoyed the novel's writing and  characterization, but this time it struck me on a realistic level. I found  myself empathizing with Lolita and imagining what the world must be like  from her perspective as she traveled around the country in the company of   a foster parent who habitually molested her. I was especially stunned by  the scene in which Humbert first informs her that she cannot leave him and  return to her mother because her mother is dead. Lolita storms out of the  room but eventually returns to Humbert's bed and tearfully wraps her arms  around him. When she does this, Humbert chillingly informs the reader that  she simply had nowhere else to go. In that moment, I was suddenly immune to  the charm of Humbert's narrative and enormously sad for  Lolita.<br />Coincidentally, just after my second reading of Lolita, I saw the  film with Jeremy Irons. Unlike the earlier version, the film treated the  story in a blunt and realistic manner. The humorous characters and witty  dialogs were overshadowed by a constant coldness and brutality throughout  the film.<br />&quot;Lolita&quot; is a great novel, but we should be wary of  how and why we appreciate it. Some readers and critics view Lolita as a  tragic love story while others consider it a celebration of the open road.  Some even argue that &quot;Lolita&quot; is a  metaphor for the clash  between European and American culture. &quot;Lolita&quot; may well be all  these things and more, but it is also a much darker chronicle of the  tormentor's mindset. Humbert's narrative is charming and full of old world  conceit, but it is also a tool of disguise. Humbert self-consciously uses  style to conceal the naked brutality of his craving and the harm it causes  Lolita. He disguises himself as the doomed lover and portrays her as the  tormenting muse. <br />We should praise Nabokov for this clever role reversal.  It is a wonderful mechanism for employing style in an imaginative manner as  Humbert alerts us in his opening monologue (&quot;Can you stand my  style!&quot;). But while we can admire Nabokov's skill and imagination, we  should not take Humbert at his word for who and what he is.",2000-01-21

Nabokov  being  Nabokov, my moments of realization were subtle. For example, during the  terrible bedroom scene in which Humbert informs Lolita that her mother can  not come to her rescue because she is dead, Lolita storms away in grief and  despair. But eventually she returns to Humbert's bed and Humbert informs us  that &quot;you see, she had no place else to go.&quot; What chilling words.  During the second reading they froze me in my seat. How many kidnappers and  child molesters have   thrived on such a revelation? <br />Humbert is part  European caricature, part monster, and yet he has many touches of a real  human being. At one point he observes Lolita to her friend and inquiring  about one of life's mysteries. After hearing her question, Humbert realizes  far from merely being his &quot;nymphette&quot; and object of his desires,  Lolita is a real human being with her own thoughts and feelings. It is a  sad and fascinating revelation for Humbert, who of course fails to act on  it in a salutary fashion.<br />Whether we like it or not, &quot;Lolita&quot;  is a love story albeit not a very wholesome one. Humbert says he loves  Lolita, and certainly devotes his life to her in more ways than your  average middle class husband. But in many ways, Humbert's behaviorresembles a compulsive sexual addiction more than love. It is Humbert's  recounting of events more than his behavior that makes this a love  story.<br />People have speculated about possible relationship between the  doomed protagonist and his creator. Certainly some of the events in  &quot;Lolita&quot; are drawn from real life. The story of Humbert's first  love, Anabell closely parallels Nabokov's description in &quot;Speak  Memory&quot; of a girl he met during a youthful trip to the South of  France. Although writers frequently cull material from real life  experiences, there is no evidence that Humbert resembles Nabokov in any  fashion.<br />Critics have also attempted to read &quot;Lolita&quot; on a  metaphorical level by claiming that it is really a book about the author's  love affair with America. Somehow I just don't buy it. For one thing, the  description and characterization of the American people and landscape is  hardly flattering in &quot;Lolita&quot;.  And though, I may be wrong, I  believe Nabokov's strentgh lies in his literal conveyance of mood,  character, and the immediate surroundings, not in symbolic writing.<br />It is  ironic that Nabokov detested Freudian psychoanalytic theory and yet was a  gifted psychologist himself. You can not read &quot;Lolita&quot; without  being impressed by Nabokov's lucid and accurate characterization of people.  With the possible exception of Quilty, his characters are extremely  realistic. This is particularly disturbing in Humbert's case because the  reader experiences him on two levels. On the one hand, Humbert is the  pervert and child molester that most people fear and detest. On the other  hand, his mania and craving probably strike a chord in most of  us.<br />Nabokov's use of language is fluid and complex. In the opening  narrative, Humbert introduces himself to the reader in a convluted, verbose  fashion. But before we can get use to his endless sentences, and limitless  vocabulary, Humbert stops himself by saying, &quot;can you stand my  style?&quot;. Nabokov is telling us, &quot;look, this guy is such a  caracature  that even HE knows it.&quot; In fact, Nabokov reveals the many  facets of Humbert's character (maniac, pervert, jilted lover, etc) through  dialog, description, and poetry. It is a very complex task that would fail  in the hands of a less able writer. Nabokov accomplishes it with amazing  ease.<br />Speaking briefly of the two Lolita films, I loved the earlier  version with Peter Sellers and James Mason and found the later one with  Jeremy Irons extremely disturbing. The early film version, like my first  reading of Lolita captures the superfluous and futile quality of Humbert's  character. It also downplays the sexual aspect of the story completely. The  latter film version, like my second reading of the book focuses almost  exclusively on the criminal and horrible aspects of the story. In many  ways, the film is well done, but is also a gratuitous  interpretation.<br />Although in many ways I don't like &quot;Lolita&quot; and  certainly don't think it is one of Nabokov's best works, I highly recommend  it. Nobokov's prose and particularly his dialogs are superb. The  characterization, irony and psychology of the book are probably among the  best ever written.",2000-01-11

To the comment below by the 17 year old from England, I'd like to  add that Nabokov did not seem to be saying in any way that there's nothing  wrong for a Humbert Humbert to love a 14 year old nymphet.  If anything, he  said too well that it WAS wrong.  Even Humbert thinks so at the end.   Humbert's logic in the beginning about the historical nature of such  relationships is rationalization, not reason.  The tragedy is that Humbert,  who loved her so much, did not bring her happiness.  Instead, he stole her  childhood and her life was ruined.  Is that how love should be?<br />Anyway,  this is a book that made me love literature a little more.

Morals dim, taboos are loosened, but it seems unlikely that this fictional memoir of a pedophile and  murderer will ever be 'acceptable' as Joyce and Miller have come to be. But  don't let that keep you away from this novel, unless you're easily offended  by the subject. Even then, you might want to give it a try.<br />It's not a  work of pornography,nor a straight confessional work. It is a rhapsody in  an adopted language; it is an ode to strange, impossible, even disgusting  love; it is the greatest tour-de-force any writer since James Joyce has  ever pulled off. The text is lovingly, obsessively, horrifically written as  a morass of details and metaphors sinking toward a great forbidden subject;  the subject is a pre-adolescent 'nymphet,' the hero is insane and twisted,  as well as the only real, likable person in the book.<br />Nabokov's narrator,  Humbert Humbert, is a sardonic, cool European (exact origin unknown) who  comes to postwar America in the late 1940s, having grown weary of the Old  World with its anachronistic, worn-out ways, and sad associations with his  past. In particular, there was a girl he knew, a beautiful young nymphet  called Annabel, that he met and fell in love with as an adolescent. She was  dead a few months later, and she stayed there in Humbert's mind - he spent  the rest of his life searching for her, obsessing over her, despairing that  he could never have her. Then he spots Dolores Haze, 11 years old, called  'Lolita,' sunning herself as she bops to the radio on the lawn - the  typical American girl. She's shallow, whiny and self-absorbed. And, as  Humbert sees it, the reincarnation of his lost Lenore - er, Annabel.<br />So  we follow Humbert as his passion, and his madness, consumes him: he marries  Lolita's obnoxious mother to be near her, hoping against all reason for a  chance to seduce her, and after a fortuitousaccident rids him of Charlotte  Haze, he takes Lolita off on an endless ride across the American landscape,  after she unexpectedly seduces him in a hotel. It's no wild and boisterous  Kerouacian road trip; Humbert vividly describes the tedium and ordinariness  of American road life - highways, hotels, and hot weather. Then boredom  turns to paranoia as Lolita grows weary of his company, and he begins to  feel a dark shadow tracing his every step. He knows there is someone  following him, very much like him, and desiring Lolita as he did before he  had her. By the time his pursuer spirits the willing Lolita away from her  hospital bed after she is separated from Humbert's side by a brief malady,  he seems almost to have accepted that it will happen, and that he has lost  her forever - but he never stops trying to get her back, pursuing his  invisible quarry for months, taunted by his evil double's punning false  names left in hotel registers. Years later, he finally gets his revenge:  not on Lolita, who ends up in a pretty sad position, but on her 'kidnapper'  and his mortal opponent, the mysterious Clair Quilty. As he awaits trial in  prison, he writes his memoirs, believing that somehow he can make sense of  his story only by telling it to others, that they may understand how  hypnotized and tortured he was by his 'victim,' and not the other way  round.<br />Nabokov clearly wasn't out to make us sympathize with the desires  and motives of a pedophile; indeed, he wants us to feel revulsion at HH's  thoughts, however beautifully expressed they are. It sets us up for some  dazzling irony: Humbert is both a sympathetic outcast and a menacing  predator; almost every other character is portrayed in such a way that he  looks attractive and charming by comparison. That is not only the way  Humbert sees himself, but the way others see him: as the fictional 'editor'  of the novel writes in the introduction, his very charm and wit make us  uneasy: this is the disguise of a monster whose real-life counterparts  could be, and are, all around us. <br />Lolita is great literature; it is  heartbreaking drama, not because of what happens, but how it happens, and  how we are told about it. It is a masterpiece of melancholy; it is evil  incarnate. It is, it is.",1999-04-09

You cannot but respect this  novel for the genius it so modestly and humbly, Humbertly offers......  (Yes, modesty is an undeniable quality of Nabakov's character, Humbert).<br />      With Humbert as his voicebox, the author delves into the depths of  human emotions impossible for the culturally confined member of the world  fraterntity to fully feel, never mind express.  It requires the shattered  vision of a &quot;psychopath&quot; to follow-through and wholly surrender  to his desire, plausibly at its core the desire of Everyman.<br />     Lolita  is a vehicle, like the pages of the book itself, through which a man of  superior learning and refined sensibilities fulfills the only duty any  human ever really owes himself: to be faithful to the force that keeps us  all alive.  The objective source of motivation is irrelevant, although  Nabakov has tricked us into assuming otherwise by choosing the most  universally offensive sin known to man:  as Lo so bluntly says, &quot;The  word is incest.&quot;  Don't you see, that this is only to underscore the  central study of bare-boned raw craving, the light of our souls, the spirit  that mysteriously brings us to consciousness in the morning, in fact  manages to get us out of bed--in other words, what no one can live without.  Of course not; it is doubtful that Humbert did either.<br />     The source is  different for almost everyone, but I believe that whatever it is for you,  your feeling for it can be none other than love.  Love, that wonderful and  terrible state of moment which forever eludes definition.  Well, Nabakov  gives an outstanding effort.  Perhaps its only flaw, and it an unavoidable  one I'm afraid, is that his work is not more easily understood.<br />     My  love, you might say, is for the occasional cerebral caress,and this book  could continue to offer that at least twelve readings over.

Yes, he is ignoble, a monster, and all other horrible things that should be jailed, put away, and never allowed to see the light of day.<br />But those  who read this novel without finding the love story contained within have  allowed themselves to entirely miss the point. And so have those who claim  it to be \\""dirty\\"" or \\""exploitave\\"" of children should read the book PERIOD.  And those who feel this novel is misogynistic are conveniently forgetting  that H. H. is contemptuous of ALL of the characters within, including  himself and his relations, regardless of race, creed, OR GENDER. Oh, of  course, he dwells on certain women, but that's because the people he spends  the most time with in this novel ARE women. And he certainly dedicates  quite a bit of time to denigrating Quilty; let us not forget that!<br />We  must first also realize that Lolita is not only about a middle-aged man's  decidedly unhealthy obsession with a teenaged girl. Lolita is also the tale  of two (stylized and heavily stereotyped, of course) civilizations  colliding, the \\""hypercivilized\\"" Europe and the \\""barbaric\\"" America  (postwar). It is also a fable about the conflict between the overly  analytical mind and the entirely emotional one (people who have studied  psychology can probably elucidate on this better than I can). It is a  satire on Freudian psychoanalysis. Finally, it is the result of one man's  remarkable love for a language, which I think that no one can refute, no  matter how appalled they are at the novel's content.<br />Where is the love in  the midst of all this horror, you ask? Perhaps those who cannot find it  have never experienced the terrible things that people do in spite of and  BECAUSE of the strength of their love. Humbert's sexual addiction to  Delores Haze is nothing less than an animalistic need to possess the object  of his obsession in the most obvious way. Humbert's patient attempts to  foster his captive's skills (whether they be tennis, literature, etc.)  reveals a desire to cultivate, as you will, what he sees as a supremely  fertile field.<br />And the sadism, I feel, was introduced for numerous  reasons. Of course, it was to show just how horrible a person can by taking  pleasure in the pain of another. But Nabokov also relayed the agony that  Humbert experienced while BEING sadistic, while hurting the one thing that  mattered most to him. Another significant, albeit rather twist, sign of  love.<br />Of course Dolores' thoughts and feelings matter to Humbert, but one  must remember that he is bent on possessing her. Therefore, her opinions on  life and the world at large matter not a whit to him; he is only interested  in what she thinks of him, but he is also able to ignore that part of her  because of he is battling to possess the rest of her, and because of his  \\""obvious\\"" superiority to her, being a cultivated and educated adult  European and all.<br />And of course, the most obvious overture made to Venus  within this novel is the transference of Humbert's life (i.e., his assets)  to Dolores. Of course, he could have blackmailed her, tried to buy her  favors, kidnapped her for a second time, etc. But no, he cedes over all  that is his to her and leaves. Granted, it is a small reparation, but it is  all he can do by that point. It is the closest he can come to giving her  back the life that he stole (her own, not Charlotte's) away and casually  tore apart, and it is his attempt at absolution, not only for himself, but  for her sake (read the last few paragraphs if you're shaking your head). It  is this action that thinly separates H. H. from the everyday male monsters  within our society.<br />Of course, I've focused on defending the love story  within from H. H.'s point of view, since there is none from the character  of Dolores. I will not go into Dolores' blatantly whorelike nature, which  granted, was partially due to H. H.'s influence, but was clearly present  BEFORE any contact was made between them. I will skip over (because of  space) Charlotte's utter disregard and contempt for her own  daughter<br />What's the upshot of all this? Well, first of all, I would like  to make a few admissions. Yes, I am male. No, I am no professor of English,  of literature, or of anything. But I do love the English language, I do  love wonderful writing, I abhor H. H., and I find his actions within  repulsive, horrifying, and warranting the harshest punishment available. I  think spouse abusers should be beaten to a pulp and that rapists should be  castrated. I don't think this is an appropriate book for most children and  some adults.<br />And I am certainly no pedophile.<br />The upshot is that I  firmly believe that Lolita is one of the finest and horrifying novels in  the English language. And I, for one, feel that it is clearly a love story.

Understanding what is happening requires thought because the horror of it  is buried so far beneath the surface of Humbert's story; enjoying the  language is extremely pleasurable.  Lolita is in no way black-and-white;  and it can be enjoyed on many levels.  I love Lolita; it's one of the best  books I have ever read.  If you agree, try Ada next!",1998-10-04

There is  not love anywhere in this story! Who loves who? Lolita never loves HH; he  never loves her (or why would he get off listening to her whimper at  night?) I avoided Lolita for years because I THOUGHT i knew the story, from  references in print and Police songs. The real love between an aging man  and a 14 year old ahead of her age. Boy, was that wrong. How can the press  use the name 'Lolita' asa euphamism for seductress? The character of Lolita  is nothing of the kind. Shokcingly, this is not a story of love --she never  loves Humbert--but a story of rape and kidnapping. All 'love' is twisted,  seen thru the eyes of a sick child molester. How can anyone sympathize with  HH? His language is magnificent, but isn't Nabokov trying to show us how  easy it is to be seduced by a glossy sheen? Isn't Humbert the America of  the analogy--attractrive and powerful from the outside, twisted wihtin, and  Lolita Old World Europe--innocently raped by the Power she respects as a  savior? Whatever the allegories, I was stunned at how Lolita is the story  of a child abuser (when HH tells Lolita that if she reports him, she'll end  up in a foster home suffering 'worse rapes than mine', and how he delights  in hearing her cry into her pillow when she thinks he is asleep--these are  truly sadistic, sick moments of abuse) I'll never again call a 9 year olf  with big eyes a 'lolita'--Lolita is a victim, her life destroyed by  Humbert. Maybe Sting never really read this book. The language is, of  course, hypnotizing, dazzeling, life-changing. The metaphors dizzying  (&quot;I probed her gently but firmly for answers. The way a gynecologist  probes for tumors&quot;)  Genius, yes--but not for its 'Love'. For its  uncovering and unmasking of judging a book by its cover.",1998-09-21
