The story, though told in the third person, centers around Ezekial Farragut, a professor sentenced to prison for murdering his brother. Much of the novel follows Farragut's mundane life in prison and his recollections of his free life with his wife and other amorous liaisons. Until the final twenty pages, the major events of the novel take place outside of Falconer Prison which holds Farragut. His lover Jody escapes, accompanied by an unsettling perspective shift from Farragut to Jody on the outside, and a riot occurs at another prison, but is eventually suppressed without much effect on the inmates at Falconer. Descriptions of Farragut's brief homosexual relationship with Jody were likely provocative in 1975, but have lost much of their shock value in the face of other prison literature and growing social acceptance of non-heterosexual romances. Cheever's portrayal of everyday prison life may be true to life, but it does not make for compelling literature. I never managed to feel drawn into the story. Farragut never aroused my sympathy or scorn because the details of his crime are not revealed until the very end of the novel. His ridiculous letters to a judge and bishop requesting liberation are comical, but he never acts on his desire for freedom until the final pages.

I believe that's because the central character and his angst are so foreign to my experience that I cannot empathize or sympathize with him or even understand the problems which shaped his life.<br /><br />Falconer is the prison where the central character, the drug-addicted Farragut, ends up after killing his brother (perhaps accidentally, perhaps not). The story follows him through the dehumanizing prison experience, with flashbacks to his former life as a university professor. Actually, very little of actual prison life is described and what is told is very mild in comparison to what one understands to be prison life today. As I perceive it, the prison is meant to be symbolic of America, with its hypocritical expectations of behavior and its soul-destroying atmosphere. The novel was written in 1975, and perhaps this is the way many white, upper-class, educated males felt back then, but it is not a mind set that I can really understand. For the record, I have never really understood Saul Bellow either.

The characters, mostly the prisoners and guards at the fictional Falconer prison, are strong but are not really likeable.

US,27586646,R14XZN27K9GVXE,0679737863,984713450,"Falconer",Books,5,2,2,N,N,"More than a Prison Novel","I picked up this book on the strength of a James Wood recommendation in 1994, the renowned critic listed Cheever's FALCONER as among the best American and British writing since 1945. The writing is phenomenal, as one would expect from Cheever and a James Wood recommendation.<br />While largely set in prison, this book is not what I would call a prison novel. FALCONER does touch on some common prison novel tropes and, indeed, a number of parallels can be drawn between FALCONER and Stephen King's RITA HAYSWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Both main characters come from relatively moneyed pasts, they are not career criminals, and both obtain clerical jobs within the prison that allow them special privileges. There are, of course, differences. The main character in this novel, Farragut, is guilty, importantly so. The reader also quickly learns that he has a severe heroin addiction. While these details are consistent with a prison setting, the prison itself is not always convincing. Or perhaps prisons have changed this much. At any rate, the prison seems to be primarily a device to separate Farragut from his wife. In fact, the prison could be read as a metaphor for Farragut's marriage.<br />The book, however, is not about marriage either. Early in the book, there is a description of Farragut's wife:<br />She had an authenticated beauty. Several photographers had asked her to model, although her breasts, marvelous for nursing and love, were a little too big for that line of work...\\""You know,\\"" [Farragut's] son had said, \\""I can't talk to Mummy when there's a mirror in the room. She's really balmy about her looks.\\"" Narcissus was a man and he couldn't make the switch, but she had, maybe twelve or fourteen times, stood in front of the full-length mirror in their bedroom and asked him, \\""Is there another woman of my age in this country who is as beautiful as I?\\"" She had been naked, overwhelmingly so, and he had thought this an invitation, but when he touched her she said, \\""Stop fussing with my breasts. I'm beautiful.\\""<br />This early scene is prelude to an account of their courtship and a meeting of husband and wife at prison. At the meeting, his wife foreshadows the true subject of the novella: \\""I wouldn't want to be married to a homosexual, having already married a homicidal drug addict.\\""<br />The prison, in my reading, seems a metaphor, if a metaphor of anything, of the proverbial closet and anti-homosexual prejudice. In FALCONER, Cheever explores homosexuality, particularly among men who are, at least outside of prison, heterosexual men and prejudice against them. Cheever fares better in this exploration, than in his descriptions of prison life. Some aspects of the novel, published in 1975, seem almost quaint by today's standards. The novel was written well after other authors had written explicitly about homosexuality, but well before the only significant public policy question became whether homosexual relationships will be accorded equal standing before the law. The characters' attitudes betray this particular datedness. But it is a dating of the setting, not the novel.<br />Cheever manages to create a portrait of the in-closet community at a particular time, his time. This was for me the most engaging aspect of the novella. I would not say Cheever misses with his many, explicit attempts to find universality, but they stand out. The examples can be mundane: \\""He waited for [his wife and son] to emerge [from the visitor's room] like a waiter in an American-plan hotel waiting for the dining room doors to open, like a lover, like a drought-ruined farmer waiting for rain, but without the sense of the universality of waiting.\\""; \\""There was, Farragut thought, some universality to a full bladder.\\"" But his extrapolations from individual moments to universality strike most honestly when touching upon sexuality, as when Cheever describes a line of prisoners masturbating in \\""the Valley\\"":<br />The wall above the urinal was white tiling with a verylimited power of reflection. You could make out the height and the complexion of the men on your left and your right and that was about all...There was some rightness in having the images of the lovers around them opaque. They were universal, they were phantoms, and any skin sores, or signs of cruelty, ugliness, stupidity or beauty, could not be seen. Farragut went here regularly.....<br />or when used to sketch a character:<br />Marshack...was very useful. He was indispensable at greasing machinery and splicing BX cables and he would be a courageous and fierce mercenary in some border skirmish if someone more sophisticated gave the order to attack. There would be some universal goodness in the man - he would give you a match for your cigarette and save you a seat at the movies - but there was no universality to his lack of intelligence. Marshack might respond to the sovereignty of love, but he could not master geometry and he should not be asked to. Farragut put him down as a killer.<br />And this, in the end, is Cheever's goal, I think. He manages to sketch the emotional life of closeted homosexuals, including portraying them as regular, if tortured, men, and also to reveal at least some universal aspects of mankind. He achieves this, I think. Not in a grand way, but adequately. I would not characterize FALCONER as a great book, but it is a worthwhile book. Cheever addresses worthwhile subjects with enviable skill and sometimes piercing insight.<br />I hope I have not cast this as an issue book. It is a well-told story with depth.

In fact, I never found the prison setting particularly convincing.  Rather, Falconer involves the dissection of its main character; the prison, I think, acts as a metaphor for the proverbial closet.    Farragut's wife is narcissistic and cold.  Society has no place for homosexuals.  Farragut is trapped pretending to be heterosexual until, somewhat paradoxically, prison liberates him.  I think these are the themes of tragedy and redemption Cheever most set out to explore.  In my view, Cheever's goal is to examine Farragut's personal demons and the strictures of society rather than to make any statements about the penal system.  The book is not for anyone squeamish regarding sexual matters, or perhaps it is.  The book explores universal themes through the filter of a closeted homosexual, shedding light both on the human condition and on what it means to be a closeted homosexual.    While Cheever is a great writer, I consider Cheever's attempt more laudable than his achievement.  I do recommend the book, but, being a hard grader, I cannot give it more than three stars.",2009-01-21

We immediately learn that he is a man who murdered his brother, and then the book explains what he  does day to day inside the walls of Falconer.<br /><br />Written in the 1970's, Farragut excuses his fratricide on that decade's greatest evil - drugs.  And, the drug that overpowers him is the worst drug of that era - heroin.  Hooked or addicted, and strung out like the other junkies of that era, he cannot remember much. He thinks he hit his brother once, and then his brother fell and died. We learn that he did not beat his brother a single time with the fireplace's  poker stick, but that it was more like 20 times.<br /><br />After living a life of certain privilege, Farragut's later half of his life is to become a horror - methadone induced drudgery.<br /><br />Cheever, who is known for short stories, has various inmates come to Farragut and tell him their reason for being there; or how they had a homosexual love; or how they acknowledge what he did and how they may have done something similar.  In effect, these great and personal short stories cluster together  to make a short novel - which Cheever calls Falconer.<br /><br />Occasionally, good things happen in the novel. And, the prison guard (Tiny), who befriends the inmates and has a strong but relaxed hand in controlling the prison population, makes the place more hospitable - unlike the greedy and headstrong warden.<br /><br />Farragut survives this transcending time of his life amazingly well. In this world similar to HBO's \\""Oz\\"", Falconer could easily rot most any character.  For Farragut, it appears the opposite occurs. He ages, his hair turns white within one year, but his spirit seems to grow stronger as the days progress.  Much to his own astonishment, he becomes a better or stronger person by being caged like an animal.<br /><br />The ending is a surprise - so I cannot ruin it for others. But, I can say that the ending of this book is great. You hope that something like this would happen. And, it thankfully does.thing like this would happen. And, it thankfully does.",2007-06-09

His main characters as well as his supporting characters are very well developed; he is an expert at description and dialogue; he knows the way the human mind works in all its logical and illogical glory.  That being said, while I appreciate all of Cheever's talents, I did not care for Falconer, my first Cheever novel.<br /><br />Falconer simply did not interest me.  Yes, all of the above qualities existed, but they weren't enough to make me care about the main character or his plight.

If you want to read about the plight of a man who is battling addiction and loneliness while incarcerated, Falconer is for you.  But, this is not a page-turner, and it would be unfair of me to lead you to believe as such.<br /><br />I also believe I should be up front and tell you that there is a great deal of homosexual behavior described between the prisoners in this novel.

But here, Cheever turns his attention to a heroin-addict named Ezekiel Farragut imprisoned at Falconer, a grey obsolescent \\""correctional facility,\\"" for fratricide.  Deeply critical of modern forms of punishment, and drawing on his own experiences as teacher at Sing-Sing in the 70s, Cheever depicts a plutonian world of iron and concrete and dripping pipes where the forgotten and forgettable are kept behind bars, their humanity supressed and marginalized.  Ezekiel, or Zeke, comes from a genteel family fractured after a reversal of fortunes that closely resembles Cheever's own family and childhood.  The story of Zeke's wayward brother, his gas attendant mother and disconnected father deftly weaves in and out of his year-long death in Falconer and finally his gripping and unexpected rebirth, somewhat reminiscent of a modern Crime and Punishment.  In spite of the book's difficult subject matter, the dark sides of humanity and society and relentless dealings with hopeless characters and rather sordid scenes, Cheever succeeds in drawing in his captive reader and forces us to ask tough questions about ourselves and the retributive society we live in.

His work, \\""Falconer\\"", is extremely well written and generally critically admired. The subject matter and the eyes belonging to Farragut through which we see this story held little appeal to me. I plan to try another of his books to see if this was the odd book out, or I am the odd reader out.<br />This is a not quite so typical prison story, which appears to be historically based predicated on the time periods and the names of prisons he uses. Why he chose to change them in this work of fiction I found puzzling, as they and there histories are well known even infamous. Farragut has been imprisoned for the crime of Fratricide. His version of the crime, and those related later in the work are so entirely different in detail and degree, the reader may reasonably ask what other events may fall into this category. Farragut's sexuality in and out of prison, his wife's and many of those we meet are discussed at length, and they compete on several levels none very pleasant. It may be that the haze or thread of a variety of addictions from sex to heroin blurs the message of this book. It may be the time he speaks of was so defined by what the Author emphasizes, that you either are absorbed in it, or feel that it is tired.<br />Mr. Cheever did not earn the repeated notice of his skills as a writer and the awards that followed without reason. So in the end it may have been my lack of interest in the self absorbed characters, and pieces of plot I found absurd, that doomed the book for me. Jody and his escape plan is pure farce, and Farragut's final act was also stretching credulity for me. Farragut's wife was the person he should have been imprisoned for harming, I cannot readily remember a more nauseating character.<br />Hopefully just the wrong book picked first, you will have to decide for yourself.",2001-01-27

Much bleaker than I  would have expected of Cheever, this story follows a man imprisoned for  murder who must come to terms with how totally his life has changed. Slow  paced and thorough, the 'plot' occurs more in the actions of the  protagonist's mind than in the external world of the prison, yet maintains  its hold on the reader.<br />One aspect of the story that stood out for me was  the matter of fact way in which the protagonist takes a same sex lover,  explaining how important real human contacts - physical and otherwise -  were to maintaining sanity. I think these scenes are both believable and  understandable to the most heterosexual of readers. A further testiment to  Cheever's talent as a writer.<br />I can't say that this is a pleasant book.
