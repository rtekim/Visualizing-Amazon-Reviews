It just word salad that some people want to believe it high fault in writing.  It is a terrible book.",2014-06-06

If you like meta fiction, its great.  However, it is very hard to follow and it's not that humorous in my opinion.  I fell asleep quite a few times after reading only a few pages.  I was about to give up reading it, but followed through, it was the longest 200 pages I read in a while.",2013-09-29

At times it's confusing as the main character is a student and author who, when he's not drinking with his buddies, lays in bed and lets the disparate characters in his mind float freely about to interact in frenzied and often funny scenarios. The author's language and style are unique to say the least, and that singular style is the most enjoyable aspect of his jumble of farce, satire, and nonsense.",2013-06-25

I love the idea of recycling characters and the whole chaos of having a story embedded in another. Truly an unappreciated work of genius! I am very pleased to have a digital copy that I can carry with me and never have to worry about it being abused by the whole transport process.",2012-10-12

Just check out the preview to see if it's your type of thing. I rarely laugh out loud while reading, but this one had me going.<br /><br />It's been a while since I read it and quickly added it to my favorites list, and the local library's ancient copy is probably always available for me, but it sure is nice to have my own copy of this in digital format (I hate storing things and have plenty of stuff populating my shelves already).<br /><br />The comparisons to Joyce are a bit misguided if you ask me. O'Brien is gifted but you don't have to be a genius with a master's in fine literature to understand a word of it. This is fun, silly and masterful. Give it a shot.",2012-05-29
