I couldn't help thinking I was reading a play with the rather stilted prose.<br />Having said all that, I don't want to be totally negative about this book.

On the strength of that recommendation, unfortunately, I ordered The Death of the Heart, and it's now close to the top of my list of books I really did not like. The novel tells the story of 16-year-old Portia, who is orphaned by the loss of her mother after growing up between the world wars on the continent in series of faded resort hotels in the off-season and comes to spend a year with her half-brother and his beautiful wife in their elegant home in London. Thomas is a very successful businessman with all the limitations of the cliched Englishman of his type. Anna is a dragon lady, disappointed in her one true love and none to happy in her rebound marriage, who goes through the motions of caring for Portia -- barely -- but whose behind-the-scenes orchestration of the orphan's life is meant to harm, not help, her. Bowen is a fine writer, but I found this a very dreary book. The biggest problem I had with the novel was Portia herself, whose innocence comes close to stupidity, making her not believable. In addition, Bowen's novel doesn't transcend its time and types of people, which aren't very interesting from the vantage of 2014, to deliver a story that endures. Innocence to experience and experience devouring innocence are classic themes, of course, and if you're looking for a British version that is worth reading in 2014, I recommend The Patrick Melrose novels.",2014-08-27

As an aside, someone once complimented Agatha Christie on her books and she demurred saying something to the effect that she wasn't a good writer, Elizabeth Bowen was the good writer and worth reading.

This is the rootless young man who is Portia's first &#34;young man&#34; in her life. The reviewers give him adjectives as shallow, caddish, etc.,all those ways young men of not much inner life but who are good looking, charming, seductive initially get pigeon holed. What I found in recently reading this novel was a description of a social climber of the early part of the 20th century, a young man who is so obviously to our eyes a gay man who cannot acknowledge to himself that he is. He likes to seduce women but that's about as far as he seems to want to go. We see him at the seaside being attractive with Dickie, going to a bar with him for a drink, and we can see his future coming at him. Eddie also seems to see it coming at him and seems unable to change his behavior. He has written and published a novel that Portia's brother liked. A caustic novel about society. Portia's diary shows her interest in observing who and what is around her. She gives some promise of a possibility of becoming a writer. We are in 1930's London and we know what the 1940's are going to bring to London. Portia will be 26 in 10 years, Eddie will probably go to war, and her brother and his wife will move into the 20th century during a bleak but exciting war time in London.<br /><br />Sorry for such rather unrelated thoughts and feelings. I just wanted to open the possibility of seeing Eddie as a trapped gay man with nowhere to turn in a society that would have crushed him if they knew, and one which would crush him if he let himself know.So he plays with Portia and everyone else, but he cannot help himself and there isn't anyone who can help him at this time in his life.",2014-01-31

For me it was captivating and un-put-downable, but if this is not your cup of tea maybe you should not read it.  The story is quite simple on the surface, the orphaned teen Portia goes to live with her half brother and his wife. The characters include the rogue who works for the half brother's firm who is both after the wife and Portia and another woman, the housekeeper who knows everything, and the wife..a complicated character to say the least. The story focuses on what lies beneath the polite and superficial lives of the well to do, on the way some people cover up all that is uncomfortable or inconvenient and in the process can be quite cruel.

The novel seems to be headed in the usual direction: young woman is caught up with dashing older man, he uses her, she is destroyed. But that isn't where this goes; it's both more complex and, in some ways, more depressing.    Portia at 16, when her parents die, goes to live with her step brother (Thomas) and his wife (Anna). In her effort to find a home/family, she observes everyone too closely and too idealistically and realistically (like in realism as opposed to like in reality), and when Anna reads her diary Anna has to face her real self as Portia describes her. This is too much for everyone, and things start to fall apart to the point where Portia must face the fact that there are no heroes. There is no one to love and in the process of seeking love people just destroy one another and then move on. Ultimately, there are just these shells of people walking around.     The characters are not without emotion, but the emotion is almost always rallied against truth and having to face it.  People want to go through life, Bowen seems to be suggesting, maintaining a surface coherence, and occasionally acting out against each other because they are so miserable but then retreating right back to the surface coherence. It's not a pretty picture.    The plot focuses on the relationships among the characters. Anna, with a shaky past of her own where she was jilted by someone she loved, meets and marries Thomas. Thomas is the son of a father who is pushed out of his home by his mother when he has an affair with Portia's mother.  This is all done with surface coherence in that no one gets particularly upset or ruffled but everyone is in some way destroyed from it. As the book says, it's the right thing to do but not the good thing.  Thomas' father at his deathbed has asked him and Anna to take in Portia for one year so she can have a familylife (the dad has an idealized notion of their life).  They take her in but they don't really want her because she upsets their coherence.    Meanwhile, Anna reads Portia's diary, tells her friend Quentin and ultimately Quentin tells Portia leading to even greater problems and destruction of ideals.  Portia runs away when she discovers that Eddie, the cad she thinks loves her and who is Anna's friend, tells her he's had enough of her because she's always trying to \\""see\\"" him and hold him to what he says. Portia goes to another friend of Anna's Major Brutt who was once the friend of Anna's first lover. Portia chooses Brutt because he too is the object of ridicule in Anna and Thomas' home, and she feels like they could comfort one another because they have this in common. Brutt is scandalized first at having this 16 year old show up at his hotel doorstep and second having to face how Anna and Thomas really see him (he was hoping never to really know).      Portia establishes an ultimatum, she will not leave Brutt's hotel unless Anna and Thomas do the right thing. Well, Anna and Thomas have no idea what the right thing is to do and are forced into the position of trying to figure out how Portia feels, which leads them to having to think how they are.  Ultimately, they decide to send the housekeeper, Matchett, to pick up Portia, believing that she is the only one who has an honest relationship with her. That's where the novel ends.    Most of the characters are well developed to the extent that they are superficial people, and we only get brief glimpses of something more complex in them. Bowen makes it clear that they don't really want to know who they really are, and so the reader doesn't ever really get to know this either.  Bowen does a fantastic job of weaving an atmosphere of decrepitude and loneliness throughout the book while also providing insight into how good people are at deceiving themselves.    What I don't like about the book, and books of this genre (thinkEdith Wharton) is that all the characters (except Portia until the end) are the same; they inhabit the same psychological landscape and that doesn't work for me.  It's as if the world is made of one psychological landscape (like a black hole) that we are all destined to end up in.",2011-08-23

Having been raised in a succession of  continental hotels (an experience Bowen herself had for about a decade, starting at age 12), she is wholly unprepared for the invisible and unspoken rules of the game operating in the upper-class English home she's entered. With her distant half-brother and cold sister-in-law, she struggles to locate some kind of human connection, and only manages to find it in unsuitable people such as an older head servant, or a dissolute young male \\""friend\\"" of her sister-in-law (he's apparently based on the Welsh writer Goronwy Rees).<br /><br />It is this latter relationship that inevitably leads to tears at the end, as her naive dreams are dashed by the self-absorption of everyone around her. It's all pretty bleak stuff, as there is not a single character in the book who lives in anything approaching happiness. It does have some appeal as a fictional ethnographic case study of a strange bygone (and peculiarly English) ecosystem, but it's hard not to wish for World War II to arrive and force these characters into doing something useful and thinking about something other than themselves.<br /><br />Although it's not a book I can imagine recommending to many people, it is worth checking out if you're the kind of reader who likes to linger over every sentence, picking it up, turning it around, and examining it from every angle. The language is rich enough to warrant this kind of close reading -- even if it didn't generally strike a chord with me. It's also worth reading by anyone with an interest in the interwar era or in the manifestation of class in Britain at the time. Note: The novel was adapted as a miniseries for BBC television in 1985, however this version remains unavailable on DVD.t up, turning it around, and examining it from every angle.

God forbid any of these commentors who hated it should make the mistake of ordering a Henry James novel.  Bowen has such remarkable powers of penetration; her ability to shape compelling images with words is nothing short of astonishing.  Every time I read a review that uses the word boring, I feel the urge to buy the book just to spite them.  What the hell does that mean, boring?  Impatience, that's what I believe it means.  Well, this isn't a book for the impatient.  I'm not interested in what impatient people like or want.

Although they are brother and sister, Thomas and Portia have had very different lives. He, in his late thirties, is a wealthy advertising executive, who has also inherited money from his mother and lives in one of the elegant Regency terraces surrounding Regent's Park. She is the family's guilty secret, the daughter of Thomas's father by his second wife. The elder Mr Quayne, a seemingly respectable middle-aged businessman, was divorced by his first wife after getting his mistress, Portia's mother, pregnant. As a result he was banished from polite society in England, and Portia has spent her entire childhood living in various seedy hotels on the Continent.     The book is divided into three sections, entitled \\""The World\\"", \\""The Flesh\\"" and \\""The Devil\\"". The first and last sections are set in London, the middle one in the Kentish seaside town of Seale-on-Sea, where Portia goes to stay with Anna's old governess, Mrs Heccomb, while Thomas and Anna are abroad. (Seale, a fictitious town probably based on Hythe near Folkestone, also features in a later Elizabeth Bowen novel, \\""The Heat of the Day\\"").     Portia is a quiet, naive and unworldly girl, who finds it difficult to fit into the fashionable world of her brother and sister-in-law. Thomas is a rather dull individual whose main preoccupation is making money, Anna a glamorous and sophisticated, if cold and conventional, society hostess, with a number of suspiciously close male friends,. Neither of them welcome having Portia staying with them, and take her in reluctantly out of a sense of duty. Anna in particular resents Portia, whose innocence is at odds with her own worldliness. Portia also seems out of place in Seale; although Mrs Heccomb treats her kindly, she cannot fit in with Mrs Heccomb's children Dickie and Daphne and their \\""fast\\"" set of fun-loving friends.                    Portia has fallen in love with Eddie, a rather useless young man who is one of Anna's protégés (and possibly one of her former lovers, although Bowen is never explicit on this point). After being sent down from Oxford, Eddie has tried becoming a writer, abandoning that career after his first, satirical, novel upset too many people, and currently works in Thomas's agency, where Anna has found him a position, despite his having neither a liking nor an aptitude for the advertising business. The bored, cynical Eddie and the innocent young Portia are, of course, quite unsuited to one another, but she is too besotted with Eddie to notice his bad points. Only when she invites him to Seale for the weekend and he spends most of his time flirting with Daphne Heccomb does she realise that he might not be the man of her dreams. Portia has been confiding her intimate thoughts to her diary; when she discovers that Anna has been invading her privacy by reading this, she takes a drastic step.       Elizabeth Bowen demonstrates in this book her gift for descriptive writing; I was particularly struck by the opening chapter, in which she conjures up a vision of Regent's Park on a frosty January evening. Her main concerns, however, were characterisation and in social and psychological analysis. This is not a book which will appeal to those who like their fiction be packed with physical action; the most interesting action is that which takes place in the minds of her characters, especially Portia. The \\""death\\"" of the title is a metaphorical one, as Portia's innocent idealism is shattered by the cynicism and heartlessness of Anna, Eddie and their set. \\""The Death of the  Heart\\"" is a sensitive, finely-written novel which justifies its owner's reputation as one of the leading British novelists of the twentieth century.",2008-06-02

It has clean generous type, a binding that stays open, a cover that feels good in the hand, an attractive and totally relevant illustration, typography that captures both Bowen's elegance and her modernity, and -- wonder of wonders -- a back-cover blurb that brilliantly encapsulates the essence of this elusive novel. For example: \\""As she deftly and delicately exposes the cruelty that lurks behind the polished surfaces of conventional society, Bowen reveals herself as a masterful novelist who combines a sharp sense of humor with a devastating gift for divining human motivations.\\""<br /><br />Not for nothing does the book-jacket writer compare Elizabeth Bowen to Henry James. For this is a very Jamesian subject. The recently-orphaned 16-year-old Portia, Bowen's heroine, is significantly older than James' Maisie ([[ASIN:0140432485 WHAT MAISIE KNEW]]) and younger than his Isabel Archer ([[ASIN:0141439637 THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY]]), but like them she is thrust into sophisticated society as a naive observer, and the book is mainly taken up by the author's razor-sharp dissection of that society and sensitive exploration of the heroine's feelings.<br /><br />What is surprising here, even in comparison to Henry James or to the other Elizabeth Bowen novels that I have read ([[ASIN:0385720149 THE LAST SEPTEMBER]] and [[ASIN:0385721250 THE HOUSE IN PARIS]]), is that so little actually happens. Everything seems to point to a premature sexual affair which will proves disastrous for Portia, especially once she falls for the charms of the caddish Eddie, whose previous dalliances we have already seen described. Portia herself is the offspring of her father's late-life affair, which has forced him to leave his life of English respectability and to live abroad; there is a sense of unreliability in the bloodline. Even the title of the book, THE DEATH OF THE HEART, and the subtitles of its three major parts -- \\""The World,\\"" \\""The Flesh,\\"" and \\""The Devil\\"" -- all seem to be leading in this direction.<br /><br />And yet, while sexuality is always present in the subtext (another Jamesian quality), it never tips over into action. This is a book in which so simple an event as Eddie's holding the wrong girl's hand at a movie can have traumatic significance; there is no need to go farther. I can only think that Bowen's misdirection is deliberate. In the course of waiting for something to happen, the reader finds that he has absorbed countless details and impressions of everyday life that, taken cumulatively, have an even more devastating effect. This book is like a timed-release drug capsule; you may feel comparatively little after you have finished reading it, but it continues to work in the mind long after you have put it down.<br /><br />In her three-part structure, Bowen contrasts two different strata of English society. The outer sections are set in the upper-class world of Portia's half-brother Thomas and his wife Anna, who live in an expensive house in one of the Nash Terraces fronting Regent's Park. Thomas is withdrawn and remote; Anna leads a busy social life with many male friends; they communicate only superficially with each other and hardly at all with Portia, who is forced to turn to the housekeeper, Matchett, as the nearest thing to a confidante. It is no wonder that she falls for Eddie, whom she sees as an outsider just like her. Meeting him at first assuages her loneliness, but his eventual small betrayals only serve to heighten it.<br /><br />Contrasting with London society is a month that Portia spends with Anna's former governess Mrs. Heccomb, in an off-season seaside resort. Having been brought up in a similar resort town myself, I found Bowen's description of the wind-battered setting and the cheerfully rowdy life of the young people whom Portia meets there one of the most vivid sections of this excellently-observed book. While the apparently free-and-easy quality of this middle-class setting can be seen to have its own limitations and proprieties, it sends Portia back to town with an unbearable sense of the shallow frigidity of her life with Thomas and Anna. And the events of the weekend when Eddie comes down to join her, although slow to make their full effect, eventually alter their relationship (and Portia's view of herself) irretrievably.<br /><br />One of the most poignant aspects of the book is its awareness of transience. Thomas and Anna are eminently settled in their house, their work, their society; even the constant motion of the Heccomb young people and their set is based on an underlying stability. But Portia's life has always been rootless, moving from one European hotel to another, staying out of season and in the cheapest rooms -- rootless with one vital exception: the security of her parents' love. Eddie's rootlessness is of a more dangerous variety, coming of having rejected the life of his still-living parents without creating anything significant of his own to replace it, but it takes Portia time to realize the essential difference between them. The theme is further reflected in one minor character who will become important at the end: the sad Major Brutt, who \\""had a good war\\"" but has been rattling around since, growing rubber in Malaya, and now staying in a seedy London hotel waiting for something to turn up; it is a touching portrait, albeit a frightening one.<br /><br />And what will happen to Portia? Will her heart remain dead? Is it indeed HER heart that dies? The book ends on a spiritual and psychological crisis, but it offers no resolution. Perhaps it is wishful thinking on my part, but I do not see her life ending in either tragedy or pathos, despite the book's title. Portia's first innocence has been dispelled, certainly, but there is an energy in her, a drive towards the good which I believe will enable her to learn from her experiences and ultimately rise above them. Not the least of the qualities of this admirable edition which I praised at the beginning is the cover painting, which goes far to contractict the implications of the title and declare that this wonderful novel is not, after all, depressing.quality of this middle-class setting can be seen to have its own limitations and proprieties, it sends Portia back to town with an unbearable sense of the shallow frigidity of her life with Thomas and Anna.
