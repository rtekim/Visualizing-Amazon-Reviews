US,48942414,R152QDIP4QOTHQ,0441569595,769194143,Neuromancer,Books,4,1,2,N,Y,"Surprisingly Relevant with an Interesting Story","I typically avoid \\""foundation\\"" books like the plague.  Whenever a piece of literature comes with the distinction of founding this genre or starting that movement, it has been my experience that the work will be focused more on concepts and ideas rather than story and characters.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I simply read for fun and tend to not enjoy books that are more about establishing ideas than telling a good story.  So, when my fiancé read \\""Neuromancer\\"" and insisted that I would enjoy it due to my love of things like \\""Ghost in the Shell,\\"" science fiction, and cyber punk, I was more than a little wary.  I feared that the novel would be rife with techno-babble and jargon that would only make sense to someone obsessed with technology, so I put it off...and put it off...and put it off.  After some not-so-subtle hints from my fiancé that I really needed to read this, I finally sat down and went for it.  Did a lot of things fly over my head?  Probably.  But you know what?  I enjoyed it anyway!  Spoilers follow.<br /><br />  \\""Neuromancer\\"" essentially boils down to a futuristic crime novel.  Case, the main character, is an ex-hacker whose former employer had part of his nervous system irrevocably destroyed after Case tried to hack the employer's company, effectively preventing him from ever connection to Cyberspace again (and therefore putting him out of work).  Down on his luck, he's offered an opportunity he can't pass up: his nerves will be repaired using new (and otherwise preventatively expensive) medical technology if he agrees to use his hacking skills to complete a special job.  He's joined by an odd, unique group of cohorts: a former colonel from the Special Forces that doesn't quite seem to be all the way there; a mercenary with some cool cybernetic enhancements and a past she doesn't want to talk about; a performance artist with perverse holographic imaginings; the personality of a dead hacker immortalized in the matrix; and the mysterious Wintermute, an Artificial Intelligence that seems to really be running the show.<br /><br />  To start this review on a high note, the story is great.  It's both exciting and complete.  I had feared that the plot would take a back seat to showcasing the author's ideas of futuristic tech, but that happily isn't the case, and the story definitely isn't secondary in the novel.  Ok, so the beginning is a little slow (the first 20 pages or so could prove to be a little daunting for some since they're mostly introducing us to Case and giving some exposition on the setting), but once things pick up, they really pick up.  And not only is the plot satisfying in and of itself, it takes us all over the world (seriously - the characters go to several different countries and even take a trip off-planet) and gives us a look at plenty of locales to help flesh out Gibson's world.<br /><br />  Gibson's writing style is very notable and distinct.  Honestly, it can be a tad difficult to get used to at first glance.  The best way to describe it would be that each chapter is broken into vignettes, each one serving to highlight something, whether it be some introspection on Case's part, character development, a plot point, demonstrating a piece of technology, or showcasing some part of the setting.  While a little jolting at first to jump around, the vignettes flow and connect nicely to weave a coherent, satisfying story.  Prose-wise, Gibson has the type of writing style that needs to be read slowly and enjoyed.  That's not to say that it's wordy or complex - quite the opposite, actually!  Every word is important, so if you try to skim or read too quickly, you'll likely miss out on a lot and become horribly confused.  It's not that Gibson writes a lot, but that he writes meaningfully - trying to speed read this would do a disservice to the author, story, and reader.  Gibson's writing style is unlike anything I've seen, and, perhaps surprisingly, it really works.<br /><br />  While the story and the author's style are extremely important, the tech and relevance are also large parts of the book.  \\""Neuromancer\\"" was published in the 1980s, so I expected some very dated science fiction and technology and a vision of the future that was so off base that it push the book firmly into the realm of fantasy.  Since this is the book that is considered one of the foundation works of the cyber punk genre, a lot concepts have trickled into not only cyber punk culture, but mainstream media as a whole.  This is the novel that invented the term Cyberspace and prominently featured the matrix as an abstract representation of the computer network that, with the right equipment, one can interact with.  People adding cybernetic enhancements to their bodies is perceived as normal and virtual intelligence is not only a thing, but a well-known (though not always completely understood) creation.  Cloning isn't unheard of and advanced medical procedures are the norm.  Given that Gibson wrote this before many of these things existed, his ideas have stayed largely relevant because many are things that science is still trying to make a reality.  One might wonder if Gibson could somehow see into the future.  Even over 20 years after its publication, \\""Neuromancer\\"" manages to not feel dated and, as a result, lacking in relevance.<br /><br />  The final thing to discuss as far as the overall story goes is the world.  The other big reason that this piece of speculative fiction has aged gracefully is that the gritty, rough, super-controlled world portrayed in the book is very much the sort of future that many people still fear.  Gibson's vision of the future consists of large corporations controlling the different countries and regions.  Some of the cities that we know have come together to form larger metropolises and the lines between countries seem to sometimes blur, yet cultures are still fairly distinct.  None of that really matters, though, since it's mostly companies and illegal groups that hold the power in this world.  Whether this is a personal fear of yours or not, you'll be able to feel the corrupt hold these large groups have and the complete helplessness of the average person to do anything about it.  This isn't a clean, sci-fi future where everything is white, shiny, and full of helpful technology; it's a grimy world full of selfish people who use (and abuse) the current tech in whatever way benefits the most...and it's surprisingly accessible to the modern reader.<br /><br />  Lets move on to the characters.  This is the one thing that keeps me from giving \\""Neuromancer\\"" a full five stars.  I'm the kind of reader that needs great characters to become truly invested in a story, and this book fell a little flat for me in the area of character development.  Make no mistake, this is certainly an interesting group of individuals.  Each one stands out in their own right with their unique abilities and back stories and, much like Gibson's writing itself, there are no wasted or superfluous characters.  Every one has a role to fill and each demonstrates something that serves to flesh out the novel's setting.  Even the side characters or one-off figures are intriguing in their own right.  I would argue that the characters serve their various purposes well...but I never felt particularly attached to any of them.  Instead, rather than seeing them as fully realized characters, they struck me more as the embodiments of the ideas and concepts of Gibson's world.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with this - my fiancé and others seem to have responded well to the book's figures and what they set out to do.  I just needed more growth from them, more reasons to become attached and really care about them as individuals and as a whole.  And while there are moments where some of this development that I craved began to shine through, the characters seemed distant throughout most of the novel.  I was interested in their stories and who they were, Iwas interested in what they could do, but I ultimately didn't care about them beyond that, and the absence of that more personal connection with them stood out while I was reading.<br /><br />  The one exception to this is Case, the main character.  Perhaps it's because most of the book is from his (third person) point of view and he therefore gets to experience more than any of the other characters.  Perhaps it's because he gets the biggest life-changing upgrade (his ability to jack into the matrix being restored), so we see a drastic change as far as his capabilities and outlook are concerned.  Whatever the reason, his journey actually seems to have an effect on him, and he definitely isn't the same character at the end of the story as he is at the beginning, and since we get to experience things right along with him, it's easy to care about what ultimately happens to him in this strange, futuristic world.<br /><br />  On a random, personal note regarding characters, as seems to often be the case, the two characters I was most interested in died before their stories were fully concluded or revealed to us.  Damn!  Just my luck...<br /><br />  In closing, don't make the same assumptions that I did.  Don't ignore this book because you think it'll be too smart or tech-heavy.  Don't refuse to read it because you fear the story will take a backseat to Gibson's scientific concepts and visions of the future.  Don't give it a wide berth because you fear the age of the novel will make it come across as dated and out of touch with the current reality.  \\""Neuromancer\\"" manages to strike the balance between telling a satisfying, interesting story and showcasing the author's (sometimes terrifying) world.  Gibson's distinct style of prose makes for a unique reading experience, and though the characters fell a bit short of what I wanted, I'm glad I overcame my objections and read this book.  A solid four star read.",2015-08-27

US,52973231,R1L7OIXKUX8BDR,0441569595,769194143,Neuromancer,Books,5,1,3,N,N,"Did William Gibson get the credit for his influence on the Matrix Films?","As a William Gibson fan, especially of Neuromancer, I am sure I am not alone in wondering if Gibson’s ideas were used and not given credit by the Wachowskis in their hugely popular and lucrative Matrix series of films.<br /><br />Biased towards Gibson and feeling automatically that this was so, upon further examination and research, I found quite a different story to be told. The story is this: There is nothing new under the sun. Whatever Gibson came up with, he was influenced by others who came before him. It’s like saying the Beatles invented rock n’ roll, ignoring the thousands of artists who came before, and had a direct influence on them before they ever picked their guitars.<br /><br />By the way, did you know that the transistor was invented and patented simulaneously in two places at once? - Texas and Silicon Valley. As with Gibson and the Beatles, it’s a not a case of who influenced you at the time, but a case of who of your group rises head and shoulders above the rest to claim the credit for it. Everyone’s heard of Silicon Valley, but who ever heard of Texas' Silicon Prairie before the TV series Halt & Catch Fire came out?<br /><br />Gibson fans, buckle up. You may not want to hear these (painful) truths.<br /><br />1. The term &#34;cyberspace&#34; was created by the brilliant mathematician and one of the fathers of computer science, Norbert Weiner (also president of MIT in his later years). The term is his and his alone, decades before Gibson ever uttered it. William Gibson is widely credited with coining the term “cyberspace.” Apparently, this is not so.<br /><br />2. Simulacra and Simulation (a 1981 philosophical treatise by Jean Baudrillard seeking to examine the relationships among reality, symbols, and society) was required reading for most of the principal cast and crew during the making of the Matrix, which came out in 1999. They were not required to read Neuromancer, nor was there any mention of the book by the directors, cast or crew, and therefore no known connection. It is not known if the Wachowskis read the book, or were even aware of it at the time they made their film.<br /><br />3. Producer Joel Silver has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for the Matrix by showing him Mamoru Oshii's 1995 animated film “Ghost in the Shell” and saying, &#34;We wanna do that for real.” So, they weren’t shy about claiming their influences – Jean Baudrillard and Mamoru Oshii. If they weren’t shy about that, then they probably would have had no problem claiming Gibson's Neuromancer as an influence – but they didn’t.<br /><br />4. OK, finally some credit, well, sort of…<br />The film's use of the term &#34;Matrix&#34; is adopted from Gibson's novel. After watching the Matrix, Gibson commented that the way that the film's creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was “exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis&#34; he had relied upon in his own writing; however, he noted that the film's Gnostic themes distinguished it from Neuromancer, and believed that the Matrix was thematically closer to the work of science fiction author Philip K. Dick. So even Gibson himself had to hand the credit off to author Phillip K. Dick. He also is quoted as calling the film &#34;an innocent delight I hadn't felt in a long time,” and stated, &#34;Neo is my favorite-ever science fiction hero, absolutely.” So, the man his fans felt had been ripped off by the Wachowskis had no problem with the Matrix. What a shock!<br /><br />5. And the guy that actually feels he didn’t get the credit he deserves? – Grant Morrison. Comparisons have been made to Grant Morrison's comic series “The Invisibles”; Morrison believes that the Wachowskis essentially plagiarized his work to create the film. According to Grant Morrison, “The truth is that one of the design staff on the Matrix were given Invisibles collections and told to make the movie look like my books. This is a reported fact. The Wachowskis are comic book creators, and were fans of my work, so it's hardly surprising. I was even contacted before the first Matrix movie was released and asked if I would contribute a story to the website.”<br /><br />So, I started off wondering if William Gibson wasn’t given the credit he deserved, and found out that he didn’t even coin the term “cyperspace,” is comfortable with and a fan of the Wachowskis’ Matrix, and some guy I’ve never heard of (not being a comics/graphic novels fan) feels he has been hurt the most.<br /><br />Down the rabbit hole one more time, Alice? Sometimes I wish I’d never asked. Then I could preserve my prejudices in peace, without all those pesky facts getting in the way.<br /><br />For contributing information presented in this review, credit goes to:<br />macrumors.com<br />killermovies.com<br />foreigndispatches.typepad.com<br />matrix.wikia.com<br />wikipedia.comsurprising.

The story is pretty decent. It certainly keeps you on your toes, and the action flows steadily, unlike Snow Crash, it's cyberpunk counterpart. There are only a few issues with the story. It's hard to tell all of the character's objectives and locations at various times. One of the side characters also has a ton of backstory that is not really integral to the main plot, but interesting nonetheless.

Gibson’s writing style in Neuromancer is almost more poetry than prose.  Long descriptive passages detailing the action are non-existent; instead, Gibson presents series of images with carefully chosen adjectives and dialect.  It is up to the reader put this series of still frames into narrative motion.  This forces the reader to think far more deeply than is typical in pulp science fiction.  The reward, besides the stark beauty of the images themselves, is insight into Gibson’s thoughts about the human condition.<br /><br />Focusing purely on the technology in Neuromancer from today’s perspective, thirty years into the future from when Gibson wrote Neuromancer, it is remarkable how much he got right.  Artificial intelligence, man/machine interfaces, wearables, biomedicine, computer simulation, hacking, virtual reality, the Internet, and space travel have all advanced along the lines inferred by Gibson.  Yet we still have at least another thirty to fifty years to go to get to the stage described in Neuromancer.  If Gibson is ultimately right about the technology, there will be plenty of jobs for software engineers and surgeons in the decades ahead.<br /><br />But the technology in Neuromancer, although interesting, is merely the setting for Gibson’s story about what we and our creations are like and will be like.  Here the vision is fairly bleak on the surface but perhaps optimistic underneath.  Similar to today’s world, in Gibson’s future there are the “haves” with unimaginable wealth and the “have nots”, some of whom survive by street hustling.  Issues of wealth, power, trust, interpersonal relationships and love continue to be the main drivers of behavior.  In that sense there is much in Neuromancer that Shakespeare would recognize.  The ending of Neuromancer is purposely vague, leaving it up to the reader to decide whether what has been achieved by the protagonists is ultimately evil or good.  I choose to believe it is the latter.<br /><br />Neuromancer is well worth reading today and will be for decades to come.",2015-07-11

Gibson often provides the barest of details, with which you flesh out the scene, then fills us in later. The bartender's legendary ugliness, the intricate detail of Molly's glasses, Case flatlining... like Wintermute's simple presence as a white cube, Gibson's choices of words have a simplicity with an extreme complexity beneath.<br /><br />Another complaint is that the characters are hollow. But they reflect the world around them, and the digital personalities and artificial intelligences are themselves made more visceral. The characters are fatalistic. Case is estranged from social and governmental powers; he is the protagonist, but not the hero. He is oppressed, but isn't a liberating force. He's the observer, through which we see this world.<br /><br />The rest of the time, there are blocks of wandering, jargonistic intricacy that seem like literary joyriding.

The scope of this book is never realized.  It takes place after a huge war apparently and the world is now more savage and bleak than ever, but we never learn much about it since the reader is confined to Case's pov, and he doesn't seem to care about anything.  The plot unfolds as the characters learn more about what they are doing and eventually why, but once they find out why, the plot doesn't go anywhere, and the book loses it's mystery.  The characters remain static in their ambitions and emotions.  Case is the hero, but his journey doesn't teach him anything and it still feels like he's gained nothing at the end.  Molly is a deadly, sexy assassin, and although she does reveal a few backstories, her character never develops which isn't so bad, but it doesn't help the book at all.  Case's one extra emotion, hate, seems forced and artificial.  Those are the only two characters worth writing about, too, the rest don't need to be mentioned that's how uninspired and derivative they are.  The AI's talk like they are a James Bond super villain, which personifies them and makes them uninteresting, since they are not people, they are AI's.  They are new, strange, and dangerous, so personifying them nullifies the fear by making them much less abstract.  On the writing, Gibson's style is dense but reveals and inspires little.  He's got this annoying way of writing action, in that he will tell the outcome of an event before he tells you exactly how it happened, which diffuses the excitement.

He was at the top of his game, thinking he was invincible enough to steal from his employer and get away with it.<br /><br />The result was a dose of toxin that shut down the part of his nervous system required for cyberspace connection.  He is entirely without tools, without the ability to make a living as a hacker, and has spiraled down into a suicidal depression.<br /><br />When someone new seeks to hire him, and is somehow able to restore his damaged nervous system, Case is on the job, ready to do whatever this mysterious stranger wants.  Soon, though, he realizes that something bigger than he's ever experienced before is going on.  He not only has a complicated hacking job to do, but he is also busy chasing leads on exactly who his new boss is.<br /><br />This is a fascinating, groundbreaking story.

The premise of books like Snow Crash, Hyperion, Solaris, and a number of Philip K. Dick novels have irresistible set ups. Although I missed Neuromancer when it first came out, I can remember what it was like in the mid 1980s and how strange and intriguing cyberspace and the world that goes with it would have been. And Gibson does deliver. From mycotoxin booby traps on the liver to Rastafarians in space, there is no shortage of novelty. His noirish style is also fun to read.<br /><br />But I did not care. For me this comes down to the characters and what's at stake. In Snow Crash or Dick stories, characters actually seem to want and care about things (even if trivial or destructive|). Not in Neuromancer. Sure the characters have goals (no spoilers). But if they had failed to reach them, nothing would have been lost. Take Case. When we meet him at the start of the novel, his suicidal hustling suggests he cares little for himself or the world around him. Nothing he does or says suggests he changes as the story progresses. The same applies to Molly, Armitage, and Lady 3Jane. They carried the same feeling as countract-bound A-list actors phoning in their lines when trapped in the third sequel to a hit film (think Hangover 3 and Horrible Bosses 2).<br /><br />Nihilism can be a sound vehicle for a joyride through a strange world. But for me, there needs to be a bit more. Even in the midst of meaninglessness, people can care for and sacrifice for animals, ideals, family, games, jobs, or strangers who suffer. And they too should suffer when they lose those things. (In Requiem for a Dream, Harry and Marion give up each other for their addictions. It hurts because they love each other but lack the strength to leave heroine.) While Neormancer's (anti) heroes are often in pain, they don't really suffer or sacrifice. As a result, the book felt like a collection of great ideas about how the future might look, but a notstory I would recommend.",2015-01-14

Neuromancer weaves together the grittiness of a classic mystery Western with the suave sexiness of any modern day science-fiction novel with heroes who are painfully human, heroines who are fiercely sensual, and villains who are disturbingly likeable. Gibson exposes his reader to a possible future filled with corruption, body modification, revenge plots gone wrong, debilitating drug abuse – a future that is not so different from the current times, but is one that is simply made edgier with the addition of AIs, and better, more specialized versions of everything we have today. Most importantly, Neuromancer takes place in two places – the physical and the intangible, while simultaneously questioning which of those two places is more “real”. Is it in the world of meat, or in the matrix that we are we more human, more emotive, and more cognizant? It is a question that our hero, Case, struggles with for the majority of the book, as his life’s philosophy has been built upon a rejection of the physical and an embracement of the imaginative (that is, until a girl comes along).<br /><br />Gibson’s reader is continually asked to question the limits of human-ness, both within and without the matrix. We are presented with characters who seem more “real” than others – Molly is a human who comes off as cold and heartless, while Dixie “lives” as a computer program, exhibits tremendous amounts of warmth, humor, and care which far exceed the humans in the book. The “real” is questioned and toyed with – is the tangible, or is the matrix more real? Are humans or are programs more real? This is the true heart of the genre – fiction that uses science or technology to explore the human condition from a perspective otherwise impossible to see.",2014-09-04

Case's frames of mind are exemplified by and reflected in his surroundings; the grim emotions come out in the Sprawl, and his exuberant feelings surface in cyberspace.<br /><br />The Sprawl is a desolate place; a part of town where the dregs of society gather in an immense cloud of suffering and self-loathing. The Sprawl is aptly named, since quite a few of its regular inhabitants are almost always intoxicated and physically out of commission. Case, a former &#34;console cowboy&#34; who got his ability to surf the matrix destroyed, has nowhere else to turn but the Sprawl, since his life was cyberspace. Making runs for whoever would hire him was his job, he was good at it, and he never learned to do anything else. When he was expertly maimed by the people he double-crossed, he lost his life, metaphorically, and from that time on he slept in what was called a &#34;coffin,&#34; which was appropriate because he was dead, in a way. &#34;The damage was minute, subtle, and utterly effective. For Case, who'd lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it was the Fall. In the bars he'd frequented as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh. The body was meat. Case fell into the prison of his own flesh.&#34; Case always considered the real &#34;him&#34; to be the entity that could go into cyberspace, and when he could no longer do it, all he had left was the thing he had the most contempt for: his body.<br /><br />In the Sprawl, Case &#34;ran the loosest deals on the street&#34; because he no longer cared what happened to him. He runs drug deals on the black market, hustling drugs to other people, which is symbolic that he is helping them to get away from the &#34;prison&#34; of the body by deadening their minds so much they don't know they're miserable. And Case takes drugs himself while in the Sprawl; destroying his liver and kidneys and other body parts wantonly, not caring because his body is not important. He is often seen in low-level places like the Chatsubo, a bar, and the Jarre de Th&eacute;, a coffeehouse, where he thinks about his depression and uselessness as he drinks and does drugs to the point of oblivion.<br /><br />Case's attitude changes completely when his disabilities are fixed and he can reenter cyberspace. In his operation, he is somehow biochemically rewired to be unable to get high when he takes most kinds of drugs. This is symbolic, because he doesn't need titillation of the body anymore to be happy; he has the matrix. Specifically, the part of cyberspace that contrasts with the Sprawl is the beach scene near the end of the book. He is alone on a dreamlike beach with his love, Linda Lee. Cyberspace is like a dream come true for Case; it has many parallels with dreams, for one, he has no body, and two, time is not like realtime. During his operation, Case had toxin sacs bound to the inside of his main arteries, putting a time limit on his talent and only making having it that much sweeter. He is almost a god in cyberspace, king of his domain. He is an expert at what he does. However, he commits the ultimate ironic action: he leaves cyberspace and Linda because it's not real. Back in the Sprawl, he dreamed of the matrix, but now that the matrix is accessible to him again, he &#34;wakes up&#34; and sees that it is cyberspace, not realspace, and that he must learn to live with his body in the real world, detestable though it may be.e miserable.

Although Gibson's world is dark and gritty and, in many ways, rather dystopian, I want to live there, or at least visit often. The world-building in Neuromancer is seamlessly organic. There isn't any long-winded exposition regarding how things in the author's world are and how they got that way. They just are, there on the page, and it feels real. The futuristic setting is woven into the plot so tightly that it's hard to separate the two. Gibson is not just a good storyteller, he is a wordsmith. He writes almost lyrically, his turns of phrase both tight and fluid at the same time. I wish I had his chops.<br /><br />I first read Neuromancer in 1998, and it felt prophetic then. That hasn't changed. Even as real-world technology and society evolves, Neuromancer manages to keep pace. It's 2014 and Neuromancer is just as relevant and thought-provoking today as it was when it was first published way back in 1984. Aside from the conspicuous absence of cellular devices, the setting so brilliantly wrought in the novel still seems like it's just a couple of miles down the road, in our future. My not-yet-teenage kids could someday visit Chiba City and bump into Case or Molly Millions- Gibson makes it so easy to imagine. Neuromancer is a masterpiece of science fiction and, I would argue, English language literature in general. It is just as satisfying and immersive today, after many reads, as it was the first time I read it.<br /><br />If you end up reading Neuromancer and enjoy it, I highly recommend the other books in Gibson's Sprawl Trilogy, Count Zero, Mona Lisa Overdrive, and the three of the short stories in the collection Burning Chrome. Gibson's next three novels, known collectively as the Bridge Trilogy are good, but pale in comparison. That said, Gibson's \\""good\\"" is most other contemporary and current authors' best.",2014-07-10

The movie never came, and that makes me sad. Hopefully some day it will make it to the screen (it certainly would be easier now than it would have been in the early 90's).<br /><br />That being said, this isn't likely to appeal to most young kids. Its the sort of thing you should probably read in your late teen/early college years. Even though the book was authored about 30 years ago, it still maintains its futuristic feel. Of course some things that were firmly in the science fiction realm at that time are closer to reality now, but it remains a well told story with real depth. The prose doesn't coddle you. It expects that you will understand the world Gibson is showing you and quickly understand the mechanics.<br /><br />I strongly recommend it if you haven't read it yet.

This time it took just a few hours to finish.<br /><br /> Extending on some of the ideas from Ford's book 'Web of Angels' , Gibson's 'Neuromancer' (and his earlier short stories) is justly credited with jump starting the cyberpunk genre that has evolved into/from films such as 'The Matrix' and 'Blade Runner'. By inventing new words and twisting allusions to fit his narrative we get a story line that may not be too far off from being a reality.

US,1672424,R2DW4TGAX5DE1T,0441569595,769194143,Neuromancer,Books,3,1,1,N,N,"A mixed bag","Neuromancer centers around the adventures of Case and Molly - two high tech street hustlers who have been recruited by a mysterious employer to hack this, steal that, and jetset around the world, all for reasons unknown. Along the way they meet a rogue's gallery of anti-heroes, burnouts, psychopaths, and AIs, each with a secret agenda and no principles to speak of. All the while they struggle to uncover the identity and motivations of their shadowy employer. Given the premise, this book could have been a lot of fun. Unfortunately, it isn't.<br /><br />Case and Molly are, alas, bores. They never do anything interesting or unexpected. Molly beats people up, Case hacks computers. That's about it. The psychopaths do psychopath stuff, the burnouts do burnout stuff, and everything pretty much proceeds the way you would expect. That's not to say that there aren't plenty of plot twists - there are. But there's no character development. These people don't feel anything, and you won't feel anything for them. They're just props. That's a pretty serious flaw in any work of fiction. Wintermute is probably the most interesting character in the book, but he can't carry the weight of the story all by himself. In any case, you know a book has a problem when it's most interesting character is a computer program.<br /><br />Neuromancer does succeed at envisioning a radically different future, and yet, one that has its own internal logic and is more or less believable. The reader will have to overlook certain embarrassing oversights in order to immerse themselves - the absence of wireless communications is particularly distracting. Ofcourse Gibson couldn't have been expected to foresee everything in 1984 - but then again, Spock and Kirk had cell phones in 1968, so he could have been expected to foresee that. The need of the characters to get physically close to computers that they want to interface with is also somewhat irksome - especially since the book's chief plot point presumes the inter-connectivity of all computers. The internationalism of the book is another feature that I could have done without. Not because internationalism is bad, per se - globalization is real enough - but because it's forced. Gibson seems to make a point of mentioning a different city every other page or so. After 100 pages of this, it becomes a definite distraction. The same can be said of the occasional references to Yakuza. There are no Yakuza in this book. Gibson just seems to think that it's cool to mention them from time to time - presumably because Japanese mobsters are more interesting than the Brooklyn variety. Those of us who were alive in the 80's may recall the popular mania for all things Japanese. In this respect Neuromancer is very much a product of its time.<br /><br />However, the setting does have plenty to offer. The sprawling urban nightmare in which megacorps have supplanted national governments, and even the most basic kinds of animal life are considered exotic, is clearly a conceivable future. Indeed, it's happening. It's also entirely conceivable that our technology will one day slip the leash and become something new and frightening. Gibson deserves credit for taking a fresh approach to this golden oldie of science fiction. The way that all these elements jostle each other throughout the book is one of its chief appeals.<br /><br />I had mixed feelings on finishing this book. I'm sure it will stay with me for a long time. The basic ideas are solid and the world it imagines is compelling. But the characters and the plot are tragically weak, and that's hard to overlook.

The novel is a crowning achievement of literary fiction in every sense of the word, even so far as being the first winner of the science-fiction \\""triple crown\\"" -- the Nebula award, the Phillip K. Dick award, and the Hugo award. How's that for high praise? William Gibson, if you're reading this, pat yourself on the back. Neuromancer is a high-octane, adrenaline charged, drug fuelled, violence driven, technology tangled, sex soaked, psychedelic, techno-noire masterpiece. It's also really quite prophetic for the time it was written, considering its lyrical description/exploration of 'cyberspace' (a now common phrase, which Gibson invented) was put to paper when the internet itself wasn't fully realised and in people's homes until 1990.<br /><br />A lot of people claim that 'The Matrix' stole, or borrowed a lot from Neuromancer, and you certainly will notice the connections, but Gibson cleared this up in an interview, when he said: \\""Whatever of my work may be there, it seems to me to have gotten there by exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis I've always depended on myself. If there's NEUROMANCER in THE MATRIX, there's THE STARS MY DESTINATION and DHALGREN in NEUROMANCER, and much else besides, down to and including actual bits of embarrassingly undigested gristle.

As a result of events that transpire, which I won't describe, Case is hired by a dark cloaked man named Armitage (cough, Morpheus, cough), and his femme fatale henchwoman, dressed from head to toe in black leather, Molly (cough, Trinity), to crack a military AI system that Case later learns is split into two darkly mysterious, sentient cyber personalities. The book has a gritty edge to it, like a dark alleyway at night, and the world Neuromancer depicts is bleak and depressing; however, Gibson juxtaposes this sense of dread brilliantly with his subtle, and delicately poetic prose. It's a world clouded in technology, and one that we seem to be spiralling out of control towards, and yet it doesn't ever take the 'Brave New World' approach of judging or comparing it to any pre technological society.

If you want to read the book, I suggest you do the same.  Here's the Wikipedia summary for your benefit:<br /><br />&#34;Henry Dorsett Case is a low-level hustler in the dystopian underworld of Chiba City, Japan. Once a talented computer hacker, Case was caught stealing from his employer. As punishment for his theft, Case's central nervous system was damaged with a mycotoxin, leaving him unable to access the global computer network in cyberspace, a virtual reality dataspace called the &#34;Matrix&#34;. Unemployable, addicted to drugs, and suicidal, Case desperately searches the Chiba &#34;black clinics&#34; for a miracle cure. Case is saved by Molly Millions, an augmented &#34;street samurai&#34; and mercenary for a shadowy ex-military officer named Armitage, who offers to cure Case in exchange for his services as a hacker. Case jumps at the chance to regain his life as a &#34;console cowboy,&#34; but neither Case nor Molly knows what Armitage is really planning. Case's nervous system is repaired using new technology that Armitage offers the clinic as payment, but he soon learns from Armitage that sacs of the poison that first crippled him have been placed in his blood vessels as well. Armitage promises Case that if he completes his work in time, the sacs will be removed; otherwise they will dissolve, disabling him again. He also has Case's pancreas replaced and new tissue grafted into his liver, leaving Case incapable of metabolizing cocaine or amphetamines and apparently ending his drug addiction.<br /><br />Case develops a close personal relationship with Molly, who suggests that he begin looking into Armitage's background. Meanwhile, Armitage assigns them their first job: they must steal a ROM module that contains the saved consciousness of one of Case's mentors, legendary cyber-cowboy McCoy Pauley, nicknamed &#34;Dixie Flatline.&#34; Pauley's hacking expertise is needed by Armitage, and the ROM construct is stored in the corporate headquarters of media conglomerate Sense/Net. A street gang named the &#34;Panther Moderns&#34; is hired to create a simulated terrorist attack on Sense/Net. The diversion allows Molly to penetrate the building and steal Dixie's ROM.<br /><br />Case and Molly continue to investigate Armitage, discovering his former identity of Colonel Willis Corto. Corto was a member of &#34;Operation Screaming Fist,&#34; which planned on infiltrating and disrupting Soviet computer systems from ultralight aircraft dropped over Russia. The Russian military had learned of the idea and installed defenses to render the attack impossible, but the military went ahead with Screaming Fist, with a new secret purpose of testing these Russian defenses. As the Operation team attacked a Soviet computer center, EMP weapons shut down their computers and flight systems, and Corto and his men were targeted by Soviet laser defenses. He and a few survivors commandeered a Soviet military helicopter and escaped over the heavily guarded Finnish border. Everyone was killed except Corto, who was seriously wounded and heavily mutilated by Finnish defense forces attacking the helicopter as it landed. After some months in the hospital, Corto was visited by a Government military official and then medically rebuilt to be able to provide what he came to realize was fake testimony, designed to mislead the public and protect the military officers who had covered up knowledge of the EMP weapons. After the trials, Corto snapped, killing the Government official who contacted him and then disappeared into the criminal underworld.<br /><br />In Istanbul, the team recruits Peter Riviera, an artist, thief, and drug addict who is able to project detailed holographic illusions with the aid of sophisticated cybernetic implants. Although Riviera is a sociopath, Armitage coerces him into joining the team. The trail leads Case and Molly to a powerful artificial intelligence named Wintermute, created by the Tessier-Ashpool legacy, who spend most of their inactive time in cryonic preservation inside Villa Straylight, a labyrinthine mansion located at one end of Freeside, a cylindrical space habitat located at L5, and functioning primarily as a Las Vegas-style space resort for the wealthy.<br /><br />Wintermute's nature is finally revealed – it is one-half of a super-AI entity planned by the family, although its exact purpose is unknown. The Turing Law Code governing AIs bans the construction of such entities; to get around this, it had to be built as two separate AIs. Wintermute (housed in a computer mainframe in Bern, Switzerland) was programmed by the Tessier-Ashpool dynasty with a need to merge with its other half – Neuromancer (whose physical mainframe is installed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Unable to achieve this merger on its own, Wintermute recruited Armitage and his team to help complete the goal. Case is tasked with entering cyberspace to pierce the Turing-imposed software barriers using a powerful icebreaker program. At the same time, Riviera is to obtain the password to the Turing lock from Lady 3Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool, an unfrozen daughter clone and the current leader of Tessier-Ashpool SA. Wintermute believes Riviera will pose an irresistible temptation to her, and that she will give him the password. The password must be spoken into an ornate computer terminal located in the Tessier-Ashpool home in Villa Straylight, and entered simultaneously as Case pierces the software barriers in cyberspace – otherwise the Turing lock will remain intact.<br /><br />Armitage's team attracts the attention of the Turing Police, whose job is to prevent AIs from exceeding their built-in limitations. As Molly and Riviera gain entrance to Villa Straylight, three officers arrest Case and take him into custody; Wintermute manipulates the orbital casino's security and maintenance systems and kills the officers, allowing Case to escape. The Armitage personality starts to disintegrate and revert to the Corto personality as he relives Screaming Fist. It is revealed that in the past, Wintermute had originally contacted Corto through a bedside computer during his convalescence, eventually convincing Corto that he was Armitage. Wintermute used him to persuade Case and Molly to help it merge with its twin AI, Neuromancer. Finally, Armitage becomes the shattered Corto again, but his newfound personality is short-lived as he is killed by Wintermute.<br /><br />Inside Villa Straylight, Riviera meets with Lady 3Jane and tries to stop the mission, helping Lady 3Jane and Hideo, 3Jane's ninja bodyguard, to capture Molly. Worried about Molly and operating under orders from Wintermute, Case tracks her down with help from Maelcum, his Rastafarian pilot. Neuromancer attempts to trap Case within a cyber-construct where he finds the consciousness of Linda Lee, his girlfriend from Chiba City, who was murdered by one of Case's underworld contacts. Case manages to escape flatlining inside the construct by choosing of his own free will not to stay. Freeing himself, Case takes Maelcum and confronts Lady 3Jane, Riviera, and Hideo. Riviera tries to kill Case, but Lady 3Jane is sympathetic towards Case and Molly, and Hideo protects him. Riviera blinds Hideo, but flees when he learns that the ninja is just as adept without his sight. Molly then explains to Case that Riviera is doomed anyway, as he has been fatally poisoned by his drugs, which she had spiked. With Lady 3Jane in possession of the password, the team makes it to the computer terminal. Case ascends to cyberspace to guide the icebreaker to penetrate its target; Lady 3Jane is induced to give up her password, and the lock is opened. Wintermute unites with Neuromancer, fusing into a superconsciousness. The poison in Case's bloodstream is washed out, and he and Molly are handsomely paid for their efforts, while Pauley's ROM construct is apparently erased, at his own request.<br /><br />In the epilogue, Molly leaves Case. Case finds a new girlfriend, resumes his hacking work, and spends his earnings from the mission replacing his internal organs so that he can continue his previous drug use. Wintermute/Neuromancer contacts him, saying that it has become &#34;the sum total of the works, the whole show,&#34; and has begun looking for other AIs like itself. Scanning old recorded transmissions from the 1970s, the super-AI finds a lone AI transmitting from the Alpha Centauri star system. In the matrix, Case hears inhuman laughter, a trait associated with Pauley during Case's work with his ROM construct, thus suggesting that Pauley was not erased after all, but instead worked out a side deal with Wintermute/Neuromancer to be freed from the construct so he could exist in the matrix.<br /><br />In the end, while logged into the matrix, Case catches a glimpse of himself, his dead girlfriend Linda Lee, and Neuromancer. The implication of the sighting is that Neuromancer created a copy of Case's consciousness when it previously tried to trap him. The copy of Case's consciousness now exists with that of Linda's, in the matrix, where they are together forever.&#34;<br /><br />Otherwise, you'll probably have a hard time just following the plot.  I read the book because it is supposed to have won many awards.  But truly, it was very disappointing and from the reader's point of view, poorly written....ted in the Tessier-Ashpool home in Villa Straylight, and entered simultaneously as Case pierces the software barriers in cyberspace – otherwise the Turing lock will remain intact.<br /><br />Armitage's team attracts the attention of the Turing Police, whose job is to prevent AIs from exceeding their built-in limitations.

Finally, Armitage becomes the shattered Corto again, but his newfound personality is short-lived as he is killed by Wintermute.<br /><br />Inside Villa Straylight, Riviera meets with Lady 3Jane and tries to stop the mission, helping Lady 3Jane and Hideo, 3Jane's ninja bodyguard, to capture Molly. Worried about Molly and operating under orders from Wintermute, Case tracks her down with help from Maelcum, his Rastafarian pilot. Neuromancer attempts to trap Case within a cyber-construct where he finds the consciousness of Linda Lee, his girlfriend from Chiba City, who was murdered by one of Case's underworld contacts. Case manages to escape flatlining inside the construct by choosing of his own free will not to stay. Freeing himself, Case takes Maelcum and confronts Lady 3Jane, Riviera, and Hideo. Riviera tries to kill Case, but Lady 3Jane is sympathetic towards Case and Molly, and Hideo protects him. Riviera blinds Hideo, but flees when he learns that the ninja is just as adept without his sight. Molly then explains to Case that Riviera is doomed anyway, as he has been fatally poisoned by his drugs, which she had spiked. With Lady 3Jane in possession of the password, the team makes it to the computer terminal. Case ascends to cyberspace to guide the icebreaker to penetrate its target; Lady 3Jane is induced to give up her password, and the lock is opened. Wintermute unites with Neuromancer, fusing into a superconsciousness. The poison in Case's bloodstream is washed out, and he and Molly are handsomely paid for their efforts, while Pauley's ROM construct is apparently erased, at his own request.<br /><br />In the epilogue, Molly leaves Case. Case finds a new girlfriend, resumes his hacking work, and spends his earnings from the mission replacing his internal organs so that he can continue his previous drug use. Wintermute/Neuromancer contacts him, saying that it has become &#34;the sum total of the works, the whole show,&#34; and has begun looking for other AIs like itself. Scanning old recorded transmissions from the 1970s, the super-AI finds a lone AI transmitting from the Alpha Centauri star system. In the matrix, Case hears inhuman laughter, a trait associated with Pauley during Case's work with his ROM construct, thus suggesting that Pauley was not erased after all, but instead worked out a side deal with Wintermute/Neuromancer to be freed from the construct so he could exist in the matrix.<br /><br />In the end, while logged into the matrix, Case catches a glimpse of himself, his dead girlfriend Linda Lee, and Neuromancer. The implication of the sighting is that Neuromancer created a copy of Case's consciousness when it previously tried to trap him. The copy of Case's consciousness now exists with that of Linda's, in the matrix, where they are together forever.&#34;<br /><br />Otherwise, you'll probably have a hard time just following the plot.

Mega corps run a muck, an 80's view of the future internet, AI, the glitz and glimmer of a Tokyo night life and the mix of man and machine. The Main character Henry Case is a scoundrel on the brink of pretty much suicide and then the plot thickens. Case was a keyboard cowboy, a hacker, and one of the best... until he went on a run that burned his ability to jack into the interwebs cut permanently, or so he thought. Given the chance too have his link back into the wide world of the matrix, Case will do anything!

US,45039154,R2E7NRS2FCNRJK,0441569595,769194143,Neuromancer,Books,5,3,3,N,N,"A 30-year retrospective: Still a classic","I have read this book 3 times: once in the 1980s, again in the 1990s, and now. As the book was written in 1983, it's worth looking back and trying to place this work in a broader context of why it was special then, and why it remains so 30 years later. It is noteworthy for breaking from other science fiction, and for reflecting a postmodern, diffracted view of the future. The novel does this through several unique features.  1. Blend of old and new. There are many references to old technology, and Gibson often refers to things using historical metaphors. A bot is the size of a &#34;baseball,&#34; a character holds a weapon like a &#34;Regency duelist.&#34; In the space station, there are rows of museum-like cabinets that Case is intrigued by but that Molly could care less about. There is no sense that we are living in a clearly separated &#34;future.&#34; Rather, the past and present blend in this future.  What is fascinating about this is that is how we live our lives now; we buy paper books but search for what to read on the internet. Old technology and new technology exist at the same time, and this makes Gibson's work stand apart from works in which humanity has left all that old stuff behind. This sense that time is slippery, that there is no monolithic &#34;future&#34; in this future, also fits with a postmodern viewpoint. Time, like memory itself, flits back and forth, and objects from different time periods exist in this future now.  Contrast that to much of science fiction, where many times even Earth is just a memory, and no reference is made to humanity's (presumably awful or irrelevant) past. The future is everything in such books, but that does not jibe with our own, real-life experience of past, present, and future. (Steampunk is a science fiction genre that foregrounds such notions through a time collage).  2. Dark, noirish world. Compared to other award-winning novelists of his day, Gibson is clearly influenced by a post-Vietnam mindset, wherein American transcendence was being questioned in many areas. We see this in his references to bits of technology; the mentions of American technology are few (most of them firearms); instead, Braun (not GE) makes everything from coffee pots to a remote droid. A rich European family has its own space station, and the main characters look for work in Chiba, not San Francisco. There was indeed a war in Gibson's world, and two of the characters were psychologically scarred by it, a direct parallel to Vietnam.  This is not the world envisioned in prior generations of science fiction, which was dominated by a modernist, American spirit of post-World War II technical and moral superiority. Some science fiction from the same post-Vietnam period, such as David Brin's &#34;Uplift&#34; series and the &#34;Star Wars&#34; trilogy, are throwbacks to this earlier, post-WWII way of thinking. That older form of science fiction did not fit the world many readers were living in in the 1980s, and Gibson extrapolates a new and different world that is unlike other science fiction writers were envisioning (except for maybe Philip K. Dick, earlier). Gibson's frequent references to chrome, mirrors, silver, and mercury are a dig at that older style of science fiction. Whereas in the 1950s chrome was something that represented a bright, shiny future, in this world, chrome misleads and mirrors hide; the truth, like mercury, is elusive. This sense of a slippery reality makes &#34;Neuromancer&#34; a postmodern work, and a break from the past.  3. Marginal characters. Many characters in science fiction are automatically competent. We see this in other post-Vietnam science fiction; Brin's characters, for example, are skilled scientists and engineers (just like real astronauts were in the 1950s). In &#34;Star Wars,&#34; Han is a skilled smuggler, Leia a diplomat, and even young Luke can fly exceptionally well. And these individuals are always doing interesting things and on the cutting-edge of doing something important and universe changing.  Not so with Case. He is at the low end of society. He lives in a cubicle-like hotel (the kind that held so much fascination for Americans in the 1980s, when we marveled at a Japan that was making better cars and electronics than the USA, but who seemed -- seemed -- to live like bees or ants in such hotels, if only on drunken weeknights). In Gibson's world, the characters are pawns, manipulated by an artificial intelligence. Gibson's world is not one where individuals have much power, or competence. To expect Molly, Case, Armitage, or the other characters to do more, to control events, to drive the plot, is to expect another kind of science fiction.  Perhaps, most of all, this shift is driven home by the Rastafarians, who have always been my favorite characters and are important to sense that this is another type of science fiction. They are more skilled than Case, as they know how to operate the space gear and how to move in zero-gee. The skilled astronauts we see in this kind of science fiction are not Case (the lead character), nor a John-Glenn type, nor a Han Solo. They are the laborers brought up by the rich to make sure that Freeside -- a sort of private cruise ship -- works. Tellingly, it is worth noting that these space jockeys are not Caucasians, and not even Americans, a significant departure from a 1950s outlook.  This is also a future where there are no governments, where supranational groups like zaibatsu, yakuza, and Tessier-Ashpool are dominant, and where even computer programs (AIs) act beyond human, let alone government, control. (It's significant that the Rastas are not identified as Jamaicans, as that would imply that they come from a country or other governmental body called Jamaica). This represents a breakdown of the modern structures of science fiction; indeed, there is no mention of the United Nations or similar future Earth government -- such a staple of science fiction -- in Gibson's postmodern world.The old, modernist world is gone.  4. Language of the future. Gibson stands apart from most science fiction writers in that he has created a sense of character through an ear for dialogue, and his expansive use of metaphor. He can be a challenge to read, and he is somewhere between a Chaucer (whose English is so old that it takes an effort to read, even though it is technically still English) and a James Joyce, whose &#34;Ulysses&#34; is stylistically demanding and he wrote in the same century as Gibson. What Gibson does is give us a language of the future. It is like the English we know, but not. It is the English of broken, short thoughts, in a world where books are not read, magazines are old technology, and English (or whatever it is in this book) is truly spoken, living, and not meant to be read. The book remains very creative in this regard, and reveals something about the characters, their upbringing, and their ways of thinking.   Too, the sense of an unclear reality -- that language does not determine reality or truth -- marks the novel as a postmodern one. Language is a code, and either you get it, or not. Sometimes, you're not meant to, and that is exactly the point. Meaning is illusory, and sometimes, as if staring into Molly's mirrored-eyes and searching for a connection, all you see is yourself looking back at you.  5. Cyberspace. It is difficult to convince anyone who has grown up with computers and &#34;The Matrix&#34; films how progressive and imaginative this book was in the 1980s. To put this in perspective, Gibson tried to (a) create a completely computerized world, (b) in prose, (c) on a typewriter, (d) before most home computers had icon-driven operating systems, let alone internet access, and still ran on cassettes. (Cassettes are referred to several time in the book, perhaps the only anachronism that roots this book in 1983). Gibson (no doubt building on Vernor Vinge's novella &#34;True Names,&#34; as Gibson refers to at one point how true names may be used to bring up a demon-AI), created or popularized a whole lexicon for virtual reality. Anyone who has played a MMO online has some sense of what this must be like, although Gibson's next step of a user actually experiencing such a reality is still relevant. Much of transhumanist fiction owes something to Gibson's concepts, such as the notion of a computerized personality (a few characters continue to live as programs in cyberspace), or the simstim, whereby a person experiences what another person does, which is similar to the transhuman idea of slotting into another person's body.  The constant drug references suggest that Gibson created something influenced by the drug culture -- the ability to travel into an infinite inside, or a computerized world that synched with one's brain. This is not a star-spanning space opera, but one that is driven inward. He is able to take one bit of technology -- computers -- and imagine what a completely digitized world could be like. Wrapped with the other elements that make this novel stand out, Gibson stands apart from Vinge and created something fresh and vibrant.  This simulated reality, the idea that the unreal world of cyberspace is indeed a reality in its own right, or that one can experience what another character does through simstim without &#34;being&#34; them, marks the book as a postmodern novel. The fact that some beings live in cyberspace as constructs, or that the AI poses as Finn or a general, creates this sense of a slippery &#34;reality.&#34; The nature of AI and the unsettling questions raised in this novel (How does AI exist? What form does it take? Where does it exist? How does it regard humans? Is it ethical to capture a person's identity as a construct? How do two AI beings regard each other?) are meant to provoke doubts about the nature of the self -- a postmodern line of inquiry.  In conclusion, science fiction fans will want to continue to read (and re-read) &#34;Neuromancer&#34; for what setsGibson apart from other works of his time, what came before him, and his influence on later work. Whether or not you find &#34;Neuromancer&#34; enjoyable on its own terms, the novel remains one of the hallmark books in the literature, and worth reading for that reason alone. It not only spawned cyberpunk, but influenced future authors and genres (Richard K. Morgan's brand of transhumanism being just one example). Lastly, it represents a postmodern break from other science fiction, and questions the assumptions in American science fiction before that point.",2013-11-10

If you sit down to read this great book thinking you will finish it in a day or two, you will likely be disappointed at feeling that your mind needs a break every 20 pages or so.  And if you decide to give up before you get to the meat and potatoes, you will not understand that the first half of the book just sets up the much better second half of the book.<br /><br />What makes this book so great?  Well, the story itself is pretty good.  By no means the best storyline of all time, but intriguing and certainly a page-turner as the plot thickens about half way through.  Character development is solid, and Gibson does an excellent job taking a bit of an unlikable person and making him a protagonist that you can get behind.  He also plays a lot of nice tricks with the various potential supporting characters/antagonists in this story.  Very few of the characters are predictable, and most of the major characters have a good balance of good/bad that keeps you from ever really knowing who is on whose side.<br /><br />But what really makes this book great?  The concept.  Without this book, there is no 'Matrix Trilogy' (which I would suggest took more than just a little bit from this book).  This book may not have been the first in the Cyberpunk genre, but was one of the first and certainly The One that brought Cyberpunk to the level of popularity it has today.  This book is also as prophetically accurate as Orwell's '1984' -- when you consider this book was itself, perhaps ironically, written in 1984 before we had the internet and before we knew what the next 30 years would bring, it is quite amazing what Gibson was able to imagine.  Finally, the book is very dark and edgy, and I do not mean in that sort of trendy pseudo-dark-and-edgy type of way.<br /><br />Once you reach the ending of the book, you will want to read it again just so you can go back and understand what was really happening in the first 100 or so pages.  Well, you might need to give your brain a little break first.  But if you allow yourself to reach the end, you will understand why this book is considered one of the best SciFi books ever.",2013-06-02

It's not an easy read -- the very thing that makes it rewarding, also makes it frustrating. Where most authors would use fiction as a license to entirely fabricate the world they write, William Gibson has created a future so incredibly rich and educated it's startling at times. I found myself often lost and uninformed about the technological details of his world and would have to make the occasional dip into Wikipedia for a better understanding. To my surprise, much of the stuff he writes about is actual stuff. That might sound obvious, but when you read his writing, see firsthand how layered his work is, and consider that much of it is tethered to real-world concepts, it's astonishing to think so much can float about one man's imagination.<br /><br />For instance, there is a space station in the book called Freeside. It occupies the 5th Lagrangian point, AKA L5 orbital configuration. If this means nothing to you, don't expect an explanation of what L5 is. You'll have to do the research yourself. Neuromancer is rife with stuff like this. And therein lies the difficulty: there is almost no exposition. Much of the world -- it's slang, it's perversions of our own world -- aren't explained. They are dropped into our laps and we're expected to go along.<br /><br />Now, if you don't mind working for your fiction, or better yet, you get a high from being challenged, I don't expect this to be a problem. We live in a world where information is readily accessible, so finding out these little background tidbits isn't too much work. It would have been a lot more work to read in 1984, when this book was first published, and the only way to cross-reference was either owning Encyclopedia Britannica or making a trip to your local library.<br /><br />That being said, I feel there are some hindrances in reading this book 30 years later. Most of which are in Gibson's handling of cyberspace or more commonly now called the Internet -- maybe you've heard of it. When he wrote Neuromancer in the early 80s, the Internet was but a glimmer in Al Gore's eyes, and in the eyes of almost everybody. Gibson was writing about cyberspace with nothing to compare it, other than what he could conceive. Writing/reading about cyberspace in the 80s meant you approached the material with a blank slate; no preconceived notions of what it should be. But now, it's a different story. I found myself at times fighting the urge to envision Gibson's cyberspace as today's Internet, but the two are different. Gibson's version of cyberspace is much more visual, immersive, and vastly more abstract. At times, it's so visual/abstract it's unclear what talents Case (the protagonist) possesses as a hacker that other non-hackers don't. There's no technical know-how: it seems he maneuvers through cyberspace much in the same way someone would maneuver through real life (e.g., walking and running), albeit lacking some basic physical laws. I spoke about this with a friend of mine, and we concluded Case's talents are somewhat implicit. His ability to maneuver through cyberspace is quite effortlessly skillful -- often very talented people make what they do seem easy to the layperson. Such is the case (no pun intended) here.<br /><br />Having reread what I just wrote, I feel as though I'm griping more than praising. A bit weird for a 4-star review (it really should be a 4.5-star review), but these are the issues that standout the most. Other than these hurdles, this is an impressive book: eye-opening, large in scale and in ideas, and touches upon many of the philosophical quandaries pervasive technology poses to our culture. Certainly cybernetics will be, and is, the philosophical minefield of our near-future, and Neuromancer manages to tightly wrap this up in hardboiled fiction. A meal, indeed.ve heard of it.

I gave it two stars because It wasn't the worst book I've ever read.<br /><br />When a book becomes tedious to read, it is time to put it down and do something else. Tedious is what Neuromancer is to me. The characters are flat and unlikeable in any context.  To find a reason to cheer for their success or for their demise would have been an improvement to the story, but there was no reason. I hoped, while reading through the first half, that the story would improve, but it did not. The characters were just as annoying at the halfway point as on their introductory pages.<br /><br />I found the dialogue annoying.  I \\""got\\"" all of the jargon, but I hated the way it was used.

I dunno, but I'm gonna do it.\\""<br /><br />A while back, I read and greatly enjoyed Ernest Cline's [[ASIN:0307887448 Ready Player One: A Novel]] which was described as \\""Neuromancer as written by an '80s-nostalgic gamer.\\""  While cyberpunk is not a genre I've cared to explore much in the past, I figured I owed it to myself to read the book that helped inspire one of my favorite novels.  Besides, this one was considered something of a science-fiction classic, and I figured it would be an entertaining read.<br /><br />Sadly, I found \\""Neuromancer\\"" suffered in comparison to \\""Ready Player One,\\"" and I gave up before the halfway mark.  I found it too confusing, too full of unexplained slang, and too difficult to care about any of the characters.<br /><br />\\""Neuromancer\\"" is the story of Case, a brilliant computer hacker who stabs one of his employers in the back and is repaid by being infected with a toxin that cripples his ability to access the network.  He inhabits a nearly unrecognizable Japan, working dangerous assignments in the hopes that one of his deals will result in his death.  When a mysterious new employer and his sidekick, an assassin with razorblade fingers and mirror-lenses in place of eyes, offer to restore his ability to hack in exchange for a favor, he agrees... only to find his healing comes with a price, and he must do as his \\""benefactor\\"" commands... or suffer an agonizing death.<br /><br />I will give \\""Neuromancer\\"" one thing -- it's good at conveying a brutal, gritty future similar to \\""Blade Runner,\\"" where danger lurks around every corner, human life is cheap, and the average citizen thinks ahead only so far as the next deal or the next hit of whatever feeds their addiction.  Gibson makes it abundantly clear that the future is going to be a dark and dirty place despite all our technological advances, and that heightened tech will not eliminate crime and villainy, only enable criminals and villains to get more creative in their schemes and scams.  It makes for a slightly depressing read, but it's fascinating nonetheless, like peeling back a fallen log or a rock to see what lives underneath.<br /><br />What killed my desire to finish \\""Neuromancer\\"" was two things -- a confusing narrative with no clear direction, and characters I couldn't bring myself to care about.  Gibson fills his book with futuristic slang and names without explaining them, forcing the reader to guess at what he's trying to talk about.  I don't mind a book coming up with its own slang, as it helps define the world and the era better, but if the book also fails to explain what said slang means, it only ends up losing the reader.  Even something as simple as a glossary of slang terms would have been helpful.  That and there seemed to be no overarching plot -- things just kept happening, for seemingly no reason, and without the main character doing a thing to move things along.<br /><br />The character issue bothered me the most.  I learned almost nothing about Case as I read, only that he was a semi-suicidal computer hacker trying to get his abilities back.  He has no motivation aside from that, and no defining character traits, let alone character traits that led me to care about him at all.  He's not the only one -- nobody in this book is likable.  Everyone is out to get everyone else, or at the very least perfectly willing to stab a friend or ally in the back to protect themselves or get ahead.  When a woman Case is close to dies early on, I can't bring myself to feel bad about it -- she was so vaguely defined it was simply crossing a name off a list, not killing a character the reader actually cared about.<br /><br />In the end, I couldn't finish this book.  There was no compelling story, no likable characters, and copious amounts of unexplained slang that made it a chore to figure out what was going on.  The world was fascinating, but at the same timeit feels like the same futuristic \\""Blade Runner\\"" world we've come to expect from a \\""cyberpunk\\"" story.

Science fiction went somewhere, but it didn't bring me along for the ride.  Heinlein got bloated.  Asimov went for quantity instead of quality.  Bradbury stopped slinging his new stories out into the world.  Most of the new sci-fi kids on the block seemed to favor flash and mood and tricks instead of basic story-telling.  If a book is too much work and not enough fun, I stop and find something else to read.  I tried to read VIRTUAL LIGHT, MONA LISA OVERDRIVE, and one I particularly wanted to enjoy, THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE.  But I didn't finish any of them.  Later, I tried IDORU.  I have not tried his more recent work.  How picky am I?  Every time I read the first sentence to NEUROMANCER I want to remove the comma.<br /><br />NEUROMANCER is a piece of work.

The usage in the book refers to a drug induced state, but both the term and the state can  accurately describe the writings of William Gibson.<br /><br />If you read and enjoy William Gibson you quickly realize reading his stuff is work, not fun.<br /><br />It's enjoyable enough, but you need to pay attention.  Many but still all too seldom gifted writers over the years have had this ability, the ability to convey as much within the spaces between the words as within the words themselves.  Perhaps even more so than Thomas Disch, a writer so talented he could<br />rarely connect on a mass market level, Gibson is unapologetic and remorseless with his narrative and his genius.<br /><br />30 years ago, we all read Stanislaw Lem's books, scratched our heads, and realized while we may or may not have enjoyed it there were levels we would never<br />truly grasp.  We decided to avoid the subject whenever possible at dinner parties.<br /><br />In today's age, with someone of Gibson's ability, we now have a distinct internet advantage that can be used to remain better connected and achieve a<br />better commonality and grasp of the Seven Dials, or the armor plating restraints on a Maybach limousine, or how wasps build nests in concentric spirals of<br />cloned spawn.  Or the countless and priceless other trival commonalities that Gibson has related.  If literary genius exists it is often found in the well described form of the ability to create new analogy.  When those who can compare and relate the unrelatable, doorways of perception are revealed heretofore hidden.<br /><br />With Gibson's writing I find the true spirit of American SF, and if the truth were known, the reincarnation of one of its best, Bradberry.  I'm aware this is akin to pairing acetone and fire.  At an emotional and empathic level I find them twins, separated by birth, but borne from the same Muse's womb.  Ray had an advantage however, he was writing in an earlier time where a commonality of experience could at least be assumed for the majority of his reading public.  Growing up in 1930's Illinois may have seemed wonderful and unique when viewed through Bradberry's eyes, but the kid reading it in 50's California was receiving the same hurts and joys in the end.<br /><br />This is no longer the case in the 21st century as we have all become aware.  The more we become connected through Gibson's chimera, the world wide web, the internet, call it what you will, the more isolated and physically untouched by others we become.  We have a lot of gifted writers in the early 21st century.  Somewhat amazing when you consider the inevitable demise of SF as an art form.  The vast majority these days, Banks, Adams, Reynolds, Gaiman,<br />Bacigalupi, appear to be coming from the usual font of creativity, which has always been England.  There, I'm a Yank and I just said it.  I won't try to sell England by the pound, but I will quickly note that there is either something in the water or the educational cat o' nine tails that is the public school system in England that inspires creative genius, creativity, and the need to find outlets for same.<br />But enough about England.<br /><br />In America, a different place and pace, we seem to have inspired few true writers who can stand amongst the greats.  America, with no identity to speak of, has always had a poor grasp of the subtle differences that seem to divide us but really bond us.<br /><br />Gibson has the talent to expose unique little moments that define his characters as real and bind them to our world.  Truly unique moments that no one else would have considered.  The amazing reality to those unique moments and sub themes in his work are that they are not unique at all, but absolutely common to the readers in some way or fashion.<br />Bradberry'esqueindeed.<br /><br />We read it, smile, internally say \\""yes...I've been there...done the same thing\\"" and suddenly you find yourself not only enjoying the strict discipline<br />required to read Gibson, but liking Gibson himself.<br /><br />He connects with you on this level.<br /><br />Sharing his piercing needle moments of crucifixion with each pinned specimen of death head moth.",2013-01-12

This felt very Blade Runner as I dove into it. Gritty technicolored futuristic slums. The wonder flying above the garbage. I thought it was interesting after I finished this, I read that Blade Runner came out while he was writing it and he thought for sure everyone would pan him as a rip-off hack.<br /><br />Hitting the book itself: For being written in the 80's I never thought it wasn't the future of today. The advance of the internet into virtual reality, the power of cyberspace upon the real world, the advance of Anonymous before they even existed, the rise of the overseas (especially Asia,) the mighty leap we will eventually make into space and the kinds of technology that will lunge us into new life or destroy us (Terminator). Some quite powerful ideas layered with a decent action plot and subterfuge that made a few parts of the book suspenseful and interesting. Throw in some twists and some rhetorical ideas, some philosophy that makes you do some personal considerations. A page turner for those 3 reasons, the view of the future, the plot and the subtle ideas thrown in.<br /><br />The two reasons I'm not giving it 5 stars are: The story itself gets a little garbled on a few occasions, like it falls into a pit on accident and you have no idea why it slipped and after it crawls out and you get your bearings back you have no idea why they were trying to dig instead of use the ladder. (Hopefully that made you get an idea for what I mean)<br />Second, he purposefully uses this kind of... Garbled jargon. To give you sort of an idea of future lingo without any understanding of what it means or any point to it. I thought it was kind of interesting after I learned that he meant for it to be garbled jargon to just kinda... Sling something around in your brain but during the course I was like \\""Wtf does this even mean and why did he bother to say it?\\"" It made the story flounder a moment while I reread a paragraph here or there and couldn't make heads or tails of what it meant. I think he could have used real jargon or made up things as jargon and actually explained a bit to make my mind open wider than it did.<br /><br />Overall a great book worth a read. I may even reread it again someday, far down the road to see how his ideas are coming along in 20 or 30 years.

It has a noir tone like an old detective or crime thriller novel. Gibson writes in a semi-prose, semi-poetic, semi-flow of consciousness style that really fits (or maybe it establishes) the book's atmosphere, which was dark, surreal, and sometimes ephemeral.  His ideas don't kick me in the stomach with a steel toed boot. Instead they build in thin layers that become something quite substantial by the end of the book. Much of the time I felt like I didn't understand what was going on, but I would push through only to find that confusing moment made total sense later on. I went back and re-read many sections after learning something later in the story and saying to myself, \\""Oh! Now it makes sense.\\""  Gibson introduces characters and settings sort of like the reader is supposed to already know who and where they are. It's challenging sometimes, but he never left me hanging; explanations come, but they come by way of showing rather than telling, and that is a process which requires no mean talent by the writer and a little dedication from the reader. It's worth it in the end.<br /><br />I wish I had read Neuromancer in the 90s, but I wonder if I would have been able to fully comprehend it without my modern, internet awareness.  In hindsight, Neuromancer is a little dated (data is stored on tapes, for instance, and there's no real notion of computer networks going \\""wireless\\"") and its concepts aren't so cutting edge anymore. In 1984, however, and for at least a decade and a half after it was published, this book must have challenged thinking, and pushed boundaries.

Gibson's attack on the previous decades of science fiction is relentless and well-realized with a haunting, powerful image of a future that's all too easy to believe.  His writing style is distinctive in that it puts you into the mind of the characters inhabiting their time, not an onlooker.  As a result it drops you into their daily lives and as the story unfolds you start to see his world as his characters do.  Beyond that the plot has action, adventure, a little humor, and strong philosophical concepts that get even stronger on repeat readings.  It can be a little dense in the beginning (about the first twenty pages) not because it's packed with fabricated information that doesn't advance the story but because the style is unlike most other authors the reader is probably familiar with, a trait that continues to his modern day stories as well.<br /><br />Because it comes up often I recommend Neal Stephenson's \\""Snow Crash\\"" as well but Gibson's book flows significantly better as a story (no monologue history lessons for the entire middle third of the book) with plot driving it expertly.

Drawn by the flashy cover I picked it up, read and then reread the first few paragraphs a half-dozen times. I closed the book, bought it, and took it home. I have never been without a copy since then.  From the opening line of William Gibson's science-fiction-noir-mystery I was totally enthralled. He opens with a single-sentence description; a phrase that might begin any number of books in any number of genres, along the lines of...It was a dark and stormy night. Its familiarity brought me right into the story, but it's the comparison that Gibson created that set the tone of this entire book, \\""...television, tuned to a dead channel.\\"" It evoked images of a technological snow, a mixture of flowing black and white dots that creates a very singular type of gray. Describing it as dead Gibson sets a pessimistic tone, lacking in any hope for his hero, Case, the former cyberspace cowboy. Case presents an intuitive description by a jaded person who has a more intimate relationship with technology than an open sky.   Gibson compares technology to nature throughout the book. The opening page offers collisions of expectations; a bartender with an antique motorized prosthetic arm; a sailor with rows of tribal scarring contrasted against a crisp white naval uniform. Technology as natural elements highlights the disjointed nature of this society and pits these images of unsavory characters against the clean nature we expect of our own technology. This rapid series of images gives an instant feeling of an aged and outdated future.   Gibson is almost Hemingwayesque with short, nearly choppy sentences. The technique envelopes us in a world of sensory overload, where thoughts come as fast as advertisements, and stay no longer. Gibson breaks up sentences, observing distinct moments, adding emphasis to every clause. He makes you read them, taking each point almost on its own, leading you down a familiar path, and then, within the same sentence, he spins you around to see the familiar in an unfamiliar way...   The sky as television static.  This all mirrors the world of which he's writing - flashes of the familiar. There is no interpretation, no equivocation. Gibson's descriptions are as absolute as the world Case lives in, telling you that those who take too long to think, lose. The speed takes Case from one isolated thought to another, leaving behind a trail to show how his past got him here, where the story begins. For Case, these are facts. Real people deal with real facts and it works in a mystery. It's best for a mystery hero to be as black and white as he can. If he doubts nothing, how can we?  Case is a broken man, a once hotshot cyberspace cowboy, now a two-bit dealer trying to convince the streets to kill him. He's tracked down by Molly, hired muscle in a cat suit with mirrors for eyes. Lured by a job he can no longer do, his new boss, Armitage, a mercenary designed from the ground up, promises to repair Case's chemically fried nervous system, the revenge of powerful men Case once stole from. The job is to crack the security of an AI called Wintermute, one of the artificial super-minds that inhabit the upper reaches of cyberspace. No mere human has ever cracked an AI, but that's okay because they have help. Somehow, in spite of all the safeguards and protocols, Wintermute is the one who's hired them. Case discovers that what the AI wants may change the very nature of cyberspace itself, but hell, it's just another job.  The pace of the action is set through the author's brevity. Action is absorbed, not contemplated, described in a few short bursts of words. But it's cut with moments of thoughtfulness or reflection denoted by longer, calmer sentences that force you to slow down.   Gibson is a master at setting the pace he wants you to follow, and he wants you to follow Case as a mere reactive animal prowling a dangerous world. Gibson has captured the style inherit in the hard-bitten, cynical detective genre and paired it with a warped science fiction to create a story that is both familiar and unreal. He uses our expectations to lull us into his tale and then twists it on us to show a future that seems like tomorrow, but one that we hope will never come.   There has never been another book that has so affected me from the opening lines.",2011-11-09

The story is confusing for various reasons, but the plot boils down to this: In a dark future, a hacker and a female mercenary are hired to steal software, by a mysterious boss.  They don't know who they're working for or why (as the man who hired them is only the spokesman for their real boss), so they do some investigating. Early on they learn that their employer is a self-aware computer program, who is hiring them to steal software for him to make himself more powerful.<br /><br />THE PLOT: The plot is what many people have trouble with. I myself had to read the book twice and refer to summaries online to understand the basics of the story, and even now there are details I'm still confused about. Part of the problem is that the characters speak in a made-up future slang, and the author doesn't explain what many of these terms mean. Gibson likes to \\""show\\"" in his books, rather than \\""tell.\\"" You don't have to be super-smart to understand his book, but you might need to give it more attention than most. If you think about what a character is seeing in a scene, then you can probably piece together what's going on, like if you were watching a movie.  And of course, even when you do have the story figured out, there's the fact that you've probably seen a lot of it before by now. \\""Neuromancer\\"" was original when it came out, but by now, ideas of virtual reality, sentient computer programs, and so on have been used in countless other sci-fi stories.<br /><br />But that's okay, because the plot isn't what keeps people coming back to \\""Neuromancer.\\"" Not me anyway. I didn't read this book four times because I just wanted to rehash the *plot.* I came back to get to know the characters better, to explore the setting more, and to feel that atmosphere again.<br /><br />THE SETTING/ATMOSPHERE: Gibson's future remains unique, even though many elements like cyborgs and virtual reality are nothing new, and you've probably seen some movie that showed a dark post-apocalyptic future. It's not his technology that remains fresh and fascinating, it's the atmosphere. If you've visited the darker parts of any big city, or just attended a shady high-school, Gibson's world will seem familiar to you--but more exciting, of course. Instead of using literary cliches, Gibson knows how to pick words that get a very specific feeling across. Another thing he's mastered is giving you a very clear impression of a place or character, just by mentioning a few specific details.<br /><br />CHARACTERS: This book has some of the most fun and most relatable characters I've ever encountered. Gibson gives them the little quirks of real people, rather than writing as if for a movie. His characters are three-dimensional and well developed. Particularly well-done are his protagonist, Case, and the female side-kick Molly, two archetypes that most commonly fail in fiction. Too often, the protagonist is given a bland personality so that any reader can put themselves in his shoes. But Case is given a very defined personality, one that the reader probably won't find likable (but might find relatable). Molly is tough and beautiful, like most female leads in stories, but Gibson doesn't leave it at that. She too has a defined personality and back-story. And in addition to being Case's possible love-interest, she also takes the role of the experienced friend who shows him the ropes of life. The sexual aspects of Molly's past are explored in a serious way, used to make her sympathetic, rather than to make her a sex-symbol.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who likes character-driven stories, science fiction books that challenge your mind, or anything with a dark moody atmosphere.

As a big fan of the sci-fi, futuristic genre, I read the myriad rave reviews for Neuromancer and bought it on the spot.  Being captive on a plane for about 3.5 hours, I got through a good portion of the book, but in the coming days, and then weeks, I discovered that I was forcing myself to continue reading (sometimes a page at a time, one or two pages per day), until over a month later, I finally finished.  Now this is a bad sign, when you finish reading a book and your first thought is \\""finally!\\"" rather than \\""wow!\\""  Ultimately, I think the book is plagued by three major problems:  1. The \\""action\\"" takes a VERY long time to get underway.  The entire beginning of the book is dedicated to a back-story that is neither interesting or particularly relevant to rest of the story.  2. The author seems overly preoccupied with describing every miniscule detail of every environment and every character, almost entirely without purpose other than to impress the reader.  For instance, instead of describing an office as sparsely decorated, with a few colourful adjectives, the description consists of paragraphs minutiae about the texture on the walls and floors and desk and the things on the desk and the flickering lighting the creak in the door and the smell and the guy's face and his mannerisms and what the main character thinks of him and then some longwinded back-story about the guy that we've just meet and ... I found myself constantly thinking \\""ENOUGH ALREADY, JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!\\""  I'd say at least 70 percent of this book is descriptions that I could have done without.  3. The only character even mildly compelling is a tertiary character who's appearances don't seem to serve the story at all.  I had no interest in the affairs of any of these people.  To put it succinctly, I was pretty much just reading tofind out what happens at the end.  In that regard, I was again let down.  I am disappointed that I was disappointed by this book, considering all of the critical acclaim.  I really wanted to like it.  I tried.

Unfortunately, I actually stopped reading this book about two thirds through (which I almost never do!), after forcing myself to read it many times & then I skimmed forward several times.  Honestly, I don't think I lost anything.  Bad sign.  I give it two stars for its very interesting concept, particularly since it was written in the 1980s.  However, a book can't rest on its concept alone.  Problems:  1.  Unintelligible dialogue and action. Truly, you absolutely have zero idea what the hell the characters are talking about or what the hell they're doing.  Not just once or twice.  MANY times. If you like reading cryptic pretentious dialogue meant to stand for meaning, go ahead.  I don't.    2.  I often felt that the author himself had no idea how a technology or device could happen--he just magically made it happen, and then masked the fact that he had no idea how by using garbled or cryptic descriptions.  I have no problems with sci fi in which we don't understand how something happens.  Authors like Vernor Vinge include hyper-futuristic technology all the time.  What I have problems with is PRETENTIOUSNESS.  Gibson liked to pretend he actually DID know what he was talking about and that you the reader are just not hip, cool or smart enough to understand it. Nonsense.  3.  You really, really don't care about the characters because the characters are very two dimensional.  Ok, it's film noir-ish.  But the plot didn't make up for the lack of character.  No big twists or insights.  Actually, there was almost no plot--sort of a stupid device about a third of the way through to 'get' the protagonist to cooperative with the secretive Mastermind, then a lot of indecipherable action, most of which you really have no idea what is going on or what is at stake, on a deeper level.  This was a big 'so what'?  Again, the concept itself is very cool and was groundbreaking at the time.  So if you read a book mostly for concept, go ahead.  But if you like to at least understand what you're reading, it's just not worth it.  And I really resent pretentiousness.",2011-09-22

His opening line in this novel, said by critics everywhere as being clever and descriptive and enticing, goes: \\""The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.\\"" Well, you gotta love a style like that, and the writing style and glitter of techno-words is what drew me into this novel. Gibson sure can describe things in a real interesting way. The novel is set sometime in a dystopic future where everybody is either wired to the Internet or has various body modifications and weird implants. It takes a bit of reading to catch the wonderful and quotable narration of this world. But it is fun and engrossing once you are rolling.<br /><br />The story is of a cyberspace junkie named Case, who spent his time in a strange version of Tokyo stealing and selling software. He is hijacked and drugged and co-erced into another mysterious job of infiltrating (against his will) a huge electronic assembly in order to neutralize it or stop it. Case is assisted by a boss, Armitage, who isn't what he appears to be, and by a strange crusader named Molly. A third of the way into this oddball ride, I was thinking of the movie Matrix. No wonder, it is very much the same, but this novel predates Matrix and probably inspired the movie.<br /><br />This is a world of virtual reality and complex webs and a construct of harrowing dangers and magical visions. Case eventually learns that he is fighting the tentacles of a couple of weird AI's. That's artificial intelligences, by the way. There are also reminders (to me at least) of the wiring together of human minds that comes directly out of Joe Haldeman's Forever War, in which soldiers are connected to each other with high-tech radios and sensors and can almost feel each other's wounds. Well, the world of case and Molly is supposed to be our current world, or the near future, where it is possible to mind-meld using computers. So it's also like the movie Tron.<br /><br />Gibson knows how to make drama move and it's no wonder he caught attention with this thrill ride. You just have to suspend your belief in a regular world and think cyber. If you love descriptive computereze and sensations of viewing the world through another person's eyes and mind, this is a joyride par excellence. I have to say that the story itself is a regular offering of search-and-destroy, or in another way, a quest for truth among the ruins, but the way it is told is compelling.<br /><br />I salute Gibson, tho I can't really say if I want more of this world. It is gloomy and depressing, full of pain and near-death, and doesn't promise any fixes. Ergo the fiction of the very readable Harlan Ellison. No clich&eacute;s here, no Hollywood endings, and no apologies for the human snares and the artificial intelligence evils.

I hugely suspect, that is also the cause, why many semi-intellectual snobs praise and give awards to this type of literature... (since writing is utterly confusing... it must be vastly clever.. and even if I don't understand a freaking bit of it, for the fear of being categorized as an ignorant idiot, I would never admit the fact.... rather I will dwell in the castle with those who seems to be smarter and know better...and of course all the masses would follow...)...   Going back to the Neuromancer... besides poor narrative I also found this book to be shallow on the spiritual, psychological and philosophical level...   The only virtue which I might find here is inventive and fascinating (at the time of the novel's birth) idea of cyberspace shared by the futuristic society.",2011-07-25

Even within the first few pages you'll re-read passages two or three (or more) times in an attempt to wrap your head around the rhythm and meaning of the story. By the time you hit page 20 you'll feel drained and unsure of what you've read so far.<br /><br />And then you'll go to put the book down, feeling like it simply isn't for you. Or that you don't have the energy for it right now. Or some other excuse you'll use as a way of coping with Gibson's style. When you get to this point it is absolutely vital you keep going. Trust me.<br /><br />Reading Neuromancer is like encountering a new genre of music for the first time. It's challenging, brilliantly succinct, poetic and with its own vocabulary that Gibson trusts you will pick up as you read, rather than padding his work with needless explanation. It takes time to acclimate to, but once you pick up the beat you'll wonder how you missed it the first time around.<br /><br />Part of the reason it's so challenging is that the ideas within are also challenging. Gibson proves himself as a visionary here and I urge you to remember just when this book was published (and then realize when it was likely written) so you may appreciate just how forward-thinking this novel is. There are a few weak spots in Gibson's articulation of his vision -- in particular, I didn't enjoy the geometric approach to ice and hacking -- but those are just tiny blips compared to the ultra-stylized world of tomorrow that Gibson's created. And, just as you consider what year the book was published/written in, take a moment to think of all the major sci-fi works which came afterwards and were highly inspired by Neuromancer.<br /><br />You'll be surprised.",2011-05-25

Many reviewers have noted that the technologies, and the cyberspace of the matrix itself, described in the text are sometimes difficult to comprehend and visualize. This is because Gibson leaves the details up to the reader and instead provides the concepts, the frameworks in which the reader sorts out the imagery. This does sometimes make for a confusing read as I could understand a readers need for background knowledge. But thats not a big deal as the power of its themes, and the richness of its world are enough to guide you through.     One theme that is rarely mentioned in reviews is that of the idea of biology/nature being subjugated under technology. Case derogatorily refers to his own body as \\""meat\\"", and nearly everyone in this world is supplemented with plastic surgery or some form of technological aids. Its as though natural biological processes are seen as a nuisance, something to be thrown away in favor of wired computation. In one of my favorite scenes in the book, Case recalls dealing with a wasps nest in a nasty motel. After the nest drops and opens, its insides are described as grotesque factory with all stages of life, from egg to larvae to full grown wasps, perversely put on display. I cringed while reading this and felt the horror Case felt right before he pulled the trigger to extinguish the nest with a flame thrower.    However, one flaw of this book, and the reason I take away half a star (but amazon doesn't let you), is the way in which the characters are written. They often feel flat and one dimensional, and their personalties seem to disappear for long periods of time. This sometimes makes for a slow read during the less action oriented parts of the novel.       Nevertheless, this book is a must read for modern science fiction fans.",2011-02-12

I'd heard the title a few times, always positive comments on the book, but never really thought about picking it up.  I bought a number of others from the Time list, and I'm working my way through the pile.<br /><br />Yes, I'll cop to it; I'm a nerd, always have been.  But having read my share of [[ASIN:055338256X Asimov]], [[ASIN:0441810764 Heinlein]], [[ASIN:0345253590 Dick]] and [[ASIN:0441013597 Herbert]], I've never really been that into sci-fi. In fact, this is my first sci-fi novel in very many years.<br /><br />That being said, in many ways this isn't really a sci-fi novel, at least that's how I see it.  It's a cool, hot, pounding story of a near-future, told with great attention to detail.<br /><br />The hardest part of ingesting this book is remembering that it was written in 1984.  As such, it is a visionary masterpiece, laying out 20 years ago where we were headed as a digital society, and in very many ways, exactly where we have ended up and where we likely are going.<br /><br />Just a few pages in [[ASIN:0767802454 Johnny Mnemonic]] came instantly to mind, and I found out only by checking the next day that this was a Gibson original--go figure.<br /><br />This novel is post-[[ASIN:B000UBMWG4 Blade Runner]] (despite Gibson's denial of its influence), and although this book give us \\""cyberpunk,\\"" it's arguable that Ridley Scott's classic really started it all, with the dark, rain-soaked thoroughly digitally-infested culture completing the prognosticative canon of Heinlein and Dick et al.  But not to take away from Gibson in the least; he is offering up a lot here, and it all holds together extremely well.<br /><br />I kept wondering throughout: why hasn't this been made a movie yet?  CGI is definitely mature enough now to take on the visuals this story would require.  Well, there's enough saga about that, too, with a movie all set for 2011, or then again, maybe not.  Read all the gossip somewhere else.<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  As a story--outside of its enduring significant cultural influence, lexicological contributions, and highly accurate vision--it reads well, quick and easy to follow.  This is not a long book, and the story gets up and moves out.  The story is not quite a quest, but it's a mystery that offers sex and violence, ranges quickly across a constantly fascinating physical landscape, and for those inclined, offers an incredible view of what electronic intelligence and the ephemeral realm it inhabits will become.<br /><br />On the downside, the Beat-like prose with its stream of consciousness flow and unique slang, and a lot of non-standard grammatical constructs and terms could throw a reader expecting something more.  Lots of sentences begin without subject or its pronoun, the narrative serving as an internal monologue; it's the same with the dialog, which to my mind is highly realistic.  One reviewer has mentioned \\""unexplained jargon,\\"" and I can see this as a legitimate beef.  Most of the jargon is very clearly defined in context immediately. There are some terms, though, that are sly cultural or technological references, and if you aren't familiar with the basis, then you really are lost, with the only hope being to see the term used again to pull its meaning.<br /><br />What really made this book for me is the [[ASIN:0802134246 Jack Womack]] epilogue, really a short essay on how Gibson created cyberspace.  It started off as a fawning note on how incredibly great Gibson is, but when I was done with its 16 pages, I'd written down Womack's name, with full intent to read some of his work.  His writing is excellent, fast, direct, witty and irreverent.  My intent to read Womack was sealed when he told of presenting Gibson with McCarthy's brilliant [[ASIN:0679728759 Blood Meridian]], the ultimate gift of the greatest living writer's writer, from one to another.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is an amazing sci-fi classic, brilliant in its now twenty-six-year-old foresight.  It's not hard-core sci-fi in terms of time/space travel, aliens, laser weapons and the like, but it's got enough future vision to make up for it.

It is a dense book, there is a ton of info crammed into each sentence and not one is wasted. It took me a couple tries to get past chapter 1, but once I did, smooth sailing. Is the book confusing? Yes. It's a lot of information to process and if you miss something important, it is difficult to follow what's going on. At the same time, it's impossible to tell which information is particularly important, as you read it. Basically, you have to pay attention the entire time. Is there essentially meaningless jargon? Yep. Do we get lots of intimate looks into the characters' psyches? Nope. Does much of the action of the plot feel random? Hell yeah.    And that's the point.    Back up to Aldous Huxley's bona fide classic 'Brave New World'. What's the plot? Oddly imperfect boy Alpha tries to impress averagely gorgeous girl Alpha by visiting a bunch of savages. One of them turns out to be white, so they bring him home. The savage gets famous, then discovers he doesn't like the world, tries to change it and fails. That's it. After nigh 300 pages, all we have is a weak tea revolution and a lot of benign characters accomplishing nothing. That's okay because the point, the real idea of the book, was the world the action was happening in, not the action itself. The majority of dystopian novels are like that. The point is \\""look at the horrible world we're setting ourselves up for\\"".    Gibson shows us a confusing world, one where technology constantly throws sensory stimulus at you, you've no idea which information is important and what isn't, things just sort of seem to happen around you and it's really just best to go along with it, and everyone's just closed off and shallow.

The book was written in 1983 and has influenced and shaped the world of today and perhaps scores of computer scientists who have worked on building the frame work that is cyberspace and the world wide web.

I was bored with reading the same type of science fiction over and over.  A friend recommended the book and I made the decision to give it a try.  I was hooked from the first line to the last word.  This book served as my entry into the dark, gritty world of cyberpunk.      What I found as I delved deeper into the story was not a perfect world of human cooperation as mankind ventured out among the stars.  There was no grand union of humanity and other races bonded together against an alien threat.  And technology in this story is not the shining answer to all of our problems.      Instead, the world through which the characters move is dark, seedy and extremely flawed.  It is a world populated with those who are seeking any advantage over others.  This is no heroic journey to the stars.  This is no epic saga of good versus evil.  This is no heroic journey to the stars.  This is no epic saga of good versus evil.  This is the story of a world in which crime, lies and betrayal exist side by side with hope and optimism.  A world in which humanity relies heavily on technology for good or ill.      In short, it is a near future version of the world in which we currently live.      This book was written in 1983 before the boom of personal computers, cell phones and the other things that we all take for granted today.

There are some readers who may feel that the story suffers from the time spent on exposition and description.  However, I felt that this served to enhance the story rather than detract from it.      For the reader seeking to ease into cyberpunk more gradually, I would recommend Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson, Market Forces by Richard K Morgan or Virtual Light by William Gibson.  However, for those who want to jump into the deep end of the cyberpunk pool, Neuromancer is the place to start.  This is the novel that set forth many of the conventions that became hallmarks of the cyberpunk genre.      Over the years I have read this novel multiple times.

The ostensible story is the attempt of an advanced computer system, Wintermute, to free and improve itself, but the real theme is the dehumanizing effect of technology, as shown as Wintermute's human servants.  One is an amnesiac who has literally been reprogrammed by a computer, a complete role reversal.   Molly has gotten herself \\""enhanced\\"" with the claws and eyes of a cat: human turning into animal.  But the real showpiece is the third servant, Case.

The beauty of nature in Japan, theme of countless poets, is invisible to Case, as shown in the famous opening line comparing the night sky to \\""the color of television tuned to a dead channel\\"".  Case lives in the present moment with little interest in the future or the past; ergo the narration is full of events popping out of nowhere and startling both Case and the reader.   Since he has no intellectual curiosity (other than the information that he steals) we only get perfunctory explanations of why anything happens, and often Molly or Wintermute need to explain things to him for the sake of the reader.

I've always been intrigued by Cyberpunk but had never read any of Gibson's work. Simply put, this novel is absolutely wrought with a wholly entertaining, yet complex and gritty vision of the future.      Neuromancer isn't quite like anything I've ever read before. The concepts of cyberspace and the \\""matrix\\"" was completely ahead of its time, but beyond that Gibson creates a world where technological immersion is the rule, not the exception. Couple that with sharp dialogue and breakneck pacing, and the result is  great sci-fi.    My only gripe with Gibson as a writer is that he sometimes relies too heavily on dialogue to tell his story. His characters are often portrayed as being very flat and cold. His dialogue matches that by being very casual but pointed and quick (sometimes too quick), and often loaded with a bevy of techno-terms and slang (some of which have no clear meaning). He divulges just barely enough information to keep the reader going, which sometimes results in the reader being unclear on who's talking and exactly what they're talking about. I often felt a little disconnected from things because I wasn't able to put the pieces together right away. A stylistic choice certainly, but it may not sit well with all readers. On the other hand, that may just be part of Gibson's brilliance in that he doesn't spoon feed the reader everything.     With that said, Neuromancer is still a very enjoyable novel.

William Gibson's &quot;Neuromancer&quot; sated that appetite very well, and I feel satisfied, and, in fact, rather interested to read more of his work.<br /><br />Most anyone familiar with the Matrix Trilogy, Blade Runner and other futuristic sci-fi blockbusters will feel right at home in Chiba City and the Sprawl, the neon-scrawled megalopolises buzzing with cryptic technologies and high-tech crimes, in which Neuromancer is set.  Case, a freelance hacker with a taste for alcohol and futuristic drugs, has a disposition that seems to have become something of a norm in the genre - world-weary, aloof, and vaguely anti-establishmentarian.  The plot unfolds at a brisk pace, and we follow Case through a wide variety of this dystopian Earth's dark alleys, into low orbit aboard a city-sized space-capsule, and, importantly and fascinatingly, into the bleak expanses of darkness and glittering neon chasms of digital information as he punches in on his Ono-Sendai terminal to experience a virtual reality computer-interface called the matrix.<br /><br />Although Case is the main character, the real star of the show is Wintermute - an advanced, self-aware artificial intelligence conceived to govern the goings-on of a corporate conglomerate known as Tessier-Ashpool.  Wintermute, we begin to learn, is the (digitalized) mind behind the character's mission, a kind of puppet-master operating from the vast blackness of the computer world.<br /><br />William Gibson popularized a wide swath of the computer-based lexicon that we now take for granted such as &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; and the &quot;matrix.&quot; What's so impressive about this novel, and why I would recommend it to those, not just with an interest in technology, but also about human nature, is that Gibson didn't stop at just creating a  fantastically vivid world of high-tech super hackers.  He used Wintermute, a sentient being of human design, to call into question the nature of perception and subjective reality.  By the stories' end, the reader has been exposed to issues that causes them to ask questions like, &quot;What is real?&quot; and &quot;Would I choose to live an eternity of happiness if I knew it wasn't real?&quot; and, that now ubiquitous question, &quot;Am I already part of the matrix?&quot;  By today's standards, this may all be misinterpreted as prosaic, even clich&eacute;.

This is a complex question to ask; the way this book is written will undoubtedly bring mixed reviews, since its plot and writing style are so unique. But,  overall, I think it's safe to say that this book's historical value is matched by its value as a story; It has an extremely well laid out plot, complex, yet readable style, and it set the way for modern cyberpunk.              The plot of the book is a brilliant foreshadowing of how technology will evolve, and it was executed almost perfectly. A seamless blend of science fiction, action and mystery, this is one of the very few books I rushed to finish; even though I had a deadline to finish this book by, that wasn't the reason I read is so speedily. I rushed because the story was so engaging, I found myself needing to know what would happen next.          William Gibson's style of writing can only be described as subjective. It serves the purpose well, but may be disliked by some for its tendency to delve into extraneous detail; it may give a confusion to the reader. But, this style, in my opinion, only adds to the greatness of Neuromancer. The writing can almost be described like the technology this book talks about: efficient, complex, and cold. Gibson describes the world beautifully, yet he almost never uses writing devices like metaphors, similes, or hyperboles. This makes the book conjure up almost no emotion, contrary what many writers try to do. This may sound boring, but it gives the book a unique feel to it. Gibson still uses plenty of imagery to give the reader perfect mental images of the world he's created, which is superior in every way to details described by almost every mainstream modern writer.            Although this book was quite good, it did have one issue, which has to do with the vocabulary the author uses; many of the recurring words in the book were made up by him, for example, the Fletcher. In the book, it is a weapon, yet the book itself had no true description of what it was like; I had to rely on the internet to get an accurate mental image. In all, I'd estimate that there are about 20 of these made up words. It wouldn't be such a problem if there was a glossary in the book, but, sadly, there is none. But, honestly, this isn't much of a problem, because the meaning of the words is revealed because of the context.         Overall, this book's relative fame is rightfully justified. I can't think of any reason this book could be truly disliked; the whole thing is an excellent piece of literature that I'd recommend to any fan of science fiction. The aforementioned problem, the only problem I could find, is minute, especially when comparing problems to successes.

So far, so good. The problem with this novel is that it is very badly written. The prose is unfocused, meandering and at times impenetrable. The book would have gained much by using a more straightforward style, which would been a better fit with the grim, dog-eat-dog atmosphere of the story itself. Then again, Gibson might have realized that the story was a tad flimsy, so maybe he tried to cover that up by injecting it with lots of made-up words.     The worst part is that I felt no connection with any of the characters whatsoever. I didn't care whether they lived or died and their insecurities just bored me.

In addition to those two awards, this novel also won the Philip K. Dick award in 1985.  As you might imagine, this work of science fiction is viewed by many as one of the most ground breaking works ever published in the genre.  I can't argue with that assessment.<br /><br />It is absolutely mind blowing that this book was written in December, 1983.  Focusing largely on virtual reality, this is the source of the now common terms \\""cyberspace\\"" and \\""matrix\\"".  Put yourself back in 1983.  Computer programming was being done with punch cards.  The internet was nothing more than a gleam in Al Gore's eye.  In fact, in an afterward penned by one of Gibson's contemporaries, it is argued that not only did Gibson foretell the development of virtual reality and cyberspace, by publication of this novel, he essentially created them.<br /><br />That having been said, I must admit to having a difficult time following the characters and storyline of this complicated work.  Like many of Philip Dick's later works, it is not an easy read.  In addition, what was revolutionary and fresh in 1983, has become somewhat old hat in the 21st century.<br /><br />The story revolves around a cyberspace cowboy who is recruited for the purpose of freeing an artificial intelligence from its human imposed restrictions.  The backdrop is urban, drug infested and gritty.  Much of the action takes place in virtual reality.  Visualize The Matrix on the set of Bladerunner and you get the picture.  Again, jaw dropping for 1983; par for the course in 2009.  For that reason, it is well deserving of the awards it has received and the status it enjoys among the science fiction community.

Reading this book today the reader most likely feels as if he's missed some crucial background info, possibly a predecessor to the novel that he didn't know existed, but that is not the case with Neuromancer.  Throughout the book Gibson weaves his tale while not divulging every detail or aspect about it.

It predicted a computer world that we basically live in right now, and that I think a lot of new readers so take that for granted that they are unwilling, or unable (maybe too young) to place this novel in the context of its original zeitgeist.  Some of today's computer technology (like Wifi) was even beyond Gibson's vision of the time (his characters must jack in), so he wasn't completely prescient, but enough so to imagine what a parallel reality the internet would become.  Just the way his computer savvy fringe dwellers feel about life and themselves predicates the emergence of destructive hackers and virus authors who see themselves as pure Gibson-driven cyberpunks.    Gibson also strove for literary quality in his writing, which he achieves well. He's almost the Raymond Carver of science fiction, based on his imagery and sparseness of text, mixed with beautiful descriptive powers and characterization that shows the peaks and lets the reader imagine the valleys.    If they are going to give awards for science fiction, it should always be to the kind of book Neuromancer is, innovative, clever, believable, edgy, even a bit nightmarish, but not dependent on wars among the stars that are basically westerns set in space with physics-law-violating means of travel.  Neuromancer delineated the possibilities and allowed for expansion.  Gibson couldn't help it that he could predict the future.  Such predictions continue in books like Pattern Recognition and Spook Country, which one could call Cybernoir.  The great thing about Neuromancer is that it was the beginning of a great career, not the end, and not just the entire career within itself.

You get to enjoy it for a while before you really wake up.    1984 was a hallmark year, a year of a multitude of changes, and the year when Cyberspace came into existence with this novel. Gibson coined so many phrases, invented technologies that didn't exist until 2005, and got so many things right about both science and society, that it's hard to comprehend the fact that Gibson is not a scientist himself. The inventor of world wide networks, cyberspace, and a thousand other technologies, some of which we're still struggling to perfect, is a Canadian literature major with no science background at all.    Thus, his imagination is stunning in its depth, fascinating in nature and execution, and thoroughly well written into a classic tale which has survived 25 years without being eclipsed by any other novel.    Gibson has so impressed other science fiction authors that even the best authors pay homage to him in their own novels, citing \\""Gibson\\"" supercomputers, and even mentioning cyberdecks with a tone of awe. In the world of imagination, Gibson perfected the hacker, a penultimate science fiction character written about by thousands of other authors. Movies, plays, and more have stemmed from the mighty mind of this author.    I credit the Canadian system of education, where a nonscience major is capable of fully understanding the intricacies of technology not yet invented, and successfully describes them such that his descriptions are accurate some 20 years later.    This book is one that gave many people hope, and a great many people a source of endless game playing. Neuromancer has been a game itself in many incarnations, the best of which may be the Steve Jackson games version, but there are several others. Gibson \\""owns\\"" the entire genre of the cyberspace world.    I can only marvel at the integrity of his science, such that it's withstood not just 25 years of advancements in science, but that he wrote all this before much of the technology for the internet even existed.    Asimov inspired me to write. Gibson inspired me to write science fiction. As a published author it is my supreme pleasure to recommend all of Gibsons books to any reader.",2008-12-07

I've read books in this genre that I liked more, especially The Electric Church by Jeff Somers, but all of these books owe a substantial debt to William Gibson.  In the age of cyberspace, it was inevitable that someone would write the first big book like Neuromancer, but Gibson actually did write it.      Gibson's world in Neuromancer is richly described and visionary; it's especially visionary when you consider that Gibson wrote it in 1984, well before the internet was an integral part of popular culture.  There are times in the book when I thought that the prose in Neuromancer was awkward because Gibson was imagining things that just weren't yet defined in 1984.  Another notion that I found compelling was the idea that stateless corporations had basically transcended the power of traditional governments.      IMO, the biggest weakness in Neuromancer is the ending.  The ending isn't a bust--don't let this stop you from picking up Neuromancer--but I felt that the ending was rushed.  It was as if Gibson had put together a tautly paced story leading to a destination, but once he arrived at the destination he wasn't quite sure what to do when he got there.  An epilogue does wrap things up, but it's brief, a bit anti-climatic, and I thought it was a bit of a cop-out.  Perhaps most disappointing of all, the only character that changed was one with which I felt little identification (No spoilers by naming the character).    All of that being said, Neuromancer is a solid read.  It's not the best cyberpunk novel, but it was the first big cyberpunk novel.  For the most part, it's well-paced and vividly imagined.  I'd definitely recommend it.",2008-11-20

Dick Award and the Hugo Award, is considered the seminal cyberpunk novel. Indeed, the profound influence of Neuromancer can still be seen in cyberpunk of all kinds, from Shadowrun to Deus Ex to Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash. Cyberpunk as it exists today largely reflects Gibson's vision, from the use of loner characters to the portrayals of hackers, technology and corporations to the very concept of cyberspace.<br /><br />Neuromancer is the story of Case, a down-on-his-luck hacker, who gets a second chance at his career when he gets hired to do a mysterious hack for a mysterious employer with mysterious motives. In many respects, Gibson's concepts are excellent. His world, inasmuch as he describes it, is immersive.<br /><br />The fundamental problem with Neuromancer is Gibson's narrative. He does a bad job of describing places, which makes the story jerky. The reader can easily keep track of who is doing what, but not why or where people are doing things. Actions just happen, seemingly arbitrarily, one after another, building toward a fairly underwhelming climax. The reader may very well ask, upon the novel's conclusion, \\""so what?\\"". The story itself is fairly pedestrian - it seems like it would make a better video game than novel (and Deus Ex did borrow heavily from it, successfully). The book also suffers because none of the characters are particularly well-developed or sympathetic.<br /><br />In Neuromancer, Gibson is, annoyingly, addicted to the use of the word \\""lozenge\\"". He uses it frequently, for all kinds of things, most of which aren't actually lozenge. You could make a lozenge drinking game for this book. You could do the same with all the random drugs all the characters are on.<br /><br />Undeniably, Neuromancer has style. It just isn't a very good story.",2008-11-03

In my opinion, Gibson awkwardly complicates ideas/vocabulary, in an attempt to show off erudition in technology and history, but comes off as pseudointellectual and immature.

Just because it is futuristic and has a dash of kitsch doesn't relegate it to the sci-fi scrap heap (which is just left of the pop scrap heap)--- there is poetry in this work and it is a poetry justified and accentuated by the framing element of the narrative.

I think it's a question which this book answers (and yes maybe there were others who started 'cyberpunking' earlier, but this is the one that snapped that genre 'into place' so to speak).  Making a (in this case: sub)genre is essentially a linguistic task; trope-tweaking, working with content in such a way as to anchor something new (a dual action, making a place and then filling it).

I was about 15 years old and I'd heard it was a classic, a must-read from 1984. So I picked it up and I plowed through the first chapter, scratching my head the whole time. Then I shoved it onto my bookshelf, where it was quickly forgotten. It was a dense, multilayered read, requiring more effort than a hormone-addled adolescent wanted to give. But few years later, I pulled the book down and gave it another chance. This time, William Gibson's dystopic rabbit hole swallowed me whole.     Neuromancer is basically a futuristic crime caper. The main character is Case, a burnt-out hacker, a cyberthief. When the book opens, a disgruntled employer has irrevocably destroyed parts of his nervous system with a mycotoxin, meaning he can't jack into the matrix, an abstract representation of earth's computer network. Then he receives a suspiciously sweet offer: A mysterious employer will fix him up if he'll sign on for a special job. He cautiously agrees and finds himself joined by a schizophrenic ex-Special Forces colonel; a perverse performance artist who wrecks havoc with his holographic imaginings; a long-dead mentor whose personality has been encoded as a ROM construct; and a nubile mercenary with silver lenses implanted over her eyes, retractable razors beneath her fingernails and one heckuva chip on her shoulder. Case soon learns that the target he's supposed to crack and his employer and are one and the same -- an artificial intelligence named Wintermute.     Unlike most crime thrillers and many works of speculative fiction, Neuromancer is interested in a whole lot more that plot development. Gibson famously coined the word \\""cyberspace\\"" and he imagines a world where continents are ruled more by corporations and crime syndicates than nations, where cultural trends both ancient and modern dwell side by side, where high-tech and biotech miracles are as ordinary as air. On one page you'll find a discussion of nerve splicing, on another a description of an open-air market in Istanbul. An African sailor with tribal scars on his face might meet a Japanese corporate drone implanted with microprocessors, the better to measure the mutagen in his bloodstream. When he's not plumbing the future, Gibson dips into weighty themes such as the nature of love, what drives people toward self-destruction and mind/body dualism. It's a rich, heady blend.     That complexity translates over to the novel's prose style, which is why I suspect my first effort to read it failed. Gibson peppers his paragraphs with allusions to Asian geography and Rastafarianism, computer programming and corporate finance. He writes about subjects ranging from drug addiction and zero-gravity physics to synesthesia and brutal back-alley violence. And he writes with next to no exposition. You aren't told that Case grew up in the Sprawl, which is the nickname for the Boston-Atlanta Metropolitan Axis, a concreted strip of the Eastern Seaboard, and that he began training in Miami to become a cowboy, which is slang for a cyberspace hacker, and that he was immensely skilled at it, et cetera, et cetera. No, you're thrust right into Case's shoes as he swills rice beer in Japan and pops amphetamines and tries to con the underworld in killing him when his back is turned because he thinks he'll never work again. You have to piece together the rest on your own.     Challenging? You bet. But it's electrifying once you get it.     I've worked by paperback copy until the spine and cover have split, until the pages have faded like old newsprint. Echoes of its diction sound in my own writing. Thoughts of Chiba City or BAMA pop into my head when I walk through the mall and hear a mélange of voices speaking in Spanish and English and Creole and German. Neuromancer is in me like a tea bag, flavoring my life, and I can't imagine what it would be like if I hadn't pressed on intopage 26.",2008-01-30

My entire life has included, if not revolved around, the emerging technologies that inspired Mr. Gibson.  This perspective profoundly shifts my understanding of 'Neuromancer.'      'Neuromancer,' winner of the three major prizes for Sci-Fi, gets great (and deserved) credit here on Amazon for originating the 'Cyber-punk' sub-genre.  As someone who reads and enjoys Sci-Fi from time to time, this is really less important to me than how 'Neuromancer' reads now.  To figure that out, we must look at 'Neuromancer' as what it is - a work of Science Fiction.    Like all (or at least most) Science Fiction, the characters and plot of 'Neuromancer' are merely vehichles that allow the author to provide a vision of the future, critiquing the present society from which the author extrapolated his vision.  Mr. Gibson's present (when he wrote 'Neuromacer') is far different from the one that readers now inhabit.  Paying attention to the divergences was by far the most interesting part of the novel.    Mr. Gibson's future must have dazzled readers in 1984.  The Cold War got hot, then ended - perhaps not in the way that readers may have wanted.  Technology has infected every part life, including the brain.  Cyberspace, virtual reality, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, orbiting resort 'islands' and bionic enhancement were wild flights of fancy.    But here I am, sitting at my 'deck,' jacked into the matrix.  Hackers want to steal your identity, not do an end-run around Soviet defenses.  Purely man-made genomes are in the news and Lasik eye surgey ads run on the radio.  Heck, Amazon even knows what kinds of books I like.    Gibson's future is also a purely wired world.  Our orbiting space resort doesn't have wireless.  Nobody has cell phones.    So a few of Gibson's projections veered slightly from the path that reality has taken.  Others haven't.  'Neuromancer' gives us a world of violent terrorists, unchecked multi-national companies running government, and the a world of weakened superpowers.    The plot is classic Noir in cyber punk clothes.  As with most Sci-Fi, the characters are rather flat.  The writing paints a vivid picture of the future, which is the whole point of the book, so the thinness of the plot and character seems less of a problem.

The cafes provide internet connections, warmth, showers, all you can drink sodas and coffee, free comic books, and a small booth to sleep in for a small price.

The characters are developed, the plot is smooth and exciting, and the prose is terse yet poetic.  Neuromancer is perhaps one of the most important American novels in the late twentieth century, no hyperbole.  Gibson's powers of prediction are strong, and his pop culture references give his work a real-life touch.  Gibson is sometimes credited with coining the word \\""cyberspace\\"", and his idea of The Matrix, a worldwide network of computers sharing data, was printed on paper long before most people had heard of the Internet.  His is not a happy Utopian dream like Star Trek but a gritty post-industrial vision of a possible global future.  He places importance on the influence of multi-national corporations, especially the electronics, medical, and entertainment industries.  Gibson shows a degree of intimacy with the real world that many science fiction writers do not have.  Rather than creating a future with spaceships and aliens, his is a human world based on trends that can be seen today.  This to me is what cyberpunk is, and cyberpunk is Gibson's baby. <br /> <br />Neuromancer has successfully withstood the test of time.  It is still relevant today as it was twenty years ago.  Sometimes, when reading a novel written many years back, I am painfully aware of how old it is.  Culture and trends move so quickly that it is easy to be left behind.  Neuromancer, however, feels like it was written yesterday.  The issues Gibson presents are quite important today, such as urban sprawl, the decline of the American economic empire, and the culture of hackers and the Internet.  Some issues we will soon face more and more, like the rise of the bio-tech corporations, the interface of man and machine, and the full consequences of environmental damage.

The characters are murderers, thieves, drug-pushers, drug-users, prostitutes, or extortionists.  Or they're mentally wacked.  Or they're all of the above.  Nobody is walking around with the lame-o natural body they were born with--they're all surgically enhanced, re-wired, and doped up.  Life is cheap.  Drugs are cheaper.  Society is nasty.

Where the technology is vague and imaginative it still works great.  Where the technology is detailed and specified it falls flat.  There's a scene where a dial-up modem is desperately needed to hook two computers together.  C'mon--this is the far future where computers are self-aware and super intelligent, and they still use POTS/modem connections?

But I've always loved Sci-Fi because it was combination of the things I read.  It was good writing combined with philosophy and science and having Orson Scott Card to start with drew me in completely. Two of my male friends recommended Neuromancer to me, saying it started the cyber-punk whatever.  So I was excited to get into this book.  I started with the audio version. But for some reason I couldn't get into the audio version.  I blamed it on the reader and thought I just needed to read the book myself.  So I bought the book, all excited to get started.  Needless to say, it was not the reader that couldn't captivate me, but the writing itself. <br /> <br />Initially when I started this book, I had to wonder if I was an idiot.  I just didn't get it.  But I knew I wasn't an idiot, having read all kinds of literature, philosohpy, science...well, anyway I thought, no big deal, eventually it'll all come together.  I realized though that it wasn't coming together.  Not that I didn't understand the words he was using, or the jargon, or the plot or characters...i just couldn't follow his train of thought or the lack of it!

However, it's writing style can be very difficult to read through.  I hated this book when I first read it.  I then tried several times to reread it, because of the hype surrounding it and could not get past the first few pages.  Amazon has the great option of reading the first few pages, which I would recommend, because if you don't like that you're not going to like the rest of it.  Rereading those pages myself now many years after having first read it, I see that readers today have it much easier with this book.  From subsequent books, references, movies (like the Matrix and several others) a reader has pretty much already read this book before even starting it.  But before those movies became popular, this book is where the terminology started.  `Cyberspace', what the heck is that; `matrix' that's something out of a linear algebra mathematics textbook.  That's how revolutionary this book was, those terms had never been used in that context before.  Today if you haven't heard of cyberspace or matrix you've been living in a cave.  But that was the problem with the book, Gibson doesn't explain these terms he just drops them in your lap, and of course they're integral to the story, so you have to read for a while until there meaning becomes clear from osmosis.  His continual references to the story's setting in Japan is so forced upon you that you almost have to go live there and then read Neuromancer to appreciate it.  If that was the only problem with this book it might be surmountable.  However there's also his prose.  The previous was the `cyber-' part, now there's his `-punk' part.  Numerous science fiction stories are sweeping, they cover galactic wars, Foundations covering tens of thousands of years, even when it's at the individual's level as in Heinlein's Starship Troopers the story still gives the bigger picture.  Neuromancer is like a slacker's wet dream, the protagonist drifting from scene to scene.  The book reads like a diary of your events from getting home from work/school/doing-nuthin and going to a bar/cafe/video-arcade to meet up friends/bartender/alone, even with the references to nerve-splicing, cyberspace, killings and can feel mundane.  This punk part was just as much of the revolution Gibson started.  Many other SF stories then followed with this ground level, gritty, noir style.  He deserves all the credit for that. You may hate him as well for having started it.  It's difficult to know though if it wasn't for Gibson if someone else wouldn't have started at least the cyberspace part, for the year of publication of this novel, 1984, also saw the release of the famous Apple Computers super bowl ad upon the launching of their desktop computers and the movie Tron that came out about this time if not earlier.  Either way, Gibson was the one that put all the pieces together for better or for worse.  Personally I'm giving cyberpunk another chance, but will try with different authors like Sterling and Effinger whose writing styles so far seem more accessible.",2005-12-17

This time, I just noticed I was doing all I could not to pick up the book and continue reading it. At a certain moment I just thought, well what the heck, I quit.<br /><br />Here's why.<br /><br />1) There are some futuristic world views in this book, how people live and get mixed with computer technology. That was probably one of the most interesting things of the book: what did Gibson make up and how original was it? Well, probably he made up quite some good stuff for the time he wrote it, but I just couldn't follow it. Gibson goes one step too far in all his inventions: he almost never explains the technology that people use, assuming we already know it. I can accept this to a certain level, but when it just goes on for pages and pages, throwing in all sorts of made-up jargon and names for stuff, it only irritates. Because of this, I even lost the interest in trying to imagine what it would be like to live in Gibson's world.<br /><br />2) Although I didn't expect so much of a story or of the development of the characters (my main interest was in the futuristic views), I noticed that when the technology part failed to keep my attention, the general quality of Gibson's writing also irritated me. I almost could not follow any of the dialogues. I didn't understand why any of the characters acted the way they did, what motivated them. Usually, this is acceptable for the beginning of a book. You just have to get into the story and at a certain moment pieces come together, after which you just want to keep going on. But in \\""Neuromancer\\"", I still didn't meet that moment after having read through one third of the book.

Dick, Gibson launched a new genre, one high on drugs, \\""decks\\"", \\""cyberspace\\"", \\""the matrix\\"", and pure stylish nihilism.  Abandoning the concept-driven fiction of Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov, with it's labcoated scientists and antiseptic spaceships, Gibson built a future in which globalization run amok, rather than bringing us utopia, brought us a polluted, anarchic, but oh-so-sexy hell.  Into it he thrust bizzare characters- the alluring and unforgettable Molly Mirrorshades, the mysteriously inhuman Armitage, the spooky and decadent Tessier-Ashpool clan, the cyber-rastifarian Maelcum, and, our protagonist, the down-on-his-luck sprawl decker Case.  Throw in a convoluted, fast-moving noir plot, more \\""cybergear\\"" than you can shake a stick at, and Gibson's acid keyboard, and the reader is left with a sci-fi classic. <br /> <br />Yes, the book is more flash than substance, and definitely lacks the intellectual punch of the book that, in the eyes of many, would close the short-lived genre six years later (Neil Stephenson's \\""Snow Crash\\"").  But for Gibson, it's not about the technology, the politics, or the ideas- these are only backdrops for an action adventure in a world so scary it might just await us.  The book created a genre which transformed science fiction, changing it from the nerdy world of rocketships and rayguns to a sexy one of drugs and catsuits.  On top of that, it's been more prescient than it's predecessor- while space became a sideshow, the Internet, nihilistic youth culture and globalization became realities.  With news every day of titanic corporate mergers, biotech and nanotech breakthroughs, government corruption and conspiracies, we slide further and further into the world of Neuromancer. <br /> <br />The book has touched every science fiction author since Gibson in oneway or another, from the transhuman weirdness of Vernor Vinge, to the liberal optimism of David Brin and the wahoo post-cyberpunk speculations of Cory Doctorow, just to name a few prominent examples.  The book even influenced fantasy- the \\""steampunk\\"" genre, currently popularized by China Mieville, would have never come about without Neuromancer. <br /> <br />Regardless of it's greatness, it deserves a read.  At barely 270 pages, it's relatively short, and Gibson's prose flows quickly- almost too quickly for the reader to keep up with the characters, cultures and concepts.

There aren't any easy answers and usually the characters are doing a gut check to figure out what they should be doing.  This makes the world of Neuromancer a darker and dystopian view of the future, but one that is closer to being possible than most people would believe.   <br /> <br />There is also no grand conclusion at the end where these contradictions are wrapped up in a neat little package.  Anything like that would have been untrue to the subject. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this to just about any adult reader.  It has subject matter that might not be appropriate for younger readers, though I know many of my high school friends read it during adolescence.  I attempted to read it at that time, but found the grim tone and hard edged style not to my liking.  I read it recently at the age of thirty and I found it to be much more interesting with the perspective I have gained with age. <br /> <br />It's important to understand that when this book was published in 1984 there was no Internet as we all know it.  The Internet was something that university researchers used for information exchange in a bare minimum sense.  It contained limited data stored on mainframes across the country and was useful only to a minute subset of the population.  To imagine the world that exists in Neuromancer was a great leap at the time and a prophetic vision of the world we inhabit today.",2005-02-20

This book was a major influence for everything that came after it.<br /><br />Also, Gibson again leaves a trail of breadcrumbs for the reader to follow through the story, but leaves a lot to the imagination, rather than putting a fence along the path. Particularly in the Villa Straylight, where he describes a scene, he left it in a state where my mind could build it's own picture, rather than the picture that he may have intended. I find that writing like this is a rare find, and I very much enjoy it.<br /><br />A few of the characters have appeared before in other stories, such as Molly from Johnny Memnonic. She even makes reference to him in the story. This allowed me to build on the world that I had imagined in that story, and keep my mental picture of her more or less intact, although she'd been through a lot between the stories.<br /><br />Overall, Gibson's portrait of the Matrix was the same that I had built from a number of sources, but this read like the foundation of everything. Shadowrun oozed from the pages. The Matrix seemed like the next logical step. When Case was riding the Chinese virus through the depths of the T-A computer system, I conjured up images of every damn 'net game I've ever played, especially Shadowrun for the Sega Genesis.

The ideas are buried between dense prose that mesmerizes one into a fugue-state. The plotting is weak at best, often leading one to think that the places visited exist solely to showcase the technologies of the story. Character motives defy analysis.

The only other book I liked more was 100 years of solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  <br />A lot of geeks who live in their parent's basement have adopted this book as there bible.  I have no idea why since they story is not really about technology.  If you go beyond the surface of the story and into the language, you can see that as much as geek's fetish this book for tech, Gibson himself has a fetish for the English language and it shows.  One famous author said on a radio show that this book is nothing more than that a Sam Spade novel cloaked in high tech terms.  I don't think that's the case at all.  The images Gibson offers the reader are pretty and disturbing.  Like the musical talking head of WinterMute.  This is much deeper than a Sam Spade crime story.  The author who made the comments is guilty of pushing out tomes and tomes of Tolkien rip offs that now litter the shelf space of book stores.<br />Despite its age, the ideas still hold up well as does much of the tech side of the story.  While some say this book started the cyberpunk boom I would say that I have no mouth and I must scream by Ellison is really the first cyberpunk book.  <br />The bad thing about this book is that it spawned so many copycat authors and the whole cyberpunk movement.  A shame really since this is a great book and I hate seeing is associated with 30 year olds who live in there parents basement compiling new Linux kernels all night.<br />I do believe that this book killed the genre of Sci-fi since no one has come along since to do anything better.

Yes, it 'started cyberpunk', and the gritty yet slick setting does have a sense of depth and life.<br />Unfortunately, it's heavily burdened by prose that has a tendency to blur your eyes and make you shake your head in an effort to pay attention to what you're reading.<br />Most of the novel, in fact, suffers from an inability to make the reader care about what's happening.  Gibson seems more committed to using three adjectives in a row and spewing simile after simile than capturing the reader's interest.  I suppose you could call this &quot;film noir&quot; style, but for me, it just didn't work.<br />Coupled with a severe lack of information about what's going on and a numb, detached approach to its limited third person point of view, it's really hard to turn the next page and reach the end of this short novel that feels like it's three times longer than some of the monstrous tomes I've read.<br />The story itself is difficult to care about.  It revolves around the machinations of a powerful artificial intelligence, but it's hard to understand what the point of the whole thing is, even after you've reached the last dissatisfying sentence.  Sure, I understood the story, I just didn't understand why I was supposed to care.<br />Part of this apathy comes from a fundamental lack of characterization.  The point of view is very 'cold'--that is, you don't get much inside the head of Case, and when you do, his thoughts are almost always analytical.  When the sole viewpoint character doesn't feel any emotion for 90% of the story, it's kind of hard to feel emotion yourself.  It's especially irritating that the novel is structured as a character story about Case's loss of his ability to 'jack in' and his death wish, and yet he never seems to care about much of anything (or Gibson fails to tell us about it if he does).<br />It seems to me that the appeal of this book is more for those who want to experience a well-developed milieu and pretty surface coating, as it has little power or significance as a story.<br />If you're looking for a detailed and skillfully constructed world, packaged in wordy description, or you want to see the roots of the cyberpunk genre, this novel is for you.

It's true Gibson explores cyberspace and lends it depth; but it's neither the cyberspace we know nor an immaculate view of something greater.  It's a complex brainchild that sometimes comes across slightly rough, like a low-polygon count computer game.  And by today's standards it seems more reminiscent of Tron than of technology's epoch.  Neuromancer exudes exactly the optimism in the possibilities of integrated computer networks that spawned all sorts of prospects of cyberpunk futures in the Silicon Valley revolution, right before the bubble burst.  Don't look for the future in this book.<br />Rather, Neuromancer should be approached and appreciated for what it is: excellent Sci-Fi noir.  It's the Blade Runner of such novels; with tight narration hinting at a complete and inspired world just beneath the surface.  And the early book does a good job of expositing this reality.  Its focus deteriorates later on, when the author seems to be straining to convey the enormity of his fantasy world in a still-sensible fashion, and the plot elements spin out of control like overly ambitious anime (another inheritor of the noir/cyberpunk genre).<br />In the end, it's the characters that redeem it.  Molly in particular, seems the most inspired denizen of such a mercenary hyperfuture.  And the Rastafarians of Zion and the Dixie construct show Gibson understands that readers' interest in futuristic sci-fi depends on making it as complex and detailed as the present day.  Sure, it was ahead of its time, and is now part of the evolution of the genre.  But the real reason Neuromancer is worth a look is because it's foremost a story.  A very good story.",2004-02-16

At its most basic, the story of &#34;Neuromancer&#34; is a classic caper plot: a mysterious and imposing character assembles a team of individuals, each with his own talent, to break into a target structure. The characters of &#34;Neuromancer&#34; are, in fact, stock characters in a stock plot.

And many of &#34;Neuromancer&#34;'s characters are drug addicts. History repeats itself, and it is those qualities that put the &#34;punk&#34; in cyberpunk.

It's a work that leaves little room for ambivalence. Yet that is the reaction that it provokes in me.<br />Gibson's world is imaginative, his prose taut, his imagery vivid, his attitude a cocky swagger shoved in your face. So what's not to like?<br />Its very surfeit of style, is what. In fact, there's so much style that it overwhelms the substance. This, I suspect, is what his detractors can't stand. This book is smothered in style, from the various settings all reeking of decay to the punk fashion in the characters' dress to the throw-away jargon and mannered ennui that inform their speech to the staccato fragments that comprise Gibson's prose. Gibson's decision to enthrone style turns this book into the literary equivalent of a high fashion strut. Those who love it admire its flaunt, its poise, its very excess. Those who hate it despise it for the same reasons. Shouldn't science fiction be more intellectual fare?<br />I suppose it depends on your tolerance for excess. While Gibson overdoses on style, he doesn't vacate substance. His dystopian vision is as disturbing as Brave New World or 1984 (the very year this book was published). Neuromancer cautions us against corporatism, rampant consumerism, the seduction of immortality and the hive mind. It also speculates about artificial intelligence, bio-techno symbiosis, universal information matrices and the nature of reality. Such a substantive collection of themes is nothing to sneer at. But this book doesn't deserve the boatload of awards that it garnered either.<br />Personally, I have little tolerance for excess. I value restraint over indulgence, introspection over flamboyance. Brilliance shines brightest when freed from artifice. There is brilliance in this book, but it is buried under the mass of all that cool posturing.<br />Ultimately, this book is worth reading, not least for its numerous firsts. But discerning readersmust steel themselves against its cynical, oh-so-hip nihilism.",2003-06-20

Gibson has given us a world that, despite his stumblings and fumblings in telling the story (which English majors like myself might--MIGHT--be willing to consider a stylistic choice on the part of the author, to add to the sense of darkness and confusion), seems REAL. It is a very, very human world, and this is a very human novel. It is about identity in a world with no higher purposes than gratification of needs and desires; even you churchgoers out there might get the idea sometimes in the back of your mind that even religion serves only to gratify and soothe, to take our attention away from the essential horror and loneliness of the human condition. What is the motivation of any character in this novel? Gratification of desire, extension of life, money, etc. The &quot;cyberpunk&quot; elements of the book are, to me, incidental to what is at its core a poem about solitude, impermanence, and the shifting sands of human life. What is the last line of the book? <br />&quot;He never saw Molly again.&quot; <br />This is not a good book, or a bad one.

His teammate Molly, rather than being the helpless baggage that clutters so many novels in the name of femininity, is instead the team's muscle - a tough-minded, hard-bodied mercenary who uses her womanly wiles as just another weapon.  Leading the team is the inscrutable Armitage, a combat veteran whose hopelessly mangled remains have been reassembled with the help of radical technology - but is he really the one calling the shots?  And how far can Case and Molly really trust him?  A quick-reading thriller that is not to be missed.",2002-09-05

Gibson's style is unique...and you either love it or you hate it.<br />That said, I still think this is the single best book written in the last 50 years.  Possibly even longer.  <br />Yes, I've heard complaints.  Gibson's writing is thick, sometimes blurry, his plot isn't \\""unique,\\"" his story isn't flashy and exciting.  This is, of course, all subjective, but I can see where people are coming from.  Gibson's writing IS very dense; you can see it in his short stories, his other novels, even in his essays.  His strength is his intense description of the world his characters live in.  Given, he doesn't hand everything to you on a silver platter (or microchip).  Someone who is simply looking for a fast, easy read will find him frustrating like that.<br />I've also heard that the mood is quite heavy.  That's because this is very noir.  That's how cyberpunk is.  Cyberpunk is not and should no be considered science fiction, at least, not what the pulpwriters want you to think science fiction is.  This isn't Star Wars.  This is Blade Runner.  The good guys aren't good.  There aren't even any real bad guys.  <br />Which is why the book is so great.<br />Gibson deals with ideas.  Big ideas, many of which are long before his time.  He discusses the problems of megacorporations (zaibatsus in Neuromancer) which we are just beginning to see in today's world.  He dabbles in the posthuman, the role of gender in a world where informaion is power, not physical prowess.  He looks at it all from the underground, which everyone knows about but no one in our culture seems to want to think about.  He deals with the human body in a post-biological world, where people can alter their body in any way they want, and its effects on society and people.  And of course, he discusses cyberspace.<br />Now, finally, for all of you who stand there and say that the whole thing reminded you of matrix, remember, this was written in 1984.  Matrix is, if anything, a rip-off of this book (along with the rest of the series, some short stories by Harlan Ellison, and some Phil K. Dick stuff, and finally Alice in Wonderland).  Matrix is an action thriller...Neuromancer is a mind-warper.  Matrix is not itself cyberpunk; it is a result of the media frenzy following the release of this book.<br />But really, your enjoyment of this book depends on your aims.  If you're looking for a fun little story about kids messing around online, you're in the wrong place.  If you're looking for a jaunt around in the future with exciting battles and neat-o cool aliens, this is not the book for you.  If you don't get a real kick out of imagery as thick and dark as the La Brea tarpits, you're reading the wrong book.  But if you like ideas, thickly textured worlds, commentary on society, philosophy, technology, and what it means to be human, you should read this book.",2002-09-03

Written in 1984, Gibson's ability to imagine the future of technology amazes me.  He doesn't craft &quot;Star Trek&quot; worlds--idealized, raceless, places where everybody gets along (although we all love Star Trek, one must admit that its character interaction is a little less than realistic).  Neither does Gibson let his technology get out of hand--people can't travel faster than light, nobody mates with aliens, or has an epiphany about the nature of the universe.  It's Earth, plain and simple (although it's obvious he wrote it in the middle of the Decade of Excess--mirrored surgical optical insets?  ick.).  The man who coined the term &quot;Cyberspace&quot; creates a complex future which is ultimately believable.  <br />Unfortunately--and this is where the rating part comes in-- as I was reading, I found myself stopping every page or two, scratching my temple, and going &quot;HUH?&quot;  Listen, guys, before you tell me I'm just slamming the novel because it's popular, let's put it into perspective.  I'm an experienced reader.  I've been able to read Kerouac, Murakami, Vonnegut, and other notoriously confusing writers' works without a hitch.  For a few identifiable and probably a few more unidentifiable reasons, &quot;Neuromancer&quot; gave me problems.  <br />I realize it's a matter of style more than anything; Gibson wants to set an atmosphere by using particular words, sentence structures, and chronology techniques.  However, the effect is something like that of a dress produced for a fashion show--what looks great on the runway is not necessarily practical or feasible for everyday life.  For short bursts, Gibson's prose is lucid, vivid, and startling.  However, taken in chunks much longerthan a page, the gaps in action frustrate even a patient reader.  There were times when I absolutely, positively could not follow what was going on, even after stopping and rereading several times.  The experience was similar to trying to solve a puzzle with a hundred pieces missing.  The prose, or lack thereof, probably cut my enjoyment of the novel in half.  <br />&quot;Neuromancer&quot;, however, is still a ground-breaking book, with so much insight and so many redeeming qualities that I'd still reccomend any SF fan read it.

Some of their brittle criticisms may have merit.  However, most of them form some kind of low-brow smear campaign.  For example, one should not be deterred from Neuromancer because it uses 'new words'.  True Gibson uses some words we may not have seen before, but it is really quite simple to work out what they mean, and even if by some biological oversight you do not have the faculties to do so, it hardly detracts from what is a very well written and astonishingly original book.  <br />The style in which Neuromancer is written is heavenly, heavenly in its darkness, its mutedness, the minute impressions it leaves here and there.  And the burnt out wreckage of Gibson's cyber punk vistas are unsurpassed.  It is remarkable how much this book achieves, little wonder therefore that it it may be a little difficult to follow in places.  <br />Perhaps most astonishingly however, the book culminates in the creation of nothing less than a new mythology, a mythology of cyberspace.  Most books are content with rehashing exisiting mythology, but Neuromancer gives us something new.  And it certainly isn't presented in the horrible didactic dribble that one gets in the rather silly Snow Crash.<br />This is an important book, regardless of whether it is a good or bad one.

But to appreciate this book, it is helpful to understand where Gibson was comming from. This book is not really about thechnology and it's impact on humantiy. It is essentially a post-modern extention of trends that Gibson saw in 1980's society. A world where soul is meaningless and consumerism is the absolute meaning. Technology is prevelant, but not the focus, which is evident by Gibson's refusal to tell us any details about the technology that makes up the world. He throws words and concepts around, but never describes them. He creates a confusing blur of gadgets and merchandise, which are not there for their own sake, but represent the lengths that our societies will go to to be entertained, and the lengths that the corportate world will go to to make money out of us.<br />Gibson's stlye is minimal at best, and confusing at worst. Confusion is prevelant in a world where concious beings are forgetting if and why they exist, and digital entities are realising that they do exist. Details are glossed over and we only ever see the surface of his world, Gibson leaves details to our imagination and presents us with fast and furious imagery. In the end it is all essentially meaningless. We don't really need to know what a sim stim is, its all throw away culture and gimiks. What is important is that we understand the emptyness of a world where marketing controlls our wants and needs, and technology exists to inject products directly into our body and minds.<br />If Gibson excells at anything it is his ability to see trends, to look at the world around him, and see where it will head if it is unchecked. In his projections Gibson is not a hopeful dreamer, he is a stark realist. Take away God and the Devil, take away warm humanist dreams, and what are you left with? This is what Gibson depicts.<br />Don't force yourself to read this book becasue it created the cyber punk genre.This book will chalenge you and make you work things out for yourself. There are no helping hands in Gibsons future, if you wish to survive you must learn fast and accept that the slightest mistake will end it all.

Countless SF novelists since Gibson, from David Brin to Neil Stephenson to Dan Simmons have cribbed (some overtly, some covertly) Gibson's ideas, populating their novels with his inventions. And i'm all for it - that's what SF is about.<br />With Neuromancer Gibson begins his masterly way of telling a science fiction story. Rather than droning on for pages and pages about minute ways new technology works, the reader is forced to envision it for themselves based on one or two throwaway lines: \\""the buildings shot up into the sky, some tall enough to reach through the domes...\\"" Domes? What kind of domes? What would they look like that high up? Rather than expand the descriptions, we, the reader, get to do it ourselves, making us complicit in the work; it's ours as well as his.

However, on hindsight, Neuromancer is flawed in many ways.  Clearly the whole cyberpunk genre arose from this book (just look at modern dystopic movies and computer games that borrow liberally from Gibson's language and plot points).  For this reason, I would recommend the book.  In addition, the story is actually quite good.  Although I normally don't like or believe in futures this pessimistic, Gibson gave his world a kind of logic that allows belief.<br />Unfortunately, he then destroys the credibility at key points in the narrative.  It is deeply irritating to me when an author sets up a self-consistent, logical (even scientific) world, and then decides (s)he likes an image or idea so much that it must be included, even if physically/scientifically impossible (Samuel Delany is the worst transgressor of this offense).  I found myself rereading a number of passages in disbelief before concluding that yes, Gibson was indeed defying one law of physics while rigorously adhering to others at the same time.  In addition, Gibson kept introducing new concepts and words invented from thin air, when there are perfectly acceptable words in use today.  Okay, so he's trying to invent a new slang, but nowhere are the new words defined.  You learn them from context, but the context may be several chapters away.<br />Gibson's narrative laziness crops up in his use of pronouns as well - there are passages that are simply incomprehensible because the author refers to all the characters (even those fighting each other) by pronouns.  A typical passage would be something like: &quot;She burst into the room just as she was getting up from the table.&quot;  Is the person bursting into the room and the person getting up from the table the same?  And if so, isn't it physically impossible to do both things at the same time?

So far so good, there are a couple slight problems though.  About two thirds of the way into the book I was in love with it and couldn't put it down.  There was a lot of mystery/underworld/cloak and dagger-type stuff intertwined up until that point and I was very entrenched in the plot.  However when it's crunch time toward the end of the book it shifts to more action-oriented sequences to further and eventually end the plotline.  This may not bother most people but for me I was getting used to how the plot was developing and this change somewhat turned me off.  However at the end I can't argue that I was thoroughly impressed and fulfilled.  Gibson describes the coolest world you'll ever read about and if you're a sci-fi/cyberpunk fan already you'll see some familiarities of Neuromancer's locales that remind you of other worlds you've encountered in sci-fi or anime.

If you've read any of his other books first, before these two, put them out of your mind because its apparently not the same William Gibson, or mabey he got hit in the head or something?

Moreover, the future he inhabits is a deeply dark, fully blown cultural wasteland dominated by an ever-evolving artificial intelligence that is recondite, impersonal, archly sinister, morally bankrupt, staggeringly powerful, and intent on absolute hegemony through the development and implementation of a breathtakingly advanced cybertechnology.

But I suppose that certain patterns could be discerned by the wide-eyed and wise of that time; imagination filled in the gaps of what social evolution had yet to dictate.  For the budding Sci-fi author, I imagine the prospects of utopia/dystopia were endless and endlessly fascinating: AI, VR, cybernetics and bio-enhancements: so many possibilities as yet unexplored, as yet unexploited!<br />Thus we have William Gibson's cyberpunk manifesto _Neuromancer_, the book that spawned a whole genre by itself and prophesized a chilling existence that, some 17 years after the fact, looks very familiar.   Hackers and viral bombs? -second page news.  The Sprawl? -growing every day.  Cloning, VR, bio-enhancements? -already on the crest of the next wave.  Thus the danger of modern sci-fi and its cyberpunk offshoot: becoming as relevant as a gutter newsrag, stigmatized by well-worn clichés and the dubious nature of experimental prose.  Why would one want to spend their valuable time on yesteryear's fear?<br />Well, when yesteryear's hype contains the febrile energy and insight of _Neuormancer_, the read is worth the time spent.  Gibson fashions a world of vivid and startling imagery, the ugliness and beauty of it leaping from type to the reader's imagination with ease.  The slang and unique aspects of Chiba, the Sprawl etc. are done in a casual fashion, so that one understands the phrases and cultural particulars without getting thrown or distracted.  There is a feel of something _new_ here, even if it isn't all that new by nowadays standards; _Neuromancer_ contains a force of intellect, of testing the boundaries and coming up all aces, that buoys the reader through the overly-familiar space-opera archetypes and, in passages, the stilted self-conscious prose.  A commendable effort that still resonates, unlike most its contemporaries/derivatives.<br />But for all its hyperbole and raw intelligence, _Neuormancer_ does have its share of flaws, some glaringly apparent, others under the surface, within the structure of the novel itself.  Envisioning and detailing this dystopia was an admirable feat, especially considering the time it was written and what hindsight awards the current reader, but so much effort is given to making the environment `real' that the characters themselves--the flesh and blood constructs that the reader is supposed to inhabit, sympathize with, and ultimately understand--the characters become neglected in the process, ending up rote pulp-fiction stereotypes of passing interest.  Gibson tries to inject some pathos for Molly, Armitage and Case midway through the novel, but the attempt is strained and, because it is introduced so late, our neon-jazzed eyes glaze over the heavy `personal crisis' of the climax--we just want these archetypes (ie the author) to get back to the cool stuff they excel at.<br />The story itself is basic pulp-noir--outlaw cowboys running on societies' edge, complete with cyber-shtick saloons and the usual assortment of backstabbing betrayals--and not very interesting pulp-noir at that: both conflict and plot are ambiguous for the first half of the novel, and while Gibson's ultimate ideas are very intriguing (particularly about the cold existence of cyrogenics), the novel ultimately suffers from a crippling lack of tension.  Gibson's writing can be inconsistent, as well: though parts of the novel are extremely well written, other passages become quite convoluted in their (needless) detail.  <br />Four stars--despite its flaws, _Neuormancer_ is a seminal work, and better than ninety percent of the dumbed-down junk competing for shelf space.",2001-09-27

I am not sure if it was the writers' fault or mine. Their stories presented a fine reading, and very often had interesting characters. They were well-written and I did care about what happened to the their heros. The real treats were those with unexpected plots or new twists on old stories - and there were enough of those. But all of them were lacking something - and what it was I understood only after reading Neuromancer.<br />Most science fiction stories (and all fantasy tales) are based in different worlds, whether different in space, or in time, or both. The authors strive to define those worlds in their terms, bringing them as close to reality as their and our imagination allows. But over the years, these worlds became stale. We've seen most of the futures, and we've seen most of the distant planets, and we've seen most of the alien civilizations. In my recent readings, no one could add anything substantially new to the previous constructions.<br />I didn't read Neuromancer in 1984. I read it in 1999. I knew it exsited for a long time, but I thought it wasn't worth reading now that we are living in the world which Gibson had described. I was wrong.<br />Neuromancer describes a world totally unlike others. It is ours. Gibson could recognize it back in 1984. We definitely recognize it now. But unlike our world now, Neuromancer's is complete, a well-defined iteration in the current direction of progress. And the insights are still startling.<br />Unlike most of the worlds in other stories, it was not designed to highlight the contrasts between our world and the one described, or between us and its inhabitants. It was designed to show what our world - our habits, our trends, our technology - will look like if we take them further along the same line we are moving now. You will recognize it immediately, and in that lies a large portion of the book's attraction. <br />Another portion is the book's language. It is evry specific, you can't confuse Gibson's prose with many others. But it defines the book as much as the world it describes does. The dialog, the sentence structure, the similes and metaphors, revelation of the concepts, even the unfolding of the story itself - it all serves amazingly well to plunge you into what could be your future. If you need any hints, just read the book's first sentence.<br />You might or you might not like the plot. It's typical as far as these plots go, but with enough twists to keep anyone interested.

For this he was robbed of his online talents, his very nerves singed with a potent micotoxin. Now it is only a matter of time before he unwittingly falls prey to suicidal depression. Suddenly he is proposed an offer: to have his nerves resoted if he is willing to participate in a very odd mission, one that will involve teaming up with a razor-handed assassin with a fresh outlook on life, a perverse freak who can subliminally induce hallucinations, all under command of a catatonic schizoid - a man whose personality is a shallow facade constructed to mask the fact that his soul is forever trapped living and re-living a horrid disaster. The goal? Write a new page in the history of mankind. By all means, Neuromancer is unique. The prose is concentrated, terse and powerful.

Gibson demonstrates all of these things in a Cyberpunk realm that seethes with scum and wholly unlikable people.  Enter our \\""hero,\\"" Case, who is part of that scum.  Through the course of the novel, Case is forced to come to terms with his own life and choices, and he learns to realize that he must rely on someone other than himself sometimes.  For a Cyberpunk novel, Neuromancer actually deals a great deal with love.  This is a parallel to John Brunner's The Shockwave Rider, so the story is a little lighter than other Cyberpunk such as the movie Blade Runner.  Also, Case seems then unlikely character to fall in love; and the object of his affection seems just as improbably to have any feelings, let alone love .  By using a seedy character, Gibson reveals to us that everyone can have a change of heart, whether they want to or not.

What some call Gibson's &quot;confusing&quot; style is actually a carefully calculated and ingenious device to make the reader actually feel as if he has been dropped into Gibson's world. He doesn't introduce aspects of his future like they're just wacky things he made up (whereas Neal Stephenson DOES), but rather like they are actual things whose history he is recording. His vividly imagined world takes on an eerily realistic quality this way. You learn to find your way around his world like a child learning a language- you just have to listen to it and wait.<br />Gibson has a lot of fun extrapolating social phenomena into the future, in the same way that lesser scifi writers meerly like to dream up new technologies.

Many of the novels critics have remarked that Neuromancer's main character, Case, is a programmer who never programs.  This is false.  Reread the novel.  While preparing for the attack on the Sensenet ICE case spends several days programming.  Still, the criticism is more the misinterpretation of youth than anything else.      The novel was written during the early '80's and videogames were its inspiration.  Unless you had access to a mainframe at this time, programming was something you did by poking cheap BASIC programs into APPLE II's or Timex/Sinclair80's.  Videogames were the rage.  The desktop revolution had yet to happen but everyone had an ATARI game machine.  That's why most of Case's ICE breakers come in cartridges to be slotted.  Videogames are learned not through programming but body language.  Case is more like someone who's mastered all the secret moves of Mortal Kombat than a programmer.  Anyway, AI's do most of programming in the novel -- true programming in Case's world is a Metafunction, beyond human. Like pinball, videogames are style over substance.  As is Neuromancer.  But, ah, what style!    So, back to the main point.  Computers are not the point of Neuromancer -- information is the point and the control of information is even more the point!  And, so style may not be deep but it is information.  Ask any LA gang member if style doesn't matter.  Style can mean life or death.  Style conveys information about who purveys it.  And like all good fiction, Neuromancer was about the time it was written.  Neuromancer is about the feel of the '80's.  During the early '80's there was the feel of something ominous and wonderful just beginning to happen.  And Neuromancer captures that feel -- the feel of the early days of the information revolution.  It may seem like were really into the meat of it now but it really is still just the beginning.  So, read the book, and like Molly says,&quot;Never let the little pricks!  generation gap you.&quot;  We may all be sitting around these days wearing Carpal Tunnel wrist braces but more than ever you still can't let the information juggernaut steamroller you.",1998-05-08

Today we see companies merging and becoming larger while the number of individial media souces becomes smaller.

I saw a review on this board in which someone refers to Gibson's writing as &quot;murky&quot; and says that his story is confusing, or obscure.  Well, that is part of the point of this novel.  The characters are living in a confusing, fast-paced, data-soaked world, so why should you have an easy time understanding it?  There's so much going on around them that *they* can barely keep track of it, so don't expect an easier time for yourself.  And that is one of the best things about this story--it's mysterious, sometimes confusing, and great.

My conclusion? It's exactly what I wanted, and also pretty much exactly what I was expecting. It was enjoyable but not earth-shattering, and its writing was intriguing, but neither as compelling nor as irritating as many reviewers found it. I thought Gibson's style of prose served the story well, and didn't find it particularly confusing or intimidating. It presents some interesting ideas, but I didn't find its ideas nearly as mind-blowing as many people apparently did. I thought his characters struck the right note in the book's highly stylized universe. I usually interpret &#34;cyberpunk&#34; as a kind of high-tech noir adventure with a few philosophical insights along the way. I have not read much in the genre. Personally, I didn't require a story that delved into the psyche of a cybernetic street samurai; some characters are simply there for ninja skills and general badassery, and that's okay by me. I thought the characters were developed to a degree that held up the story well enough. I thought Gibson's prose did a nice job of painting the matrix and the technological dystopia of the real world. He clearly did it so well, in fact, that his vision has influenced popular culture the point where the whole book feels weirdly familiar. Reading &#34;Neuromancer&#34; in 2014, you come away feeling like you've seen these neon-lit slums, space stations, leather-clad ninja vixens, mysterious techno-plutocrats, pasty emo hacker dudes and quasi-omniscient AI constructs many times before. Maybe it's Gibson's matrix and we're all just living in it?",2014-09-22
US,23393034,R1O9ERK76WXEPZ,B003P9WM4U,203397024,Neuromancer,Digital_Ebook_Purchase,5,1,1,N,Y,"One of the best books ever","Are you a fan of cyberpunk? I am. And if you are a fan of cyberpunk, or are merely interested in learning more about it, or are merely interested in reading a good science fiction story, then you absolutely must read Neuromancer.<br /><br />But even if Gibson didn’t invent cyberpunk genre all by himself, he certainly was the one who popularized it and, whether he liked it or not, became its face. It was also Gibson who came up with terms such as “cyberspace” or “ICE,” which later became the staple of cyberpunk literature. In fact, some of these words entered the mainstream vocabulary. If you want to read a book that became one of the greatest classics of science fiction literature, if you want to read a book that became a cultural phenomenon, then you should read Neuromancer.<br /><br />But what is this book about? It has many levels and it is about many things. The book is set in distant future. At one point they mention an old law from 2053 governing AIs (Artificial Intelligences). I estimate that it is set somewhere at the end of the 21st century or beginning of the 22nd century. The technology had reached fantastic levels. Artificial intelligences, cybernetic implants and space travel are now common, albeit expensive. But it is not a fun world to live in. Governments have either collapsed or are subservient to corporations. The world is divided into haves (usually corporate employees) and have nots (everybody else). Drug use is rampant. Corporations lord and master over everyone and there are few limits to their power. If you do not have money, you are nobody.<br /><br />Coming to think of it, the world of Neuromancer is not all that different from what it is today.<br /><br />It is in this kind of world that we meet Case. Cased used to be a computer hacker. In this world internet had become a form of virtual reality and you have to connect your brain to a computer in order to use it. Case had doublecrossed his employers and in revenge they applied selective damage to his nervous system which prevents him from using the internet. Unable to work as a hacker, he now makes his living as a street hustler and lowly criminal. Things are not looking good for him, but then he is recruited (somewhat forcibly) by a mysterious man named Armitrage and his bodyguard/henchman Molly with blades that come out of her fingers and sunglasses that are permanently installed in her eye sockets.<br /><br />Case’s ability to enter internet is restored because Armitrage needs him to hack the computer system on a space station called Straylight. The space station is owned by a mysterious family of billionaires named Tassier-Ashpool. As Case and Molly prepare themselves for their mission and quietly investigate what this is all about, they discover that Armitrage was created (literally created) by an AI named Wintermute. Interestingly, Wintermute is owned by Tassier-Ashpool. Why is he trying to go against his owners? On top of that, another AI owned by Tassier-Ashpool, named Neuromancer, is trying to stop them. Case soon realizes that he and everyone else are pawns in a struggle between two titanic AIs, and the outcome of this conflict will shape the future of humanity.<br /><br />It is hard to classify Neuromancer. Yes, it is obviously science fiction, but it also resembles a spy thriller. This is not an action story. If you hope for a lot of shootouts, car chases and explosions, you will need to go read some other book. However, Neuromancer does offer richness and depth. All the characters are well rounded up and avoid falling under clichés. But the story is more than just a science fiction thriller about two rival AIs and their human pawns. There are a lot of questions asked here about the nature of humanity and how technology does and does not change us. The world as presented in Neuromancer is an ugly place where advanced technology tends to make things worse rather than better. But is that the fault of the technology, or the flawed human beings who design and use it? Take the conflict between Wintermute and Neuromancer. They both do bad things and appear to have no conscience, yet they act this way because they were so programed by their human creators. So who is at fault here?<br /><br />Aside for the story and the philosophy underneath it, the book offers one more great thing. Gibson has (in my opinion) a very unique and wonderful writing style. It is hard to explain if you had not read it for yourself. He is a master of detail and dialogue.  The scenes, as he writes them, are full of, at first glance, inconsequential and superfluous details. But the way he chooses these details and the way he describes them add richness to the story and create a truly unique atmosphere. Gibson paints a world that is full of contradictions between the expensive and cheap, between the new and old, between the freshness and decay. The overall result is that the world of Neuromancer is at war with itself. At first sight it is a world of gleaming cities packed full with expensive, flashy and advanced technology. But walk out of corporate gated communities and scratch a little deeper, and you will see that it is a world of poverty, decay, oldness and despair. Moreover, even the new expensive things are, upon closer inspection, mass manufactured and full of kitsch. They might look nice, but they lack soul. The whole world is like that; full of glimmer and glitz but lacking depth and soul. No wonder that many of its people search for something deeper through collecting old things.<br /><br />Then there are the dialogues. Again, it is hard to explain if you had not read the book yourself. The dialogues are simple and straight to the point. People speak realistically. There are no flowery long speeches here. And yet, sparse as they might be, the dialogues express and communicate a lot about characters and their world. What we have here is a rare combination of depth joined with realism.<br /><br />What more can I say? Neuromancer is simply one of those books you have to read before you die. It is one of the best books I have ever read, and I read it more than once, which is rare for me. I would give it six stars, but Amazon allows only five, so five stars it is.",2014-07-06
