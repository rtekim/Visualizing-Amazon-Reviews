US,51212418,R3KOQ0B4UYHQ47,B001PBGKU2,887884219,An American Tragedy,Books,4,5,6,N,N,"Review posted on The Literate Man [...] on July 19, 2010","Don't you all miss the days when it seemed that every great artist was an unabashed socialist? Ok, so maybe I don't actually remember those days at all, but I sometimes feel like I lived for brief periods in the dark worlds of corrupt American capitalism painted by Dreiser, Steinbeck, and even Hemingway (oh, heck, let's through Kerouac in there too), among many others. Don't you? I have this purely romanticized vision of the turn of the twentieth century and the years that followed as a battleground of ideologies when it seemed like a system that valued human relationships (as opposed to supply and demand) might actually raise the human race to another evolutionary level. Of course, the intervening years have largely proven that dream to be just that--a dream--devoid of any grounding in human nature. But I like to reminisce in any case. Ah, those were the (completely nonexistent) days ...    No one, and I mean no one, is better at painting a straightforward tale of the evil influences of American capitalism than Theodore Dreiser. He's like the Brothers Grimm of the American working classes or like the Dr. Suess of anti-capitalist ideology--except that the Cat in the Hat wears a bushy mustache and carries a hammer and sickle. Though 25 years separate them, Sister Carrie (1900) and An American Tragedy (1925) are almost mirror images of each other as they treat the effect of unbridled American ambition on first women and then men, who grow up in Darwinistic America devoid (individually or collectively) of any strong moral compass. The fact that Dreiser's novels continue to be relevant in the twenty-first century is a testament to his ability to find universal and enduring themes.     An American Tragedy was based upon well-publicized actual events in upstate New York in 1906. Here's the short, short version of the story: upwardly-mobile boy from a solid family takes advantage of country girl; aristocratic third-party female then expresses interest in boy; boy dumps country girl for a chance at the good life; but country girl is pregnant; boy thinks, \\""what to do ... I know ... murder,\\"" or is it? Maybe it was just an accident.  I will say that in the actual events, the boy was convicted of murder and executed by electric chair. But you'll have to read the book itself to find out what happens to his on-page persona, Clyde Griffiths.    This is one of a very few books that I have re-read over the course of my life. And usually I find that my understanding of the story has changed in the interim. Not so here. Dreiser is forever an idealist and an advocate for the redemptive power of empathy. Though his dream seems further away now than ever, it is still undeniably enjoyable to inhabit that world for a week or two. Give it a shot ...",2010-07-19

It's about poverty resulting in greed combined with the egotism and blindness of adolescence, finally leading to murder. Tragic and deeply touching.

Do we want to spend the majority of the book on the formative years of the protagonist and his victim?  Wolfe wisely placed the crime just one hundred pages into his seven hundred page book.  Dreiser, by contrast, gives us five hundred pages of back story before starting the real drama, which focuses all the characters and institutions - - courts, politics, newspapers, business, church - - on Clyde Griffiths.  The characters are real enough, the societal critique valid enough, but, for large parts, the delivery is about as subtle and engaging as that of Clyde's street preacher parents.",2005-01-10

Dreiser leaves little to the reader's imagination as he explains every detail with percision.<br />Clyde Griffiths is a young man with ambition who longs for a better life than that of his parents, who are street missionaries. First he flees his Kansas City home after getting into some minor trouble. By chance, Clyde meets his wealthy uncle by chance and secures a job in the family collar factory in New York State.<br />Clyde, thanks to the family name, is quickly brought into the social scene of his new hometown. He develops a relationship with a co-worker (Roberta) but as soon as a young lady of wealth and social status (Sondra)shows favor to him, Clyde looses interest in Roberta. The affair with Roberta produces a pregnancy and the situation spins out of Clyde's control. Eventually Clyde's self interests outweigh his sense of right and wrong, resulting in tragedy. <br />From the first few pages you get a sense that Clyde's ambitions  will eventually be his undoing. Drieser leaves very little to the reader's imagination as he weaves you through 800 pages of intricate detail. At the end Clyde comes to terms with his deeds and confesses his sins to both GOD and himself.",2001-03-18

Many of the books that are on our curriculum are &quot;the classics&quot; that everyone reads during high school. Although  they all have an important message and are worthwile to read, none of them  has touched me in the way this book has. It has had an effect on me the way  no movie, book, or other work has ever had on me. There were times that I  felt like I couldn't read any more, not because I was bored with it or  because it was difficult getting through the words, but instead it had made  such a tremendous impression on me that I could read no further although I  wanted to so much. I just need to take a second away from the book to think  about what had just happened. I was so into the novel that I lost my sense  of reality. I was in the novel. I felt the pain and happiness of the  character. I have felt things somewhat like this before but never near this  as strong as this. Theodore Dreiser has created a true work of art. I  honestly believe that he has created the most tragic story ever written. It  is not for anyone who is cold or insensitive, for if you don't truly feel  the pain of Clyde Griffiths and Roberta Alden, you can not feel the whole  effect of the book. Once again I strongly reccomend this book to anyone  with a heart they are willing to put through a little pain in order to  experience a feeling that cannot be found anywhere else",2000-03-09

He sometimes structures his text awkwardly.  Although he can be excused by the dated language (the book was written in 1925), he tends toward excessive use of some words (e.g., I  think he uses the word &quot;gay&quot; about 567 times!).  At points within  the narrative, it slows to almost an excruciating crawl.  <br />Despite these  drawbacks, Dreiser succeeds in acquiring and sustaining one's attention  over a long book.  His character development is second to none and, in my  opinion, demonstrates significant growth since writing &quot;Sister  Carrie&quot;.  You'll find yourself first rooting for Clyde (after all,  he's the protagonist and at least in Book One, he is a sympathetic  character), then being shocked by him, then, finally, damning him (and  grieving over &quot;her&quot;, the truly tragic figure of the novel).  The  book left me shaking my head at the waste and, yes, tragedy of it all and  the role society played in it.<br />This book is a must read for any serious  student of American literature.  It combines the superlative character  development noted above with a keen understanding of the caste-system of  American society and the gulfs that separate the classes.  <br />After the  depth of drama preceding it, the simple &quot;Souvenir&quot; at the end is  powerful in its impact.  I agree with others that the Afterword by Irving  Howe is well worth reading and adds some wonderful context to the work.   <br />Finally, I'd recommend that, like a good film, the reader not enter into  the novel already knowing the ending....its length requires some dedication  and the experience is much more suspenseful and rewarding when one is open  to surprises.",2000-03-01

Which is what she demands of the poor boy, Clyde Griffiths.  And of course, proving the axiom that it is just as easy to fall in love with a rich girl as a poor one, Clyde prefers instead the rich girl, her lifestyle, her friends, all that she represents to someone like himself.  How Clyde gets himself into this fix and out of it is the plot of Dreiser's classic novel.  It is a terrific page turner as you root for Clyde to escape his family, make his way in the city, meet &quot;a nice girl&quot;.  When faced with the dilemma, appreciated in its context (many many moons before Roe v. Wade), you brainstorm with him to try to figure out some good way out of the situation-how to help him get to his happy ending.  And at last as events overtake him, the reader is torn between loyalty to Clyde and ... well I can't give away the ending.   A great story, and my understanding is that it was taken from a true story.  If you are a movie fan, the story was updated and re-told in &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; in 1951 wth a beautiful young Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift in the starring roles.  But the movie, though nominated for several Academy Awards, is a pale imitation of Dreiser's book.  If you want this story, do yourself a favor and read the book first.",1997-12-29

The lessons Clyde takes away from Esta's pregnancy seem to have no bearing on his lack of empathy for Roberta once she conceives. He understands the social stigma attached to a child out of wedlock, but he never learned to accept responsibility for his conduct out of those circumstances. As Dreiser indicates just before the Lycurgus section of the novel opens, Clyde \\""never learns to grow up\\"".<br /><br />b. In his relationship with Hortense, particularly towards its close when she wants that coat from the merchant, (location 2181) we see that Clyde learns to associate desire, if not real love for another, with material augmentation, as Hortense herself has long been there. The same thing occurs later with Sondra Finchley, who is perhaps intentionally given the name of a flitting little bird-- and this is as much the dark side of the American Success as is its inability to rectify the hardship of poverty in a capitalist society. This may not be precisely what draws him to Roberta, but he winds up defining his relationship, as she comes to realize his presents to her doesn't mean she has his affection.<br /><br />c. The unethical conduct of Mason's subordinates is dated, by today's standards, but it does unfairly impact the justice that Clyde receives, which might have gone to life imprisonment had the evidence not been tainted and the anti-Mason juror pressured. Dreiser is also very good at looking at the ripple effect of Clyde's crime on everyone else, including Sondra and both branches of the Griffiths family-- but despite his *evil* as the Reverend McMillan sees it, Dreiser never loses sight of Clyde's humanity, and the hardship that shapes him, and this is a very difficult thing to do in a literary work, and as such carries a powerful impact, maybe even more so than Sister Carrie. I cannot think of any thriller that offers us such an interior sympathy for its villains, except for an author like Simenon, but the French are willing to take chances with formula that most American franchise authors will not; in that sense Dreiser's work is not only still relevant but a seminal achievement.
