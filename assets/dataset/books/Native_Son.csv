He, his mother, younger brother, and younger sister live in a dirty and rundown apartment building rented out by a wealthy white man. Bigger goes to work for this wealthy man, Mr. Dalton, and in a surprising turn of events ends up accidentally murdering his daughter, Mary.

Detailing the story of Bigger Thomas, a young man whose reality is fully determined by white racism, we witness his plunge into an irreparably fallen state through a highly ambiguous murder of a wealthy white girl. Although the majority of the content here is Bigger’s flight from the law (as well as the countless scenes of interrogation and prosecution that follow), Native Son is essence about the way in which anti-black racism determines the individual to be existentially homeless in America. Through the realization of Bigger’s guilt, his person becomes a blank canvas for the whites of Chicago to project their most heated vitriol—the novel is most successful in its capacity to represent the confrontation of an internal consciousness against an anonymous mob. And while the final defense of Bigger is overly tendentious, this work still has a considerable place in the history of African American literature, which is to say in the history of American literature itself.",2015-02-21

In fact, certainly, nobody is. This is a book beyond itself and it's time and place. When you pick up on the beautiful tradition of the classic American realists in Wright's (very, very modern - don't get me wrong) prose, and the existential leanings of Sartre and Dostoevsky, the fact that you are reading the most fully realized novel ever written begins to come into focus. Though this novel is acutely about race, and I am in no way trying to detract from that, there are aspects of this novel that are applied to the lives of the &#34;outsider&#34;. The &#34;Underground&#34; people of societies all over. In Wright's view, this position is most absolutely actualized in the form of &#34;Bigger,&#34; which is a name that doesn't take a close reading to understand the subtext (if such an overt allusion can even be called subtext). Wright plays with the relationship of signifiers and what's signified, he plays with language, he plays with narrative arc, he employs satire in juxtaposition with this novel which is dark and bleak and every way.

There is no question of the brutality of the crimes. An even Bigger, when in jail, believes he deserves to die for them.<br /><br />But through the story of Bigger Thomas, Richard Wright depicts a people confined to the edge of existence. Their physical segregation, having to live in certain neighborhoods in the city, symbolizes their existential segregation. Mr. Dalton, the building's owner and Bigger's employer, donates to help the Black community, but still allows his landlords to only rent units in certain neighborhood to Blacks. Perhaps the social force overwhelms this man's will to kindness.<br /><br />To Bigger, white people aren't flesh and blood but an impersonal force overwhelming him. \\""To Bigger and his kind white people were not really people; they were a sort of natural force, like a stormy sky looming overhead, or like a deep swirling river stretching suddenly at one's feet in the dark. As long as he and his black folks did not go beyond certain limits, there was no need to fear that white force. But whether they fear it or not, each and every day of their lives they lived with it.\\""<br /><br />So when Mary and Jan try to befriend Bigger and treat him better than other whites had, Bigger feels that force upon him. They, perhaps unknowingly, exert their power on him and Bigger resents that, even if the power comes from their kindness and goodness. He doesn't want to be told what to do; he wants to live. And so he hates Mary and Jan for forcing him to do something he doesn't want to. He tells his attorney Max, \\""Mr. Max, a guy gets tired of being told what he can do and can't do. You get a little job here and a little job there. You shine shoes, sweep streets; anything... You don't make enough to live on. You don't know when you going to get fired.

The story presents itself as a tale told many times in America. This book exemplifies the racial and class stereotypes during a time in American history that is frowned upon by many for its racial inequalities amongst other things. In the early 1900s America is moving into a new frontier, moving from a post reconstruction era to an industrial boom. With these changes large numbers of Americans begin to migrate to more urban areas. With these migrations many cities like Chicago became heavily populated with minorities trying to find their way. With a slow job market for most minorities and an ever increasing number of people forced into substandard living environment, many which have no choice but to turn their attention to living off the land. In most cases that meant being forced into a life of crime and injustice from law enforcement and the like.<br /> So is told the story of Native Son's Bigger Thomas. Bigger is a young Black make living in Chicago's south side, otherwise known as the region called the \\""Black Belt\\"". Mr. Wright printed a very clear picture when describing Bigger's living conditions. Bigger's living conditions is typical for African Americans of the past one hundred years. He lives in a crowed apartment complex with his family which consists of him, his mother, and two younger siblings, in a one bedroom apartment. Mr. Wright highlights the depressing environment in which Bigger lives by starting the novel off with a little black on black crime, were Bigger has an encounter with a large black rate in the apartment where he lives. The vicious way in which he kills the rat shows that despite the species of the creature what can happen when pent up anger and aggression are released. The next part to his adventure was meeting up with the fellas of his neighborhood gang. Frustrated with his current social and financial standing Bigger and the boys plan to rob someone. Just some random person won't do, they most target someone of prominence, a white man. Before they can carry out this mission, Bigger is over come with fear of the consequences that come from trifling with white people.<br /> Bigger is later given an opportunity to take a job as a chauffeur of one of Chicago's wealthy business types named Mr. Dalton. Now Mr. Dalton is pictured as this typical confused white man in the early 1900s. Mr. Dalton extorts money from the black community through the incredibly high rents he charges those who live in the Black Belt region. Yet he feels he is down for the Negro cause by presenting charity in the form of Ping-Pong tables for the local boys and girls clubs. Nonetheless Bigger gets the job because he has a criminal record. The Dalton's mission is to reform Bigger into a respectable person.<br /> Bigger would spend most of his time on the job for the Daltons driving their daughter Mary. Naïve Mary like most over privileged youth of any time period, wants to see how the other half lives tells Bigger to bypass the designated route to the university and show her how Black people live. After picking up Mary's communist boyfriend Jan, Bigger is instructed to take them on an adventure in the Black neighborhoods. During this time Mr. Wright shows the reader just how clueless people of prominence could be during the time, about the living standards of those less fortunate. After having a few drinks Bigger drives Mary back home. This is where the story truly picks up.<br /> Over the course of a few days Bigger lands himself in tons of trouble. Mr. Wright tells it best as the main character goes on a in adverted killing spree. After which a though investigation in sues. During this time you can see how Bigger and Blacks in general interacted with white people with authority, any white people for that matter during that time. There after Bigger's tragic story meets its beginning, middle, and Climax ina foul swoop. As he tries very hard to cover his tracks reality does not let up in pursuing him. All the while Bigger gingerly dances around the white people he encounters as to promote the stereotype that people of color can't commit such crimes to whites due to his lack of intelligence.<br /> The sad part is when the story is all said in done, though the story presents a story in which anything can happen next, the story ends the way it was always meant to end. With the death of someone who in retrospect knew nothing more than the life which was destined for him before he was even born. This American tragedy has been told many of times throughout time before and for years after the book was written. Mr. Wright's Native Son is just a reminder that no matter where you live or what year you live there can be seen many injustices committed when it comes to race. It solely depends on how hard you're willing to pay attention to what reality is putting in front of you.",2012-10-11

He is uneducated, frustrated in his ability to provide for his family and the tensions that brings, and he occasionally works small hustles with his small neighborhood gang and legitimate gigs around town. He eventually receives a chance to work for the wealthy Dalton family, who own the tenement building where he resides, in Hyde Park. This mansion and luxury the Daltons live in is an alien world to the pariahdom Bigger and his black friends and family members inhabit. His ennui of poverty and living in a white supremacist society is morphed into confusion over this brand new world. Mr. Dalton's daughter, Mary, introduces Bigger to her Communist boyfriend, Jan, but Bigger is unaware and disinterested in that political sphere. On a fateful night, Bigger feels threatened that his life is in danger over the thought of false rape accusations when he sneaks a kiss with Mary. This leads to a series of desperate and depraved acts of violence followed by determined, autonomous and deliberate actions of cover-up, hiding and evasion. Once apprehended and charged with multiple murders, Bigger Thomas begins a personal, even spiritual, journey directed by his own consciousness and his discussions with white sympathizers Jan and lawyer named Boris Max. All three receive epiphanies about themselves, race relations, society and humanity.<br /><br />The protagonist, Bigger Thomas, is a fascinating and deceptively complex character. Bigger had a feeling his whole life of white people judging him, looking at something wrong and ready to blame him; it was only a matter of when, not if, Bigger would be targeted for severe punishment. Is there also not a distaste towards white people as a badge of defeat from centuries of violence? There was a strain of living and going through days dealing with the silent hate and invisible violence throughout white society.

What complicates the matter is how should we react to Bigger? Is he a victim or aggressor?<br /><br />There are no easy answers, but what arouses my sympathy for him is the fact that at no point are any of the characters interested in him as an individual, or to acknowledge him as one; they either let there eyes glaze over his black skin or see him as a symbol for all that's wrong with 1930s race-divided America.

The first book is a powerful image of a young adult yearning for freedom; the second book presents the psychology of a man with guilt and power; the final book analyzes the underlying motives of the action in the first two books.<br /><br />Admittedly, much of Wright's work is unbelieveable. The most notable example is the liberal rights granted to a communist Jew in the courtroom circa 1940. It is simply impossible to believe that the mob outside would not, at the very least, assault him, if not kill him. The large gathering of visitors in the prison cell is also implausible.<br /><br />Wright himself defends these unlikely scenes in his long, long introduction. The idea \\""How Bigger Came to Be\\"" is straightforward enough, but it comprises a full-length essay all on its own, and the reader is not yet familiar with the character of Bigger, and so growing bored should be an unsurprising outcome.

The beginning pages were long lost and any other potential date displays were ripped or smeared. I was reading the future lining of my kitchen trash bin. How in the world could such wonderful gems as books have such cruel fates?<br /><br />This entire book is about cruel fates. Broken up into three parts, Wright's \\""Native Son\\"" tells the story of Bigger Thomas, an angry and foolish young black man from 1940's Chicago. He is powerfully built but weak-minded because he didn't have a proper education. He had big dreams of becoming an aviator but lack of opportunity forced him to live in a rat-infested room with his mother and two siblings. He just wanted to be left alone but his suffocating world would soon torture him with relentless attention. He was one of many young black men like this during the age of evil prejudice, withheld freedoms and spirit-breaking segregation.<br /><br />The first \\""book\\"" introduces us to Bigger and his dead end plan to rob a Jewish deli with his gang. The second \\""book\\"" shows that he could have a chance for a better life if he could make better choices.

The year was 1940, the Great Depression seemed endless, and it was not known that World War would soon provide the \\""meaningful employment\\"" that would end it. Segregation was the law in the South, the practice in the North, and the very act that created the current president of the United States was illegal in 30 of the 48 states, and would remain illegal in at least 16 of them until as late as 1967.

But he cannot protect himself from the stereotypes and prejudices that plague him and he becomes the very monster that everyone around him insisted on seeing in him. He is plagued by guilt, both for what he has done and for the damage he has done to others who look like him. And yet he cannot truly be blamed for this, because it is clear that those who hated him made sure, through systematic disenfranchisement, that he would fail eventually.<br /><br />Whereas Ellison's invisible man was able to disappear completely, Wright's Bigger was not so lucky, yet both are equally victims.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll",2008-11-20

The first is that it starts off very slowly, then builds up a powerful narrative steam (although not of the simplistic plot-driven variety), and the second is that it is a tale that overwhelmingly `tells' what is happening, rather than `showing', which violates all the simplistic MFA workshop prohibitions against same. Yet, it is a great novel- despite some flaws in length and occasional descriptive lapses into banality, because, by its end, and the courtroom speeches for and against the protagonist- a killer and rapist named Bigger Thomas, your average reader is wholly involved in the vortical scenario. And this scenario wholly undercuts the thesis that this book is about life as a black man. Instead, it is about life in America in the late 1930s, during the wane of the Great Depression, and just before the start of World War Two. In a sense, this book is an black urban counterpart to John Steinbeck's rural white The Grapes Of Wrath, even if it's a tad lesser of a work, much as Carson McCullers' The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter covers similar psychological ground as Betty Smith's A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, even though the former's protagonist is a Southern adult white male, and the latter's an adolescent New York female. When first released (in expurgated form; the unexpurgated version did not see daylight for over fifty years), it was a bestseller, with over 300,000 hard copies sold, and Wright immediately became a black icon and spokesman, but neither stage nor film versions of the tale have ever had the impact that the book did. A 1951 film version, made in Argentina, and starring a fortysomething non-actor Wright as Bigger, was ridiculed critically across the globe.<br /><br />  The novel, written in the third person omniscient- thus almost all `telling,' is divided into three long chapters, or `Books,' as in the older literary sense....All of these points, and more- too lengthy to detail in a mere review, prove that the book is far beyond its most strident and ignorant critics' claims, and is still as relevant (sadly) today, as ever; in the delusions that the poor are fed- be it of race, then, or war, today. It is no coincidence that, upon the eve of World War Two, Bigger dreams of a career in the military, as a flyboy, even as his race denied that possibility. It is also relevant in the ways that society delimits many of its citizens via poverty, in the way crimes are seized upon by politicians, the media, and authority figures to boost their careers, or even in how little everyday people, no matter their sex nor color, truly understand themselves. In the end, the biggest thing that Bigger Thomas admits is his fear of the act of cogitation, for with that comes realization, in every sense of the word, including of the self.

The story takes place sometime ago when the world seemed to be a lot different, but make no mistake about it, most of us know that Bigger Thomas still exists today.  Early in the first chapter, Fear, Wright describes Bigger as:<br /><br />\\""...a strange plant blooming in the day and wilting at night; but the sun that made it bloom and the cold darkness that made it wilt were never seen.  It was his own sun and darkness, a private and personal sun and darkness.  He was bitterly proud of his swiftly changing moods and boasted when he had to suffer the results of them.  It was the way he was, he would say; he could not help it, he would say....  And it was his sullen stare and the violent action that followed that made Gus and Jack and G.H. hate and fear him as much as he hated and feared himself.\\""<br /><br />The more one becomes familiar with Bigger, the more one realizes that a tragedy will befall Bigger; a tragedy that is a result of his own doing.  Bigger's instincts, honed by the pressures of being black and poor, will lead him down a path of ill-fated acts.  In the second chapter, Flight, the reader shadows Bigger's every move as tries to evade the inevitable.  In last chapter, Fate, watch as Bigger seals his fate; his destiny coming to fruition.<br /><br />If you want to experience oppression, race relations, poverty through the plight of a young black male in the early 20th Century, then this is one of the books to read.<br /><br />As a final note, I couldn't help but notice the Du Boisian references, where on occasion, Bigger is portrayed as being  \\""...behind a veil\\"" or \\""...behind a curtain\\"".",2008-07-27

While this quote may be more broadly applied, it summarizes the overall theme of the story.  Bigger Thomas is accused of the murder and rape of a white woman.  Though the argument is never posed that the murder is not a crime, the author presents the argument that it is a symptom of a flawed system.  The squalor  and graft to which African-Americans were subjected in the story does not exempt Bigger Thomas from guilt.  However, it is certain to increase the likelihood of future Bigger Thomases.    One can argue against the author's point, yet it is hard not to be disturbed by the hopeless story of Bigger Thomas.

Indeed, when this large wall of separation is breached, rabid fear is instilled in Bigger, which leads to his acts of murder. <br /> <br/>Blindness is a recurrent theme throughout, as Mrs. Dalton is literally blind, yet it is the entire society that is blind to the plight of the likes of Bigger Thomas.  Of course, Bigger is also blind to the other side and has bred hate and contempt for all whites, even those that do good.  Throughout Bigger's journey of self-awareness in prison, he attempts to break through this blindness and to see his purpose in life.  Tragically, only as he awaits his final fate does he realize that his white enemies and himself share the same fears and hopes and insecurities. <br /> <br />Although the first two-thirds of this novel will leave you spell-bound with its details and its suspense, I was expecting a letdown in the final part of the novel and a rehash of \\""The Jungle\\"" syndrome, as I'll call it.  In \\""The Jungle\\"", Sinclair provides a scintillating story in the first part of the novel, but this serves only as a pretext to the blatant Socialist propaganda in its final part (no thanks, Mr. Sinclair).  And though the last part of \\""The Native Son\\"" espouses Wright's philosophy on racial oppression and may be sympathetic toward Socialist ideals, it is more of a subtle warning against the conditions that existed at that time which were a powder keg for future violent racial strife.  Although there are definitely aspects which serve to blame society and divorce responsibility from his actions, in the end Bigger does take responsibility and comes to an understanding that he may have been oppressed and victimized, yet there were outlets other than violence for his despair. <br /> <br />Overall, Wright provides a chilling account of the state of race relations in 1930s Chicago and in America, in general.  Although some may interpret Wright's novel as an attempt to deflect responsibility and to blame society for the actions of others, I believe Wright is attempting to distill a much deeper meaning and understanding for all races to come together.",2007-01-23

He has known prejudice, white scorn and poverty all his life, a life without hope future or any meaning. When he gets a job as a chauffer in a good Samaritan white family, he is happy and yet bit resentful of their patronizing, their condescending manner. On the very first outing with their young daughter and her communist friend, tragedy strikes due exclusively to Bigger's sub- conscience fear of association with white women. Once he commits the ultimate crime, inadvertently as it was, it spirals out of control and one need not wonder about the denouement.<br /><br />When the case goes to trial, Bigger's attorney makes eloquent, convincing case of three hundred year history of slavery, bigotry, hatred that resulted in such inevitable tragedy. He concludes Bigger was a victim of society, a world at large with its own rules and customs where he was a pariah from the day he was born. Bigger could not comprehend that not all whites hate blacks and harbor bigotry.<br /><br />It is a fascinating account of racism in the twentieth century America.

Purely as entertainment -- is it an enjoyable (however you want to define that) read? -- the book is spotty.  My edition runs about 500 pages, including a lengthy, self-important introduction by the author, and I found the middle 250 pages very compelling reading; I really wanted to know what happened next.  The beginning and end were far less interesting.  This is attributable largely to the author's very obvious intent to use the novel as a means to convey a Message, and his limited skill.  Rather than have the message emerge as an implication of the story, the characters instead are crudely-drawn stereotypes designed to portray and declare, in very broad strokes, the author's philosophical beliefs, which are not at all subtle.  Time and time again I came across passages that were so heavy-handed and preachy, with the narrator forcing his views down the reader's throat between the characters' chessboard-like moves, that I thought they'd make excellent examples of bad writing for a class of beginning novelists.       The book therefore must be valued, if at all, for the author's message and the novel's place in history as one of the first to try to address it. I find it difficult to imagine that a modern reader could find the author's premise -- that centuries of oppression made blacks capable of acting in a manner that those in the dominant culture would consider inhumanly brutal -- particularly new and revealing, but it's important to consider that it apparently was so when the book was written only sixty-six years ago, itself an important commentary on American society. The book therefore would be an excellent addition to the reading list for a class on history or sociology.      Taken out of historical context (i.e., ignoring the fact that this was a new perspective at the time and setting aside the tremendous credit due Wright for having written it when he did), I found it unpersuasive.  This is not to say that conditions have changed so much that what may have been true in 1940 has little relevance today, but that the author failed to persuade me that a brutal rapist and murderer who, the author acknowledges, has virtually no redeeming qualities, and never showed any remorse, should be spared, in 1940 or today, the death penalty, unless it is assumed the death penalty is per se never appropriate.  This is certainly a reasonable view, and at very least a point worth debating, but it is not the author's point, which is that his protagonist should be spared because Society Made Him Do It -- a point that he tries to make in an attorney's speech that (speaking as an attorney) is terribly inept. (In fact, after taking hundreds of pages to get to the point where Wright finally takes the opportunity to express his perspective directly, I felt the author fell flat on his face.)  I know of far better crafted works that have since been written that are both more interesting and more persuasive about the author's intended message, and I'm by no means very knowledgeable about this genre (Manchild in the Promised Land and the Autobiography of Malcolm X come to mind.)    So as an historical document, I'd give this five stars, but if its historical context doesn't interest you, I'd pass.",2006-09-09

There are many presentations of race--from the 'apes' of the fearful white masses, to the self-loathing of young unemployed African-American men, to the color-blind Daltons and Communists (each with a substantially limited view of what constitutes the racial experience of Bigger).  No one experience by itself is sufficient, since Bigger at least partially rejects them all.  Race is a particular structure of what the Existentialists called facticity, and it is not as important to classify it metaphysically as it is to interrogate it experientially.  Students in philosophy courses could benefit a great deal from seeing how little ground we have gained since this book was written.

On the one hand, we disapprove of what Bigger Thomas does but we can't completely condemn him either. The problem is that his actions are partially a result of the oppression under which he - and all African Americans - has had to live all his life.  <br /> <br />It's interesting to compare the book to two works on similar themes - John Fowles \\""The Collector\\"" and Dostoyevsky's \\""Crime and Punishment.\\"" All three works deal with murder of women but in each case the emphasis is different. For the great Russian novelist, the import is moral, for the Englishman it's socioeconomic and for Wright it's race. I don't mean to suggest that these elements don't coexist in several of these stories, but in each case the respective author means to point out one specific element over the others. This gives the reader a fascinating look at the nature of crime and makes us question both what punishment would be fair and how to mitigate such future violence. <br /> <br />Wright's book works best when he lets his character, Bigger, speak for himself. However, the author can't seem to help inserting much of his own voice. This becomes most intrusive during the last section \\""Fate,\\"" in which you can almost see Wright - in the character of Max - walk onto the stage and grandstand. While this makes the meaning of the book painfully clear, you really should have understood him hundreds of pages earlier. I suppose this ending courtroom drama is a product of the book's times.

As I read the book, I felt myself somehow tied to the main character, Bigger.  I cheered for him, was ashamed with him, and I had a hard time putting the book down because it was so enthralling.  It was great to be able to feel a part of a life that was so different than my own.  The culture of Bigger Thomas is something very foreign to me, and I appreciated being able to feel like I was in his shoes.  Richard Wright is undoubtedly a great writer, and I am looking forward to reading more of his books, enjoying his stories and trying to understand his ideas that seem so illogical to me.  The story was improbable is some parts, and I think the author sacrificed reality for the philosophy that he was pushing.  This didn't take away from the suspense or interest of the story.<br />Though the story was great, the author had some ideological axes to grind that were very evident in this novel.  At first, I felt his agenda was race (the oppression of blacks).  Then I felt his agenda was politics (the greatness of socialism).  But I think his agenda goes even farther than those two issues, the agenda has roots much deeper than race and politics.  The issue at hand is a worldview issue, in which Richard Wright tries to show the supremacy of the individual over anything else (society, religion, race) but in his world, the individual is powerless to the society.  I believe Wright has given too much credit and power to society.  In the book, Bigger Thomas is portrayed as a puppet in the hands of a white-controlled society.  Though society is undoubtedly influential, in no way can it control individuals in the way that the main character, Bigger, was controlled in this book.  Richard Wright is living proof that society is not supreme, for he wrote books that were definitely not wanted by the society that he thinks hates him and his ideas.<br />In my opinion, this ideology is the easy way out.  Blame goes on everyone but self, and the individual is justified in making poor, selfish, and destructive decisions.  In the book, the white majority was definitely wrong in the way they treated the black minority.  But it is my contention that this is not ground for rape and murder which Bigger Thomas was guilty of (the accidental murder of Mary and the deliberate rape and murder of Bessie).  Maybe I am ignorant like the character, Mr. Dalton, but I think that the powerful and the rich ought not to be blamed for the bad decisions that individuals make, even though the powerful and the rich may be a negative influence.  Society is never going to be perfect.  And even though America obviously has its problems (especially in the 40's) its society is much better than most around the world.

In the book, the white majority was definitely wrong in the way they treated the black minority.  But it is my contention that this is not ground for rape and murder which Bigger Thomas was guilty of (the accidental murder of Mary and the deliberate rape and murder of Bessie).  Maybe I am ignorant like the character, Mr. Dalton, but I think that the powerful and the rich ought not to be blamed for the bad decisions that individuals make, even though the powerful and the rich may be a negative influence.  Society is never going to be perfect.  And even though America obviously has its problems (especially in the 40's) its society is much better than most around the world.

I liked the beginning of the story because it gives you an insight to Bigger Thomas's pre-story life.  It explains that Bigger had been involved in criminal activites and attended a reform school.  Also in the beginning of the story, it shows his demeanor when he kills a rat in a very disgusting way.  This re-enforced the fact that he was troubled.<br />     I also like that the typical stereo type of white people hating blacks is cleared up showing that even before the equal opportunity laws existed, some whites gave African Americans chances to better themselves.  An example from this story would be how Mr. Dalton, aka the Rich white man, takes the risk of hiring a young black man, who has had a criminal history, to be his family's chauffer.  Another instance is when Mrs. Dalton asks Bigger if he wishes to attend night school to better his education, since he was only educated to the 8th grade.<br />     Another interesting part is where the plot starts to add up. On the first night on the job, Bigger is faced with some excitement and some peculiar happenings.   For instance, he is driving Mary Dalton, the Daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Dalton, and picks up one of Mary's friends, Jan.  He is a boy with a weird name, kind of like a \\""Boy named Sue.\\""  Jan insists on driving.  Jan happens to be a Communist and try's to push some communist pamphlets on to Bigger to show that the Communist party wants to help the African American community.  This surprised Bigger and made him feel uncomfortable.<br />     The one thing that I didn't like about this book was the graphic description of a later incident with Mary Dalton, when he tries to conceal an event that happens between them.<br />     I also looked to find some information on Richard Wright.  I found that in real life he was connected to the communist party and had actually married a white woman.  He later divorced and then married another white women.  I believe that he put some of his real life experiences and feelings into this book.  Maybe he was thinking of his first wife when he came up with the character Mary Dalton because in the story there are bitter feelings toward Mary and since he divorced his first wife there may have been bitter feelings.",2004-01-22

This gives the story all the intensity and focus of a first-person account, but enables the author to use a more articulate voice than his subject would have been capable of.  Few novelists have employed this technique in such an uncompromising way.  We are with Thomas every breath, every step.  I think few readers will get to like him, any more than Wright himself does, but we get to know and understand him.  He is a product of 1930s America, of deeply ingrained racial prejudice and extreme economic disparity.  Wright does not suggest that this excuses Bigger, only that it explains him.  The writing style is lean and muscular, sparse and direct.  We are given only bare descriptions as Wright allows action and dialogue to carry the story.<br />It is worth dealing with a couple of criticisms posted by other reviewers: firstly, the wooden axe handle does not survive the fire; we are told specifically that only the metal axehead remains.  Secondly, it is entirely plausible that, in his panic, Bigger did not think to hide under the bed.  Indeed, depending on the style of bed, it may not have been possible.  The plot is actually quite sound, the only really implausible element being the gathering of the entire cast of characters in the prison cell, something Wright himself acknowledged could not happen in reality but for which he allowed himself dramatic license.  It is true though, that the final phase goes on too long and the long diatribes from Max are unconvincing.  Another socialist writer, Upton Sinclair, suffered from the same tendency to preach instead of relying on the story to carry the message.  Despite these reservations, &quot;Native Son&quot; remains an important social commentary and a forceful and compelling portrait of a lost soul.",2004-01-19

He commands both hatred and sympathy at the same time.  He is full of evil and yet also very human.  He is one of those characters that will haunt his readers long after the book has been closed.<br />Richard Wright should be applauded for his courage in choosing to take the approach he did with this novel.  He does not create a typical hero who will inspire others.  He does not try to paint black America in rosier shades in order to convince the white majority to give up their prejudices.  Instead he gives us one of the worst of the bunch, a directionless punk, a criminal, an abuser of women, a young man full of anger and hatred.  And yet we see the world through his eyes, and only his eyes, and eventually we come to see the humanity in him, despite his many flaws.  We come to care for this kid, even after he commits two heinous crimes, and (dare I say?) we even hope for his escape or an acquittal in the courtroom.  Why is that?  Perhaps it is because the inevitable outcome is so obvious, so preordained.  We want to hold on to a small glimmer of hope that perhaps there will be something to cheer for.<br />Wright gets a bit preachy at times, especially at the end when Max makes his passionate plea for mercy on Bigger's behalf in the courtroom.  It reminded me of the 96-page radio address at the end of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.  Fortunately Wright keeps his speech to under 10 pages, but I'm always a bit annoyed when authors completely abandon subtlety and simply decide to speak through their characters like through puppets.  I'm not sure it was even necessary in this case.  Throughout the book Wright presents a powerful indictment of American society, and the reader does not need to be beaten over the head with a brick (excuse the stolen reference) in order to get the point across.

Wright's Bigger Thomas is a stand-in for black America of the early 20th century, driven to vile deeds out of fear and desperation from his disenfranchisement by a white-dominated society.  From the very first scene with a rat-hunt in his family apartment (which nicely prefigures his own unenviable position on the fringes of society), Bigger is characterized as a guy who just seems to be getting the short end of the stick in just about everything, and only truly feels empowered when he expresses himself through violence.  <br />Despite the intensity of its subject material, the book is not without flaws.  In addition to the plausibility issues involved with Mrs. Dalton and the furnace (I really don't see how she couldn't have felt something was not right in Mary's room, nor how a burning body doesn't give off a noticable, rank odor), the lengthly third section of the novel undermines much of the cohesion of the rest of the story.  Given that its primary focus is on a trial whose outcome (thanks to the precedence of the other two chapters) we can easily predict, the tension and momentum that drove the rest of the story is absent.  In its place, we're left with a long, rambling closing statement by Bigger's lawyer that seems superfluous and not at all clarifying, much less convincing.<br />It seems as if the author wanted (using Max as a proxy) to get up on his soapbox at the end of the story and directly reproach the evils of racism, ignorance, and poverty that led to Bigger's downfall, but there is no real need for this, seeing as how his masterful narrative of Bigger's indiscretions and lack of foresight has already established this as strongly, if implicitly, as possible.  There's little need for an author to devote fifty pages at the end of the book to explain the story that just preceded it, especiallyone as uniform in tone and mood as this one.  As a whole, I think that Native Son is a great, valuable novel, but I wish that Wright would have written it with a better appreciation for subtlety and a greater faith in the power of imagery rather than direct explication.",2003-12-29

Richard Wright experimented with so many diffrent styles, it was at times hard to keep reading. The one thing I didn't really like about the book was, well, I didn't like the main charater. From the start I didn't like what he did or how he thought. It was hard for me to feel for him. I felt sorry for all of the people that Bigger knew. If you think about it, Bigger screwed up his relationship with ANYONE! All of the sub characters were only trying to help Bigger and he spit in the face in one way or another. He didn't support and was mean to his mother, he killed his girfriend, he threatened to kill his bestfriend, he turned down and framed the white man trying to be nice to him. I was so ready for Bigger to get caught. I didn't want him to get the money and run off with it and I didn't want him to live freely. <br />However, on the bright side, the message Wright uses in a lot of his books came across strongly. &quot;Why couldn't the whites just leave the blacks alone.&quot; <BR>In every point of view. Of course, I'm not a believer of this in the year 2003, but in this story, had Mary just left Bigger alone, she wouldn't have been murdered. People like Bigger shouldn't be bothered! If it was important to her, she should have tried to befriend Bessy or bigger's mother. They are the people who deserved the kind, warm hands of Mary and Jan not someone who will cut them off!!! <br />The ending (and when I say ending I mean the last 3 pages!) is what got me though. I finally realized what Bigger needed. A friend he could just trust, maybe another chance, or perhaps a completely diffrent life! I felt sorry for him because he was physiclly and mentally trapped behind the bars of his personality and life. He could have been a hard working, affective, loving (well, maybe) man. <br />In all, I don't regret reading this book.",2003-12-01

As a black Communist sympathizer, Wright was a member of two of the most oppressed and hated groups in America, but he wrote a moving novel explaining his liberal ideas and explaining the plight of African-Americans. Using the crimes and trial of a tragic black murderer, Wright persuasively lays out his ideas about race and politics, and how society would be better off if they gave blacks a chance at the same education, jobs and housing that whites had available to them. This was a revolutionary idea at the time, but one that is slowly, but surely, gaining acceptance to this day. <br />Aside from the subject matter, which makes this book an excellent historical (seeing as the setting is now 70 years ago and hardly recognizable anymore) look at race and class relations, politics, and urban America, this is a very well written story. The main characters are diverse and interesting, the action is rapid, and the dialogue, both external and internal, is gritty and realistic. It flows well and is a quick read. It is at some points hard to read, because the action is so intense and graphic, but certainly worth the brief gruesome scenes.<br />The only reason I wouldn't give this book a five star rating and consider it a classic as many people do, is that it becomes bogged down in rhetoric in the end. The murder trial of Bigger Thomas is too long, political, and heavy handed. Of course this was the time when Wright wanted to sum everything up and present his views, but the book slowed to a crawl, he became far to abstract, and really ended the book on a down note. Fortunately this doesn't ruin the book, just makes it not as great as it could have been.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone, from the casual reader, to a 20th century historian, to someone who wants to learn more about race, politics, or class relations.

And it has questionable plot elements. In the key scene where Bigger is trying to prevent Mrs. Dalton from knowing he is in the bedroom with her daughter, one must wonder why he would so thoroughly lose his presence of mind, not to realize that she might not only walk up to the bed and smell her daughter's breath and clothing to see that it reeks of alcohol, but that she might also feel her way to her daugher's body, only to discover Bigger's presence? We're already told that he has seen her feel her way down hallways. So, why not, when sensing Mrs. Dalton's presence, simply hide under the bed? The other thing that makes the book dated is that now Bigger Thomas is the archetype for the recalcitrant, violent African American male. At the time Wright wrote the book I'm sure it was innovative. But it became so popular that now, racists in masse see Bigger Thomas when they think of African American males.

It is well written, moving, and thought-provoking. It is also often poorly taught and discussed.<br />Too many people who discuss this book would lump it into the genre of naturalistic fiction. They argue that Bigger, like the characters of authors like Dreiser and Lewis, is constrained by his environment. These commentators would rob the character of Bigger of his ability to determine his own fate.<br />Bigger Thomas, no matter how constrained by circumstance, is his own master. His decisions, not his surroundings or heredity determine his fate.<br />Biggers mother is depicted as upstanding, hardworking, loving and Christian. Biggers mother loves and is greatly concerned for her oldest son. She provides as stable of a home setting as is possible in her circumstances. She is perceptive enough to see that Biggers life outside of the home is the true threat to her sons well being, it is for this reason that she sets Bigger up with a great job for a person with his record.<br />Here Wright allows us see Biggers first set of choices. Rather than be grateful to his mother, Bigger goes out on the town with his fellow criminal friends who he then alienates by being excessively domineering and cruel. He then takes the job because he has nothing to do. Even here, Bigger brings the massive chip on his shoulder to his new setting.<br />Bigger chooses to see the worst in people (there is always plenty to seeno matter where you are). Rather than try and understand his employers desire to help the unfortunate, Bigger sees condescension. Rather than taking Jans friendship for what it is worth, he sees the political motive of Jans friendliness.<br />One can argue that the book bears out Biggers suspicions. After all, when everything comes down most of the whites do in fact only see a black monster. Yet this begs the question: Was Bigger truly doomed by his heredity and social status? The answer to this is a qualified no. Bigger still had choices. The fact that he made all the wrong ones does not mean that he had to.<br />In a sense, Bigger, as black person in the Chicago ghettos of the early twentieth century was indeed doomed to having far less options than his white counterparts. Wright condemns such a plight. He unmasks the racism of even the most well-intentioned whites. Yet I believe Wrights societal critique also exposes Biggers other options. The two alternatives we are blatantly presented with are the causes.<br />Bigger could have escaped in the cause of Communism. He could have made his life (even his crimes and punishment) worth something in the context of the great struggle as envisioned by Mr. Max. The flaw here is one of what then of Bigger? Bigger gets to make a profound statement, perhaps betters the world for others, but what does it get Bigger?<br />The other cause Bigger could have escaped into was his mothers rather pietistic, reward-in-the-next-world form of Christianity.  Again, the problem with this is one of what of this life? Should Bigger sit on his oppressed hands and wait to die?<br />The problem with both of the causes Bigger is presented with is that they do nothing for the here and now. They were offered (at least with any force) too late. These great causes, with the exception of Biggers mother, cared little for Bigger until he was surrounded by all the hoopla of his trial. So, once again--was Biggers fate predetermined by circumstance?<br />Biggers final moments are filled with a vain dream partly born by his misinterpretation of Mr. Maxs final address to him. Nevertheless, it is clear that however buried, Biggers dream had previously existed in him. Bigger claims that his dream was the motivation for his crimes--in which case it would have existed long before any philosophy had tainted the picture.<br />Just as Nietzsche says bad men have no songs (how is it then that the Russians have songs) how is it that this automaton of location and genes has dreams? If he dreams then must he not decide whether or not to act on such dreams?<br />It is Biggers consistent failure to choose his dreams that leads to his nightmare. Perhaps he is paralyzed by the vagueness of his dream. Bigger knows what he does not want to do. He cannot decide on nor do what he wants. Even his one seemingly fulfilled action--the murder of his girlfriend--turns out to have failed.<br />This condition of indecisiveness is allegorically dealt with in Biggers repeated putting off of cleaning the furnace of Mary Daltons ashes and bones. This procrastination is the reason why Bigger is eventually caught.<br />Dreams, indecision, pathos, and regret add up to a tragedy. This tragedy was not caused by environment or even race. Though race and position hinder Bigger, his fate has clearly not been written in the stars. His decisions are his alonenot the result of society.

It speaks of prejudices, foreign to me being a middle class white female in the 21st century, yet assisted my understanding of how confining and debilitating this must have been. I am embarrassed of how my white ancestors treated the black population, and very aware that hatred for different races is prominent on all sides of the color wheel. Like the author of Native Son, I wish that people could understand that down deep, in our psyches and inner core- there is no color. Native Son also speaks of - death-, which transcends all racial boundaries and unites us all in the end.<BR> The novel is based on young Bigger Thomas, a Negro teenager growing up in Chicago's 'black belt' in the 40's. Daily Bigger must deal with his poor and starving family, pressure of being the 'leader' of his delinquent group of friends; he is segregated, oppressed, angry and most of all very scared. A brutal bully on the exterior masks his silent fear that he discusses with no one and doesn't even admit to himself. The source of Bigger's fear (and hatred) is the great mountain of white people, whom he holds accountable for oppression of the Negro population. One afternoon, Bigger devises a plan with his buddies to rob a white delicatessen. He then starts a fight and pulls a knife on one of his the boys in order to get out of pulling off the burglary. Later that night he is to get his first job, driving the family car for a very prominent white family on the other side of town. Though he doesn't admit it, Bigger is happy that he will at least have money for his family to be able to eat. That evening, on his first task of driving the young daughter to a 'school event' - young Mary is murdered by Bigger in an accidental sort of way. Bigger derives a plan to cover up the situation, which fails miserably and he gets himself into even more trouble. The painful and gruesome actions that Bigger is able to perform are the byproduct of his oppression and ultimate fear. Despite that he is pretty certain he will be unable to escape his fate; after the murder, Bigger is more calm and peaceful then he has been ever before in his life. It's like he has been waiting for something disastrous to happen his whole life and now that it has, there is no reason to worry about trying to prevent it any longer. He deals with his fate stoically, for now he is a man and understands more deeply than before. He arrives at an enlightened existence of race and death and fear and anger, and for the first time believes that maybe he really is something more than a criminal black kid on the streets of Chicago. <br />Richard Wright, the author of Native Son, grew up in a poor family in the South with much segregation. He later moved to Chicago- where he found it to be less prejudiced, but still his people were very confined. Despite his hard, poor childhood- in and out of orphanages, he was able to become an educated and enlightened author. Many blacks have asked him why he didn't write a tale of a successful brother such as himself, fearing that the boy that he depicts will only confirm the suspicions of whites that blacks are all evil and capable of gruesome crimes. His view on this was that he had to be honest, had to make a statement as to how this whole mess of racism and hatred could end up if something was not done. He wanted people to know that there is a hatred for whites among the black population that is as deep and powerful as its counterpart.  Mostly, he felt that he could not be afraid to relate this message, and would not succumb to the fear of doing so.",2003-02-18

His plot is shockingly salient.  And his writing style and sentence structure is nothing less than superb.  In one of the most introspective novels of the modern day, Wright describes the plight of impoverished African Americans in Chicago in 1940.  With a plot that is riveting, Wright discloses to the reader a side of society that many people never have the opportunity to witness or directly observe.<br />With delicacy and aplomb, Wright illustrates how people with no hope of success in life can be brought to violent action not by design, but by impulse provided because of the deprivation that is imposed upon them by societal indiscretion.  The pervasive prejudice that was endemic in that period is graphically articulated by Wright's well chosen words.<br />What is most disturbing though, is how little society has changed in over 60 years.  While today, there are laws that protect minorities there still exists a plethora of prejudice against those who are not White Anglo Saxon Americans.  This anomaly is fueled by an unusual American xenophobia that still captures the minds of the unenlightened to a great degree.  While segregation is no longer a legal practice, it still seems to be the ever present and overarching character of all too many Americans.  It gives the reader pause to consider how many years must go by, before American society becomes racially neutral.  Even today, only the smallest percentage of African Americans succeed in achieving the quintessential &quot;American Dream.&quot;  To most, this opportunity is just not available.<br />Any reader who doubts that high level classic fiction can be created by modern authors will be swayed significantly by &quot;Native Son.&quot;  The book is recommended to every single American reader.

Here was a gorgeously realized essay that basically outright states that the effort of the book was to cause a change in society.  That is fine, I suppose, as a means to an end when a skilled writer takes up a cause and seeks to expose the world to his home truths, but in a novel, which historically needs a great story to sustain its relevance, such a nobel or ignobel (depending upon your persuation) goal might ruin a potentially thrilling narrative.<br />Parts one and two are marvelous; searing, insightful long passages of identity, understanding and crisis, wrecked by social considerations and two-way prejudices that force all scenes of life to become mutual misunderstandings.  The story is vivid and told with an uncommon force, growing and expanding in range and vocabulary as the situation tightens and all hope boils into steam and breaks up . . .<br />And then . . . part three.  Here is an attempt at justification, complicating the situation (most particularly in Bigger's mind) by imposing political explainations and making suggestions of possible reasons behind the acts of horror that frankly come across as vapid excuses.  And while humanizing the oppressed and the criminal in a nobel manner, giving insight into character and the personal anguish caused by shame, guilt and rage, the explainations also seek to excuse individuality by stating that people can never make choices and are only forced to live the lives they struggle to lead.  At the time this was written, just prior to WWII, many of the concerns were far more on the front line and opportunities weren't as plentiful for anyone.  The evolution of society has made Wright's powerful story more prophetic than valid.  The imposition of such a blaring interruption as a twenty-page lecture on the reasons the Socialists are right that ultimately seeks to exploit the cause of racism to justify its own denial of individual humanity is a tiresome, ponderous mistake that subtly undermines the psychological insight of everything that comes before.<br />It is a shame Wright seemed more moved by politics than the genuine passion and realities of his riveting character.  He claims otherwise in his introduction (which, frankly, contains some of the finest passages within the entire book), but he appears to have become distracted by partisan consideration when telling the story of someone who couldn't possibly care about his concerns, no matter how much we seek to pity him.dermines the psychological insight of everything that comes before.<br />It is a shame Wright seemed more moved by politics than the genuine passion and realities of his riveting character.

It is a perspective on race relations in America in the 1930's -- how whites treat blacks and how blacks react -- and it rings true today louder than ever.  It is about black resentment against the white establishment, but it has emphathy for all its characters and presents several different points of view about the roles of victim and aggressor.<br />The protagonist is a 20-year-old black man named Bigger Thomas who lives with his mother, brother, and sister in an abject one-room apartment in Chicago's South Side.  He normally spends his days and nights stealing, shooting pool with his hoodlum friends, and hanging out with his girlfriend Bessie.  The novel begins on the day he is to start a new job as a chauffeur for the Dalton family, white millionaire philanthropists whose mischievous daughter, Mary, is a progressive liberal and a Communist sympathizer.  If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, the Daltons are working the jackhammer.  <br />The first night on the job, Mary instructs Bigger to drive her and her Communist boyfriend Jan around town while they get sloshed.  When they get home, Bigger feels obligated to take the drunken Mary up to her room and, to avoid being discovered in her room by her mother, accidentally smothers Mary with a pillow to keep her quiet.  To cover up this accident, which he is sure the white world will consider a case of a black man raping and murdering a white woman, he stuffs her body into the Daltons' furnace.<br />(...)<br />Bigger's predicament after the murder ironically gives him a certain freedom and control for the first time in his life.  He feels the white establishment has been oppressing and restraining him for so long that it was inevitable that one day he would seize a position of power with an incredible act of violence.  He knows that the whites will never understand the real reason he killed Mary, so there is no point in trying to convince them.  Because he feels that he's always been hated by white society, it fulfills a kind of persecution fantasy to listen to the angry shouts of white mobs looking to lynch him.  <br />A prevalent motif in the novel is the American paranoia towards Communism in the 1930's, which creates a striking parallel to Bigger's paranoia towards whites and also reflects Wright's interest in Communism at the time and his belief that it would provide racial equality.  That a novel filled with such angry, hateful characters, both black and white, could be written with such compassion and intelligence is indicative of a great writer, and the legacy of this novel maintains Wright as one of the great chroniclers of the history of American society.",2001-12-12

If only he was not poor and black in 1930s Chicago he may have found it. His situation is bleak and certainly not preferable for someone young and full of energy. Bigger is penniless. All occupational opportunities offered to him are menial. His father is dead. His mother is poor, overemotional and obtuse. White radicals such as communists will only get him into trouble. White philanthropy does not understand him and provides only the tritest comforts. His peers are as trapped as he is. The white ruled world has established high walls between him and the gentler aspects of society. He is growing furious in a societal cage too small for him. He is bound for trouble and finds it in the murder of a young, white woman in a moment of haste.<br />Leading African-American novelist, Richard Wright, sets himself a considerable challenge with Native Son. His protagonist is the type of young, black man who is often despised. Bigger is an unemployed urban dweller who is full of rage and guilty of an atrocious crime. Nevertheless, readers deeply care about him. Bigger is basically good-natured, yet completely conflicted and confused. In an attempt to outrun the inevitable he commits dreadful, yet utterly, logical acts. The series of dilemmas he faces is inexcusably unjust and gravely challenging, yet perfectly realistic. By understanding both the prejudices and truth surrounding African-American society Wright brilliantly antagonizes even the most intellectualized presumptions and prejudices about minorities, while leading his readers down a path of aching sympathy and nail-biting suspense. Wright's narrative skillfully places readers behind Bigger's eyes.

The story centers around Bigger Thomas, a 20 year old black man who hasn't done much with his life up to this point.  He lives in a one room apartment with his mother, sister and brother without many prospects for the future.  He has already spent some time in reform and has been hanging out with the wrong crowd.  Finally, a chance comes along that could turn things around for Bigger.  He is given the job of driving for a wealthy white family and I was hoping it would work out for Bigger, but the first night on the job things go terribly wrong.  Mary Dalton, the daughter of the wealthy white man, has Bigger drive her supposedly to the university in the evening, but instead goes to meet up with her boyfriend, Jan, who is in the communist party.  Jan and Mary try to befriend Bigger, but he is confused by this and hates Mary.  By the time the night is over, Mary and Jan are drunk and Bigger has to figure out a way to get Mary up to her bedroom without her parents finding out.  As things turn out, Bigger ends up murdering Mary, albeit accidently, and to cover up his crime he carries her body down into the basement and chops her head off, then sticks her into the furnace where he hopes she will burn completely leaving no trace of the crime.  I actually found myself on Bigger's side, hoping he wouldn't get caught, because it all had been an accident, but of course things get out of control from here.  The author has woven a suspensful story, capturing the feel of how it would be to be a black person in 1940 when they weren't welcome in most places, and were hated by white people.  As Bigger goes to trial he is defended by a white man who comes to understand why Bigger felt the way he did and helps Bigger come to terms with his execution.

Wright's depiction of the oppression that blacks experienced in the 1930's is not to characterize whites as racist or as villains.  It is simply trying to show the graveness of the conditions that were then present.  First, Wright divides the book into three sections: fear, flight, and fate.  Book One introduces the first motif of fear.  This is the foundation of Bigger's struggle, because he must overcome fear to prove himself.  He and many others in his society fear white people.  This is shown by how they are quick to burglarize fellow blacks, but will not dare rob a white man.  Also, Through Bigger's fear, he tries to display a hard exterior so that people can not see his weaknesses.  He can not \\""be swept out of himself with fear and despair\\"" (9).  He has to maintain an \\""attitude of iron reserve\\"" (9).  Therefore, the only way that he knows how to be hard is through violence.  This violence takes the form of mean acts towards family and friends, burglary, and murder.  The first action of the story is the ringing of an alarm clock.  This is the beginning of the time motif.  This element of time is frequent throughout the novel.  It draws the reader's attention and signals a warning or foreshadowing.  Most importantly, it represents the time Bigger has left to live.  From this first Brrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiing, Bigger's life is counting down.  The story ends with a ring just as it begins with a ring.  As the book closes, Bigger \\""hears the ring of steel against steel as a far door clanged shut\\"" (359).  Early in the novel Bigger kills a rat in his family's one-bedroom apartment.  This scene is important because it provides an in-depth view of the conditions that Wright illustrates.  The one-room apartment and the rat, which threatens the Thomas family, symbolize poverty.  As Bigger fights and kills the rat, his family members are overcome with violence.  The rat is hungry, and therefore, attacks the family.  Bigger retaliates with violence as well.  This struggle parallels Bigger's struggle with humanity.  Going deeper, this symbolizes the black struggle.  The rat's death introduces the motif of death.  Book Two: Flight suggests Bigger's attempt to escape the consequences of his crime.  This action is a result of fear.  As he flees he resorts to violence because he is somewhat disillusioned.  In Book Two: Fate, his violence catches up to him and he must face his fate.  Fate represents the motif of death.  In this section, Wright uses the character of Max to show the aid that is given to disadvantaged blacks.  Max is a communist, like Richard Wright, and he tries to help Bigger even though he himself is white.  Wright uses this element because he believed that communism was the solution to the black problem.   Furthermore, Bigger's outcome is meant to show how society treats troubled people who cry out for help.  It combines with the scenes describing black and white burglaries to address the injustices of African-Americans during this era.  These elements show how a person is pursued and brought to justice for a crime against a white person, but not for the same crime against a black person.    In conclusion, Bigger Thomas reaches his ultimate goal in the end.  Despite his fate, he is able to define his life.  Bigger's achievement shows how black's must overcome all adversities to emerge from social bondage to define their lives and their equality.",2001-05-07

Richard Wright's introductory essay &quot;How Bigger Was Born&quot; is an excellent essay, and prompted me to read the book.  I did see where Wright was unsuccessful in some places, particularly towards the end of the novel, when the two attorneys are speaking.  We lose the sense of Bigger's perspective, and get Wright's and others' perspectives, which Wright says he did not want to do.  The strongest parts of the book are in the beginning and through his escape and plotting. Reading this book, say on the train for a half hour, you get off and look around you with a nasty scowl.  It's impossible not to.  You can truly understand the character, and how he would react to most situations.  Wright goes ahead and gives him the most trying circumstances around.  Bigger is a compelling character, and this is a great story.  Bigger's hopes and dreams, his nasty worldiness, and his frightening distorted realization of his purpose and his self at the end are slowly growing entities of their own, which leave an undelible mark on the reader forever.  I don't expect to ever forget much of this book.  One of the things I liked in the essay was how Wright said, after the response to his short stories, that he would never write something that would be so easy as to bring tears.  Your approach to this is much more difficult. It's not a tear-jerker.  An excellent read, the book is written in plain good prose, too.

At the broadest level it is a novel about free-will vs. determinism - why do we do the things that we do?  On a societal level it is the story of racism in America and the interaction between blacks and whites in the 1930's.  On an individual level it is the story of Bigger, Bessie, Max, and the rest of the characters that Wright develops.<br />This novel has been criticized and praised alike.  In Bigger Wright has created a complex character.  He is not a mindless robot, as some critics of Wright claim, but a well drawn character who in some part of his being has dreams and aspirations, but is firmly defeated by the situations in which he finds himself.  Perhaps the most memorable part of the book comes in the opening, as Bigger watches an airplane flying overhead and realizes that flying is an option which has been closed to him.  <br />Bigger is a human being, and a glimpse through the headlines even today in the year 2000 (perhaps *particularly* today) reveals our fallibility as humans.  Children born in ghettos are not genetically predestined to end up criminals, but a disproportionate number of them do end up that way.   Wright tells us the story of one of these individuals.  <br />Those who have characterized the novel as a racist or one-dimensional portrait of Black Americans have missed the point.  Bigger is not a proxy for all Blacks living in America.  Bigger is one individual, and is presented as such.  The assumption that any literary work which includes a negative portrayal of a Black person is racist is, in itself, in a way racist.  African Americans, like all human beings, are individuals, and it is a simplistic assumption to project the portrayal of one individual upon the whole group.  We look around us and see that there are indeed individuals, who like Bigger, are not strong enough to bear the weight which society forces them to bear.  The question which Wright poses is to what extent is society responsible to the ills provoked by the evil of racism, and to what extent are we as men and women responsible for our own actions.  An excellent novel; should be required reading.",2000-12-01

I feel the reason Mr. Wright wrote this book(and his others as well, his work is so haunting) is to show America what seperatism caused African Americans. Personally, I don't feel that Bigger intentionally killed her, he really didn't know how to act with whites. He was conditioned to fear and respect them. But a side of him questioned this, and he didn't like it. It is sad when a group of people have to suffer indignities just because they are somehow different from the rest. First it was the Native Americans, then, the African Americans, then the Irish, Italians, the Jewish, and now, the gays. I don't see how one cannot see how history repeats itself here. Mr.Wright's books were all very haunting and pessimistic, and that is because he lived it, and he didn't like it.

In his review on May 17, 2000,  Rspellman asks why it takes 430 pages to tell a story of rape and murder.   He goes on to say that, \\""Honestly, that's the whole plot itself.\\""   Whether or not this is true, it is more important to understand, I think,  that a book's degree of quality should be based on more than just a plot.   A book has characters that develop and unfold; it has a setting that one  may never but through literature see; and, to make matters even better, the  characters and setting and even plot are based upon an author's choice of  language.  Often, as in the case of Wright's Native Son, the language  itself might be so beautiful that it breaks our hearts.    Rspellman states  that the emphasis is on the white man in Native Son.  The book presents an  altogether larger social matter that plagued Chicago in the 1930s and still  continues with remarkable similiarity today. Native Son is about the social  circumstances of that period--a crucial one, in fact, as it is when the  Great Black Migration had begun and Chicago was attempting to find a way to  respond to it--and therefore has placed emphasis not on the white or black  man, but on both, and how they respond to one another.    Finally, Rspellman  states that he understands things were not easy for blacks, \\""back  then,\\"" and that in order for America to correct itself from racist  attitudes it should simply stop thinking about how difficult it really was.   The truth is, the education of America's tangled past with racism is the  only sure way to prevent further racism.  When you understand others, you  have a much better chance of leaving behind marks on the world that will  help make it better.  Literature such as Native Son can be a force which  moves us in that direction.    Rspellman states that he is from another  country, and while I hesitate to point out the importance of this, I must  do so.  To truly understand the American experience, it often takes years  of exposure.  You find it through the schools of childhood, the colleges,  the neighborhoods, travels, arts, and so on.  In the experience itself, the  one issue that you can never escape from, no matter how much you might try,  is race.   Any American who has a true sense of its history knows this to  be, as sad as it is, the truth.

Native Son really made me think  about how hard it was for blacks back then and, to some extent, even now.  The book is very depressing to read because Bigger is such a sad character.  He has no options in life, so after his accidental murder, he's almost  happy because now something is happening to him. He's finally the center of  attention, and he matters in the world. The parts where he covers up the  murder, the reporters find the dead girl, and the police's chase of him  through the streets and apartments of Chicago are very exciting. However,  the rest of the book focuses mainly on Bigger's emotions, and gets a little  boring. The best part about the book is how the author, speaking through  Bigger's lawyer, explains how the oppression of blacks has made all blacks  hate and fear whites, forcing Bigger to murder. This attitude is much  different than the one expressed in To Kill A Mockingbird, by Harper Lee.  While that book has a hopeful outlook on race relations, Native Son has a  much more negative viewpoint. Wright feels that the oppression and  dehumanization of blacks has made it so that blacks and whites will never  treat each other as they would members of their own race. I recommend this  book to anyone looking for a long book that isn't easy to read but really  makes one think.",2000-05-16
US,49529638,R2GJR5N3RZU6OM,0060809779,146114302,Native Son,Books,5,0,3,N,N,"Native hypocrisy","The book I read was called Native Son. The author is Richard Wright. The year the book was published was 1940. This book is available in Valley High School's library. This book would be classified under the historical  African American fiction.  The story begins with a young man named  Bigger Thomas. He is a poor, black boy of 20 years who lives in the Chicago  projects in the year 1932. The story starts out when the young man is  caught in a downward spiral after he kills a young white woman in a brief  moment of panic. Bigger attempts to evade the authorities that are  persecuting him for his devious crime.  This novel serves as a model  for an aspiring novelist or the everyday writer. Wright's ability to  capture the realism described through the experiences that Bigger views  within his poverty stricken life is captivating and easily distinguishable  from the mundane description of a John Grisham &quot;thriller.&quot; This  passage portrays realism and feeling within Bigger Thomas's perceptions.   &quot;He stretched his arms above his head and yawned; his eyes moistened.  The sharp precision of steel and stone dissolved into blurred waves. He  blinked and the world grew hard again, mechanical, distinct. A weaving  motion in the sky made him turn his eyes upward; he say a slender streak of  billowing white blooming against the deep blue. A plane was writing high up  in the air.&quot;  This is only one of many paragraph long excerpts of  visual imagery and figurative language.  Native Son is so strong and  transfixing, that the reader can honestly see Bigger's world through their  eyes. Every situation that falls upon Bigger's story is thoroughly analyzed  from a psychological point of view. Wright accomplishes this feat through a  wonderful description of a certain conflict or situation then analyzes the  predicament within the complex analytical personality contained within  Bigger. This novel is so deep and psychological that a psychology class  could easily study it.  Wright's powerful novel is an unsparingly  reflection of the poverty and feelings of hopelessness experienced by  people in inner cities across the county and what it means to be black in  America. The powerful novel can bring a consciousness of sympathy and anger  to all readers of any ethnic background. The reader can honestly empathize  and feel the complexity and confusion between Bigger and the white society  that dominates and controls his actions and reactions to the events that  unfold. The novel is a true realization of the causes of hypocrisy and  ignorance breeding hopelessness and desperate measures such as murder in  Bigger Thomas's case.  Every sentence in this book is in relation to  Bigger Thomas. There are no side plots and no other main characters that  deviate from the central path of the plot and themes. I have never read a  book like this and I don't think I probably ever will. I have never felt  such a catharsis, purging of feelings and emotions while reading. The  description and syntax create a presentation of ideas and thoughts that the  reader cannot help in reacting mentally and emotionally. I would recommend  this book to anyone who is willing to not only think openly but also feel  openly in regards to the experiences of others in any social class or race.",2000-05-15

It is not quite on the level of Ralph Ellison's _Invisible Man_, which I consider to be the greatest literary work ever on the subject of the  African-American experience, due to some weak characterization of the minor  figures in the work (with the exception of Mary Dalton, Jan and Max, there  is not a white character in the book with a shred of decency, and most are  portrayed as the epitome of evil). With that minor quibble set aside,  though, I heartily recommend _Native Son_ to any reader of fiction  interested in the plight of the American Negro, or in a masterfully drawn  portrait of the criminal psyche and the latent and not-so-latent pressures  and circumstances that lead to its development.<br />The Modern Library's Top  100 list rated this book as the 20th-best English-language novel of the  century, which I think overrates the book, but only very slightly. It's  definitely somewhere in the top 100, and I would rank it behind only  _Invisible Man_ and perhaps Baldwin's _Go Tell It on the Mountain_ as the  greatest 20th-century work of fiction by an African-American.

Bigger Thomas had one of many reactions to his life within the oppression of his people.  He is a study in the complicated human condition.  Wright comes close to making him a hero or maybe a justified victim.  I wanted nobility.  Wright grants none in the South Side of Chicago.

The easy route for the author Richard Wright would've been to write a novel asking us to sympathize with a black man wrongfully accused of murder in a racist community. But he does not take the easy route. Instead he implores the reader to follow Bigger Thomas, a young black man who is absolutely guilty of committing a deplorable act (for reasons which he himself cannot fully explain), and forces us to look at the circumstances which might have possibly created this complex man.<br /><br />Although the book isn't perfect and every now and then (especially in the last 30 pages) delves into bloated preachiness, it still is very engaging and surprisingly suspenseful. It forces you to consider how society in the 1930's created a man, for whom fear and hate were the only emotions he's ever felt, and how those emotions can lead him to murder. It challenges you to understand that although the murder is essentially accidental, Bigger knows he has done something wrong but is initially unrepentant. Because after lashing out in a situation he doesn't understand, it is the first time he feels alive, with a purpose and with the control of his own life in his hands.<br /><br />A challenging and important book that pulls aside the curtain and looks dead on at the circumstances that create Bigger Thomas and at the social, class, and racial relations in our society.",2014-03-18

The closest comparison I could think of is Theodore Dreiser's \\""An American Tragedy,\\"" another tale of a young man from the wrong side of the tracks caught up in committing and then trying to hide a murder (though Tragedy's Clyde Griffiths' crime involves a lot more premeditation). The last part of Native Son is in my opinion the weakest, describing the murder trial whose verdict is a foregone conclusion but where author Richard Wright lets his most pedantic instincts dominate with a long, tiresome (and largely irrelevant) courtroom speech from the defense attorney, and some equally tiresome and offensive showboating from a caricature of a district attorney.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a powerful work, giving a vivid portrayal of what it was like to be black in the Chicago of the 1930s. The central character, Bigger Thomas, is fully realized and Wright's exposition of his thoughts, attitudes and actions show a complex and human character caught up in circumstances where readers can't help but identify with him. I also thought this was a step up for Wright from his previous published work, the short story collection Uncle Tom's Children, where pure rage seems to be the operative authorial emotion with its tales of brutal lynchings, vigilante justice, malevolent and impersonal whites and helpless blacks. In that work, whites are basically caricatures, while in Native Son the portraits start to become more rounded, especially in the persons of Mary, Jan and the Daltons. Max, Bigger's attorney, is probably the weakest white character, an idealized social justice lawyer who is basically a half-baked Atticus Finch with a gift for pomposity.<br /><br />Still, this is a landmark work in American literature, one of the first widely read novels by a black author that is also first rate in its artistry.

Every decision he makes seems to be the wrong decision.  Ironically,  he feels most  empowered as a human by a single, tragic action that sets the rest of his life on a  path to the inevitable end.<br /><br />Within this story, Mr. Wright weaves  connected characters together, describing how  weakness, prejudice, and survival are affected by education, opportunity, class, and economics.  People and events come together like a multi-car pileup that brings destruction  and  collateral damage to everyone involved.<br /><br />In the end, can the peace and hope that one man finds for himself ever extend to his family, community, and country?  Can we, individually and collectively, in the 21st century, understand  Mr. Wright's warning - every person carries prejudice within themselves.  Struggle by well-meaning people to overcome prejudice  may  bring change to governments, but it takes an understanding of the prejudice each of us carries in our own heart -and the knowledge that every person carries  prejudice within them -  to move past those prejudices and bring strength to our relationships with each other.<br /><br />In addition to the selected group reading, a single member of our bookclub selects a 'banned book' to read and summarize into a brief book report.

He had no future, and no present. His family of six was stuck in a rat-infested studio apartment. When Bigger gets a job driving for a white family, he inadvertently crosses the color line when his boss's daughter; a progressive, white college student and her communist boyfriend, extend a kindness and curiosity no white person had ever shown him. This leads to a tragic series of events that highlights [[ASIN:B002BY779U Native Son (Perennial Classics)]]'s motif of black powerlessness and shame.<br /><br />Wright himself admits in the essay \\""How Bigger was Born\\"" that plot is not central to the novel. The point is to express a unique feeling deep within the black psyche of 1940s America, that their lives were limited by factors outside their control. There was no American dream, no equality, no money, and no freedom for 12 million people who had the misfortune of being the wrong color at the wrong time.<br /><br />Bigger is not a classic protagonist. He's neither likable nor innocent. In fact, the 20 year old delinquent scarcely defends his crime. Bigger's freedom begins at the very moment he breaks one of the great taboos of his time--one that can only lead to his demise. Richard Wright's novel is rich with topics that would fill many semesters' worth of graduate-level literary analysis. Countless Ph.D. dissertations have been written about how Bigger's relationship with Bessie epitomizes the hopelessness of the impoverished relationship. Or the ways in which Henry Dalton perpetuates a community's despair.<br /><br />Every American ought to read Native Son. It belongs in the highest echelon of modern literature and is as readable today as it was when published in 1940. As a bonus, recent editions come with Wright's essay on the inspiration for the novel. Students assigned the text may not get much out of it, but serious writers would find it well worth their time. The author makes it clear that while there was never a historical Bigger Thomas, there was a generation of men who felt exactly the same.

He held his hand over her mouth and his head was cocked at an angle that enabled him to see Mary and Mrs. Dalton by merely shifting his eyes. Mary mumbled and tried to rise again. Frantically, he caught a corner of the pillow and brought it to her lips. He had to stop her from mumbling, or he would be caught. Mrs. Dalton was moving slowly toward him and he grew tight and full, as though about to explode. Mary's fingernails tore at his hands and he caught the pillow and covered her ntire face with it, firmly. Mary's body surged upward and he pushed downward upon the pillow with all of his weight, determined that she must not move or make any sound that would betray him. His eyes were filled with the white blur moving toward him in the shadows of the room. Again Mary's body heaved and he held the pillow in a grip that took all of his strength. For a long time he felt the sharp pain of her fingernails biting into his wrists. The white blur was still. - Richard Wright's Native Son (Part 2)<br /><br />A man killed his family, drove to a Walmart parking lot, and killed himself. Another man injected cyanide into his girlfriend as she was packing her clothes to leave him, then drank a cup of cyanide, both died. More and more people are cracking under the pressures that bare down on us these days. Unemployment is high and many lost jobs will not returned. Half of those who are unemployed are not even acknowledged. Programs that help to feed, clothe, and shelter those of us struggling are all being illuminated. Even those institutions that were stable for decades like hospitals and our children's schools are disappearing. How can we survive without losing our minds? We can actually use our minds. Create our own businesses by finding out what we are good at and doing it. I am promoting my academy every chance that I get. We will have to eat less, minimize our wardrobes, and find the best places to shelter ourselves. I know a homeless man that sleeps in the ATM section of a local bank, it's warm and it's safe. We are in a cycle of extreme social Darwinism so we have to elevate our consciousness in order not to fall into a state of savagery.<br /><br />In self defense he shut out the night and day from his mind, for if he had thought of the sun's rising and setting, of the moon or the stars, of clouds or rain, he would have died a thousand deaths before they took him to the chair. To accustom his mind to death as much as possible, he made all the world beyond his cell a vast grey land where neither night nor day was, people by strange men and women whom he could not understand, but with those lives he longed to mingle once before he went.<br /><br />He did not eat now; he simply forced food down his throat tasting it, to keep the gnawing pain of hunger away, to keep from feeling dizzy. And he did not sleep; at intervals he closed his eyes for a while, no matter what the hour, then opened them at some later time to resume his brooding. He wanted to be free of everything that stood between him and his end, him and the full and terrible realization that life was over without meaning, without anything being settled, without conflicting impulses being resolved.<br /><br />I often think about life through the eyes of black children. They attend a bad schools that are determined to keep them confused, but that also feeds them during the day. As the bad schools close our children become free to go hungry. Our children do not know their fathers. This lack of connection to a past takes a toll on the psyche of our children. We tell our children that if they overcome these deficits early in their lives, they will be able to become doctors or lawyers. However, black people do not control any medical or law schools. As a matter of fact black children cannot look any place and see a black person controlling anything. Everyone who looks like our children works for someone else from parts of the world other than Africa. The only chance our children have is for us to wake up out of our fog to build institutions, no matter how small. If we cannot develop and protect our children ourselves, then they will end up like the countless others serving the penal system for life.wake up out of our fog to build institutions, no matter how small.
