Moore stretches from fond parody to outright sedition, wrapping the once-simple genre in layers of meaning. This is a tale where he also constantly pushes its boundaries. Watchmen is unrepentant and unwavering in it delivery.<br /><br />There are no real heroes here - for most Superhero narratives, up until the publication of this title, these Superhero comics were all usually built around wholly compassionate, venerable characters. They represent what people wish they were, and they do the things normal people wish they could do. It doesn't deliver on every level, it isn't perfect, but it contains so much that succeeds, and comes so close to fulfilling its promises that it would be almost crass to mention any failings.<br /><br />Alan Moore is a great writer. He is not a great writer for comics; he is a great writer period, who happens to have made the graphic novel his medium. Watchmen is at times legendary, funny, scholarly, sad, exciting and intriguing. It is written for intelligent readers. The plot, at times, does sprawl - it is convoluted, and it spans generations with a large ensemble cast. What kept it together are the deeply personal narratives on various scales. This is a fun read. It is exciting. The artwork is truly sumptuous and coveys so much of the unwritten tale.<br /><br />Read it.

Yes, it's undeniable, WATCHMEN embodies the apex of artistic achievement in the graphic novel format (says so on the back cover). It's equivalent in other mediums might be Picasso's wartime painting Guernica or Bob Dylan's &#34;All Along the Watchtower&#34; in rock and roll. All three are revered in their respective worlds as works of considerable political and moral content. Guernica manifests, through Picasso's choice of muted colors, a tragic aspect of mankind underpinned by the unifying spectre of death. The latter, as every fan of Watchmen knows, played a crucial part in the creation of the novel. Consequently, Dylan's influence on the book and it's authors imbued in the narrative a consistent theme about the conviction to stand determined against uneven odds. Or as brusque main man Rorschach puts it, to &#34;Never compromise&#34;. The song lyrics illustrate archetypal characters that parallel Watchmen's lucid portrayal of uninhibited human behavior through its multifaceted and representative characters. The joker and thief of Dylan's landscape are approaching outsiders opposed to the established power structure of the castle off in the distance, characters in an impending conflict between a stagnant regime and liberal revolutionaries. In the same way, Watchmen's characters fight against the prevailing structure of disorder and amorality they see as the stagnant regime of their world. Throughout the graphic novel, author Alan Moore (with incredible visual aid by artist Dave Gibbons and colorist John Higgins) continuously develops on themes concerning the human condition and the uncertain nature of morality. I know, sounds like some pretty heavy stuff-but it's totally accessible and a satisfying experience for all ages. Watchmen is a book with widespread influences and, in turn, widespread influence in our own modern culture where many of its insights still hold significant weight - a fantastic novel for anyone searching for a deeply poignant (and fun!) read.",2015-06-15

US,7016642,R3VX4AKZGXXV44,1401245250,777411096,Watchmen,Books,5,0,1,N,Y,"WATCHMEN: the best thing I've ever read","I have to say, this is just the best comic I have ever read. The art was just to die for, the characters were well thought out, and a brilliant plot was implemented into the comic. I have read many comics where the story seems jump around to useless side stories for no typical reason other than to show that the writers want to make a long ass story, but this was different. Sure the story jumped around a lot in this but there was some point to it; it helped me understand when, why, and how the heroes became who they are.<br />For example, Jon a.k.a. Dr. Manhattan, was not always an immortal bipedal h-Bomb, he was once human. He had a life once before where he was human. He grew up a the son of a watch maker so he was always around time. Things changed and he became a scientist in Nuclear- Atomic- Atoms- whatchamacallit. He met his first love and he offered one day to fix her watch because someone stepped on it. He left it in his lab coat one day, and his lab coat was left inside a room where objects were de-atomized. He went to fetch the lab coat and an accident occurred, causing him to be trapped inside the room and he was De-Atomized. Thought to be dead, everyone tried to think as if it never happened. Then Jon appeared, living and well but had changed. He was glowing bright blue, his skin was like a blueberry threw up on him, and he now had abilities unlike anyone. He had become God, which he denied to every extent. But he was also fixated on how time flowed. He always knew what would happen before it would happen, and it made him quite a pain in the ass to be around since he seemed to never be impressed or seemed to care. However he at times does wish to be normal, but he blames three people for his transformation, but never could he choose the main person to blame. He blamed the man who stepped on the watch, he blamed his girlfriend who he offered to fix her watch, and he blamed himself for ever leaving his coat in the De-atomization chamber in the first place.<br /><br />Another example of a well thought out character (which is one of my favorite heroes of all time) is Walter Kovacs a.k.a. Rorschach (pronounced: Roar•Shack). Rorschach is more or less the character that actually knows when stuff is going on, and he knows how to get the information he wants. He doesn't need fancy gadgets (although he does have a Grapple Hook launcher), he doesn't need superpowers, he doesn't need the force, and he sure as hell doesn't need money. He used something called breaking limbs. It works to the very least, and that's how he found out about WW3 (which was about to happen but events at the end of the book caused the world to stop all war). He did find out about a plot to stop the war by interrogating a retired villain who was dragged into the whole mess. But how did Rorschach become like this? How did Walter Kovacs become the cold, paranoid vigilante that he is? Walter grew up in a broken home, raised by his whore of a mother that treated him like garbage and he was bullied by the other kids because his mother was a whore. At some point he grew tired of all of the worlds evils. He, when he became an adult, started working at some package-fashion store place, and a package with a dress that was specially made came in. The dress was an ink blot dress which meant that the dress design 'moves' via body heat reacting with ink in between special fabric. They were holding it for a celebrity who died before she could ever pick it up. The way she died caused Walter to break. The Celebrity had been raped and murdered, and bystanders watched as it happened. The cold injustice that happened to the lady created Walter Kovacs's alias. But, through a confusing explanation on how Rorschach truly began, he tells a doctor the birth of Rorschach and the death of Walter. According to Walter, Rorschach began the night he promised to find a kidnapped girl. He found the kidnapper, but no girl. The girl was dead, chopped to pieces and fed to dogs like kibble. He changed drastically, and instead of arresting the kidnapper, he killed him. As Walter said: &#34;whatever was left of Walter died that night with little girl.&#34; He now kills those who dare to cause injustice. He even hates the politicians (for going on with war as the only answer) and prostitutes (because of his childhood).<br /><br />But to truly understand the story, YOU. MUST. READ. IT. You'll be sorry if you don't. I will cherish my copy and pass it down for future generations to experience an era of comics from before my time. Thanks for reading!<br /><br />Famous Quote from Rorschach:<br />&#34;Dead dog found in alley way, tire tread on burst stomach. This city is afraid of me, I have seen its true face. The streets are extended gutters, and the gutters are filled with blood until the drains finally scab over and all of the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of their sex and murder will rise up around their waists, and they will look up and scream: Save us! And I will look down and reply: No.&#34;",2015-06-08

It’s a book that allows adults to go back to being fifteen years old and allows visualizations to produce the story in full; all while presenting a very serious and truthful story. One of the greatest thing this book masters is the use of symbolism and repetition. If you have even looked at the book and opened it to page one you would see that the smiley face with a blood mark is something that is used constantly. It’s found almost in ever chapter, but not always in literal form. For example it was a pattern in the dust grounds of mars that could only be fully seen from a birds eye view at the end of the book, or how it’s seen in several of flashbacks still on the chest of the comedian, including in a flashback of the scene moments before the Comedian fell to his surprise death. The cover of it is even a close-up. For those of you have never read it: the comedian dies (you’ll learn who that is in the first 5 pages, so don’t worry it’s not a big spoiler). The smiley face pin is the item that he leaves behind somewhat involuntarily. The blood stain on the smiley face completely sums up the Comedian in totality. Everything is a painful joke that will inevitably destroy you.  The pin isn't the only object that is intriguingly used for the purpose of symbolism, but I’ll let you figure the rest out.",2015-04-02

The brief dialogues between characters as well as excerpts from “Tales of the Black Freighter” have moments of literary depth, but the true storyline is revealed through the illustrations and the reader’s ability to interpret these illustrations. The use of vibrant and subtle colors aided in establishing both the setting and mood of each individual scene. For example, the depiction of Dr. Manhattan’s time spent on Mars displays the pale pink terrain of the terrestrial planet against the endless night sky speckled with distant stars. This imagery allows the reader to understand the omniscient vigilante’s physical isolation from Earth as well as his emotional disconnect to its inhabitants. Linear text on a page is incapable of conveying this same feeling.  Additionally, a major component contributing to the literary adventure that is the Watchmen graphic novel is Alan Moore’s and Dave Gibbons’ use of closure. Closure is a technique used to manifest a viewer’s creativity with illustrated clues in order to lead the reader to an inference regarding events that have occurred in the novel but have not been visually presented.  When done tastefully this method allows the reader to play the role of investigator, further engaging the individual with what’s happening on each page.<br /> The only challenge I faced while reading Watchmen was a fault of my own.

The author, Alan Moore, discovers a deeper meaning within the classic tale of superheroes, good VS evil. Every character is facing their own battle within, hiding from their past or the dark side of human nature. Evidently, that is the overall theme of Watchmen, not superheroes fighting bad guys or villains, but citizens and vigilantes fighting the darkness of human nature. I believe that the theme of Watchmen is so compelling because people can relate with it. Everyone has made mistakes and everyone has done something in their past that they would like to forget. Moore portrays  this theme throughout various aspects such as images, quotes, and characters.<br /><br /> Every Single character mentioned or is a main part of the story is facing a battle, whether it be their inner darkness, darkness of their past, or the darkness that is in society. Some characters are in hiding, scared to face this darkness within while other accept the true dark side of human nature. Moore does an excellent job in portraying both of those sides through the main characters. Including people like Rorschach, Adrian Veidt, The Comedian, and Dr. Manhattan who accept the depth of darkness, and others such as Dan and Laurie who have been hiding and denying their past.<br /><br />Throughout Watchmen there are myriad frames and images that represent the endless depths of human nature. There is one frame that stands out and represents human nature as a whole, it is an image of a street in the city, there are subtle representations from different groups of people within it. For example, there is a line of people including prostitutes, abusive relationships, homosexuals, poverty, and other aspects of human nature. These frames help make the theme of the book more evident, while highlighting the importance of every frame.<br /><br />Watchmen isn’t a classic superhero book, it has a dark side. There are no fake bad guys or villains. All the characters in Watchmen are in a battle versus themselves and the darkness of human nature. This theme is what makes watchmen so unique and compelling.",2015-03-27

When people hear the words “graphic novel” they think of comic books and easy reads, but this defies all.  Watchmen is an amazing, l well written piece of literature that has immensely deep meaning that really can't be portrayed in normal books.<br />The book is fascinating because it manages to incorporate a story inside of a story (Tales of the Black Freighter)  and also follows along with the main plot of the book.  It really makes the reader pay attention to what is going on and pulls them in.<br />One thing that I didn't like about Watchmen was how it was hard to follow at some points and it got a little confusing.  They would jump from Tales of the Black Freighter back to the Watchmen then to the past memories of people.  It gets really confusing if you don't pay close attention.  On top of following along with the text of the story, you also have to pay close attention to the pictures in the background for certain clues or clarity for what is going on.<br />Overall this was a magnificent and brilliant book and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good read; but I will have to warn that this book possesses a challenge.",2015-03-27

I've always found an interest in superhero movies and action stories, but I never thought to pick up a comic book, I figured movies of superheroes would do the job. Watchmen changed my perspective on comic books. The chapters bring you on a ride through a dark psychological timeline and wrongs in humanity. It exposes you to superheroes through flashbacks of their lives while fighting crime and how they became part of the Minutemen.<br /> Watchmen showed the evils of humanity in events that have taken place, but also events that are timeless. The history of the United States becomes tied into the events happening in the book, making the story seem less of a comic book. For example, they involve the Manhattan Project and nuclear war with the role of Dr. Manhattan. You are able to relate to the book without even experiencing the events that took place, but there are endless elements that are timeless. These timeless elements consist of the government role in society and the protective role the government has. With the events that have taken place recently in the news about police force having a role in the government and rights that some don’t agree with, we are able to relate this event to the book.  Individual responsibilities for each person are a key in society and it shows this through the super heroes role.<br />The more you look into society and see the flaws and how it is run, the more relatable the book becomes. Adrian Veidt hid behind screens to destroy the world, our government is also hiding behind screens to destroy our personal information and to run society without anyone seeing it be done. I recommend this book to people that may not ever think to read a comic book. It’s more than just super heroes dressed up in costumes trying to save the world.",2015-03-27

This book is has intense meaning behind most of the scenarios. Each character, mostly a superhero has a background to why he or she is a superhero. One of the theme of this book was that all superheroes were trying to save the world and ended creating more chaos and destruction. We have analyzed each character and each chapter. Rorschach’s mask was connected to inkblot tests. Dr. Manhattan a very unique character, the only one who really has superpowers. He was a human being but a machine changed him to a blue man who could teleport himself, get bigger, could live without oxygen, and make multiple forms of himself.. He was used as a powerful weapon in the war. The only connection he has with human being is his girlfriend Laurie who really doesn't want to be with him. Laurie wanted to be with Dan so there was a love triangle between them. Laurie had to be with Jon because she was there to control him.<br />Rorschach had a very rough background which made him have a very black and white personality and made him want to be a superhero. He was kind of an insane character because of his background. He killed many people because of his insanity. But when Adrian Veidt killed many people he couldn't register it. He also had many sessions with a psychologist. The psychologist had a hard time figuring out why Rorschach was the way he was.",2015-03-27

This book does an excellent job highlighting important aspects we don’t always consider and personally, it left me thinking more and more about society. It explores the idea of how superhuman abilities can be found in any ordinary individual, how government controls many aspects of life that we don’t even realize, and the idea that our country thrives off war to unite us when it actually just diverges us further apart.<br /> The group of “superheroes” in the book, known as the minutemen, are anything but superheros. None of them other than Dr. Manhattan have special abilities or powers and the only reason why he does is due to the science experiment gone wrong. Instead they are all ordinary individuals who dress up in costumes and give themselves hidden identities to “fight crime” in the streets of New York, when fighting isn't the way to end war. Their idea of uniting the world  and creating a Utopian society will never be reached considering the fact that they separate themselves from everyone else, which is very contradicting. In addition the government chose to involve themselves and pass the Keene Act, retiring superheroes except specific ones OF THEIR CHOICE. They abuse the condition of Dr. Manhattan and exploit him to the world using him as a weapon for their own good and to threaten other countries. The worst part is at the end of the book, it’s revealed that war is the only thing that will cause us fear and unite us to work together to make the world a better place, which is a sickening thought.

Each chapter I read, I was at the edge of my seat trying to predict what was going to happen next.  This is the best comic book I have ever read.  The pictures, the frames, the illustrations all enhanced the story of Watchmen.  Many people may think that since it is a comic book, it is not considered an intellectual piece of literature. They would be completely wrong.  It has action and mystery mixed in with a little bit of sexual content.  Watchmen appeals to almost any reader who is looking for an awesome read.<br /><br />This book should only be read by adults or mature individuals.  Not only for the nudity, but Watchmen was not created for a younger crowd on an intellectual standpoint.  I found at times I had to reread lines and go back to other chapters to fully understand what was going on.  Even for me, an 18 year old, I had a difficult time understanding some of the events that were taking place.  It was not that it was hard to follow the story, it was more of understanding and interpreting certain situations in the book.  For example, having The Tails of The Black Freighter tie into Watchmen sometimes made the story hard to follow.<br /><br />I also think the topics of this book were extremely dark.  Rorschach’s story of how he was brought up was very disturbing.  I think that Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons did a great job explaining and illustrating to the audience how Rorschach’s mind worked.  On page 17 in chapter 6, Rorschach was given blot tests to examine.  They showed in one frame the test and in the next, a picture of what it reminded Rorschach of, which was a dead dog he had killed.  This allowed me to understand what Rorschach was thinking about and why he was the character he was.  I also find this interesting that the mask that he wears resembles a blot test.  Every so often the blob on his face changes depending on how he is feeling.  I think that this blob and the blot tests are connected ina sense.  When a blot test is given, it usually triggers memory or a reaction from the person being examined.  I think that depending on what Rorschach was feeling or thinking about, the blobs on his face changed to show his emotions and attitude in the story.<br /><br />This book definitely makes you think.  There were so many overlapping ideas and events always occurring within one frame.  I definitely recommend this book to a person who likes action and mystery.  It is a read that will suck you in and make you really deeply think about how the world works, or at least how we think it works.",2015-03-26

While the story at the surface may seem like a not-so-interesting look into the minds of superheroes, it’s actual plot is layered with meaning concerning the impending doom of nuclear war, the crime that hovers over New York City like a shadow, and the superheroes themselves struggling to remain human. These people don’t have superpowers (the exception being Dr. Manhattan), but they only feel part of the human race when they are protecting it. The barrier between doing good and trying to do good and failing is a very thin line, a thin line that these heroes tend to tightrope daily. It is this struggle to do good for humanity and to defend innocent lives while also trying not to injure or kill a bystander that makes a connection with the Watchmen as they try to hinder being a regular person by day and a crime-stopper at night.<br />It is their look on life which is quite interesting. One of the main superheroes, Rorschach, thinks the world is a barren place full of evil people who only care for themselves. He believes he’s the only person who can save this world while everyone else only looks on. He credits this way of thinking to the death of Kitty Genovese, where she was brutally murdered in the street while neighbors looked on and did nothing. No one called the police, no one tried to help her. They stayed in their homes trying to block out the screams of the dying girl. He uses this, an event that actually occurred outside of the Watchmen universe and in real life, to explain how people no longer act human, how they no longer care for the people around them, but only for themselves.<br />The human aspect of this book and the way people demonstrate their humanity is what makes this book a masterpiece, diving deeper to show the readers a true image of the world and what is becoming of it.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a sophisticated, dark, and relevant book. It’s not shy in it’s approach of showing the reader the problems in the world, but because of this, we as readers take it seriously, making it a much more enjoyable read.",2015-03-26

You have to experience what is happening in all parts of the story, and fill in the missing pieces yourself. Despite it being a “comic book”, Watchmen is not an easy read. The complexity in each picture requires much more mindful thinking than in a paragraph of text. The hidden symbols and details are not only what make this book a tricky read, but also what make it interesting and worth your time. The characters range all over the personality spectrum, and relate to every aspect of humanity good and bad.<br /><br />Rorschach; a complex, delinquent, mentally-ill masked hero is who makes this story happen. He represents the darkest side of humanity that at the beginning of the book, many can't begin to relate to. But just like the splotches on his mask change throughout, so does Rorschach. Following him and his story, you can see that he is just another person with troubles and doubts just like any other. A life with an abusive prostitute mother and absent father and the real tolls that took on Rorschach make him over the course of the story become relatable and understandable. He teaches the readers about the struggles that some people go through, and the mental illnesses that can form from such a life. One of my favorite quotes from him that really tells you a lot about who he is and what goes on in his head is: &#34;Looked at sky through smoke heavy with human fat and God was not there. The cold, suffocating dark goes on forever, and we are alone.&#34;<br />Watchmen brings together fictional characters, real life events, and the “Tales of the Black Freighter” (a side comic story that highlights the ideas about humanity that also exist in the main themes of Watchmen), to create something unique and intellectual. By using the time period of the Cold War, it allows you to experience what life was like then and question what life would be like if these masked heroes really did exist.

His real name is is Jon Osterman. Early on in the story there was an accident that happened involving Osterman. He was doing a physics experiment and something went wrong. When Osterman came back in from the experiment he had god like powers and was blue. Gibbons throughout the story used Manhattan as a god like creature, very tall and blue in color. While Moore used details about things that Manhattan could do and things he did throughout the story.<br />Manhattan was one of the big role characters in the novel by representing the United States of America in the “arms race.” At the time of the story the USA and Soviet Russia were in the cold war. Manhattan was used to represent a weapon in it. Along with his huge figure and blue shape, he had many other abilities that a human does not. He could teleport people to wherever he wanted, he had super strength, and he could see into the future, so he knew what things would happen to him but he did not show that in the book. There was a specific time in the book that the US sent Manhattan to Korea to fight in the war. In that chapter he is seen as a huge figure that is going to help bring the country to victory. There is one specific frame that takes up a major part of the page that shows him going through the battlefield with soldiers around him and helicopters shooting at him but it does not phase him a bit. Overall Moore and Gibbons used the theme of Manhattan as a major character throughout the whole text. He showed many things that resembled the US being a superior nation. Along with him going to war there was many scenes of him going to mars by telaporting. This resembled more of the arms race by the US and the Soviets seeing who could get to the moon quicker but instead Moore and Gibbons used mars. Overall I enjoyed the book and thought that for a “comic” bookit was the best one I have ever read I would suggest anyone to read it.",2015-03-26
US,48983706,RM4Q0QXO9GCX5,1401245250,777411096,Watchmen,Books,5,0,1,N,N,"Who represents America?","“Watchmen”, the graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons, is a multi layered story with complex characters, interactions, plots and meanings. An intriguing story of love, hate, war, peace, and the means and methods or order. Characters are used to symbolize certain elements of late 20th century world issues. Jon Osterman, for example, also known as Dr. Manhattan represents the the threat of nuclear weapons in the world.<br />Another, Rorschach, I believe to be another one of those characters who represents a bigger idea. Rethinking the books many layers and characters, I came to the realization that Rorschach is the epitome of the United States. While Dr. Manhattan and The Comedian worked for the government, so they were literally the United States, Rorschach is a better representation of the country during the 20th century. Rorschach was mysterious and never showed his real face. He was suspicious of everyone, and believed that he was the only sane one left. This is a great example of his representation of the US. The US during this time period was caught up in the Cold War, believing that our nation was the only nation we one could trust. Moreover, the era of McCarthyism was high and people were being accused of being communist every day. Rorschach says to Ozymandias early in the novel, “I came to warn you about the mask-killer. So you don't end up the smartest man in the morgue”. This shows his constant suspicion of conspiracy. he had no reason to think that Ozymandias was in any danger at that time.<br />I’ve also noticed that throughout the book, he never physically kills anyone. He never strangles anybody, never fatally shoots anyone. This is a representation of the proxy wars the US and Soviet Union fought during the Cold War. The US fought in places such as Korea and Vietnam, while the Soviet Union fought in Afghanistan. Both sides had supported groups in each conflict, but they were never fighting each other directly. Rorschach makes other people kill his enemies, such as in the jail cell, and he only kills when he is backed into a corner, literally and metaphorically.  Even so, he never touches the man that he kills. He doesn't carry a gun, so he can't use that directly on people.<br />Of course, this can be interpreted in many ways, you could argue that Dr. Manhattan, The Comedian and others represent the United States as a whole much better than Rorschach. Maybe in the end, the entire group of super heroes work together to represent the United States in the 20th century. This is what makes this novel amazing. It has many layers, and is open to interpretation.",2015-03-26

Each scene is carefully laid out to make everything flow. I was impressed by how a lot of scenes relate to each other. Most of the time, two events will be happening at the same time, like when there was the comedian's funeral and Laurie was visiting her moms house. Thereâ€™s a picture at the funeral and theres a text box saying â€œItâ€™s History.â€ These words can go with the scene before, where Laurieâ€™s mom is talking about her past. Or it could go with the funeral scene, meaning that the comedians life is history. The scenes flip back and forth but the words and actions relate. It does that throughout the book making the book well crafted.<br />Each chapter has its own key symbol and itâ€™s shown in the beginning of each chapter. It lets you know what to focus on in the chapter because itâ€™s a key element. When you combine all of these small things, you get the overall theme. Thereâ€™s always a centralized idea that the author tries to get to without revealing too much. The book has a lot of value and makes you think at a higher level.

It was really confusing at times, with multiple stories going on including the comic book within the novel, The Tales of the Black Freighter. I also think that the extra text at the end of each chapter was unnecessary because they never really add anything to the story or the chapter that you had just read, they were mostly just more information that you had to absorb. The only thing I thought was impressive was the graphics and the symbolism that carried throughout the entire book within the graphics. It allowed the deeper meaning of the story to carry throughout the story and it was easier to pick up on because it was visual. Watchmen had quite a few themes and throughout the novel there were many different symbols for those different themes, such as the clock at the end of every chapter that represented Doom’s Day and the end of the world. There was also the punk rockers that represented the system and how messed up it was. Those are only two examples, but symbols like those were in every chapter all the way up to the last page, when you are left with possibly the biggest symbol out of all of them. Although the book did not appeal to me, I can see why it would appeal to others with the history, action, and plot.

However, Watchmen changes that thinking and takes the graphic novel genre to a whole new level. The themes of Watchmen are actual real world issues, disguised as a typical masked adventurer story. It sheds light on rape, mental illness, politics and government control without throwing it in your face. This isn't a child’s graphic novel, you have to think and notice smaller hints to see the meanings and the lessons, and Alan Moore helps you do that. The manipulation of Dr. Manhattan shows the reliance on weapons at that time, as he symbolizes the atomic bomb. They tell him what to do and say and support Laurie to keep him happy so that they can use him regardless of how it affects anyone else.  Also, there is controversy over the power of the heroes as shown by the constant “Who watches the Watchmen” graffiti and the violence against its writers from the watchmen. This symbolizes government power and how it can get corrupt and opposition can be covered up. Ozymandias’s all knowing screens and faked innocence sheds light on the issue of citizen privacy and the fact they society may not have any idea about the extent of the government’s actions and not always told the truth. The intertwined story from “The Tails of the Black Freighter” helps with the understanding of Watchmen, which is an example of the message present in “Tails of the Black Freighter” that the masked heroes are doomed to become the monsters they’d been fighting against. I think that Moore portrayed the real life issues in a superhero setting perfectly.",2015-03-26

The Watchmen is an intertwining, revealing, and unraveling masterpiece that I would reccomend to anyone who enjoys seeing the real dystopia our society encounters day to day. The retrospect and scale of The Watchmen is larger than one read can provide you with. You can constantly look back into this literature and find new discoveries; new connections within the piece, yourself, and our world today. With all the many concepts you can absorb through this outstanding comic book, Dr. Manhattan is a blue man who represents so much more than a nude weapon.<br /> Dr. Manhattan is a character who holds a great deal of meaning within the text and within our society. He is a man who accidentally became a weapon by a machine. In 1985 President Nixon is still in office. With the discovery of Dr. Manhattan who is in short, indestructible, he becomes the United States main defense as well as attack. He can morph and predict what will happen next; he knows everything. He represents, with the arrival of his somewhat disturbing self, that our world is turning into a malicious nuclear crazed society. Now that we have broken the barrier with force and mass destruction what is there to stop us from pursuing more from weapons and pursuing more from fear? We are becoming reliant on our forces with weapons and military.This not only impacts the United States, but every nation that surrounds it; that comes in contact with it.<br /> The theme of masks is very prevalent throughout the piece as well. Staying along the concept of Dr. Manhattan, the U.S. and President Nixon hide behind screens and behind this giant blue man who has the world at his fingertips. This correlates into our history of teetering on the brink of destruction. This dependence on force is shown very clearly when Dr. Manhattan takes a trip to mars, unsure if he shall return again to Earth. President Nixonis lost, the nation is lost, frantically hoping that their one weapon will return again; return their power again.<br /> I have only provided you with one blue concept that I perceived from the text.

The book is set in the cold war era in an alternate reality where superheroes exist. One of the major themes of the book is fear. The authors comment on the fear that they are living with, during the cold war, in the novel by using the plot, characters, and The Tails of the Black Freighter a graphic novel within the graphic novel.<br />The plot shows how fear is a major motivator by having the characters worry about a masked killer that could be after them. The fear that the characters feel draws them out of hiding and back into costumed adventuring. We also see fear motivate the United States and the Soviet Union into working together at the end of the book. But the biggest and most clever reference to fear in the entire book is the parallel story The Tales of the Black Freighter.<br />The Tales of the Black Freighter follows a character that has been attacked by pirates and shipwrecked. Throughout the entire book we see the character wrestle with the idea that the pirates of the Black Freighter are heading to his hometown, to go after his family. Fear is his constant motivator, “Everything I loved, everything I lived for depended upon my reaching Davidstown in advance of that terrible freighter. Clinging to the memory of my wife's eyes, I dragged men up from underground, sand trickling from their sockets.”(Chapter V 9). He digs up the bodies of his friends, just to make a raft to sail to Davidstown. Fear causes him to commit horrible, unspeakable acts.

That is what you will be saying to your self at the end of each of these 12 chapters. Written by the amazing Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons, this comic book changed the way modern comic book stories are told. It is a mystery novel, a deconstruction of super heroes, and an epic, high-art story on the same level as Greek tragedies, Shakespearean plays, and noir crime stories. Don't believe me? You should, because I am high on 4 cups of coffee and should be going to sleep right now so that I can wake up at 5 and go to work, but I am avoiding that sense of responsibility to tell you about this book! Buy it now.<br /><br />&#34;But I don't read comic books&#34;, you say. I don't give a crap, BUY IT. Do you like time travel? Do you like gritty, psychological thrillers? Do you like science fiction? Do you like anything that challenges your worldviews and the way you think about things? Do you like great stories with character development, and layered plots and subplots? Do you like sex, adult stories, blue penises, murder and complex things? Do you like rhetorical questions? Huh? I'M TALKING TO YOU! DO YOU LIKE REVIEWS IN ALL CAPS?<br /><br />Me neither. I'm sorry.<br /><br />The point is, this book is incredible, and rather than say what has already been said OVER and OVER about this story's influence and impact on comic book storytelling and the comic book industry and my sex life (sniff, sniff), I suggest you just buy it. You should also look into Alan Moore's other works, as he writes amazing stories. You can also buy the movie, which is long but has it's cool moments (I suggest the Director's Cut on blu-ray). You can also, stop reading.<br /><br />I said stop.<br /><br />Seriously, I have nothing more to say already.<br /><br />Bye.",2015-03-11

There are just so many undercurrents going on.  There's so much I kept missing...until I didn't.<br /><br />I first read this as a compilation.  I finished it and thought to myself, &#34;Comics have got to change.  This will help change them.&#34;<br /><br />It did.  It got out of hand in a lot of ways, but sometimes that's how things go.  People focus on the package and not the contents.  Many in comics apparently read it and just thought, &#34;Dark characters are cool.  All superheroes should be dark.&#34;<br /><br />They missed the point.  All superheroes are ALREADY dark.  Put on a costume, risking life and limb, and go out and beat the crap out of muggers or demented geniuses or megalomaniacs?  Who does that?  People with some screws loose, some self-hatred, maybe guilt, and few other outlets for their violent tendencies.  When you get down to it, how many mainstream heroes have guilt as one of their primary motivations?  Batman and Spider-Man, obviously, but even someone like Green Lantern.  He's given this cosmic ring with a responsibility for a whole sector of space, from a dying &#34;policeman&#34; no less, and the guilt trip that he alone was chosen out of everyone.  That's a lot of responsibility.  Maybe he would have rather just worked at Fed Ex.  At least until the Guardians inform him that 8 billions sentient life forms just died while he was unloading boxes because he wasn't there to stop (fill-in-the-blank).  Superheroes only seem cool because you don't really know them, but the idea of comics is to get us to know them.  So, focusing on the &#34;cool&#34; as the outcome seems to sort of miss the point.  I find it so much more interesting to be introduced to a character's flaws and then still love them (and perhaps still find them cool), flaws and all.  Rorschach anyone?<br /><br />WhenI had this in college, I just remember handing it out to everyone who would take it and give it a read, comic fan or not.  I think most of the questions came from The Black Freighter and its point in the storyline (as well as pirate comics in general).

It depicts a alternate reality that is similar to ours, but with vigilantes and one true superhero. The story can be dark at times and so can the pictures, but the story and illustrations are rock solid. The illustrations only further your ability to take in what is happening in this world of life, death, and dark comedy. The cover is very eye pleasing and would be a perfect piece to display. Also the writing style of a graphic novel is just that a novel with illustrations; it is a comic, but in book style with a tone that can be adult and teen-ish.

Most books I put down half way through because they simply don’t interest me. That being said I do believe that the book could have been a bit better. The book was a very fun book to read, it truly is a beautiful book and has a tendency to layer things in such a way that one who reads through it quickly is more likely to miss aspects of it that can relate to other sections of the book and the world around us.<br /><br />The artwork adds to the book as a whole but when you’re reading the book the pictures have a tendency to get lost in the mind and don't get the appreciation they deserve. I’ll admit some pages were so dense with text that I didn’t take the time to take in the images in their entirety. The book really twists the perceptions and ideas that we tend to associate with superheroes, it shows them no longer as those that can do no “evil”, but rather people like ourselves that have their own fights to deal with and actually are not as far above us as we might of originally thought. The book rarely will come out and say something directly to the reader, rather it will hint at things and lead you to them through characters actions and others impressions of them. The characters are thoughtfully developed and the added texts at the end of each chapter put an interesting twist to who they are and what their internal motivation is. Most of the “heroes” are not out there to save the world; they have their own demons and fights that they fight through their vigilantism.<br /><br />For those who are looking for a book to read, don’t be disheartened by the confusion and vague ideas that come up in the first few chapters, the book ends up sorting most of it out rather nicely by the end.",2014-04-03

The story scores some points, but ultimately fails because the author, not being American, proves to be far less knowledgeable about American politics and culture than he thinks he is.<br /><br />On the plus side, there is only one superhero who has real superpowers-Dr. Manhattan, who gained his abilities to manipulate things on an atomic level and to see into the future and past with crystal clarity in a laboratory accident, and whose abilities make him become less human in his view of the world as time goes on-and the US government is well aware of this fact.  The others are variations on Batman, who are smart and physically able but are not superhuman.  As the decades go on, there are rivalries, scandals, retirements, and attrition among the various superheroes, and they vary greatly among political views and other personality aspects.  The best scene of all is when the policemen of New York City go on strike, and the various superheroes prove incapable of replacing an official police force.<br /><br />On the minus side, there are punks wearing Asian-style costumes running around, but their presence isn't explained.  What, no hippies, bikers, greasers, etc.?  And politically, the Vietnam War is won by the USA, and Nixon manages to stay in the Presidency for five terms.  Uh, it was Lyndon Johnson who was responsible for the Vietnam War being a full-scale operation, and even if it were won, it would have been no guarantee of lifetime popularity for him.  Indira Gandhi became very popular after winning the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, yet she wound up out of office not too long afterwards.  After all, there are issues such as the economy, etc. which affect the President's popularity as well.  And if we assume that Dr. Manhattan and the other superheroes were responsible for winning the Vietnam War, why not go all the way and win the Cold War as well?  Dr. Manhattan could have turned the Soviet arsenal of nukes and other weapons into dust and destroyed its power.  Evidently Moore didn't think of that.  Instead, the superheroes' presence was supposed to make the possibility of a nuclear war more likely, for unexplained reasons.  And when you think about it, why didn't the Soviet Union come up with its own superheroes?<br /><br />Well, \\""Watchmen\\"" is supposed to be a classic, but I found it to be a period piece that became highly dated only a few years after its publication.",2014-03-08

His beard had long past gained sentience, perhaps before the writing of Watchmen, or perhaps afterward.

There was the good guys with their superpowers and then the villains who had few if any redeeming qualities. It was easy to root for the heroes and be amazed by how their superpowers obliterated pretty much anything that stood in the way of justice. Watchmen take a much more \\""realistic\\"" approach, and we are presented with a set of heroes that have flaws like everyone else, and whose motivations may not always be the common good. The setting for the novel is mostly 1985, a time when these heroes have been outlawed and are in retirement, there is a tense situation in terms of the struggle for world domination by the usual suspects, and the United States have an ace in their sleeve, Dr. Manhattan, which is pretty much the only one of these superheroes that has superhuman powers.<br /><br />When someone kills a former watchman known as The Comedian, a chain of events leads to one of the most interesting stories ever presented in a graphic novel. There are many characters to keep track of, and it takes a while for the different pieces of the plot to start connecting with each other, so it does take a bit of effort by the reader to keep at it. If you do though, you will be rewarded at the end.<br /><br />There are many things I liked about this book. First, you have the fascinating story as already mentioned, but this is also complemented perfectly with proficient art, some of which is truly breathtaking. There are many little gems hidden inside the story, this is done by references to the world these people live in and the reader can't help but compare it to what actually was going on in the US in 1985. I am sure I probably missed many of these gems, but there were enough I did catch to make me feel happy. The authors use a comic within the comic, which at first seems a little confusing, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes another positive element in the experience. In between each of the twelve volumes we get a few pages of information on different topics. Some come from newspapers, some from personal correspondence, others from psychiatric notes.

What is amazing is that about 2/3 of the way in, six or so story lines unfold in a manner that neither a novel nor a screen can yet reproduce well. That is, the tales, the captions, the images all hover and as they flit across the page into your mind's eye, you \\""see\\"" resonances in your imagination from the layered stories, in a most engaging and intricately fashioned way of verbal and visual narrative. The sophistication itself deserves acclaim, let alone the fresh way that the middle-aged and elderly crises of superheroes make for a new take on a by-now familiar genre.<br /><br />A second attempt rewarded. I had tried it years ago but found the pace slow as I was scanning each frame for context or clues. The density, as in an engrossing film or novel, rewards rereading or giving it yet another try.<br /><br />While near the end some genre limits of the force of compression needed as the tales came together, and certain surprises seemed to be tucked deeply away in what had been previously shown, this sort of tension, explication, and sudden revelation is standard for the well-told adventure. The complexity of this, and the coordination of the caption and image with the multiplying narratives build this up into a memorable experience. As if you get to read a novel and see a movie simultaneously, and best of all you still with the words spinning out keep your own vision of the story somehow intact. Pay attention to the newsstand, as by then, the levels of story piling up make this rewarding for the patient reader.<br /><br />I came to this in a different direction from perhaps most readers. I rarely read graphic novels but as I liked \\""V for Vendetta\\"" on my then-teen son's recommendation, and even the film--which benefited by prior exposure to the printed story, I sought out Alan Moore's debut novel.

Well first of all, I have a confession: I saw the movie first. And I thought it was alright! Especially the Ultimate edition. And then I read the book. But, I read a digital version on my friend's computer and skipped over most of the tie-in content. And I still liked the movie better.<br /><br />But then I bought this, and it was a thrill to read. The first time, I went through it speedily, soaking up all the content I'd missed my first read-around. I'd definitely recommend getting a print version to a digital version, because there's so much going on with the page layout that you don't get reading digitally. Seems like a weird thing to say about a book with probably the most rigid panel structure I've read, but it's true. Even on a 3x3 grid, Gibbons and Moore managed to change it up just enough to reflect the mood of the current story arc. But it was subtle enough to make me feel like a comic analyzing genius.<br /><br />I read it again recently, this time after procuring a magnifying glass. I probably went overboard: scanning every panel for texts that foreshadowed what was to come (my favorite: \\""The Veidt Method: I can give you bodies beyond your wildest imaginings), flipping back and fourth through the symmetrical chapter, and making note of every recurring symbol and motif and hoping that I'd get assigned this book to read in a class one day and have to write an essay on it.<br /><br />Beyond that, it came in a nice condition and the binding is high-quality.

April 23rd, 2013: Watchmen outdoes itself!!!!!","Ever since I read Alan Moore's sensational work on BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE, it has been my goal to find another work of his that had the same psychologically innovating tone to it. It wasn't easy though. Alan Moore is one of the most acclaimed writers in the comic's medium, and is known for dark and grim, yet innovating works such as V FOR VENDETTA, FROM HELL, PROMETHEA, SWAMP THING, and LOST GIRLS. I have my limits when it comes to dark content in media, which made it a challenge to find another compelling work of Moore's. I first made an attempt with Swamp Thing, which seemed promise a tragic monster tale, but its occult themes pushed my limits. But I was still determined to dig up another great Alan Moore book, and I uncovered it with his most popular book of all: WATCHMEN!!!<br /><br />Watchmen was designed to break the boundaries of what a superhero comic could achieve, but it went far beyond that. It became a psychological breakthrough, and transformed the minds of comic book fans worldwide. Watchmen takes place in an alternate America during 1985, where despair and corruption has plagued society. The U.S. is now on the verge of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, and superheroes that were once a major symbol of American society have been outlawed since 77'. The members of the Watchmen (Rorschach, Nite Owl, Dr. Manhattan, Comedian, Ozymandias, & Silk Spectre) have since disbanded, but ominous events soon change everything. The story begins with the death of the Comedian, who was mysteriously murdered and thrown out his apartment window by an unknown assailant. With the rest of the world focused on the approaching apocalypse, the only one to investigate the Comedian's murder is the rogue vigilante Rorschach. Rorschach believes that someone is killing off former costumed heroes, and that the conspiracy is linked with a plot to ignite a World War III. The rest of the Watchmen ignore Rorschach's \\""mask killer\\"" claims, but after Dr. Manhattan exiles himself to Mars, and Ozymandias is attacked by a hit man, one can only wonder if Rorschach's theory is true. With the doomsday clock slowly ticking towards midnight, and vigilantes suffering attacks from an unknown mastermind, one question remains: \\""Who watches the Watchmen?\\""<br /><br />Watchmen surpassed all of my expectations! The story is extremely well-written, and the plot drives on the force of the moral standards of characters in a world without hope. The characters themselves have complex psychological profiles that allow us to identify, and feel for them, despite their obvious moral flaws as people. Rorschach is the best of the batch! In him we see a man tormented by the sin and corruption in the world, that has changed him into a cold redeemer of justice, with a black and white perspective of reality (his mask reflects his personality with its ever changing inkblots)! He is one of the greatest superheroes I have seen since Spider-Man and Batman. Dr. Manhattan is the only hero with actual superpowers, separating him from the rest of society, and making him gradually less human with each passing moment. He is frequently naked throughout the book, but I don't mind this at all as he is blue-skinned, and it further symbolizes his detachment to humanity as his power is nearly equivalent to that of a god. Despite the fact that Comedian dies at the beginning, he is the force that drives the all of the characters and events in the book, as his death sets the mystery and plot into motion.  Comedian is the most flawed of all the watchmen, as he has committed unforgivable acts in his life, but the method of his portrayal allows him to be likable to readers. Ozymandais comes off as a bit of a flat character through the story until the explosive climax, which gives him depth and development that nearly rivals the previous characters, which I dare not spoil! (I think Moore did this on purpose to serve the story he tells, which is an exceptional feat to pull-off!) Nite Owl is the weakestin my opinion, as he feels too similar to Batman (even though his approach is technological, and not direct), but even he provides moments that make him more than just a character on the printed page. (Besides, his airship is just cool!)<br /><br />The book is indeed Graphic (I'd strongly advise caution towards readers under 17), but even the suggestive content has strong meaning to it, as it places superheroes in the real world, and shows how fear and corruption dominate a society swiftly approaching nuclear war. I've finally found an Alan Moore work that has not only lived up to my experience with THE KILLING JOKE, but has surpassed it completely! Alan Moore not only successfully displayed what superheroes would be like in the real world, but gave us a psychological roller coaster ride of a comic book that has been tough to surpass. It makes me want to take a look at the BEFORE WATCHMEN prequels, even though Alan Moore has no involvement in them. It is a book that is essential for all comic book fans to read! It's an experience that no other comic can offer you.<br /><br />\\""[They] will look up and shout 'save us!' And I'll look down and whisper 'no.'\\""<br />  -Rorschach's Journal.

The writing, characterization and plotting are all exemplary. The art, clean and imaginative.<br /><br />But what a dark and cynical vision of humanity this is!<br /><br />For here is a world with no heroes. The Watchmen are masked vigilantes without any real opponents. The one 'super-villain' is old and dying. The Watchmen swagger about, a law unto themselves. Among their number are violent psychopaths (i.e. most of them), several murderers (one Stalin-level) and at least one rapist. One could imagine that a Nixon banning such beings would be acting with great public support.<br /><br />Now it could be argued that this is Moore's purpose. No doubt his message is: don't trust those who seek power for themselves. After all, the constant refrain here is 'who watches the watchmen?' Is Nixon right, then, to ban them? This would undermine Moore's apparent view that great power is inevitably corrupting since the government's action has probably saved the country from the Watchmen's even greater abuses. Perhaps Moore's point is: Government power is good, but individual power is bad?<br /><br />Whatever the case, the rightness or wrongness of the Nixon government's banning of costumed 'superheroes' is not much pursued beyond merely being stated. But it does weaken the question 'who watches the watchmen?' since the answer to that is \\""why the government, of course!\\"" and the government is never held up to scrutiny in the same way.<br /><br />One is left with the impression that Moore wants us to think that the Watchmen are authoritarian for behaving the way they do but that bogey-man Nixon is also authoritarian for banning them. This is not entirely well thought out.<br /><br />But a greater failing of this work, in my view, is a lack of a credible character who offers, even cursorily, a happier view of humanity. There are no good characters in Watchmen, merely differing levels of cynicism. This is a superhero version of King Lear, a world of darkness, cynicism and nihilism. Yet even Shakespeare's darkest play allows some hope and goodness in. In Watchmen, there is not one genuine hero, super or otherwise, period. Everyone in a costume is in it basically for themselves, either because of they are psychopaths, control freaks or thrill-seekers. This ultimately fails to convince me because it contains no one to challenge the over-arching cynicism of the narrative, No Fool or Cordelia or Gloucester to balance out the endless Edmunds, Gonereils and Regans.<br /><br />Such a cynical world view was greeted ecstatically by critics and Watchmen, along with the contemporaneous Dark Knight Returns, ushered in the Dark Age of Comics where such world weariness and nihilism became the norm. One cannot blame Moore because his dark vision was taken up by hacks, but there is something ugly and untruthful even in this Ur-text.<br /><br />The truth is that we see real acts of heroism every day, firemen who enter burning buildings at their own risk or people who volunteer their time to help others. This is the basic notion of the superhero, an altruistic being who will risk life and limb simply to save another. The superhero has no ulterior motive. He is not a psychopath or thrill-seeker but a person of the highest moral integrity. The subverting of this concept, which took place during this era, is not to my mind, a truthful vision but rather cynicism masquerading as sophistication.<br /><br />Moore is suggesting that there is no goodness in the world, that heroism cannot exist except as a form of mental illness, that selfishness is the only real motivation. it is not a vision I can share for all the excellent qualities of this work.",2013-04-12

Actually, it was the back story that interested me the most – I enjoyed reading about how each superhero got to where he (or she) was. In fact, I liked those parts of the books much more than the overall plot. The main conflict in the book got a little too big for its britches, and ultimately didn’t hold together for me.

It is a window into their private lives in a way that hadn't been tried before and it allows us to see these people as weak and afraid trying to do the right thing (or sometimes just in it for the fun or for the violence).

This entire work should be required reading for anyone attempting to write any sort of engrossing, page-turning, mind-blowing fiction.<br /><br />I found myself at times just looking at the images ... there is so much detail.  Sometimes when something important would happen in a panel, I'd look a few panels back, and there are people or things in the backgrounds of previous panels that I hadn't noticed before which foreshadow the important event.<br /><br />Another thing I liked is that this book blows away any preconceived notions of goodguy/badguy one may have.  In Watchmen, the good guys aren't all that good, and the bad guys aren't all that bad (sort of).  Also, the \\""superheroes\\"" frankly aren't all that super (except for two).  I think all of that was the point of the book -- to portray heroes as real people, with all the good AND the bad baggage a normal person would carry with them.  It makes it so much more real to me.  I loved that about it.<br /><br />Because a good bit of the story arc deals with Cold War issues, people born after about 1984 might find it a little less enjoyable than those of us who remember the international politics of the time and what it was like having a nuclear arch-nemesis.<br /><br />One warning: The book has sexy scenes, brief nudity, and lots and lots of blood, death and violence.  Keep that in mind if you are considering this book as a gift for a minor.<br /><br />To sum up: not just a good book, not just a great book ... it's a book that will blow you away.  AMAZING.",2013-01-03

That is, all except Rorschach, a totally uncompromising crime-fighter who continues to operate outside of the law (the superheroes' activities having now been deemed illegal). Since their heyday, several have met tragic ends and now the cynical public sentiment is very much against them - even though they helped the US win the Vietnam War and their most powerful member, Dr. Manhattan, has helped the US gain the upper hand strategically in the global stand-off with the Soviet Union.<br /><br />When a final showdown with the Soviet Union seems to be imminent, one of the Watchmen, the Comedian, is brutally killed. Dr. Manhattan is then vilified in public and promptly disappears. Rorschach investigates and becomes convinced that someone is trying to murder or sideline all remaining superheroes. Is someone out for revenge? Is someone trying to tilt the balance of power back in favor of the Russians? The Night Owl comes out of retirement to help and the Silk Spectre (disenchanted partner of the missing Dr. Manhattan) also dons her crime-fighting costume, despite detesting Rorschach. They try to persuade the super-intelligent Ozymandias to help as well, but he casts doubts on their conspiracy theories and seems to be too wrapped up in running his business empire.<br /><br />As nuclear Armageddon fast approaches, some of the Watchmen struggle to untangle what is going on and try to persuade the troubled and emotionally detached Dr. Manhattan to return to Earth to help. This in turn leads to some unpleasant discoveries for the Silk Spectre. Meanwhile a youth is reading a gruesome comic book about pirates, Tales of the Black Freighter, which seems to have some uncanny parallels with what is happening in the real world.<br /><br />The ending is full of surprises and really challenges the reader to think about what is right, what is wrong, and what might just be acceptable in a world that is anything but black and white.<br /><br />John's thoughts:  Well, I never thought that my first five-star rating would be for a graphic novel, but here I am and this is most definitely worthy of five stars. If you have notions about the graphic novel art form being adolescent and unintelligent, banish them and read this book.<br /><br />The characters are remarkably complex and interesting, especially Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan. The plot twists and turns all over the place and I had no idea how it would all end up. The ending is remarkably thought-provoking. And it's nice that Moore doesn't try to lay out what he thinks - in essence the various characters have extreme and differing views on what is morally right and what isn't, and the reader is left to decide what she/he thinks.<br /><br />There is so much more to enjoy about the book. It's a wonderfully dark story; it lays bare the shallowness and venality of the world we live in; nothing is black or white; thanks in large part to the activities of the Watchmen, Richard Nixon is enjoying his fifth term as US president (truly scary); the graphics are excellent; and despite much of the bleakness, it's actually a fun read.<br /><br />I'd unequivocally rate the book five stars. If you like dark superhero stories or any books that are deeply thought-provoking, this one is for you. If you've never ventured into the world of graphic novels, this is a great place to start.<br /><br />P.S. When the movie version of Watchmen came out in 2009, many Watchmen purists panned it. I don't agree. A movie could never pick up all of the subtleties and intricacies of a novel like this, but the Watchmen movie was hugelyentertaining, fun and, as with the book, very thought-provoking. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Whether you have read the book or not, I'd recommend giving the movie a go.entertaining, fun and, as with the book, very thought-provoking.

Somewhere in my twenties I dropped out of the comicverse in a quest to succeed in the \\""real world.\\""  Perhaps it was childhood nostalgia, perhaps it was watching Phineas and Ferb with my kids, perhaps it was just time, but I recently set myself to reading one comic a month until I satisfied my illustrated urges.

Like da Vinci's most famous painting, Watchmen operates simultaneously on multiple levels of complexity.  How many comics are able to integrate a comic-within-a-comic pseudo-commentary without falling flat on their face or diving into self-parody?  Great works of fiction force their readers to search inside themselves for answers to the questions they ask, and Watchmen is no different.  Does the black and white morality of Rorschach have a place in our modern world?  Or does Ozymandias' moral relativism rule the day?  Do vigilantes really offer justice?  How much is one life worth?  Is the Comedian a hero or a villain?  Is there such a thing as either?<br /><br />Moore has crafted a masterpiece of plot, character, and narrative, and Gibbons' cinematic artwork matches him step for step.

When it came out in 1985, it was one of the first stories that took a different look at superheroes and comic books. Without Watchmen, there would be no Dark Knight.<br /><br />The story takes place in an alternate 1985 America, where we won the Vietnam War and Richard Nixon is still president. There are no humans with super powers, only masked crime fighters--adventurers--who help clean up the streets. After the Keene Act, vigilantism is declared illegal, and the heroes retire or go to work with the government. One of these is Edward Blake (the Comedian), whose less-than-honorable ways have made him a successful soldier-for-hire. Another is Dr. Manhattan, the only person with real super powers. Dr. Manhattan works for the U.S. government, and keeps a check on the approaching Soviets by tipping the balance of power in America's favor.<br /><br />The story opens with Rorschach, an illegal crime fighter with an heightened sense of justice, searching for answers in the murder of Edward Blake. He uncovers a plot to kill the former adventurers in an attempt to remove Dr. Manhattan, and perhaps to have world-conquering implications.<br /><br />There are many layers to this excellent story: the comparison to this America to the actual 1985's America; the story-within-a-story about the Black Freighter; the question on what heroes do when they are done saving the world; and, the most interesting to me, Rorschach's moral justice versus the other characters. The character is perhaps one of the most compelling characters, both good and depraved in the same man. His mask is Rorschack inkblots, black and white with no place for gray.<br /><br />If you are interested in the graphic novel format, I'd suggest giving this a go.

While I've enjoyed all genres, my favorite ones have been the superhero types. And within those, my favorites were of the Batman and Spiderman variety ... the comics where the protagonist were mere humans (Batman, Daredevil, and Iron Man, for example) or marginally superpowered heros (Spiderman), all with human flaws and problems, and struggling to overcome them. And so it is with the characters in this graphic novel, &#34;Watchmen&#34;.<br /><br />Since my desire to read comics comes and goes, I completely missed the entire &#34;Watchmen&#34; phenomena when it first came out, and I didn't watch the 2009 movie of the same name. However, I recently came across some discussion about the &#34;Watchmen&#34; and decided to give the complete graphic novel a read. Now having read it, all I can say is &#34;Wow!&#34;<br /><br />While in my opinion, it isn't completely without flaws (for example, I can't quite get how Rorschach, such an unbending paragon of absolute right and wrong, can continually break into other peoples houses, filter through their possessions, and assault people for information, even if he is mentally a few bricks shy of a load). However, any flaws that I perceive are very minor when compared to the rich, complex story and wonderful illustrations. Comic books, as a literary medium, are typically considered &#34;lightweights&#34;, the same way that the sports section is thought of in most newspapers. However, every so often a work like this comes along that shows how deep and powerful of a story can be told using this format.<br /><br />The graphic novel was named as one of Time Magazine's Top 100 novels. While I won't go quite that far in my own evaluation (it is, after all, still a comic book adventure about a bunch of superheroes), it's amazingly good, and sits at the top of its genre alongside Frank Miller's &#34;A Dark Knight Returns&#34;.

Is the best I can do to wipe random flecks of foam away from its mouth?""","FIRST BOOK I'VE EVER READ:<br />In high school, I didn't read because I thought all the books we were assigned were boring or childish, and at home my parents weren't readers, and hey, I had an X-Box 360. And then one of my favorite film directors, Zach Snyder (aside from Sucker Punch), was going to make this movie called Watchmen. So, of course I looked it up and learned it was based on a graphic novel of the same name. It was one of TIME's magazine's greatest 100 books of ALL TIME--books, not \\""comic books\\"" (and Watchmen IS NOT a comic book: that needs to be put out on the table right here and now in case that's a turn off). And then when my family was going to take out yearly trip to Daytona Beach, Florida, I told my mom I wanted to get a book. She was shocked that I would even ask (even though she considered Watchmen a comic book, but hey, it had words), so she bought it on the spot even though at the time it was twenty dollars or so.<br /><br />Watchmen was the first book I've ever read. It was a gateway book to George Orwell's 1984, and then from there on . . . I became a chronic reader. So, first and foremost, there's a great respect for Watchmen. It didn't get me into other graphic novels, per se, it got me into real literature! But here's the thing: I don't consider comic books/graphic novels having real substance, but I don't consider Watchmen a comic book and certainly not an average picture oriented graphic novel. Watchmen is all about the words! And there are lots. And to be honest, that COULD be a turn off for someone having to read so much. So, in a sense, Watchmen is more or less between a hard and soft spot in terms of its audience. But only because it's risky art.<br /><br />THE WORLD OF WATCHMEN:<br />\\""One of us died tonight . . . somebody knows why.\\"" And that's the thesis to the entire novel and I believe the first line, if not one of the first lines in the book. Watchmen takes place in a alternate history where Nixon was president for many terms and people dressed up and faught. Not necessarily crime, but they faught against what they believed in. And that is what separates this superhero bunch from others; their motives differ. It's a big political analogy in a way. Rorschach represents Conservatism, Ozymandias represents Liberalism, The Comedian represents war, Dr. Manhattan represents coldhearted, unbias logic, whereas Silk Spectre and Nite Owl represent the common, everyday American citizen that cares more about love and worries more about paying the bills or taking care of mother than to get into this murder mystery full of political angst. Knowing these characters was the first time I understood American politics. And Alan Moore (known to be anti-government) did not entirely make it a rigged message, per se, for instance the characters each have their beliefs and I had always been on Rorschach's side, even though there was a piece of information in which following Rorschach's plan would have cost the world billions of deaths. Alan doesn't make the reader like characters; instead the reader has the choice to like whom they will, and usually they'll like characters according to their own politics.<br /><br />In a way, Watchmen is a \\""what political affiliation are you?\\"" test--I only say that half-jokingly.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />I'll get around to rereading Watchmen every now and then. It's a book full of political tension and it doesn't matter if you're Liberal, Conservative, Independent, Libertarian, or just don't care at all, because simply there's a character for everyone, and the message is never preachy; the message is simply: if sellout your morality and humanity, you'll save the world--it's a bitter cup to swallow. Do you kill a few to save many or do the right thing and kill many? It's an ethical question and there is hard to find the right answer; but that's what Watchmen deals with. Identity.<br /><br />In other words, if you're a comic book reader, Watchmen will be wordy, but worth theread; if you're a \\""I will never read comic books\\"" person, well, Watchmen honestly is not going to be a backslide in your intellect. It takes effort and time to read it, unlike your typical graphic novel that you could read in a day.

I will qualify that statement by stating that I used to read comic books as a child and teen (by no means was I ever an avid comic reader) and I have only read 3 graphic novels so far. As a genre, I do enjoy the artwork and the different mode of story-telling, but I do not find the experience as rich as reading traditional novels.<br /><br />On that note, I did truly enjoy most of what Watchmen had to offer. Alan Moore has created a rich history and a solid storyline that I found interesting and engaging. Some of the characters were a bit strange and/or annoying, but that is true of many fictional characters, so I would not consider that any fault of the genre.<br /><br />In this case, the artwork complimented the storyline well. In some examples of this medium that I've seen, the author relies too much on the artwork to tell the story. In Watchmen, the text and artwork compliment each other in such a way that both combine to tell the story.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed Watchmen and feel that it is a quality piece of literature. I do feel that it has been a bit over-hyped as far as it's overall literary merit, but that is a common occurrence when a \\""newer\\"" medium is really taking a commanding foothold in it's particular field or genre.",2012-03-14

Not only is it amazing as far as graphic novels go, it's better and more intelligently written than a lot of lauded literature that I've read.

Only Veidt has means and motive.  No criminal would do this.  A foreign power wouldn't spook the Comedian.  Dr.  Manhattan would need no secrecy.  Neither Dreiberg nor Rorschach (Kovacs died long ago) tells the authorities because that would ruin the end of the book.  The people at the New Frontiersman don't give Rorschach's journal even a cursory look - for the same reason.  A killer killed Veidt's secretary instead of Veidt.  The killer shot at point blank range.  Everyone assumed Veidt was the target.<br /><br />The book is filled with loopholes, ridiculous things and moral ugliness.  There is Rorschach's absurd fight with Veidt.  Laurie calls out to Veidt before shooting him.  Veidt catches the bullet.  Moore doesn't realize the speed of light or vastness of space.  Osterman's comment that \\""Mars did not choose life\\"" is rationalizing his own selfishness as standing up for inorganic matter.  Mars cannot think or choose, moreover, if there were no life, there would be no point to the universe because there would be no one to notice it.  Earlier you have Laurie leaving Doctor Manhattan despite possible consequences.  Veidt even refused to admit that he murdered his servants.  So many of the characters are solipsists.  It's all about themselves.<br /><br />This Veidt, the smartest man in the world has an idiotic plan for peace.  It wouldn't work.  Within a few years to a decade, things would go back to the way they were.  Veidt said \\""let's compromise\\"", but asked for capitulation.  The moral ugliness of Osterman (Dr. Manhattan) and Veidt is crushing.  Osterman says that \\""nothing ever ends\\"", implying that peace will be undone.  He, of course, is admitting that he murdered Rorschach on a whim, just to see Veidt's plan unfold.  When he leaves for good, he is saying that the earth can die because he has no stake in it.  The ending of the book still suggests peace, though it hints at Rorschach's journal being looked at - two months too late.<br /><br />The high point of the book was the study of Rorschach - chapter six - how a hero turns psychotic.  He goes too far and is mostly violence oriented, not a thinker, but at least he cares, and not in the abstract as does Veidt.  Fascinating.  The character, an atheist, lived his life free from compromise and faced death without complaint.  He is the most interesting character in the book, and the only one I have some sympathy for.<br /><br />Lastly, some of the book is filled with such raw ugly descriptions (like the pirate sections) that defy comprehension.  The book would have been better without such overkill.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, the book cannot be dismissed.  This disturbing book will haunt one.  I wish Moore had written in detail about it and what he intended.  One thinks about \\""heroes\\"" advocating a murder coverup.  One thinks about Veidt's insane plot and Rorschach's unwillingness to look the other way.  What would they have done if Rorschach had lied and later had exposed the plot.  I'm sorry, Mr. Moore.  I guess I shouldn't think such things.",2011-11-14

The characters debate deep topics such as the nature of humanity. While the symbolism and depth of the story are what makes this novel great and helps it rise above what I normally think of when I think of superhero comics, it also made it hard to read. I wish that the mystery and its investigation was given more weight in the story, I felt like sometimes the plot took a back seat to the examination of the bigger questions.

And let me also inform you that there are not many books in recent years that I would call essential... but the graphic novel \\""Watchmen\\"" by  Alan Moore is a mesmerizing exception.<br /><br />I first came across the book when I was in summer camp and I was about thirteen-years old. At the time I was heavily into reading a bizarre combination of Greek myths, fantasy novels, comic books, and Shakespearean plays (mainly the tragedies). I suffered under the pretension that I was an intellectual because most of my peers were reading quaint young adult novels about adolescent romances and school troubles, while I was reading poetry, philosophy, and wanting to become a professional writer. Then I encountered a fellow camper with similar tastes and, dare I say, an even bleaker outlook on life than my own. It was this angry, self-doubting, pubescent punk that introduced me to  Alan Moore's classic 12-part series \\""Watchmen\\""... and I've never looked at comic books the same way again.<br /><br />\\""Watchmen\\"" is an amazing, epic series that commenced in 1986 and was published by the legendary  DC Comics. DC is best known for a trio of classic comic book heroes that were created in the late 1930s and early `40s. Superman,  Batman, and  Wonder Woman are still a popular staple in the \\""DC Universe\\"", mainly because they can evolve and adapt to better reflect the current social atmosphere.<br /><br />In the early 1960s, DC revived many of their best-selling characters in a series of slightly more sophisticated updates of their classic `40s comics. Meanwhile  Marvel Comics, at the time a hipper, edgier company, found great success with their new take on superheroes. As  Marvel began creating a cosmology of self-centered, morally conflicted, and neurotic characters, DC suffered from \\""Batmania\\"". With the popularity of the ridiculously campy and self-satirizing  Batman series, starring  Adam West and  Burt Ward, on the rise  DC found itself losing readers. While  Marvel's characters were tackling sociopolitical and even spiritual issues spawned by the tragedies of the Vietnam War,  DC was being denigrated by their reputation as a simple, old-fashioned publisher of children's cartoons. But that changed when a group of socially conscious writers, artists, and editors came on board and began breathing new life into  DC's superhero pantheon. An era began of more topical comics, where people had no qualms with dealing with controversial issues. Civil rights, anti-war, and even anti-government stories began to proliferate at both  DC and  Marvel.<br /><br />By the early 1970s writers began to take notice that the average reader was no longer a five to ten-year old. College kids had discovered the new complexity of the comic book. The world of comics had entered a new age, where posters of superheroes were proudly hung upon the walls of student dormitories next to pictures of revolutionary figures like  Malcolm X and  Che Guevara. Comics were becoming part of the counterculture and paradoxically they also became more commercial than ever before.<br /><br />Yet as tastes evolved and the hippie mentality of a \\""revolution of love\\"" faded away, a new group of writers and artists emerged to remind the world that life wasn't all sunshine and flowers. The `70s were coming to an end, faith in the American government was dissipated after the deception and distrust of the Nixon years, and the consumerism and Cold War paranoia of the `80s were just around the bend.  It was in this decade of decadence and denial, of great artistic innovation and technological advancement that comics were forced to grow up... whether readers were ready to or not.<br /><br />Just as there had been an \\""invasion\\"" of British innovators in the rock 'n' roll music of the `60s, a similar \\""invasion\\"" began happening in the comicbook industry. European writers and artists were dealing with a wide range of social, political, economic, and religious problems within their ever-increasingly conservative cultures. Inspired by the rebellious attitude of punk rock and the writing of the beat poets and the hippies, some comic book creators began telling stories of dystopian futures that reflected their growing concerns with modern society. As these darkly pessimistic books began to gain in popularity,  DC Comics executives sat up and took notice. They began importing talented British writers and artists to the U.S., and here they began to reawaken the spirit of social activism that had been so prominent during the Vietnam era.<br /><br />Among the many talented writers who made names for themselves were two innovators : Alan Moore, who specialized in anarchic storytelling with a distinctly philosophical slant and  Neil Gaiman, whose darkly humorous tales are often tinged with mystical themes. Both of these writers, along with many others, would inspire and influence their contemporaries, as well as future generations of comic book and graphic novel fans.<br /><br />As I have said earlier, whether readers were ready for it or not, comics were about to leave behind their domain as a medium for children and enter the cruel world of the adult. And it was  Alan Moore's masterpiece \\""Watchmen\\"" that would be responsible for this momentous change.<br /><br /> \\""At midnight, all the agents and superhuman crew, go out and round up everyone who knows more than they do.\\""<br />-Bob Dylan in the song Desolation Row<br /><br />The world of the Watchmen is set in a hellish alternate 1985, where Nixon is still President of the United States of America. In this alternate reality superheroes (or more accurately, costumed vigilantes) are not uncommon, though the government has outlawed them. But their existence is not purely beneficial and they are typically as dysfunctional, if not more so, than average citizens are. As the tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union grow to an unbearable level, a sociopath masked crime-fighter named Rorschach begins his own investigation into the murder of a fellow superhero (who was less than super as you will find out when you read the book) known as The Comedian. Rorschach's instincts tell him that the death of The Comedian is no random incident and he suspects an elaborate conspiracy against all heroes, but who if anyone is behind it?<br /><br />\\""Shall not the Judge of the earth do right?\\""<br />-Genesis 18:25<br /><br />While Rorschach stalks the streets of New York looking for answers, his former allies reminisce about their glory days as superheroes, before the government outlawed their brand of vigilante justice. Former heroes Nite Owl (a man named Hollis Mason was the first Nite Owl), a self-doubting and apathetic man whose real identity is Dan Dreiberg, and Silk Spectre (her mother was the first Silk Spectre), whose real identity is Laurie Juspeczyk, begin to question if their abilities as heroes are once again needed. As Laurie spends more time with Dan, she and her former boyfriend (if you can even call him that) Dr. Manhattan become more distant.<br /><br />\\""Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.\\""<br />-Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche<br /><br />Dr. Manhattan, formerly known as Jon Osterman, became the first superhuman superhero when, as a brilliant young science student, he was accidentally trapped inside of an intrinsic field test chamber and was de-atomized. Yet somehow Osterman's consciousness survived and he psychically manifests a new body for himself. Osterman now possesses the god-like ability to manipulate all matter, constructing or destructing whatever he chooses. Osterman's powers make him an international celebrity, a status to which he is ambivalent, and he is employed by the U.S. government to fight the Communists during the Vietnam War. But Osterman, now dubbed Dr. Manhattan (named after the Manhattan Project), becomes more and more detached emotionally, until finally he begins to disassociate himself from all of humanity.<br /><br />\\""On Hallowe'en the old ghosts come about us, and they speak to some; to others they are dumb.\\""<br />-Eleanor Farjeon in the poem Hallowe'en<br /><br />Meanwhile Rorschach continues his vigilant quest, all the while society falls apart around him, reinforcing his fanatical apocalyptic religious beliefs.<br /><br />Former superhero Ozymandias, a.k.a. Adrian Veidt, now an egotistical entrepeneur, who exploits his own celebrity for financial and political gain, is said to be one of the most intelligent men alive. So, naturally Rorschach distrusts him, as well as former hero Hollis Mason, the original Nite Owl, who vocally expressed his dislike of the violent and morally deviant Comedian.<br /><br />\\""It would be a stronger world, a stronger loving world, to die in.\\""<br />-John Cale in the song Santies<br /><br />But as Rorschach and the other heroes come closer to the truth, as the mystery of The Comedian's death unfolds, it becomes grossly apparent that the \\""Watchmen\\"" and their superhero fraternity was comprised of severely flawed individuals: rapists, murderers, racists, psychopaths, and opportunists.<br /><br />In the end, an entire city is devastated, good people suffer or lay dead strewn across the carnage-filled streets of New York, the corrupt thrive as ever, and the greatest of heroes turn out be the greatest of failures.<br /><br />\\""Quis custodiet ipsos custodes.\\""<br />\\""Who watches the watchmen?\\""<br />-Juvenal, Satires, VI, 347<br /><br />The climax of \\""Watchmen\\"" is delightfully nihilistic and shows Moore's dislike of neat-and-tidy happy endings. What he delivers is a darkly humorous and disturbing finale, which perfectly encapsulates the emotional reality of his psychologically flawed characters.<br /><br />What Alan Moore gives us, as readers, is a pessimistic yet not inaccurate view of America's inability to take responsibility for itself. The main problem being that, on a whole, our nation is too quick to rely on heroes, icons, celebrities, and powerful political and religious organizations. Rather than being self-reliant, we surrender what little power we have to those who hunger for it the most. We lie back and complain about the woes of our world, but we are too lazy to take action. While self-appointed heroes prove themselves to be insecure and amoral, we are equally guilty as we are tainted by apathy and a reluctance to help ourselves and others. We glorify and vilify heroes and public figures, as we glorify and vilify all leaders, but when we cast down those leaders we fail to uphold their burden of responsibility. We fail, as they fail.<br /><br />If there were a single message or moral to Alan Moore's story, it would have to be that we must all become heroes or else we are all naught but villains. There is no middle ground, no in-between, not so long as we are inert and submissive. The story also carries an anarchic message about relying on authority figures to protect us. Authority is often obtained by the enforcement of power and anyone capable of enforcing or asserting their power on another individual cannot be trusted. In this sense, Watchmen is about how we must abandon our tendencies to rely on external powers, be they religious, economic, or political organizations. The people who succeed, or seemingly succeed, within these organizations have only done so because they are corrupt and willing to exploit those weaker than themselves in order to possess even greater power.<br /><br />Just as writer Alan Moore revolutionized the art of storytelling in comics with his vast interweaving narrative, so too did artist  Dave Gibbons raise the bar in the graphic storytelling medium. Gibbon's work on Watchmen is simple and understated. It recalls comic books of the `60s and yet it is very unique to its own time period. In the `80s, many comic book artists pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable, greatly emphasizing sexual and violent content, but Gibbons never sunk to the amateurish level of exploitation that many artists of the era succumbed to. Instead his style reflects the world we live in and the world of the Watchmen, while colorist  John Higgins' unique use of colors creates a memorable secondary reality that is both very familiar and foreign.<br /><br />In Alan Moore's brilliant \\""Watchmen\\"" saga, he embraces certain themes that are reminiscent of other great works of literature. \\""Watchmen\\"" is as detailed as J.R.R. Tolkien's \\""The Lord of the Rings\\""; as brilliantly convoluted in its non-linear narrative as Bram Stoker's \\""[[ASIN:0393970124 Dracula ]]\\""; its political commentary and satire equal  George Orwell's \\""[[ASIN:B003ZX868W Animal Farm\\"" and \\""1984]]\\"" and  Ray Bradbury's \\""[[ASIN:0345342968 Fahrenheit 451]]\\""; it's as dark and psychologically complex as  Philip K. Dick's \\""[[ASIN:1400096901 A Scanner Darkly]]\\""; it's as contemplative and poetic as William Shakespeare's \\""[[ASIN:0451526775 Macbeth]]\\"". Yet it is as original as any of those works were when they were first published.<br /><br />Rarely in comic books can a reader go through panel by panel and uncover layer upon layer of visual metaphors, hidden symbolism, and artistic and narrative motifs that are carried throughout. Yet this is common on every single panel and page of \\""Watchmen\\"", partly because of  Alan Moore's meticulous description of each scene, but also because of the unique inventiveness of  Dave Gibbons' artwork, which hearkens back to the comic book artists of the Silver Age.<br />It's not often that one goes out of their way to praise a colorist in their critique of a comic book or graphic novel, but  John Higgins' contributions to the overall look of \\""Watchmen\\"" cannot go overlooked. Going completely against the grain, Higgins used secondary colors (greens, oranges, pinks, and purples) rather than primary colors (reds, yellows, and blues), which are more typical in the graphic medium. This unconventional approach was at first questioned because some felt that the color palette was unattractive, but Higgins explained that it was intended to reflect the reality of New York in the 1980s and the neon signs and garish wallpapers that were then popular.<br /><br />The \\""Watchmen\\"" has been celebrated as a milestone in graphic literature, yet it has also caused controversy for its anarchic message and it portrayal of corrupt and unreliable institutions, whether they be political, religious, social, economic, or scientific. \\""Watchmen\\"" is a work of pure genius, both irreverent and relevant. Irreverent in that it deconstructs the beloved icon of the American superhero and satirizes the worse aspects of the American society and government, and relevant in that it took a great progressive leap forward in the evolution of comic books and in that it dared to criticize the conservative political structure of the 1980s. It is this combination of irreverence and relevance that gives the book much of its appeal.<br /><br />In the final view, \\""Watchmen\\"" is too complex to summarize, just as our world cannot be summarized.

When I finally picked it up, I enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />And that's pretty remarkable, because I'm no great lover of comic books - though I do enjoy reading Stan Lee's fun 1960s work, and witty stuff like Calvin & Hobbes. I have nothing against comics, exactly, and I do think they're a legit art form; perhaps I just get put off by the violence and relative lack of intelligence found in so many superhero comics. Batman, for example, is cool on the surface but actually constitutes a very disturbing glorification of vigilante justice; his comics also contain shockingly primitive depictions of the mentally ill, as well as unflattering portraits of women (e.g., Poison Ivy, who embodies a whole range of little-boy fantasies and fears about women and sex).<br /><br />Fortunately, \\""Watchmen\\"" is like Batman with more of a brain. This comic very intelligently explores the psychology and social impact of superheroes, directly addressing the elements of violence and weird sexuality that spoil mainstream comics for me. Indeed, Watchmen's Rorschach is a more realistic depiction of the Batman figure, who has allowed his obsession with crime to take over his life - even to the extent that he neglects his personal hygiene.<br /><br />Rorschach may be the most interesting character here, but writer Alan Moore also does a good job with the other Watchmen: the aloof and almost all-powerful Doctor Manhattan; the somewhat weak and indecisive Nite Owl; and the jingoistic Comedian. Perhaps the only character who doesn't quite work for me is Ozymandias; considering how important he becomes by the end of the story, I don't think he gets quite enough attention early on.<br /><br />Apart from Ozymandias, I have a few other problems with Watchmen. The Black Freighter segment seems overdone to me, and doesn't add much to my understanding of the story; and I alsodon't care much for a late plot twist that involves a silly-looking creature. But these are minor flaws. More significant is the fact that I've continued to think about the characters and politics of Watchmen, long after I finished reading it. Far from being a disposable piece of pop culture, it's a fascinating social commentary that sticks with you.<br /><br />But does that make it one of the great novels of the 20th century? I'm not sure. Perhaps I'm not the right guy to ask, since I've never been too keen on contemporary fiction. But, for what it's worth, I enjoyed Watchmen much more than I enjoyed some of my other recent reads, including: On the Road; The Brooklyn Follies; Super Sad True Love Story; and A Visit from the Goon Squad (this year's Pulitzer winner). So yeah, this is good art - very good art - and I'm glad I finally got around to reading it.",2011-10-03
US,33949194,RMIR9KAXIPVUJ,1401219268,777411096,Watchmen,Books,5,0,1,N,N,"One of the Best Novels Ever","This book is one of the best books I have ever read and a must read for everyone.<br /><br />When I first picked up Watchmen, I was not expecting to read a novel with such complex themes and great literary construction. Watchmen is by no means a simple book with pictures but a novel of intense meaning. Moore is an incredibly talented author exposing the realities of human nature and society. The theme of the nature of superheroes is central to this novel's success. Moore presents the reader with a realistic interpretation of superheroes with his portrayal of superheroes not just as the defenders of morality but also as human beings, with human flaws. The dichotomy of good and evil within the superheroes is symbolic of the same dichotomy existing in every aspect of society. Moore argues in this novel that everything we perceive as positive and good in the world always contains negative elements. Moore also argues that despite our best efforts the future is unchangeable, that through human actions we are always marching closer to our doom. This argument is established through the repeated use of the cover image. The smiley face on the cover of the novel is symbolic of the human tendency to ignore even the blatantly obvious and destructive problems in the world. The repetition of this element throughout the novel juxtaposed with immorality demonstrates the human refusal to accept the problems of the world.<br /> Moore is an incredibly talented author employing multiple forms of figurative language to elucidate the themes of his novel. Moore's control of the English language is amazing. Moore's use of idioms in the novel establishes a cultural connection with the reader, allowing them a deeper understanding of the transpiring events and how they relate to the themes of the novel. The copious amount of puns in the novel not only serve to enlist vivid mental imagery and deeper insight, but also serve as a real example of Moore's arguments. Puns in the novel only exist injuxtaposition with events that are significant to the development of the plot or immoral actions, because puns garner a comedic response from the reader, the reader is laughing at immoral actions and the development of life-threatening problems. This intentional paradox is Moore's method of conveying his argument that human beings ignore problems are refuse to accept the negative reality of situations. Only an extremely skilled writer could possibly design their writing to work so harmoniously with the reader. In addition, the use of symbolism by Moore is skillful in that he is able to repeat the image of his theme throughout the novel as a signature indicating general events that relate to the readers.<br /> Despite Moore's strengths, he is as fallible as his superheroes. The beginning of Watchmen is the most negative in the book, albeit only slightly affecting the quality. The novel begins immediately with an event confusing to the reader and only understood superficially after reading the second chapter. Indeed, most of the first chapter of the novel was confusing to me because it lacked any exposition of the characters used. That said, the mystery of the characters was still compelling enough that I continued and enjoyed the rest of the novel. However, that lack of detailed character exposition may be a non-starter for some readers.<br /> As a whole Watchmen is one of the best books, I have ever read. Not only is the novel densely packed with deep social commentary and relevant themes it has a gripping plot and is written so well you will not want to put it down.",2011-10-02

I spent hours just reading it. After I was done with one issue I went right into the next one, and then I went back to admire the artwork, to see if there was any hint into what the next issue would be about. The only thing that I didn't like about it was the ending. I mean, it was good, but for some reason I just felt that it was rushed.

Although, I never saw the movie, I thought it looked interesting so when I saw the book in a store recently, I bought it.  It was an interesting read and probably a book I'll reread in the future.<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />This is the most brilliant part of the book.  The characters are all masked heroes who were vigilante crime fighters earlier in their lives.  The book follows Rorschach, Nite Owl, the Silk Spectre, Dr. Manhattan, and Ozymandias.  The only character that could be said to have true superpowers in Dr. Manhattan, who lost his human form in a nuclear accident.  Most of the time when we see heroes from comic books, they are essentially paragons of virtue.  Batman and Superman may have their weaknesses, but they are still fairly black and white about their tasks.  The characters in this book aren't nearly as heavily in that vein.  Each of the characters is flawed in some way and the book shows this clearly.  The characters in this book are the single biggest reason to read this story.<br /><br />Setting<br /><br />The book is set in 1980's America, taking place in New York City.  The world history is heavily altered due to the existence of the heroes the story revolves around.  The biggest influence on the world is Dr. Manhattan and his knowledge of the workings of everything in the world.<br /><br />Plot<br /><br />The plot begins with Rorschach examining the death of another masked hero, the Comedian.  From this starting point, it begins to expand both forward and backward in time to show the characters pasts as well as the current events of the world.  The story is very didactic as it deals with the way that humans deal with conflict.<br /><br />Enjoyment<br /><br />The characters in this story are brilliant and are the main reason to read it.  All of the characters are beautifully flawed.  I generally don't care for stories that are clearly didactic to the point where itfeels like it's hitting you in the head.  The plot of this story reads that way to me at times, but the characters still make it worth reading.<br /><br />Overall Grade<br /><br />Worth reading, the first half of the book is where it really shines.<br /><br />7/10<br /><br />This and all of my reviews are available on my blog.

I read it for the first time while stationed in Iraq about a year before the film came out.

Rorshach is a darker and more twisted version of batman (my favorite super hero). He has a great back story and is a non-conformist vigilante. Dr. Manhattan, the all powerful<br />super-human has a way of looking at his life and humanity in general that i havent seen in any other series. His personality is refreshing and original, but still believable for person put in his position. The other charcters are less interesting but are still interesting and the story is better for having every one of them.<br /><br />-Story line. While it starts off a little slow, it quickly picks up and emerges the reader into a dark world full mystery and excitment. The story behind the formation and falling apart of the watchmen is interesting, as is the reformation of them. The ending was perfect. Unlike the end to many books and comics, this was unexpected and still believable.<br /><br />-The art. While I am not overly adept at picking apart artistic work, I can say that the illistrations were perfect.

The Clark Kent-esque Dan Dreiberg is a depressed loser who pines over female superheroes. The Comedian, similar to Wolverine from the X-Men with his brutality and emphasis on force, is a rapist and serial killer. Yet these characters in their reality as pitiful as they are, are still the main characters and do the deeds of crime fighters in the real world. Essentially Watchmen is a look at what would the real world be like if there were costumed people going around doing the deeds they do in the comic books.<br /><br />Dave Gibbons's art has been praised as great. I would not pen that same exclamation as it is very reminiscent of other comics written around its era, but for a story as gritty as this one, it works. The superheroes are drawn as realistically as you would expect costumed superheroes to look like. The first Silk Spectre is dressed like a prostitute with a bad mullet, the Comedian wears an outfit so stars and stripes that I imagine it is given to the tenth Dan of Rex Kwon Do, and Ozymandias sports an outfit that, while you could see it in a superhero comic, you could also imagine someone at Caesar's Palace wearing it too. There are also many little Easter Eggs hidden in the artwork, such as one chapter which is a palindrome, or a recurring smiley face.<br /><br />The story starts off with one of the superheroes, the Comedian, defenestrated and lying dead in the street. One of his old partners, Rorschach, is convinced that someone is going after the rest of the remaining superheroes, all now retired, save those working for the government from success in their previous careers. He visits the rest of the superheroes but none of them buy his story, and as the Comedian is laid to rest, the superheroes in attendance of his funeral reminisce on their roles in stopping crime and fighting abroad in Vietnam. Other world powers have grown tense as this is the Cold War period and the threat of another conflict is on the precipice. Things eventually run full circle as the superheroes assume their old roles and find out the secret behind the Comedian's murder.<br /><br />The beginning is extremely promising as most of Rorschach's former companions think him a kook mired in conspiracy theories and to an extent, they're right. The Comedian alone is built to be such an atrocious character that even though he is dead, he is felt by the characters in the present at revulsion for the numerous atrocities he committed, and his death remains a mystery. Another superhero, Dr. Manhattan, who after being vaporized in a physics experiment was reborn as a god, is growing detached from humanity and is eventually interrogated on the suspicion of giving several people cancer, whereupon he runs to Mars. The world powers grow tenser and another world war seems imminent.<br /><br />While the premise is innovative for the comic book industry, adding realism to a work is not a new story idea. The history of Western storytelling alone is at least two-thousand years old and people give far too much credit to an idea that some people would think obvious. That being, superheroes in the real world would be dysfunctional people tied too far back to their old lives without understanding a whit of how reality works at all. Fortunately there is more to the story than that concept alone. The alternate universe of Watchmen goes to great lengths to show how integral the role costumed vigilantes played in concert with cops and firefighters and the world feels real. More importantly, there are little snippets offered at the end of each chapter such as a journal entry from one of the old superheroes meditating on his life that breathes history into the characters and the plot.<br /><br />Yet the realism goes one step further into darker territory and comes off as hokey forced writing. A psychiatrist has a disturbing new client and the work is beginning to get to him but all his wife does is mock him and insult him, saying that she needs sex. Later on the psychiatrist sees people on the street who need help and decides to help them, but his wife threatens to leave him based on that alone. Most of the relationships are bluntly portrayed as dysfunctional, but what is irritating is how all the women are nagging shrews and the men are either spineless wimps or vicious thugs. Dr. Manhattan eventually brings the Silk Specter to Mars with him and despite that he started the Martian Book of Genesis while the earth is facing the end of days, all she can do is whine about her pathetic life with her eyeliner running constantly. Or there is a fictional in-universe comic story meant as a parallel of the actual story's events thrown around about a man growing increasingly insane to highlight how intense things have gotten in the real story, but this parallel story reaches its acherontic peak early in its telling and most of the later events are only exaggerated grim happenings to the point of absurdity. At the end of each chapter, a quote from Bob Dylan, Friedrich Nietzsche, or other such figures, is thrown around to emphasize the obviously dark themes of the story but all this shows is that Alan Moore is so terribly unimaginative he has to crib quotes from greater writers.<br /><br />There are times when it seems that the story is more layered than it is. The Comedian once confides that he saw terrible things that the real villain was plotting and was broken down in tears. Yet the Comedian is so bloodthirsty that I expected him to simply revel in the madness, as he took pleasure in war and killing people several times before, including his pregnant lover. Barring reacting as a sociopath, he should have been cruelly pragmatic as he always was and found a solution to the problem without much sweat. Yet instead he acts like a blubbering crybaby in contrast to his characterization throughout the entire story to show that even bad guys love their mothers. Nothing can be completely dark because then it would not have those hip shades of gray. Pollyanna would be preferable to the amount of cheese grated here.<br /><br />An early problem is that while the story starts strong, it loses steam quickly as the mystery of the Comedian's murder is cast aside in favor of a romance between two of the old superheroes reunited by said murder. They don't really do much besides commenting on how crazy Rorschach is and they don't have much in common either. Then, they decide, that, yeah, they probably should find out why the Comedian died. At times the story reaches a huge lull, with way too many words appropriate for a graphic storytelling medium as every word said by a news correspondont is written down, two new characters discussing something completely irrelevant to the plot, or just long stretches of introspection that don't really go anywhere. A serious offender is the Dr. Manhattan chapter, with an extremely tedious stream-of-consciousness style that fails to capture how interesting a look into the mind of God would be.<br /><br />But the real disaster is that either the story reiterates themes already said earlier or plausible for anyone to imagine from mere contemplation, such as that superheroes in real life would be terrible people, or that the complex plotting does not amount to much. The mystery behind the Comedian's murder takes a character barely introduced in the story with little to no personality whatsoever, and assigns the villain role with a whole, \\""You fell into my trap you fools!\\"" exposition. Quite frankly it would be more amusing if a man in a pickle suit turned out to be the supervillain instead of the actual character. Worse yet, the actual truth why the Comedian was killed involves an extremely complex and vile plan done in the service of a greater good. This is supposed to make the story realistic by having gray characters but while this is novel for comic books in the simple dichotomy of superheroes and supervillains, this is not great storytelling when compared to real books. The villain's plan is also meant as a solution to the Cold War tensions, but is so laughably childish that anyone who would peg him as a complex character is just as one-dimensional as he is. That was doubtlessly the intent, but I do not see why I had to be bored at the same time.<br /><br />And for all the darkness in the story, despite how much the world seems ready to end, the day is saved. It is obvious the world saved is not a perfect one but we do not see how distorted this it is except that a few know the bloody foundation it was built upon. Still, it's a pretty happy world. There are hints that it could collapse at any moment but none of that ever happens. That is my main problem with Watchmen. There are always hints of something that will throw the world off the edge of its seat but it never happens because something random always comes out of nowhere to either save the day, or the plot suddenly diverts to something else completely unrelated and is only mentioned again as something that is, yes, still completely bad, but nothing has happened even though it's supposed to be completely horrible. I for one wanted to see what would happen if the world ended. I think when you make God an actual character in your story taking place in the real world nonetheless, you raise the bar a little bit as to what can happen.<br /><br />At one point in the story, two characters are arguing with each other about the next course of action. One does not want to do anything while the other is trying to emphasize how important it is that they act. While arguing, the character for action suddenly remembers a past event differently and has a revelation out of nowhere about their father's real identity. Then the other character that was all for doing nothing changes gears and is ready to fight. And that's all Watchmen is. A bunch of random stuff happening.",2011-01-31
US,51660615,RXDEBFJCBJ32V,1401219268,777411096,Watchmen,Books,5,2,4,N,N,"Most profound book I've ever read","What if superheroes were real? I mean really \\""real\\"": what if they grew old and got fat, had spouses and families, carried emotional baggage (sometimes a serious psychosis), and just generally had to deal with everyday life? These super-heroes aren't inherently all good, either. Just like public servants -- police, politicians, doctors, etc. -- many begin with the best intentions, but some become jaded and others are only motivated by self-interest from the start. In other words, if superheroes were real, they would be just like us, more or less.<br /><br />Also, what would an ultra-powerful superhero really be like? A person who understands quantum theory as easily as we chew gum, and is so powerful that he can move through the space-time continuum, be several places at once, and alter sub-atomic structure with a mere thought? Can you imagine how scary it would be for a god to live among us? Someone whose very citizenship in a particular country gives that country an unbeatable advantage over the rest of the world?<br /><br />On the surface, this is the premise for Watchmen, and Watchmen was the first work of its kind to humanize superheroes this way, but it's also much more. There are good reasons this graphic novel, or comic book for adults, won a Hugo and was picked by Time magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels since 1923. (To any literary snobs out there who've talked trash about comics and the like: In your face, Dude!)<br /><br />Alan Moore made superheroes into real-life people. Then he put these heroes in a paranoid world on the brink of a nuclear holocaust, a world where a symbolic clock that tracks doomsday as 12:00 is currently ticking down to the last few precious minutes. Does that world sound familiar? It should. It was Earth circa 1980's.<br /><br />This reviewer recalls those times all too well, as I imagine most anyone who lived through the Cold War can. I was mostly just a kid then, but it still seemed inevitable that sooner or later the USA and U.S.S.R would have at each other and the world be damned. In fact, I was in the Army at the time the Watchmen comic was running, in `86 thru `87 (which is probably why I missed it then) and we were training with the Soviets in mind as our enemy. So I found Watchmen to be pretty much... terrifying.<br /><br />Mr. Moore's insight into modern society and how fragile our world is, unfortunately, rings all too true. It's enough to keep you awake at night. There are probably one or two people left that haven't read Watchmen or seen the movie yet so I won't give away spoilers, but if you take into account the time Watchmen was written and what came to pass years later, it's even a little prophetic.<br /><br />In a graphic novel, the illustrations tell as much, if not more, of the story than the words. So it's crucial that the artist realize the writer's vision and be inspired by it enough to bring the action and emotion to life. When the writer and illustrator are a perfect match, a graphic novel or comic book becomes a thing of magic. Moore and Dave Gibbon accomplished this with Watchmen.<br /><br />Even more than the actual imagery, the coloring and shading make this story jump out of the book. Flashes from lightning or explosions almost made me blink. I could practically feel the dampness of a rain-slick street. A horrifying facial expression of a character so angry that he's about to explode with violence all but makes the reader instinctively prepare to flee. Don't overlook the smallest details of each panel. They will be meaningful later.<br /><br />I have enjoyed a few other graphic novels more than I did Watchmen. But nothing I've ever read has been as frightening as the decision the characters face at the conclusion. It's the kind of decision that, if it really happened, we wouldn't want to know about. And I've never read anything that realizes life's place in the grand scheme of the universe like Watchmen does.<br /><br />I'm amazed that comics, the very medium that introduced me into the fascinating world of books, turned out to be the medium that produced the most profound book I've ever read.",2011-01-31

For that we find a brilliant work. But is it really as groundbreaking as the critics say? Maybe for the `80s...<br /><br />The story opens with the killing of the ex-superhero the Comedian. This sets the tone of the graphic novel. It's dark, sad, and bloody. Alan Moore sets us up with a plethora of characters, each unique in his or her way, and throws them and us into a mysterious plot. It's difficult to recap a 400 page graphic novel. There are many twists and turns we find along the way, each revealing a new part to the story and the characters. I won't go into detail. Suffice to say, the plot is pretty intricate.<br /><br />Since I was most surprised and pleased with the character aspect of the story, I will first address that. I really liked how the characters were introduced, and closed, and how that interacted with each other and reacted to the events that took place around them. Nite Owl, the passive, kind, easily relatable man; Dr. Manhattan, just the opposite, serving as the distant, out-of-touch-with-humanity, trying-to-please person who just wants to put everything right; the Comedian, the violent, sadistic, animalistic antihero; Silk Spectre, the sweet and attractive female; and finally Rorschach, the mysterious, dark, violent man who does what he has to do to get the right thing done.<br /><br />There are more characters that I won't get into right now. Moving on. I really thought how the characters stayed to their proper characters was great. This is difficult to do with such a large cast. Moore nailed it. Everything fit together like a patchwork quilt. Moore really brought everyone to life. I cared about their decisions, I wanted the good guys to succeed, and I even understood the bad guys and semi-bad guys and felt sympathy for them. The characters weren't only interesting as they started in the beginning; they changed and developed as the story progressed, and the changes were well founded in what already happened earlier in their lives, which tied in nicely. Alan Moore really has created a masterpiece if you look at it from the character viewpoint. There was no disappointment here.<br /><br />Now for the story. We are brought into a complex collage of flashbacks, subplots, and a riveting main storyline that contains much more than meets the eye. From the get-go we see something serious is going on. As the story progresses we are introduced to new depths through flashbacks that reveal the characters' pasts, and see how the world came to be as we see it now in the story. So much happens through the course of the book that it's almost difficult to keep track of. But the author manages to keep it flowing well enough.<br /><br />Since this is a graphic novel, I have to say something about the art. And I have nothing bad to say. The artwork isn't like the art nowadays, but it's still good. The colors are real `80s style, but it wasn't offensive. I also liked the layout and how the scenes moved along. These things really aren't the point of the s graphic novel. It's really what's going on, not so much how it is portrayed visually.<br /><br />The last thing I'd like to say is that Alan Moore really knows how to develop the world in which the story takes place. It's realistic, gritty, and is perfect for what goes on. For a world that involves numerous superhuman beings and people that accept them, it is very believable.<br /><br />On these aspects I have addressed, I'm very please with this book. But there are some aspects that I have not yet discussed.<br /><br />First of all, the story is very in-depth and deep, which I thoroughly enjoy, but I think Alan Moore takes it a step to far. At times it can get tedious and overly detailed. I didn't understand why Moore inserted certain aspects that seemed to me small, insignificant, and unnecessary. I think he should have paced Watchmen a little better. I though the interluding subplot that involved the Black Freighter didn't need to be thereeither. I can see why Moore did it, to develop the story more, but it only served the purpose of dragging it down. There is enough story as it is without more added to it.<br /><br />These things may be annoying to be only because I didn't read it when it came out as a twelve-issue miniseries. But even so, the book should be written with the same pacing as if it were one big story rather than a number of smaller segments. There were also a few bits and pieces that I felt were thrown in there to complicate matters on a lower level, rather than simply adding to the story on a grand scheme. For example, the bit with the short man in prison with Rorschach, (*Spoiler*) and the part where the woman was drawing the monster (*Spoiler*). It kind of bogged down the story.<br /><br />Another thing. (*Spoiler*) I really didn't like how Ozymanias planed to kill a lot of people. The monster was rather ridiculous. There was no mention of it earlier (only with the woman drawing the monster, which made no sense. We'd never seen her before or anything, and we never saw her again.). Basically there was an epic buildup, with and ending that fell flat on it's face. An extreme letdown. I think there could be a much better way to utilize what had already been introduced into the story. Maybe something with nuclear war like Moore had seemed to be hinting at the entire time. (*Spoiler*) Also, at the end, Doctor Manhattan did something out of character as well, which was probably the biggest letdown of all. At least, if the plot didn't end well, the characters at least should. But no. Thankfully, Moore managed to keep everyone else in order.<br /><br />Before I move on, I'll say one last thing. There was a high sexual content, which really wasn't necessary and detracts from the story immensely. And there was a lot of violence and language as well. All of this brought the whole graphic novel down a quite a few steps for me.<br /><br />Now to the defining moments.<br /><br />Critics have called Watchmen groundbreaking, genius, a landmark work, remarkable, a masterpiece, the best example of graphic storytelling ever, a classic. Well, is it? My answer to this is, yes... to an extent. And no... to an extent. Here's why.<br /><br />Something like Watchmen had never been done before Alan Moore stepped up to the plate and brought his ideas to the table. A solid story, solid characters, and a world that is realistic, vivid, and striking. So, in this way, Watchmen is groundbreaking work. In the `80s, this was something that comic book readers had never experienced. It is deep; there are meaningful characters and events that we care about. It isn't corny, overplayed, and over-dramatic.<br /><br />But what about now, 2011, almost thirty years after it was first published. Does it still apply to us now? Is it still as important? It is in the sense that the characters are still interesting, and we like the story. But it isn't quite as relevant. We are no longer threatened by nuclear war. Other graphic novels have been written and drawn that have equal depth of characters and story, that may be even more complex. The artwork now has become far better than the artwork in the past. Graphic novels can only get better.<br /><br />The reason Watchmen will survive, and I think the reason it has survived, is because we like the characters. We can invest out emotions in them for the time we are between the front and back covers, and we will still think of the decisions they made even after we've put the book down.<br /><br />To conclude, Watchmen was a groundbreaking work. It broke through the surface, and it has paved a path for other graphic novels, and, I think, better graphic novels.",2011-01-11

Comics (or \\""Graphic Novels\\"", if you wish) are not at all the same today that they were in the '80s.  They have changed a great deal, and The Watchmen was one of the early turning points.  It broke narrative down to move back and forth in time.

It also put together a fairly grim world that wasn't as black-and-white as the typical hero universe.<br /><br />In the world of 'The Watchmen', something changed in society, and people turned against superheroes.  Anyone who donned a mask and/or fought for the good guys is now either retired, undercover, has been banned.  Some capitalized on their fame, others labor under the 'blessing' of government surveillance.  The character 'Rorshach' is the plot's centerpiece:  watching from behind the scenes, Rorshach sees that a murder of one of their own has unraveled a pattern that hints at a global power play, and it is his fanatical determination to fight that helps draw back together what's left of the former team to which he belonged.<br /><br />That said, this story is not solely about him.  Instead it introduces a plethora of people--very human beneath their costumes--all of whom play a part in the final story.  Each is given intrigue and depth, and all slowly draw together to face the future.  Without giving you any spoilers, I will say that if there is one flaw in 'The Watchmen' it is a key plot twist that is rather awkward...it just didn't read well (and was handled differently in the movie).<br /><br />If you have seen the Watchmen movie, you won't see many surprises, but you will most likely enjoy 90% of this book.

A second reading a few months before the movie came out still kept it in that top spot.<br /><br />Before reading it a third time recently, I was afraid that the movie had skewed my view. I was afraid that the amazing visuals and bad acting (the film's glaring flaw) would make me see the characters in a less-realistic tone, with the exact dialogue bringing my mind back to how it was butchered on screen. And my predicted fears came true, but only for the first two issues. By the third, I fell headfirst into Watchmen's universe, feeling like I did the previous times I read it. With the hundreds of comics I've read and reread since my last reading of Watchmen, I've still ascertained that Watchmen is the greatest comic book ever produced. Watchmen is filled with so much philosophy, symbolism, and character development, that no comic book has ever reached it's level of completeness.

Pushing the envelope with what was possible in sequential storytelling, he helped bring a smorgasbord of mature themes into the fold, in an effort to produce smarter and more sophisticated comics. But that was just only the beginning of a decade of innovation and pizzazz for the comics industry. Watchmen wasn't the only big thing out of that era.<br /><br />But it was probably the biggest giant at that time, a monolith of twelve extra-sized comic book issues, complete with prose pieces at the end of every issue save the last.  Every page holds an average of 6-7 panels, every one of which packed to the gills with immense detail and excellent facial expressions, and these are panels with an average of three dialogue elements and no less. The prose pieces read like something from a novel, something to be expected from a short story. These issues were, in every sense of the word, great value for money at a time where comics were lower priced than in recent years.<br /><br />So if anyone has any doubt about Watchmen's appeal, let it be clear: Watchmen is a masterpiece of comic book storytelling. The characters have a sense of lovability, largely due to Alan's excellent knack for creating realistic dialogue. Rorschach's hard-boiled journal is one of the highlights of the entire book, as are the Black Freighter sequences. All of Alan's dialogue fabrication skills come to bear in every section of the book in fact, especially the prose pieces.<br /><br />It is hard to include prose pieces in comics because no one ever reads comics for beautiful prose. Alan took a huge, bold step in that direction by providing much of the back-story in them. But, boy, did they ever work. The excerpts from Hollis Mason's (the first Nite Owl) book are an example of prose done in exactly the same voice and mentality one would expect from the character and not something that would come from the writer itself. These pieces hold much of the struggles and nuances of superhero life, legacy, death and super-villains included. While much of the material today covers these issues in one way or another, it seemed Watchmen did it first. And if it didn't, arguments could be presented that it did those themes like no other work since. Some claimed that these prose pieces, along with the prolonged extra sequences, were dragging the book down. Wrong. It reads exactly like a graphic novel should read.<br /><br />The doomsday clock ticks ever closer to nuclear war and Richard Nixon is worried. No one really knows what will happen. But when the ending comes like a freight train, a reread seems inevitable. Simply put, this is the book to read if you are a comic book fan wanting a feast, or someone who just happened to hate comics.",2010-07-29

That is, what kind of neuroses/psychoses/emotional instabilities would trouble them? Unfortunately that premise is not enough to hold the reader's attention over 12 very dense issues. A big problem I had with Watchmen was the making up of excuses the characters deployed to justify their behavior. They are so self-absorbed and obsessed with their troubled pasts that they can't move on. I understand some people are like this, but no effort is made on behalf of the characters by the writer to stop wallowing in self-pity and better themselves.<br /><br />Another problem I had was the lack of a plot. Something is wrong when you spend more time developing the back story than the present-day plot. No sooner is a character revealed or introduced than we are treated to a gratuitous personal history. Some characters flash back to the SAME EVENT so we can see it from multiple points of view--this would be fine if the event were something worth flashing back to, but it's not.<br /><br />The entire plot turns on the hysteria of an approaching nuclear war between the USA and USSR.

As superheroes, most of these characters are not in a position to ultimately affect the fate of the human race, and this leads to frustration or apathy, and eventual alienation from the rest of humanity.  The Cold War setting could have made the story very dated, but because of the structure of the story (it's like a Tarantino film, jumping around in time and using multiple storytelling techniques), we are readily and easily drawn into the world and everything seems current.<br /><br />The plot, in very basic terms is this: the original generation of superheroes have retired.  They were costumed do-gooders but otherwise normal human beings who tried to help people by patrolling the streets for muggers, rapists, and gangsters.  The second generation became increasingly sopisticated in their crimefighting techniques (and fought in Vietnam), but were ultimately outlawed as vigilantes and had to hang up their costumes.  The Comedian, a superhero that was absorbed as a government (CIA) agent is murdered.  The outlaw superhero Rorschach (still practising but wanted by the police) investigates the murder.  Early chapters focus on the histories and interconnections between the (former) superheroes, and lead up to the point where some of them come out of retirement, convinced of the need to start working again to solve the puzzle of Comedian's death.<br /><br />Such a plot description does not do justice to the depth of the story, nor does it adequately explain Watchmen as a cultural phenomenon.

You say \\""oh no, it has pictures, that's kid stuff! I can't be caught reading that!\\"" Just relax, we'll get through this. Yes Watchmen has pictures but that doesn't make it any less a novel. In fact, Alan Moore, the primary author or the book, claims that twenty two pages of Watchmen is equal to 135 pages of text, dialogue, and description that he handed in to his collaborator Dave Gibbons. That's about one graphic page for every 6 written pages. If Watchmen were a traditional novel with full descriptions the 419 page book may have been nearly 2000 pages long! Yes, Watchmen is a graphic novel, a comic book. And, yes, Watchmen is about superheroes. But the book explores the superhero genre in a way that questions it and it does so in a very interesting and entertaining way. It defied comic book conventions, depicting very violent people and gritty themes in a time when Batman still had shark repellent on his utility belt. Watchmen explores the basic superhero archetypes from the vigilante adventurer to the near omniscient super powered man. It looks at these characters' codes of justice and tactics and attempts to make sense of them relative to reality. Watchmen asks who among us would really be willing to put on a mask and pursue this brand of justice, and why would a man with god-like abilities bother to fight crime?<br /> Watchmen depicts a set of very basic superhero archetypes; There is the enterprising adventurer, like Batman, or Doc Savage the rich, intellectual idealist who strives for change. The vigilante type like Zorro, the Lone Ranger, or the Punisher with their uncompromising, black and white view of right and wrong.  There's the  femme fatal, enticing criminals into submission. And the super powered man, the benevolent god among us, the superman sent to protect us all. Watchmen shows us these characters set against the backdrop of the cold war, a very real time in our history when the prospect of total destruction was very real. The characters become rounded as the authors shape them and reveals them as people with real issues in this terrifying world. The authors recognize the horror inherent in human nature and the idea that just because a person puts on a mask, they are not exempt from it. Some of the characters are repressed schmoes, others sexual deviants, others are narcissistic, some are just confused, and some are even sociopaths. Watchmen posits that perhaps those who would choose to pull on a mask and a pair of tights and adhere to a strict, black and white idea of justice may not be the best, brightest, most altruistic among us, but could very well be mentally and emotionally unstable. The story suggests that some may even be so obsessed with their code that they may be willing to do horrific things to achieve their idea of what is right. Even when an act of congress attempts to subvert the heroes' obsession with justice, some persist, even grow more determined. One character goes so far as to brutally murder his foes rather than hand them over to authorities and be forced to reveal his identity. Another allies himself with the US government, reveling in the opportunity to feed his hunger for violence and to be payed to do it. Still another uses his status as a former hero to gain wealth and  influence and perhaps use it to reshape society into his image of what it should be, regardless of who or what stands in his way. The authors of Watchmen boldly propose that, yes, superhero crime fighters could exist, but we probably wouldn't want them around if they did.<br /> And what of the super powered god/man? Watchmen's depiction of such a character aims to bring to light the fallacy of the assumption that such a being would naturally fight for \\""truth, justice, and the American way\\"". So often, Americans want to believe that god is on our side but would he be? Should he be? Why would a god among us care about our ideas of justice or morality?

So often, Americans want to believe that god is on our side but would he be? Should he be? Why would a god among us care about our ideas of justice or morality? Watchmen suggests that maybe he wouldn't, that maybe a man endowed with fantastic abilities would grow apathetic toward our ideals. Maybe he would grow out of touch with humanity as he begins to feel as though he is no longer a part of it or perhaps never was. In one famous line from the book, a TV program misquotes a prominent physicist as saying in response to this god-like character \\""Superman exists and he's American\\"". Later this misquoted character authors an article that is one of several articles that Watchmen's  authors have inserted in-between chapters to further develop the universe that the characters live in. In the character's article he points out the misquote saying \\""What I said was 'God exists and he's American'\\"". With this idea firmly in place, Watchmen shows just how our country and its leaders may attempt to exploit such a being, even become dependent on him. With this character, the book is able to illustrate just how dangerous such a situation might be and if a man were given such immense power, a country or even the whole world may be at the mercy of this man and his loyalty or apathy toward humanity.<br /> Watchmen explores the major characters in the world of superhero pulp fiction and attempts to give the reader an idea of the machinations of these archetypes in a real world setting. The book looks at these characters and how they have been grown and shaped out of our ideals. The authors attempt to take a step back and look at these ideals in contrast with human nature. The conclusion seems to be that ideals are nice, but you can't change human nature. And if you could give a man super abilities and change his nature, it would be futile because he would cease to be a man. It is a wonderful read and is every bit as exciting as it is thought provoking. I highly recommend this book for anybody, whether they are fans of the genre or not.",2010-03-23

It has been hailed as the graphic novel that started a revolution in comics, and I like to agree with that sentiment. I was not around when it first came out, and I only just got to reading it, but I can see why it still stands as a solid piece of work thirty years after it ended. The Watchmen is indeed a classic!<br />Where to begin? Well, let us start with the lesser of its achievements, the art. The line work is crisp and clean, the anatomy realistic, and its action scenes flow like poetry (to say the least). The character designs were set in the early eighties, so they are a bit dated, yet for the most part you feel you could meet these people in your very own city. For me, my favorite thing was the use of color - each scene oozes atmosphere, and you can tell thought and effort was put into the coloring of each panel. All and all, it is superb.<br />What really makes this different from pretty pictures, and truly a graphic novel, is Moore's writing. The man is a genius. He took something that, for years, had been dumbed down for children's consumption, and made it for adults.  After The Watchmen debuted, no one could say that superhero comics were kid's realms. It was truly what the stale comics scene needed at the time. It changed the scene - leaving a standard writers and artists continue living up to today.<br />Moore's first big achievement in The Watchmen is setting up a realistic and consistent world. Not only did he use the comic to do this, but between each chapter he would add textual tidbits - such as newspaper clippings from the story's world - to further expand the alternate reality. It draws you in, and upon a second reading makes you go \\""Oh! Now I see what he did there.\\"" Each line, each piece of dialogue, every panel is meant to further along the plot, faster and faster on to the final conclusion.<br />Then there is the recurring symbolism and motifs, something you don't really see anymore in any medium. The story makes continuous references: patterns stitch together where there once was nothing, subtly reminding the reader of what they are reading. Much of it is used to the effect of social commentary; some is there to bring a sense of unease; all of it is perfectly placed and never overused. Almost all of it is in the art, making another perfect example of why the graphic novel is such a powerful medium.<br />The most important thing, besides the groundbreaking plot, is The Watchmen's characters. Each and every one seems meticulously plotted out, their psychology slowly peeled open throughout the course of the book like a rare flower. Each character serves a purpose - each has their own motives, desires, and fears. They are memorable in their humanity. In real life, you do not see the ending before its due time, and The Watchmen reflects that. Until the final chapters we are left only guessing as to what great and terrible thing will happen to our heroes.<br />At the end, it will leave you asking - \\""Who watches the watchmen?\\""mething you don't really see anymore in any medium.

It's a heavy-handed (to the point of the author /spelling out/ the points he's making) and ultimately irritating in its lack of any real intellectual stimulation as a reward for the time required to read it.<br /><br />The issue addressed is pretty much summed up by the title -- who watches the people with power? The question itself implies almost all the possible answers. Moore does little to explore the use and abuse of power in depth. And by introducing a character -- Dr Manhattan -- who is, for all practical purposes, omnipotent, he discards the possibility of analyzing the question of the moral responsibility of power in \\""the real world\\"". Yet he misses the opportunity to compare/contrast Dr Manhattan with God, especially with regard to his/His behavior and responsibilites.<br /><br />Alan Moore doesn't /really/ understand that comic books are fundamentally visual, which is why they're so heavily populated by super-heroes and other fantasy characters. Visual media (including motion pictures) don't easily lend themselves to philosophical discussions. Had \\""Watchmen\\"" been a rousing adventure story in which the philosophical issues were the subtext, it would almost certainly have worked better.<br /><br />I was expecting something special (especially considering TIME's encomium *).

His explanation of which can be torn apart by a freshman physics major.  More frustrating was Mr. Moore's conclusion, which I have been told he wrote under the stress of D.C. demanding that he just finish.  But I believe that in the way he kills of his most interesting character in the most anticlimactic fashion, misread what a world and American response to a massive and horrifying loss of life, and elevates his least developed character to the position of the most important character of the conclusion to be unsatisfying.

One wonders what the world of \\""literature\\"" is coming to when you've got to turn to comic books to read something truly edgy, intellectually challenging, and creatively uncompromising. As publishers fill up every inch of available shelf space hoping to make millions with Dan Brown knock-offs--when Dan Brown himself was never worth reading--and an unchecked infestation of paranormal vampire romances spawned by the long-ago success of Laurell Hamilton, it's left to the geeks who write comic books to actually write stuff worth reading.<br /><br />Maybe its because comic books are written (and largely read) by misfits like myself who see the world from the margins, being ourselves only marginal. Well, whatever the reason, \\""The Watchmen\\"" is simply a terrific book, a summation, in some ways, of the last half of the 20th century in which concepts such as heroism, patriotism, good and evil, the sanctity and meaning of human life were tossed into the blender and turned into a viscous, stinking goo.<br /><br />Moore does a kind of post-modern critical analysis of the comic-ethos even as he's writing a comic-book. His superheroes are deeply flawed--sometimes downright criminally insane human beings--but they also embarrasedly aware of the absurdity of running around the city at night in cape and underwear catching bad guys.

Or is Snyder so reverent to the original novel that he does not let the \\""scenes breathe\\""?<br /><br />Ah, the book!<br /><br />Watchmen is a Hugo Award winner and one of Time Magazine's best 100 novels list.  Alan Moore, author of such classics as V for Vendetta and The Killing Joke (both books of which I loved) churned out The Watchmen, a 12 issue miniseries by DC Comics back in the 1980s.  I won't rehash the entire plot here, just to say it's an anti-hero story; heroes who started out great and then came to their end under the suppressive thumb of the US government run by Nixon and the Cold War with the USSR is an ongoing background problem.<br /><br />The art by Gibbons is freshly done; character's bodies are not overly done; the blood & guts is not too graphic, but just enough for you to feel the horror of the moment.  The child murderer who gets his dogs mutilated by Rorschach is such a scene:  Red on red, man screams, cannot say anything else but \\""Oh God, Oh God!\\""  Quite a scene.<br /><br />The articles between the scenes adds depth to the story that you cannot get from the film.  Not at all.  Excerpts from \\""Under the Hood\\"" where Hollis Madison discusses \\""the trauma of the 1950s and the emergence of the new super-heroes.\\""  Hector Godfrey's article from The New Frontiersman gives us some radical writing with such subcaptions as \\""Coked-Out Commie Cowards\\""!  Articles like this give the reader the mood, the suspense and then we dive into the characters and their travails in this unabiding world.<br /><br />And finally, probing into the character's lives really brought them to life and made them real for me.  The \\""Probe Profile\\"" on Sally Jupiter as she discusses her rape from The Comedian.  The psych file from the Rorschach.  The origin story of Dr. Manhattan.<br /><br />The book gets a solid four stars from me.  It's entertaining, great art and writing and the articles between the issues gives greater depth than what one normally sees in the typical comic book.  League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, another vehicle by Moore, attempts this too, but not to as successful degree.<br /><br />Read them up!<br /><br />Check these items on Amazon:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1848560419 Watching the Watchmen: The Definitive Companion to the Ultimate Graphic Novel]]<br />[[ASIN:B002G7E0K6 Watchmen Doomsday Clock Black T-Shirt Adult]]<br />[[ASIN:B001FB55H6 Watchmen (Director's Cut + BD-Live) [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B001QTWC0K Watchmen: Tales of the Black Freighter & Under the Hood]]br />[[ASIN:B001FB55H6 Watchmen (Director's Cut + BD-Live) [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B001QTWC0K Watchmen: Tales of the Black Freighter & Under the Hood]]",2009-12-17

DC Comics was supposed to revert the rights to the authors one year after retiring the property from publication, but that year hasn't happened--or as Alan and Dave might tell you, it hasn't happened YET.<br /><br />The movie rights are another beast.  It took two decades of wrangling to finally shoot the 2009 par for the course film.  The authors again had no control over the production, though Gibbons signed on as an adviser to director Zack Snyder.  Moore has stated Watchmen is unsuitable for film, because he and Gibbons used techniques which showcase the uniqueness of comics to tell a story.  I agree with this assertion, which is no small feat for both writer and artist, rarely accomplished with such breathtaking precision and subtlety, and on such a grand scale.  While the film version conveyed the basics of the plot and characters, the soul and depth of the story were lost on film.  Most glaringly, the ending is significantly altered in the movie.<br /><br />Moore has totally divorced himself from Watchmen, refusing any kind of credit or compensation for the work.  As of this writing, Moore hasn't seen, nor intends to see, Snyder's film.<br /><br />This entire article could easily be written almost verbatim about Alan Moore's fantastic \\""V for Vendetta,\\"" with the one major difference being Moore's total disgust with the screenplay (he thought Watchmen's screenplay was about as close as film could come).  Moore is much more careful guarding his intellectual properties these days than he was in the '80s.<br /><br />The second thing which can be said about this seminal piece of comic art, which follows easily from thefirst point, is that buying a new copy of this novel anywhere ensures Moore and Gibbons won't see the rights to their masterpiece returned to them.

I considered taking out the book soon after I heard of it, but it wasn't until I watched Watchmen in a theater once, and then ordered and watched the director's cut that I finally took the book out of the library. After finishing it, I watched the director's cut on DVD a second time, this time stopping frequently to re-watch scenes and take closer looks at details.<br /><br />Reading this graphic novel, there were three things I noticed. First, it was a fun, quick read. I found myself reading more than an hour each night, and sometimes even reading it for 2 or 3 hours in the day, and at that rate, I was finished within a week. Second, the movie was very close to the book, and it's quite possible that the Zack Snyder film is the most faithful big screen literary adaption thus made, even more faithful than some of the classic novel adaptations like The Outsiders or Huckleberry Finn. Third, it's not exactly the same.<br /><br />Reading the graphic novel, after having watched the movie twice already, I noticed subtle changes. Some little things like there being a glass divide between the prisoners and the cooks in the prison cafeteria, the slightly larger and sturdier laser that Nite Owl caries (not sturdy enough to resist a boot, though), and the less poodle-looking haircut of the older Sally Jupiter, as well as the more noticeable changes such as the slightly altered Ozymandias plot (simplified, more connected, and slightly less stupid than the one in the book), the slightly altered costumes, and the changes in pacing such as removing the unnecessary Max Shea storyline, separation of the Black Freighter storyline, the shortening of the Dr. Malcolm Long encounter (which also has the effect of increasing the character's intelligence, since in the comic Dr. Long seems almost retarded, as he initially takes Walter Kovacs' Rorschach answers of \\""a pretty butterfly\\"" and \\""some nice flowers\\"" as truth) and lengthening of some important scenes such as the final encounter of Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach. And though I'm not a diehard fan enough to list all the changes, I got the impression that about 9 out of 10 of the changes from the graphic novel to the movie were positive, sensible ones.<br /><br />The overall effect of these changes points out a key fact: The most critically acclaimed graphic novel of all time isn't perfect. Saying it's the best graphic novel of all time simply means that there isn't a better one, or at least there isn't a better one that's as well-known. In fact, I would agree that it's probably at least one of the best graphic novels of all time. The detail that went into the drawing, color and background, the written features between chapters, and the working of the story all point to a superb job done by Alen Moore, Dave Gibbons, and John Higgins. But there are many parts in it which don't make sense, are overly complicated, deserve to be cut out (some simply because the movie doesn't have the space for everything, but many more because they weren't that important to the original story to begin with), and some parts that were just plain mistakes. And thus, I would say that the movie actually DESERVES to be the way that the general population learns about the Watchmen. In fact, I think the movie deserves to be canon more than the original novel deserves to be.<br /><br />TV tropes has one trope which it named \\""Adaption Distillation\\"", when a work is shortened to fit a new medium, and in the process, much extraneous material is cut and some errors are corrected, creating a work that's better than the original. In my opinion, that description fits Watchmen perfectly. With the simplification, beauty, movement, acting, and other changes of the movie, the original graphic novel starts to look less spotless by comparison (kind of like a button with liquid blemishing its surface), not to mention the decay as the book ages, not only the physical decay (new or mint copies can be found, but the majority of the ones in circulation are very old. The one in my library was first checked out in 1990), but as history continues to erase some of the assumptions that the novel was founded upon (most importantly the founding assumption of the inevitability of the US/USSR conflict ending in nuclear war, which obviously never happened in reality).<br /><br />Alan Moore famously refused to see the movie Watchmen after it came out, and had little to no hand in its production. Many assumed that was because he feared the movie would not turn out well. It turned out he did not have to fear such an outcome. Instead, now he has good reason to fear that his 35 year old comic will be rightfully replaced in the public consciousness (and be seen by millions more people than would ever have even known about the graphic novel) by a movie which distills and improves upon his original work. So, I would still recommend reading this book, because it stands up well in that it's still a very enjoyable read (plus it's interesting if you're curious about the genesis of the movie, and curious about what was changed). But know that this book has more errors and is less concentrated than the Zach Snyder movie, and that its time and influence as a graphic novel is waning.",2009-09-09

The genre took another step when Stan Lee wondered how a teenager with the proportionate strength of a spider would deal with the challenges of adolescence.  With \\""The Watchmen,\\"" Alan Moore pushes the genre even further.  What happens when superheroes wrestle with a morally ambiguous world?  Deal with mental illness and depression? Grow old?  How does the world react to a hero who is seemingly omnipotent?  What are the social, political and cultural ramifications of heroes in tights?<br /><br />Following these issues to their ultimate end is what makes \\""The Watchmen\\"" classic.  The multiple plots and the endless allusions make for dense reading, but they are done well.  The authors understand the conventions of the medium, and they stretch them.  They create a world that is rich and textured.<br /><br />That being said, the graphic novel is very dated.  I can understand why the movie didn't do well at the box office.  The market in 2009 for movies about an alternative 1985 in which Richard Nixon is still president must be pretty small.  In the book, the Cold War and the threat of nuclear war dominate ever page.  The ever present threat of death and destruction pushes society to the point of neurosis.  \\""The Watchmen\\"" outlines the transition from the moral clarity of the early superheroes to nihilistic confusion.<br /><br />This descent is probably what bothers me most.  The underlying assumption of the book is that there is no purpose or meaning in life.  All of the major characters accept this worldview without question.  No one in the novel stands for an objective reality.  As the Comedian demonstrates, fighting for truth, justice and the American way is laughable.  God is dead, yet the novel does not celebrate.  There is something sorrowful and regrettable that moral clarity has no foundation or basis.

I really enjoyed the concept of masked comic book type heroes who, with one exception, don't have actual super powers but are regular men and women - physically well-trained, intelligent, and also flawed and troubled, with different neuroses and compulsions.  My favorite is probably Rorschach, a complex well-developed character enlivened with little quirks, often presented with a strong streak of dark humor, and also given an unforgiving childhood and background.<br /><br />Watchmen never got bogged down in all its characters; their connections to one another were often presented in surprising and even startling ways, and there are moments when you realize that something was hinted at or foreshadowed in a seemingly casual bit of dialogue or minor illustrative detail.  The humor, often dark and ironic and even tongue-in-cheek, works well (there's a good deal of irony in Watchmen, used effectively).  I also enjoyed the story-within-a-story of the Black Freighter - the writing there was particularly strong and vivid, and I liked how it ultimately ties into the major conspiracy and plot at the heart of Watchmen.<br /><br />Watchmen's not without its flaws though.  When the central conspiracy/plot was revealed I found its execution and details too outlandish for suspension of disbelief, even though I did think the broader themes and idea behind it were compelling.  Another weakness lies in the character of Dr. Manhattan.  When you're confronted with a character like Dr. Manhattan, imbued with such super powers and capable of so many things, whether reconfiguring matter or teleporting to far off places, you find that the use of his powers becomes inconsistent and arbitrary; these powers are readily available to forward certain plot elements or contribute to certain details in the story's wider world, but then there are other plot elements or world-details that could also have been influenced or changed by those powers but never are, for no obvious reason except that the writer didn't want the story to go in those directions.  I much preferred the characters to operate on a more limited, but also more interesting, human scale.<br /><br />Still, I'd recommend Watchmen to other readers.  It has interesting things to say about human nature, human intentions and limitations, and though I thought the large-scale politics and the geopolitical landscape were a little too simplistic, I enjoyed the development of each character's individual worldview.",2009-08-17

Then I heard it was the only graphic novel on Time's 100 best novels of all time. And then when the movie was coming out I finally read it. I'm really impressed. For one thing, I found it hits on philosophy's three main kinds of questions:<br />1) What's reality or being? A central figure, Dr. Manhattan, has whole sections where he wonders explicitly things like \\""Who makes the world?\\"" (Ch. IV, p. 27, in my hardcover 2008 ed.). And elsewhere, he philosophizes on the wonder that \\""in each human coupling, a thousand million sperm vie for a single egg,\\"" to \\""spring this precise son; that exact daughter\\"" (Ch. IX, p. 26).<br />2) What can we know? (The very structure of the multiple narratives going on at the same time made me wonder at times \\""Is this really true right now?\\"" and I was often unsure whether some particularly devastating events, like all the death and destruction, had happened in the story or now.) And then there was an explicit take on establishing knowlewdge, \\""This is not to say that we should cease to establish facts and to verify our information, but merely to suggest that unless those facts can be imbued with the flash of poetic insight, then they remain dull gems; semi-precious stones scarcely worth collecting. ... Until we transform our mere sightings into genuine visions... until then we may have a hobby, but we shall not have a passion.  ... This gradual tarnishing had gone unnoticed, unchecked, finally calcifying into unthinking habit. ... my mind reduced to blankness by the various concerns of the day\\"" (Ch. VII, p. 30).<br />3) How do we choose right from wrong, ethically? Wooh, this one's a doozy, as every character is flawed fundamentally, none is a hero really, save maybe one female \\""mask,\\"" as the watchmen are called. A central question after all is \\""Who watches the watchmen?\\"" making you wonder, \\""And why do they need to be watched?\\"" In a rare moment of emotive vulnerability too, one character laments, \\""Theyre dead. They can't disagree or eat Indian food, or love each other... Oh it's sweet. Being alive is so damn sweet\\"" (Ch. XII, p. 22).

Such cool devices, like the visual zooming out from a closeup, with ever wider insight in the narration at the same time.

The story itself was hard to get into because I was concentrating on these things, but once it got started, it really got started. I think I got hooked right around the part where Dr. Manhattan's character gets more to do (basically, when it started being slightly more character-centric). The majority of the book is action-centered, but there are some fantastic moments of character development (whole story arcs for several of the characters, giving them psychologically deep stories behind the actions that become crucial to the plot). The two most intriguing characters to me were by far Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan. One with too much to feel, the other with nothing. The minor details the characters were given, such as distinct speech patterns, made all the difference. The end fell apart. Once all the character development was done, it was all action, action, action, and the big reveal at the end made no sense to me. Fantastic set-up with really well-rounded characters, and it all falls flat on its face near the end.

Indeed, one of the greatest `novels' of the 20th Century according to Time magazine.  Well, I think Time was being a bit generous, but THE WATCHMEN certainly is deeper than what one will normally find in the genre, and one can certainly spend time in less interesting pursuits than reading the twelve chapters that bring everything together.<br /><br />Set in an alternative American history in which costumed adventurers have given the U.S. an edge in the Cold War, but are viewed with deep suspicion and ambivalence by the public, THE WATCHMEN explores the psychological horizon of such heroes against the backdrop of a familiar, if altered, history.  When a few adventurers are killed or in some other way neutralized, Rorschach, a deeply disturbed renegade, starts pursuing what he believes to be an intended plot to kill former masked heroes.  He enlists the help of Nite Owl, his old partner, who views his past adventures as the immature manifestation of a largely wasted life.<br /><br />The truth is far more complicated, both personally and politically.  Alan Moore, The Watchmen's creator, uses the genre to explore terrain that, although more meaningful during the height of the Cold War when the Soviet Union still existed, is not completely outdated today.<br /><br />History, however, has not been exceptionally kind to the interpretation of this book.  In fiction, the world's smartest man, despite years of reflection, cannot escape the conclusion that the two world powers, given their trajectories, will ultimately come to blows and destroy the world.  As someone who came of age in the `80s, I remember this perspective as all too common back then.  But events proved this view wrong.  We just needed Ronald Reagan, who recognized the inherent weakness of communism and exploited it until it imploded.  Reagan's mark on the world stage makes large chunks of THE WATCHMEN basically superfluous in retrospect.<br /><br />Further, although Moore portrays one of two clearly right-wing characters as morally degenerate (The Comedian) and the other as, for lack of a specific diagnosis, borderline schizoid (Rorschach), it takes the left-wing, pyramid worshiping, vegetarian to wipe out millions out of his `concern' for mankind and in pursuit of his utopian vision.  What a hoot!<br /><br />Significantly over-rated by fans of graphic novels, no doubt to convince themselves that the genre is meatier than it really is, THE WATCHMEN is nonetheless an interesting read.  Moore took the superhero story into unexplored territory and wrote an interesting story while out there.  Just don't believe all the hype.",2009-06-15

Moore paints a bleak alternate reality in which so-called superheros seem to have done more harm than good, driving a world which was already teetering on the edge of chaos closer to apocalypse. These vigilantes range from being slightly naive and altruistic, like the two Night Owls, to psychologically disturbed and vengeful, like the Comedian and Rorschach. One individual -- Jon -- has become so removed from his humanity via the machinations of science as to have little emotion left at all.<br /><br />These \\""superheroes\\"" aren't really heroes, but that seems to be part of the point. While many start out with good intentions, they come to realize that their heroics aren't fixing the major problems which are bringing the world closer to apocalypse: while they catch purse-robbers, the arms race chugs on. But does this make their actions meaningless? And what is the moral price of solving these bigger problems, and is it worth paying?<br /><br />Moore addresses all these questions through his characters, some of whom have given up on the world, and others of whom still see its potential for good. The search for any kind of meaning in life is something which all the characters, even the background characters who fill the streets of New York, are trying to find. By the brutal and morally dubious climax of the story, I wasn't sure if Moore was trying to say that such a search is ultimately meaningless in-and-of-itself and that means are ultimately justified by their ends, or that, as the Earth is always heading toward apocalypse, committing despicable actions in service of preventing such an event iis never justified.<br /><br />Regardless, the last scene presents a blank slate: the Watchmen cannot be expected to be humanity's saviors, because they are as flawed as those they are protecting. The human race must make the collective decision to save itself -- its all in our hands. This is certainlyan unsettling ending, but it fits the unsettling tone of the rest of the story.

It was too much pseudo-science and cheap philosophy for me.<br />They say it's easy to create an overwhelmingly powerful character ,what is hard is to create an amusing, quirky, appealing one.<br />I agree to a certain extent. It's very hard to roleplay a very smart character, whose intelligence far exceeds the writer's. And Moore had an epic failure here. I could buy the cliche explanation for Manhattan's origins (accidents, as always), but I would never buy an almost omniscient being fighting in Vietnam - specially NOT as a giant blue godzilla - or being unable to automatically win the Cold War. Come on, he could teleport to Russia and kill soviet leaderships.<br />If he cared about all this (and he ceases caring at a certain point, which i appreciated), he would, instead of playing Mr US Military Puppet, self-declare world leader and unite the world, materializing food out of thin air and using his powers to aid humanity.<br />When you want to create a godlike persona in a realistic world, you must be able to convince the reader. And Manhattan's science, philophy, intelligence, and, most important, motivations, are dull and unbuyable.<br />The God Ex Machina gran finale, then, is a complete shame.<br />Despite all this, I liked Watchmen.

Sure, I can imagine impact, put it in comparison with other schools of comics, with other great authors and so on, yet I still find actual experience quite unimaginable. Digital age brought together with itself numerous scans of older American comics, stuff for which you would pay thousands to read, unless you had someone in your family that collected them back than, and one is free to browse trough this library as one sees fit. When you see first issues of Fantastic Four, Spider-man or Green Lantern (or any other hero for that matter), one cannot but feel touch of nostalgia for \\""good ol' days\\"" and simplicity of it all. Shiny costumes, rigid moral code and bad guys who wanted to destroy the world or steal some money from some bank. Collosal galactic battles came after.<br /><br />Moore used all of this. Being a passionate consumer of a genre, it was easy for him to draw references, to cite American and British comics (much like Tarantino does in filmmaking), and during that process, to deconstruct a genre, creating a myriad of followers, readers and authors, who continued on his path - creating bleak, depressed heroes, which battled issues of an \\""ordinary life\\"". Suddenly, shiny costumed vigilantes leaped out from hands of the youngest and landed into the world of grown-ups, world where straight division line between good and bad couldn't be drawn. Watchmen screamed \\""look what can be done with a simple premise\\"", and in that screaming it drawed attention to itself.<br /><br />Yet, as someone has already written here, time went on, and age of the Watchmen started to show (rather quickly one should say). In twenty years from its appearance we witnessed many great comics that surpassed watchmen on many levels. But point is, these comics weren't of the superhero genre. Genre authors drawed from Moore, as Moore did from the earlier era, and we were able to observe making of new language in superhero stories. Yet, as advanced as it may be, Watchmen remained within the boundaries of the genre. When compared with other texts, especially with \\""European school\\"" and American underground, texts that featured braver, radical or simple topics, Watchmen started to leak. It's language and it's problems showed itself as staged, overly constructed, and it's characters became somewhat cloaked manifestations of simple ideas. What Watchmen told in over two hundred pages, some of the books managed to tell in less than 48.<br /><br />Today, there are far better stories, thematically more concise and far better drawn, yet Watchmen still remains actual. As far as Cold War was a fiction, so is Al Quaida today, which once again puts theme of Watchmen back into the spotlight. Still, as an art form, Watchmen are seriously outdated and, in all of it's complexity, relatively simple. They should be remembered as a starting point of a new language in superhero fiction, should be remembered as a proof that comics aren't kids stuff anymore. But that is as far as it goes.

But with the film adaptation finally here and all of the chatter about how important and superb the graphic novel is, I decided that it was time to see what all of the fuss is about.  As it turns out, it's not that much.<br /><br />First of all, I do not frowm upon comic books or graphic novels and dismiss them as inferior to other works of fiction.  I have a small comic collection from when I was younger, but I never really got into the whole comic scene that much.  That being said, I appreciate a great work of fiction regardless of what genre it comes from.  It's just that Watchmen isn't all that great.<br /><br />Watchmen is innovative, all right.  It took the graphic novel to a whole new level proving that the genre could be artistically significant.  Its characters are very human, despite their superhero backgrounds.  It takes on ambitious and complex themes and stays grounded firmly in reality.  It taps into 1980's cold war paranoia and is bleak as all get out.<br /><br />Yet I suspect that many critics and fans have placed the novel's innovativeness and landmark qualities in front of it's actual entertainment value.  That happens quite often with works of art.  Is it too much to ask for something that breaks new ground to also be fantastically entertaining?<br /><br />The plot of Watchmen, which deals with costumed crimefighters who have been ostracized by society, is bogged down by too many characters and too many themes.  It feels a bit overwhelming and largely unsatisyging at the same time.  None of the characters feel real.  It seems that Moore has worked extremely hard to force them to be three dimensional and complex.  Each of them feels too plotted out, their motives and actions dictated by the writer.  The result is a collection of characters who never really feel real or emotinoally accessible.  It's all too neat and tidy, despite the fact that everything is supposed to be messy and complicated.<br /><br />Still, it's not terrible.  I admire the ambition and I appreciate what it did for the graphic novel as an art form.

I think I started somewhat in the middle of the story and was a little confused as to what was going on and who each character was and what the motives were.  Reading it all the way through, I can see the potential for confusion just jumping in.  There were a few times where the various threads were a little confusing, but generally everything is presented in a very interesting and accessible way.<br /><br />The artwork and the story line are wonderful.  I really enjoyed the organizational style of the book.  At times it felt a little soap-opera-esque in that there were three or four fairly core story threads all happening simultaneously and the narrative bounced around quickly between them.<br /><br />Through the presentation and organization, I was able to determine the mystery antagonist early on.  And yet, even knowing who was responsible, I couldn't put my finger on the motive or exactly how everything was going to play out.  The story has sooo many elements working together and playing with one another.  When everything came together, I was definitely shocked and surprised by the motives and the way the finality was organized.  I also felt that most of my questions were answered but that there were still a few loose threads I'm not quite sure about.<br /><br />Still, in one of the stranger and more allegorical threads, it ended with a line something like \\""I have to keep re-reading everything because I don't understand what happened.\\""  To me, I found that particular plot thread to be a metafictional commentary on the plot of the book as a whole.  By ending it in that way, I think the authors are telling me that they expect me to come away confused on the first reading, but to get more insight with subsequent reads.  And looking back in my mind at the material I read, I can see where that could be true.<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed this story.  I've really enjoyed most everything I've read from Moore.  Hisstories are creative and thought provoking.  Sometimes a little more extreme than I might ordinarily seek out, but I still come away from his books with new thoughts in my head.  I'm still bummed that the movie got an \\""R\\"" rating.  I can see where the director would have liked to have pushed for the \\""R\\"", but at the same time, I can see where some conscious choices could have kept it at a solid \\""PG-13\\""  (I personally feel that the novel itself is closer to PG-13 than R, but that could be the desensitized Okie talking).<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of those graphic novels that deserves the accolades it's received.  I can't necessarily recommend it to everyone because I know there are those who will be put off either by its theme or by the media (...those who say \\""it's just a comic book\\"").  But to those who are willing to stretch their reading opinions and their sensitivities, I definitely recommend this book.<br /><br />****<br />4 stars (out of 5)",2009-04-21

I lost interest with the volume on Dr. Manhattan. He's just plain old boring. The parts that concern him feel like they were written by an unsure college freshman who is trying to sound philosophical. Tedious is more like it.

Sure, it is a \\""graphic novel,\\"" but the story, artwork, and story-within-a-story are fabulous.

In addition to being blue, he has the ability to teleport himself and others, to see the future, and more. The story begins with the death of one of the Crimebusters, The Comedian. It then moves along as an investigation of the murder by one of the remaining members of the group, Rorschach, who discovers a plot to kill or discredit the remaining Crimebusters. Interspersed within the novel is the story of The Black Freighter, another graphic novel, that adds an interesting perspective on the main story.

It's stupid, childish, totally outdated, and takes itself far too seriously. It is a comic book trying way too hard to be literature, and failing miserably.<br /><br />There is one statement of truth on the back cover of the book: \\""The would-be heroes of Watchmen have staggeringly complex psychological profiles.\\"" This is the one saving grace of this otherwise completely unworthy effort. The problem is that author Alan Moore (whose other credits include V for Vendetta) chose to examine these \\""staggeringly complex\\"" psyches through a hokey superhero prism. There are tons of comic-book in-jokes and what I think are actually veiled statements about adults who read super-hero comic books -- which is sort of funny, I guess. But just when I would get back into the book, I'd be rudely reminded that I'm a adult man -- a father -- reading a comic book, and it would jar me out of my enjoyment of the characters.<br /><br />Now some other problems: I read through Chapter 1 fully enjoying the book, and then I got to the bonus material at the end of the chapter. In this case, it was excerpts from the \\""tell-all\\"" book one of the characters wrote. How completely boring, pointless, and lame! The amateurish prose shows why Alan Moore should stick to comics and why this most certainly is NOT one of the 100 greatest novels since 1923! Three or four chapters in, I stopped reading this bonus material -- which cut my reading time practically in half -- and just roughly skimmed it, never finding anything of interest or value when I did. Similarly, there's a kid reading a comic within the comic -- a pirate story -- throughout the first eleven chapters of Watchmen. Sometimes this goes on and on for entire pages, interspersed with dialog taking place in the main story. This got confusing and, again, pointless, so I stopped reading it, too.<br /><br />Now let me get to the heart of the matter; the ridiculous plot. Some mild spoilers may be contained herein, but I'll try to be good: This was written in 1985 and takes place in an alternate 1985 -- wherein Richard Nixon has been re-elected time and time again (constitutional amendment and everything) and the U.S. is still at the verge of war with the USSR. Only, in this alternate 1985, the U.S. won the war in Vietnam -- with the help of \\""Jon,\\"" a god-like super being. The idea presented here is that Jon is the only thing stopping the U.S. and USSR from initiating World War III, and indeed, when Jon decides to vacate Earth for Mars, tensions mount and the nations begin preparing for war...<br /><br />Do you see the problem here?<br /><br />In real life, there was no Jon. How can taking Jon away make war inevitable when there was no Jon in real life? Maybe I'm missing something? And secondly, Jon can see the future, and yet the authors lacked the prescience to see that Communism was doomed to fail... The USSR wasextinct within five years of this book's publication, and thus nuclear war was not statistically inevitable -- anyone who'd ever read Mises's [[ASIN:0913966630 SOCIALISM]] would have known this. As one final, lame joke, Robert Redford is supposed to be running for president in 1988 -- \\""but nobody would want a cowboy-actor for president\\"" -- hardy har har.<br /><br />Finally, I'll take a swipe at the art. Have you ever seen a CrossGen comic? If so, you'll realize there's nothing special about the art in Watchmen. Very mediocre.<br /><br />In summation, I guess I'm glad I read this \\""top 100 novel,\\"" just so I can say, definitively, that it's not. But unless you have a similar goal, or you're just a comic-book nerd, reading Watchmen will be a waste of your time.

I decided to take a chance and read the book.<br /><br />I haven't seen the movie, but I don't see how it could hold up compared to this brilliant piece of fiction.  The plot is not the main purpose of the series; it is about the characters, the people, and that is where the book shines.  These are REAL people in an alternate world, who choose to dress up in silly costumes and be \\""heroes\\"" (until the one real Superhero shows up).<br /><br />The exploration of good and evil, of actions and consequences, of people being lonely and trying to make connections, are all explored.

The biography \\""Under the Hood\\"" excerpts, advertisements, police reports, newspaper articles, etc. scattered through the book add to the traditional comic portions.<br /><br />In short:  If you enjoy great fiction, whether or not you read graphic novels, read it!

The artwork is exceptional and the story is one of the most original and different for a comic/graphic novel. It is geared more for adults since this isn't the usual kiddie comic book. That is what makes it so popular no doubt. I think most comics today are more for adult taste anyway. If you've never read Watchmen before then I highly reccomend it.

There are real situations explored in the Watchmen that to this date may not be completely acceptable in how we see masked avengers and super heroes. Nevertheless, the real unraveling yarn here is the exploration of the different pasts shared by this fraternity of masked heroes; and how their lives have played together and apart for better or for worse. There is real character development here that should not disappoint.<br /><br />Speaking of disappointments, my only complaint would be the rushed ending: the god in the mechanics that appear without real explanation as to how (expect they were indeed [note sarcasm] developed by the Smartest Man in the World) everything was executed so easily, with such devastating use of high technology... However, the outcome, the logical outcome of the weird deus ex machina was quite the unexpected twist.<br /><br />I recently saw the remade film The Day the Earth Stood Still, and there is a matter of observation spoken within: something along the lines of man often does his best when on the brink. Since hearing that, I have noticed its sad truth and perception. The novel Watchmen does just that: throws a huge mass of individuals into the brink, and because of that, the impossible--for this alternate timeline--happens.

I'd hate to attend a party with him -- he seems to be a rather pretentious, grim bloke who wants to prove that he's the smartest guy in the room.<br /><br />Also, while this stands head and shoulders above most American comics (especially anything else DC was publishing at the time), I had a lot of trouble seeing what was so revolutionary about it.  It's not the only example of dense, multilayered storytelling from the time (though I will admit it took it to a higher degree), and the techniques, while unfamiliar to comic book readers, had long been used in film and literature.<br /><br />My advice to potential readers:  Borrow a copy from a friend...then shell out the money for your own copy if you really like it.",2009-03-29

Much seems contracted and redacted in the story.  Some of the more striking scenes appear lifted from other sources.  The burlesque and vaudeville work alongside the \\""smart bully\\"" style story, with interludes of gracious prose and reference.  As a brief commercial treatise, the entire flow as presently given can be seen as a pleasant failure among the waterfall of global entertainment failures.  I can say it is pleasant because a few blonde tramps seem to adore the book.  I can say it is a failure because I didn't get laid by them.<br /><br />Our present Moore probably wants to write significant stories of grace and seems bored and hassled with the more furious pulp styles.  No doubt his pulp magazine subscription has expired, but this does not decrease his power with the rarely occurring elongated prose passage.<br /><br />Watchmen is a graphic novel that directs satire at the naive politics of old comic book adventures.  The approach used seems rushed to me, somehow impatient, or perhaps there was greater business afoot at the time.<br /><br />One might be caused feelings of regret because the meager space permitted in this graphic novel.<br /><br />At present tense, Moore is most capable at extravagant literary asides that are pleasing to the wit.  When violence and sex become foremost, he panders just as Rice and Barker sometimes do, using silly plot devices and insipid character development.  However, when it is a question of mannered imaginative prose, he approaches the issue with dignity and capability.  In this, he is reminiscent of Clive Barker, Anne Rice, and (to a very limited extent) Bukowski.<br /><br />Moore is not truly one who authors action adventure in the high style of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Fritz Leiber, or Robert Howard.  Moore is a quiet gentleman of letters and literature.  Moore should be permitted his writing desk, ink pot, and quill.  Otherwise he might puke allover us next time.  Ah, there's the fellow, there's the lad.<br /><br />Gibbons is a traditional comic book artist and a dramatic artist too although the color sometimes obscures the splendid line interaction.  An economy of gestures are used in image while still maintaining a sense of fullness in the depictions and eye catching \\""sufficient realism\\"" in each panel.  The approach Gibbons has to face and posture of characters makes the comic book into a silent opera: the gestures are operatic, the facial expressions are stiff, the jaws tense, the musculature rarely relaxed.  Again, the colors are bright and almost dizzying.  An effect is achieved: it is confusing, yet Gibbons manages a perfect beauty in placement.  Gibbons is a pretty.<br /><br />As to the cover: I seem to recall similar paintings in a gallery, with many different colors of spirtle and background and disc.  This might have been before the comic book issues that lead to the graphic novel.<br /><br />One wonders if this graphic novel is a particular bulge that formed in mist that shall soon vanish.  Let us hope neither Moore nor Gibbons vanish soon.  Gibbons is too darling and well put, Moore is kicking the dirt clods out of the path so he can be Queen of the May along a route.",2009-03-24

The heroes are either ineffectual (Nite Owl), deranged (The Comedian and Rorschach), above it all (Dr. Manhattan), or rife with neuroses (Silk Spectre, mom and daughter versions both).

I can't imagine what it was like to have read this work when it was first released.  After walking out of the film having put this comic off for over a year to not ruin the most highly anticipated cinematic experience of 2009, I felt like I'd been hit by an atomic bomb.  All of the praises and hype and glowing reviews over the most celebrated graphic novel of all time did not prepare me for a story that layered, epic, and DARK.  I bought the comic the very next day.  I paid double what Amazon was charging for it at my local mall to avoid an excruciating 3-5 day wait.  I'd put off the legendary work of literary genius long enough.<br /><br /> Back to my original point, now.  \\""Watchmen\\"" was obviously conceived as an all-out assault on the costumed heroes we grew up idolizing.  A human story with larger-than-life characters who at the end of the day were not only flawed like you and I, some of them bordered on downright pathetic and/or psychotic.  Gluttony, Lust, Envy, Sloth, Wrath, Greed, Pride; all are well-represented among the \\""heroes\\"" of the dystopian  alternate 1986 where the story takes place.  Hell, some might say they are the stars.  But as jaw-droppingly bold as that premise alone was and is, that is barely the beginning.  \\""Watchmen\\"" is an absolute tour-de-force of creative artistry, brilliant structuring, and amazing writing.  Alan Moore does not mess around.  Whether blowing up Parliament in a future totalitarian Britain, dissecting hookers with Jack the Ripper, or crippling Batgirl with a bullet to the spine, this is one author who NEVER  holds back and only needs one color to paint his desired picture of the world: black.  And this is his hands-down masterpiece.<br /><br />I won't bore you with details of the story that most everyone knows by now, but what I will do is regale you with but a few reasons why I love this book.  Rorschach opens the story with a noirish monologue in the form of a journal entry that is to die for.  Angry, spiteful, bile that makes Travis Bickle look look like the world's biggest optimist spills out from the blood-covered panels, letting you know without saying so that Superman don't live here and Batman is a big, mushy wuss.  And in a way, Rorschach is the heart and soul of this book.  \\""Even in the face of Armageddon.  Never compromise\\"" are the words he speaks, andthey sum up the attitude Moore must have had when he conceived this story.  And there is no motto I respect more.  At the end of the day, this comic is not just a deconstruction of costumed superheroes; it's a deconstruction of our entire race.  An invitation to gaze into the abyss and know the darkness of the human heart, while still valuing it's worth.<br /><br /> While I love the abundant nudity, dazzling look, and violent action of the film, the comic shies away from focusing on cheap thrills and rather pulls you into it's world and makes you a citizen of it.  There is absolutely sex, violence, nudity, and fantastic imagery in the pages,  but it is often intentionally downplayed in favor of more intellectually immersive endeavors such as ending each of the 12 chapters with famous and darkly relevant verses of poetry and including reading materials from the worl of \\""Watchmen\\"" both integrated into the story and as spacers between chapters/issues.  \\""Tales of The Black Freighter\\"" is a  comic within the comic that one character can be seen reading while other characters talk about the state of the world in the background.  One almost feels as though he is peaking over the child's shoulder and reading this bleak and twisted story while people discuss the world's imminent collapse around him.  How you relate this tale of woe within the larger tale of woe to the primary narrative is up to you.  It may be the single best reason to pick up the graphic novel even if you saw the movie and don't necessarilyread comics.  I suspect the latter will no longer be true once you finish \\""Watchmen\\"".  This is one of the shining examples of what the medium can accomplish.<br /><br />Each of Moore's characters in \\""Watchmen\\"" serves as a classic archetype.  Archetypes he willfully destroys.  Rorschach is the classic hard-boiled detective with a traumatic past, like Batman if he were to go off the deep end and become a savage avenger instead of the troubled hero.  The line is a thin one and only a fictional character could tread it for so long.  Silk Spectre II is the classic woman who resents her mother's firm guiding hand and her attempts to fulfill her own dreams through her.  And then there're the daddy issues.  Naturally, she seeks sanctuary in male \\""companionship\\"".  Obvious?  Yes, a bit, but throw in a crime-fighting career and the cliche takes on an interesting new wrinkle.<br /><br /> Enter Doctor Manhattan, who will be playing the role of God in this work of fiction.  No, not exactly, but the metaphor is absolutely there.  With all of the limitless powers bestowed upon characters like Superman and Silver Surfer it's interesting that no one ever took this aspect to it's logical psychological extreme before this.  Complete detatchment from humanity and eventual apathy towards humanity is the only destination for one who can see across the universe and backwards and forwards in time as we can see up and down our own street.  The Big Picture, as it were.  And what are we all in the big picture, folk?  That's right!  Less than microbes for the win.  Manhattan's cold declarations that life is a meaningless phenomenon when compared to the chaotic artistry of the universe is an amazing thing to read.  And frightening in that it is quite possibly true.  But Moore does end up throwing us a bone and does it by celebrating the wonder of individuality from a scientific perspective.  Now that's what I'M talking about!  Rorschach may be the book's black heart and soul, but Dr. Manhattan is it's most brilliant device.  Add a megalomaniacal corporate genius willing to pragmaticly weigh millions of lives against billions with no regard whatsoever for individual rights and you've got the best contrast in a whole book full of contrast.  Lastly, I'll drop some love for The Comedian, who's laughter is the true face of the war heroes we so often celebrate as aculture.  People whose job it is to commit the most vile of atrocities in the name of politics.  I like to think of him as Moore's answer to Captain America.

There's so many things I love about this book that I don't even know where to begin. I guess I'll just list them out:<br /><br />-I like how Moore presents you with all of these different characters with different viewpoints and lets you choose who you want to side with.<br />-I also like how Alan Moore weaves together all of these different ideas, like how he mixes real life events into this alternate time line where superheroes existed.<br />-This book really uses the comic book medium to its full potential. Alan Moore's scenes are just so incredibly well thought out and Dave Gibbons is just so adept at getting in all of those little details. There's so many little things I didn't pick up on the first time I read this. When I started reading this the first time, the art didn't really connect with me. I think after I read the first chapter I realized just how amazing it is. I don't know how to explain it. Everything just looks really perfect. Gibbons has a really nice style and just nails every scene.<br />-Unlike a lot of other superhero comics, you can actually have some sort of emotional investment in these characters. Partly because they're more realistic and also because you know that they can actually die and not be brought back.<br />-The Absolute Edition and all current editions of the book have been recolored by original colorist John Higgins and I have to say he did a really great job on this. The original colors were a bit too bright and a little sloppily done. The colors here have been cleaned up and are more subdued.<br />-And, of course, you know, the story and characters are awesome.<br /><br />When I think about it, it is really just amazing that this comic even exists. I don't understand why people always compare this to The Dark Knight Returns, which came out at the same time. To me, Watchmen is a much better book. Watchmen makes you think; Dark Knight Returns makes you think about Batman (but don't get me wrong, I still think Dark Knight Returns is very well done).

Not many out there will agree with my assessment: I found that, even though Watchmen presented a thorough and fascinating reflection of American culture through a fantastically-detailed alternate reality, the story itself is dry, teetering unsuccessfully on the edge between comic book and philosophical detective novel, and the characters are, to me, with perhaps one exception, generally hallow and annoying.<br /><br />Somehow the deep moral consideration of the characters didn't come across as either believable or profound for me.<br />What I saw was a bunch of people in hokey costumes presenting gradations of perspective on being \\""heroic\\"" in a world that forces them to be simultaneously anti-hero and hero, never one or the other.

I was a teenager who had graduated from the innocence of Superman, into the more troubled existence of Peter Parker, and then to the continuing crisis of the X-Men born in a world that refused to understand them.  But I was ready for something else, something even edgier.  The \\""Have a Nice Day\\"" smiley-face that appeared to have blood running down its surface on the cover of Watchmen #1 beckoned.  I bit and stuck around for twelve issues.<br /><br />The author of this masterpiece, one Alan Moore, is a paranoid left-winger (See V for Vendetta, for example), but the man can write.  Perhaps the character people remember the most from the Watchmen is Rorschach, a man in a hat and trenchcoat who covers his face with a mask of ever-changing ink impressions.  Rorschach has no superpowers or even the genius and equipment of Batman.  He is a man determined to set things right and is uninhibited in his willingness to do violence to wrongdoers.  Rorschach was once a more conventional hero, but he has seen too much evil in the world and is no longer prepared to accept limits on his retribution.  This vigilante, full of retrograde opinions and mourning for an America whose best days are behind her, is Archie Bunker without the laughs.  Rorschach walks along a street in the red-light district and notes that he is offered French love, Swedish love, and other exotic pleasures.  But American love, he regrets, \\""is like Coke in green glass bottles . . .  they don't make it anymore.\\""  He is dangerous.  And he is Moore's idea of a conservative.  If it is intended as an insult, it is one most of us can live with.<br /><br />While Rorschach stands out, the rest of the cast is also memorable.  We have The Comedian, a former masked crusader with a dark past who now does dirty deeds for the government.  Ozymandias is like a Bruce Wayne who has decided to go public and cash in on his former exploits.  The Night Owl is a genius who turns technology and desire into heroism, more like the Bruce Wayne we know and love.  The Silk Spectre is a heroine because her mother was.  She's been taught how to fight, but it was as much for publicity and commercial possibilities as it was for fighting bad guys.  Doc Manhattan is a demi-God after surviving a nuclear deconstruction of his cells.  He is tempted to rise above the concerns of mere mortals.<br /><br />All of them live in an America that has formally outlawed the independent activities of masked heroes as a response to public resentment and suspicion.  What brings them together is a murder.  Someone seems to want them dead or out of action.  At the same time, the world is consumed in a larger drama of nuclear confrontation.  The Cold War is running hot and tensions may boil over.  Doc Manhattan is not sure whether he cares.<br /><br />This is the backdrop for one of the most compelling dramas ever enacted in comic book form.

This book covers so many layers of humanity and issues- it is THE comic book to read.<br /><br />Still, after reading alot of the discussions on this site about the book, I gravitated towards the negative reviews to see why people would not appreciate the work, because in my opinion this is a piece of work.<br /><br />Rather than detract or defend the criticism, I feel like tossing my own two-cents into the mix over analysis and deconstruction, seeming as this is pretty much the point of Watchmen, and stating in my humble opinion why I feel that this book deserves the praise and adulations.<br /><br />First and foremost, the point-of-view of the book is Moores; and this seems to be the point of reference for contention that most people have by way of the novels nihilistic construction. Through Moores vision is the world constructed, and this in and of itself is why the novel is good from its start- good storytellers are able to infuse in their works with their views, and create an atmosphere that resonates completely within the scope of that outlook. In this, the entirety of the series does, whether you appreciate the atmosphere, bleak and seemingly apocalyptic, or not.<br /><br />Still, the point of this entire series is a question.The basic question presented by Moore is Why do we, and should we venerate the concept of Hero[ yet 'Hero' here is more broadly to be taken than simply superhero, indeed it is all 'authoritarian' or even, 'moral' personas]? It would have been boilerplate material if an author had chosen to present a single hero, or superhero, doing daring-do's and who in secret committed acts that questions the outcomes of his actions. What Moore did was to dissect the concept of hero into discrete, manageable constructs- that is, different characters, each possessing different driving forces as to their vocation of superheroing. The extremes of each of these characters are the glaring extremes of the traits and qualities of heroes- courageous, loyal, champion, etc. However, by way of these various characters, he was also able to seep into each the reasons behind these virtuous markers- the dual natures of and driving factors of these lauded traits. For example, the vigilante, who can and is romanticized as a rule-breaker to set things right, is himself a victim of wrongs, poisoning all his actions with the question of redemption. So too are the characters who possess great insight into logic and rationalization- to what extremes of logic and analysis should and do we choose to accept? Or even the more humble, thrill-seeking, adventurous, and amorous natures that drive a hero towards gadgetry and costume capering- these affairs of passion and chivalry are at their core poisoned by the very natures of what it means to be human and the need to break the mold of the ordinary and mundane. Yet, in each character, mundane and commonplace seems to be the eternal web from which they are all caught in, and as humans, they will inevitably remain. It is this, the breakdown of the motivations of characters, of the worship of supposed heroes', and veneration of traits seemingly extraordinary that Moore begs us to question.<br /><br />What's more, each character is infused with different aspects of macro-societal concepts as well. Whether it is the death of bravado and a steady decline of a nation, or the emergence of the worship of science, and its subsequent susceptibility to indifference, or its longing for simpler ways, or attempts to stare into the abyss, despite the chaos that may commence- all of it is harmonized and told against a critique of society with such concepts as state, science, and the individual.<br /><br />In this then, each character is fighting a battle both on a personal level, and a societal level.<br /><br />As for the artwork, it blends well with the story itself, gritty and straightforward.<br /><br />I don't necessarily agree with allthat Moore posits about the nature of humanity and the brutal outlook of action, and pathos that he paints.

If I could, I would give it 3.5.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the entire read through. I was absolutely riveted and read it in a day and a half. But I always ask myself a few questions after I finish any kind of book -- would I read it again? Do I regret reading it, even if it gave me a good ride? Was the payoff worth the effort... in short, was the content rewarding enough to justify reading for hours?<br /><br />In the end, I'm glad I read it. I needed a good read and a book that didn't speak to me like I was an idiot. I can also appreciate mastery when I see it -- these characters are so real that I feel I could recognize them if I saw them on the street. In fact, this is very much a character-driven story and is, ultimately, where this graphic novel excels. Frankly, after reading so many books with characters as thin and flimsy as notebook paper, I can't tell you what a relief it is to read about characters as substantial, well-crafted, and richly complex as these. I did not read this graphic novel to find out about the plot; I wanted to know how each character was going to handle their personal crises.<br /><br />But, although I am glad to have read it, I'm not sure I would ever read it again. There's a point where the \\""theme\\"" of the book got so loud, so pretentious, that it broke the magic. When a theme starts to swagger about, throwing its weight around like it's the king of the roost, it inevitably begins eclipsing story and character (and as the characters are so excellent and added so much to the theme without even trying, it seemed a sad choice). Quoting Nietzsche and Bob Dylan is fine and dandy, but often it seemed like Moore was saying, \\""Look at how much I know! I'm high-brow; I'm in on all of the important books on the high-brow reading list.\\"" How best to put it?... it's like Watchmen couldn't stand on its own two feet. It wanted to shore itself up with philosophical catchphrases andthe thoughts of other men instead of saying, \\""This is what I believe. This is my worldview. This is what I really am.\\""<br /><br />I feel that I am not on target with this -- not completely -- but suffice to say, the theme was too heavy. It needed to relax. Themes are like a fine perfume. Too little, and the story is cheapened; too much, and even the least asthmatic gags and chokes.<br /><br />For example, at first, the \\""Black Freighter\\"" subplot is a marvelous diversion and really spices up the story. It added yet another delicious layer to Watchmen, which I relished. However, after a while, I began to hate the \\""Black Freighter\\"" chapters. Why? Because I got it. I got it after reading the first installment. Why did I have to keep reading about it? It only rehashed the same idea, and after a while seemed only to be included for the sake of shock value. I wasn't interested in this half-baked story with its over-the-top message and its one-sided character; I wanted to read about Rorschach and company.<br /><br />Another con is the darkness of this story. Yes, there is darkness in this world; that's understandable. But to deny that there is brightness in this world is foolish, too. It's sad to me that the only bright and cheerful character in this story is painted as blind and rather stupid (honestly, who would think that Rorschach saw \\""a pretty flower\\"" in his ink-blot tests?). There are also few uplifting moments.<br /><br />The plot itself has been seen a thousand times before, and if it was not for its shining cast, it would not be remembered. To add insult to injury, it ends in a most ignominious fashion.<br /><br />(Spoiler Alert)<br /><br />A giant mutant squid explodes on New York.<br />Really.<br />A giant mutant squid with a psychic's brain explodes on New York, sending out horrifying brain waves that make people go insane. That is an acceptable ending for this otherwise excellent tour de force?<br /><br />The problem is thus: this book builds itself up as a completely sensible world directly correlating to our own, with characters that are completely realistic. The masked vigilantes are billed as real people, just physically fit and trained people, with no supernatural powers to speak of. The technological advances of this world seem sensible, what with Dr. Manhattan. Dr. Manhattan is the only quirk in this sensible, logical world, but we can accept him; we can stretch our belief enough to contain him. That's because he's the only aberration on Earth, and most people react sensibly upon seeing him -- they can't understand or accept him. We don't understand his rebirth, but it's possible not even he understands it. He's a hiccup in the laws of physics; that's okay. I can take a hiccup.<br /><br />But an otherwise normal man catching a bullet in his hand and a mutant squid being teleported to New York only to explode on impact and shoot psychic brain waves at people?<br /><br />To imply that a man can catch a bullet and that there are psychics implies that there are above-average human beings along the lines of Dr. Manhattan, and made me wonder if I had missed something in the first chapters of Watchmen -- were these costumed vigilantes actually, really superheroes? No, they aren't. Which only goes to show that this ending was no more than a deus ex machina, and a comical one at that.<br /><br />Even more comical is the fact that someone who is supposedly the most intelligent person alive thought it was the obvious choice to solving the world's current problem, and the supposedly brilliant Dr. Manhattan accepts it with a wry smile. Now, that is a stupid and unsatisfying ending! This issue only ties in with the problem of Watchmen's overbearing theme: is there substance underneath the armchair philosophy? Would anyone in their right mind think that exploding one mutant squid is going to make everything better? Even if you did get to pursue this plan of making the people of Earth think that an alien attack was imminent, how would you keep it up? Who would continue your little plot after you died? Would anyone that intelligent, with that kind of knowledge of history, really believe that such idiotic activity could lead to everlasting peace?<br /><br />Here's the problem: humans are transient and selfish by nature, and they never learn from history. History will tell this to you over and over again until it gets hoarse. There will never be everlasting peace as long as there's something to squabble over. Nor is there ever an easy answer to anything. Thus, when Watchmen finally ends, all neatly tied up in a bow, it's silly. It does not feel like the world has been saved or even that world politics have reached another plateau; it feels like the world is seconds from destruction -- either from nukes or an overzealous \\""protector.\\""<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong. Although I harshly criticize some of Watchmen's elements, I would recommend this graphic novel. It's an intelligent and fun read. The characters are sharp and realistic and make the read worthwhile. The story fumbles in the end, but it's riveting otherwise. Read it, and make up your own mind about it.",2009-03-02

Originally published as a series of twelve issues, the compiled series was one of the first to be called a graphic novel, along with the famous Dark Knight series by Frank Miller. The simple change from comic book to graphic novel was coupled with a darker and more realistic look at traditional comic subject matter - superheroes - and has led to widespread recognition of the literary merits of the medium.<br /><br />Watchmen is set in an alternative timeline late 1980s and revolves around the lives of a group of superheroes. While most of these crusaders are regular people who wear costumes to fight crime anonymously, there is one character with genuine superpowers - Dr. Manhattan - whose simple, impossible presence  has led to a vastly different world. America firmly won the war in Vietnam, Richard Nixon is still president, and the Cold War rages more fiercely, if more unevenly. The plot centers around these heroes now living in and attempting to cope with a ravaged society that has rejected their help, even when they still feel compelled to give it. This intricate world and wide cast of characters are revealed slowly throughout the novel, so richly detailed that new discoveries continue to appear on multiple read-throughs.<br /><br />Watchmen explores themes of violence, sin, justice, and the impulse to do right. This was one of the first comics to turn the superhero mythos on its head, questioning if heroes in any guise more help or harm societies. The art is detailed and incredibly expressive, with dark, moody colors, giving the story life and immediacy. In that it deals with superheroes dressed in silly costumes, has a male-dominated cast with a few attractive and scantily-clad females, and is bathed in violence, it holds to traditional comics, but it takes these aspects and turns them inside out, sharply critiquing each while offering a host of other issues, political and moral, to wrestle.

Is this 'the greatest graphic novel\\"" of all time? That can only be determined by each indivudual or through a voting process. For me, it certainly ranks in the top three. The artwork for the time stood out from the rest of the comic industry and the characters are recognizable as some form of DC Comics regular characters. Comparing the artwork to current comics, yes it has fallen behind but there's something deeply nostalgic about it still. I think the writing is overrated but still several notches above most recent contributions to the industry.<br /><br />The evolution of the masked adventurer / crimefighter presented here is interest enough to get you into the story. There are elements I could have lived without such as the sub-story double talk of the Pirate Comic but without it would the book have truly been hurt? The interaction of the characters and the plot twist reveals push the story along. You'll obviously like some characters more than others and the ending... well, initially I didn't like it but I understand how it is probably better this way.

It is a grim and unpleasant place. When you pick up this story, you are immersed in this world as immediately as if you did a dumpster dive into the urban human mind. I sought in vain for someone in the story that was likeable. Most of the major characters (and there are many) are angry, violent, paranoid and unstable. Nevertheless, it is a well done dystopia. The story is interesting, the suspense builds steadily, and if you can follow it, you will be hooked. On the mood scale, this work felt more downbeat than The Dark Knight. That seems to be the latest Hollywood zeitgeist. This story is bound for Hollywood, in spite of Alan Moore's protests. Of course, Alan Moore protests just about everything. Maybe that is why his imaginary universes are so dysfunctional.<br />The graphics are uniformly excellent. The reader should examine them closely, because they contain a lot of the story content. This is not a novel for the visually impaired. At times, the amount of information is overwhelming. I began to feel like I do in the aisles of a big box store.<br />There are often two or three storylines going forward simultaneously.

Close to Perfect!","With all the hype surrounding the movie coming out (March 2009), I had to get the source material. After all, it's only the \\""most celebrated graphic novel of all time.\\"" I had to find out for myself why.<br /><br />It only took a few pages. That's how long it takes before you forget that you're reading a comic book. You're enveloped in a murder mystery on a grand scale. You're in a world that bears a striking resemblance to our own, yet is just not quite the same. The characters are rich, complex, and jump off the page. Soon you feel as if you're a part of this new world. You feel a burning desire to look forward in the book, desperately wanting to find answers. But you stop yourself because you don't want to spoil the amazing story that is being laid out in front of you. You ache to find out...who killed The Comedian?<br /><br />The principal characters are much like us. Ozymandias, Rorschach, Nite-Owl, Silk Spectre, and The Comedian are relatable, fallible, and possess no superhuman powers. They are not the \\""super\\"" heroes you're used to. Dr. Manhattan is the only exception, having omnipotent powers that are without rival. Their story takes place in 1985. Costumed crime fighters have hung up their tights. The threat of nuclear annihilation is strong as the Cold War strains the relationship between the United States and Russia. In the midst of this global angst, there's a killer on the streets. And that killer is targeting mask-wearers.<br /><br />Alan Moore ([[ASIN:140120841X V for Vendetta]], [[ASIN:0958578346 From Hell]]) demonstrates a prowess that I've never seen before in comic books. So much so, that calling Watchmen a comic book seems to be a disservice. This is literature. Moore aptly weaves both past and present together into tightly wound yarn filled with symbolism and metaphors. Textual excerpts from books, newspaper stories, and documents are mixed into graphic storytelling to create an infinitely compelling package.<br /><br />Watchmen comes so close toperfection, it actually saddened me to watch the ending unravel to a point where I was once again reading just another comic book. It feels rushed and like Moore was in a race to tie up loose ends. In doing so, it devolves into a somewhat hokey mad scientist conclusion that was both unsatisfying and mildly irritating. Had I built such high expectations during the book that it's climax could not possibly live up to them? Possibly, but the fact remains. Without spoiling anything, it frustrates the reader because the Cold War actually ended without a shot being fired...severely nullifying the punch Moore was trying to pack. Had Moore waited a few more years before starting the book, would there be a different resolution? I'd be interested to know.<br /><br />Despite its somewhat dated elements and subpar finale, Watchmen is an amazing piece of work. It definitely belongs on any must read list. The over-sized hardback is truly a great presentation and enhances the art of Dave Gibbons. Included are notes from Moore on the world and its characters, of which were originally going to be extensions of old Charlton characters, like Captain Atom and Blue Beetle. He explains the change in direction that had to be taken after learning that he could not use these old characters and how he molded them into new ones. There are also interesting bits of art, sketches, and script work to finish it off.",2009-02-07

Because I'm so out of the loop on comics, I didn't know what a turning point the \\""Watchmen\\"" series was for the comic book industry until I heard about it on the History Channel.  Now with the movie coming out in March, I thought I'd finally give the source material a try.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />It's important to note straight off that these are not your father's comic book heroes.  What \\""Watchmen\\"" did when it came out in the mid-80s was to make comic book characters REAL--or as real as can be expected.  The \\""costumed adventurers\\"" depicted in the series are not in it for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.  They have varying reasons like psychotic obsessions, family pressure, fame-seeking, or just plain old curiosity.  Most of these \\""heroes\\"" might help you if you were being mugged or trapped in a burning building, but don't expect them to help old ladies cross the road or give a lesson on civics to a 3rd grade class.<br /><br />The story begins in 1985, a very different 1985 from what you might remember.  For one thing, Richard Nixon is still president and American won the war in Vietnam thanks to the costumed adventurers, most notably Dr. Manhattan, a god-like being who is blue and pretty much do whatever he wants to matter--including making it disappear.  (Another difference is that thanks to Doc Manhattan electric cars were invented in 1960, thus global warming is not so much of a problem, nor are rising oil prices.)  Only Dr. Manhattan and an aging mercenary known as The Comedian (like a sadistic Captain America) are still allowed to fight evil by working for Uncle Sam.  The rest are all forced into hiding.  Most find other jobs while some, like the obsessive Rorshach, continue to operate at risk of prosecution. (The premise of superheroes being outlawed was later used in the Disney movie \\""The Incredibles.\\"")<br /><br />One night, though, The Comedian is found dead in his apartment.  As Rorshach investigates the case, he begins to see a conspiracy at work and not only because he's paranoid.  Someone is out to eliminate or marginalize all the costumed adventurers.  But who and why remains a mystery as the world teeters on the brink of Armageddon with a Soviet incursion into Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Can the \\""heroes\\"" find out what's going on and put a stop to it?  With the USA and USSR turn the earth into a radioactive cinder?  Tune in to find out.<br /><br />I have to say, for a comic book (originally published as a series of 12 and now packaged together into a novel) this was fascinating.  It's not just one slugfest after another between heroes and villains.  The narrative not only goes into the mystery and conspiracy, but it delves into the backgrounds of the characters and includes interesting sidebars, notably a comic within the comic about an evil pirate ship of damned souls that makes the Black Pearl seem like a Carnival fun ship.  The comic within the comic fits into one of the overreaching themes of the book, which is: do the ends justify the means?  And as is frequently scrawled on walls in the book:  who watches the watchmen?<br /><br />Unraveling the various complexities and symbolic elements of this would take a long time, and I doubt I could nail them all own.  Suffice it to say if you think comics are kid's stuff then you are dead wrong in this case.  This is a comic for adults with adult situations like rape, impotency, and other stuff you certainly won't see on Saturday morning cartoons.  \\""Watchmen\\"" was one of the first books to really focus solely on the adults and revolutionized the industry.  Its influence is still felt today in movies like \\""The Dark Knight\\"" that strive for a more realistic approach to those costumed adventurers.<br /><br />That is all.<br /><br />(BTW, as I have no experience with graphic novels there's nothing I can say about the artwork.

It is a political work of art riddled with original stories and characters.

As things progress and unravel we begin to sink into the lives of various superheroes with all their tics and problems and phobias and disorders slowly coming out into the open, learning along the way that they're not always super and they're not always heroes.<br />And then the medium itself begins to twist and take on other forms.

Comic books and graphic novels, until The Watchmen, rarely ever stray from this eternal struggle between good and evil. Set in 1980s New York City, The Watchmen brings a new perspective into the psychology of the superhero. The novel tells the tale about a group of vigilantes, who are desperately needed, as they mature from average human beings into people with elevated senses of themselves. The novel grapples with good and evil unlike any prior graphic novel. The band of \\""superheroes\\"" begins to hesitate as the world implodes around them. The fantastic book even intrudes into our own reality.<br /><br />During the height of the Cold War and the brink of nuclear war, the now defunct band of vigilantes is faced with an imminent apocalyptic threat. Though, this group, which had rescued its corrupt world many times before, feels obliged to rescue it again, the members have matured. They begin to question the necessity of their help and doubt their abilities to achieve any fundamental change in society. We soon realize that the characters are merely human as they question their purpose and being. The story crescendo's with a debate between two of the Watchmen about whether humanity should consume itself or should the group intervene and possibly prevent this catastrophe.<br /><br />This story provides a uniquely, insightful window about what human beings would do with unnatural power. It even questions humanity's dependence, or faith, on forces that are invisible and larger them themselves.",2009-01-16

No doubt Moore helped pave the way for those who would take comic books to greater heights, exploring the medium's potential to its fullest.<br /><br />I'm not sure TIME MAGAZINE put THE best \\""graphic novel\\"" on its list of Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century.  Without a doubt, the collected volumes of Neil Gaiman's SANDMAN would be more worthy of inclusion...same for Art Spiegelman's MAUS.<br /><br />I've read all three (WATCHMEN, entire SANDMAN series & MAUS) an equal number of times.  With SANDMAN and MAUS, I always discover something newly unknown and magical with each repeated reading.  With WATCHMEN I tend to see more of its warts & flaws with each reading.<br /><br />Gaiman and Spiegelman have an ear for poetic prose and dialogue.  By comparison, though dense and laden with many words, Moore's style of writing is often so verbose, as though a lack of brevity will equal a profound statement.  It doesn't.  Often less is more...and this is a lesson that Moore, even after all these years, has yet to master.<br /><br />Finally, when dealing with writers such as Neil Gaiman or Art Spiegleman (and there are dozens of others whom I could mention, but felt it simpler to limit comparisons to these two accomplished writers in comics), one feels that they often bring out the nightmarish and horrific in order to shine a light on what is, essentially, the better angels within humanity.<br />And both writers DO enter into dark & disturbing terrain.<br /><br />By contrast, one gets the feeling that Moore sometimes pontificates on the importance of humanity as a cheap vehicle to go full guns into his disturbing mind and world.  Acts of grace...when they occur in Moore's work...seem to exist only to remind his readers that the world is not entirely one of no god, no hope, no future.  However, if given his way, I get the feeling that Moore would happily skip the better angels of humanity and would dwell entirely in the abyss.<br /><br />After having lived with WATCHMEN for over twenty years, it is a flawed, bloated and pompous work...more an exercise in histrionics rather than a work that sheds anything new on humans (be they costumed, with super-powers, or otherwise).  It does not hold up nearly as well as the works of Gaiman or Spiegleman.  TIME magazine picked the wrong token graphic novel to include in its 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century.<br /><br />When I read MAUS, I wish that I had Spiegleman's knack for pathos and natural dialogue.  When I read Neil Gaiman's SANDMAN (or just about any of Gaiman's work), I wish that I had Gaiman's extensive knowledge of myth, archtypes, religions, symbols and literature (as well as his eloquence in both narrative and dialogue).  When I read Alan Moore (whether it's WATCHMEN or V FOR VENDETTA or LOST GIRLS)...I pretty much find myself forever grateful that I'm not Alan Moore.<br /><br />I don't mind that Moore tackles disturbing topics.  More than anything, I resent when Moore...with all the people skills of a misanthrope...exploits tender human situations (which, in Moore's hands, feel completely void of any sincerity/empathy) for the sole purpose of making his bleak, nihilsitic vision all the more potent.<br /><br />We get it, Alan...the world is a place where there be dragons.  It's why you seldom leaves you small town in England (and will do your research through books rather than ever visit the settings with which he writes with the false authority of a self-appointed expert).  Fine, Alan.  Just leave the goodness and grace of humans out of your tomes.  Humanity and grace serve a higher purpose than the way you exploit them...as a vessel to merely offer a dichotomy/diversion to the demons that drive you.<br /><br />What's written above would also apply to Frank Miller...<br /><br />Gaiman/Spiegleman and Moore/Miller...one may as well say \\""the sacred and the profane.\\""",2009-01-04

The first half of the story is primarily composed of the histories of many of the main characters (each of these earlier stories is structured in a very similar style to an average episode of \\""Lost\\"" and it is not surprising that one of the recommendations on the back cover of my copy of \\""Watchmen\\"" comes from one of the co-creators of \\""Lost\\""). After that, much of the next quarter deals with the personal relationships between the superheroes. It is only in the final quarter that the main story really comes to the fore. I understand that one of the reasons why many people consider this to be a great novel is because it does deal with the histories and personal lives of these characters, but I personally felt that they were overdone. Nine comics of this sort of material was just too much for me.<br /><br />When the main story, about a conspiracy to bring about a major disaster (which I won't go into details about, so as not to spoil it), does come to the fore, however, the story improves greatly.

Fans of graphic novels coming to Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' text for the first time are going to be surprised at how uninspired the artwork seems, especially when set against the kind of brilliant artwork of more contemporary comics or graphic novels.  So many of the pages are laid out in static, nine-panel sets that the pages sometimes take the feel of the intro credits of \\""The Brady Bunch.\\""<br /><br />And yes, _Watchmen_ puts the novel in graphic novel.  In places it reads like a Mamet play, and it lingers more on the psyche of its super-characters--their phobias and sexual peccadilloes--than on their physical prowess or superpowers.  How moviegoers to the new _Watchmen_ movie will react to the superhero film version of \\""My Dinner with Andre\\"" remains to be seen.<br /><br />Despite its failings, Moore and Gibbons' work deserves to be lauded.  For one thing, I can't think of a novel outside of Delillo's _White Noise_ that better made me feel as if I were back in the mid-80s.  Even with Nixon still holding the presidency in the alternate timeline here, this book captures the fear and dread of the Regan years--the still-real fear of atomic destruction and the dread of economic malaise.

I had of course heard about it for years, but it took the amazing trailer for the upcoming movie adaptation to prompt me to pick it up. For those of you unfamiliar with it, the Watchmen is a self contained superhero comic series that came out in 1986. Along with Maus and the Dark Knight Returns, it revolutionized the comic book industry of the 1980's and paved the way for the darker, more adult graphic novels we have today.<br />Watchmen takes place in an alternate 1985. The superheroes are very down to earth, in fact only one can claim what we would consider `real' superpowers. The rest are the second generation of masked vigilantes. When we join the story, few are still actively fighting crime largely due to an anti-vigilante law passed in 1977. The plot moves effortlessly between the past and present. Minor details in the panels hint at the differences between our world and theirs such as America winning in Vietnam and Nixon running for three terms. Moore is examining what effect superheroes would have had on things like the cold war. Technology is more advanced than in our world largely due to the one real superhero, Dr. Manhattan who can manipulate matter and energy on an atomic scale.<br />This is a much grittier world than what we normally find in superhero comics and the frank sexuality and violence is not for the squeamish. Think more Miller's Sin City than Iron Man. Check this out as a groundbreaking adult comic with a labyrinthine plot and amazing artwork packed full of hidden gems and detail. For example in chapter 5, Fearful Symmetry, each page mirrors one later in the chapter in both layout and content, when you reach the middle the mirror images intersect. Mirrored image motifs are hidden in many of the panels, for example the half visible Aoxomoxoa Grateful Dead poster in two different panels. Each chapter has a similar motif that can be found in many of the panels and each tie into the larger story and mystery.<br />The movie comes out in March 2008.f the panels and each tie into the larger story and mystery.<br />The movie comes out in March 2008.",2008-12-09

I also come to this review in the post Dark Knight era, an era in which complex troubled superheros is not as new or intriguing as it probably was when Watchmen first arrived.  I also come to this book a generation after the Cold War ended.  In that context, Watchmen risks being an important historical landmark for what it did for the genre in the mid-80s, but of little relevance today.<br /><br />So, what does a book of this nature have to offer?  It's still an incredibly well crafted story.  The first time through, though, I struggled.  I was counting pages until the end.  It seemed to labor on discordant aspects that didn't make sense until I knew the bigger picture.  The second time through, knowing where things were going, I could appreciate the various parts a whole lot more.  I still didn't like the fact that they took the easy way out and did the \\""villain monologue\\"" at the end.  I was waiting for The Incredibles line, \\""You caught me monologuing!\\"" to come up.  For such a long and complex story, there was plenty of opportunity to convey this sinister plot more effectively.<br /><br />But what this book in its historical context does is shed light on a sliver of time and human nature in ways probably never intended by the authors.  When this book first came out, the fears expressed by the characters about the Cold War going very hot were palpable.  The world was at risk of imminent destruction.  A lot of what people were feeling within was probably reflected in these pages.  I found it all rather excessively alarmist and reminded me how often throughout history we've thought the world would end.<br /><br />Yet, this very context provides an interesting insight into human nature.  The actions taken in the end were horrific but justified by the major characters.<br /><br />What is intriguing is juxtaposing this story's ending with how it played out in the real world.  For all the doom-and-gloom about human nature in this book, the humans involved in the REAL Cold War that were targets of this rage proved ending it without a single shot fired.  Who could have seen that coming in 1985?  Such a graphic novel would have been seen as too idealistic at the time.<br /><br />So, yes, this book is dated.  Its impact today is far less than when it first came out both as a breakthrough in genre and a reflection of the national mood.  But this novel's brilliance lies in the fact that, as the perpetrator of the final sequence asked for reassurance that he did the right thing, so too did I begin to wonder whether the atomic bombs on Japan were a \\""necessary evil\\"".  We did it, so we all assume it was necessary just as these characters did.  Yet, seeing this violent fantasy ending juxtaposed with the real peaceful ending made me wonder.<br /><br />If a graphic novel can compel such questions, then surely it is worthy of a read, even if its impact is not what it once probably was.",2008-12-08

Basically we have a set of back stories illuminating the lives of the heroes, mixed with intercut 'documents' and an overarching narrative concerning a putative plot to eliminate the heroes so that some grand, dark event can occur without their interference.  To summarize would be to spoil.  Suffice to say, that all of the narrative lines converge, an event occurs and the aftermath becomes the subject of controversial reflection.  As the main narrative proceeds, a second narrative parallels it (from a comic book read by a young bystander within the principal narrative).  The interplay between these two narratives is central to the final resolution, in my opinion, but I can't describe it without spoiling the principal narrative.  The architectonics of the plots are very impressive and engaging, though the greatest amount of attention is likely to be focused upon the aftermath of the 'event' and the degree to which one 'agrees' with it.

You must be unintelligent, a graphic novel noob, or you just don't understand the history of comics.<br /><br />Say whatever you wish because I did not enjoy Watchmen.<br /><br />Since college I had a friend constantly try to get me to read the graphic novel.  He knew that I liked stories told through any medium and that I would give it an open-minded reading.  Eventually I decided to take the plunge, after all, if Time Magazine has it listed as one of the 100 best novels then it must contain some merit.<br /><br />Let me first say that I understand how important this piece is for modern comics.  Watchmen was the first story to really dive into the deeper side of being a good guy hero and the not so much black and white but gray area in which the real world operates.<br /><br />Historically it is very important, but simply being historical does not warrant the intense praise that it is receiving today.  I'm afraid it doesn't have the impact now that it did in the 80's.  The story type has been improved upon and stories like \\""The Dark Knight\\"" will be compared to it unfairly, but compared nonetheless because it's fresh in people's minds.<br /><br />The majority of the graphic novel is character development, which in and of itself is not a bad thing, but the story just falls flat in the end.  The mad scientist has the good guys in his lair where he reveals his evil plan for influential control of the world's future.  Even then you don't really feel a connection to any of the heroes which causes a further disconnect between the reader and the story.<br /><br />There are plenty of positive reviews touting the stronger sides of the comic.

I had never heard of Watchmen before and all I kept reading was, \\""most celebrated graphic novel of all time\\"", so that added to the intrigue.  Who were these characters?  Why had I NEVER before seen any merch, Saturday morning toons, ice cream truck popsicles even!?!  I had to find out.  I started looking it up online.  First it began with buying the iTune for Smashing Pumpkin's 'The Beginning is the End is the Beginning'.  Then I hit the fan sites hardcore style until I finally found the official Watchmen movie site.<br /><br />The site contained abridged plot schematics of each of the 12 books.  I didn't want any spoilers, I wanted the MEAT of the story!!  So I decided to buy the whole thing.  Mind you, I'm a comic book fan just like the next guy, but I had never actually purchased my own books before.  I was the guy who had friends with boxes full of them that would either recite them to me, or drop the geek guard long enough for me to flip a few pages at a time, but mostly I got my dose of the scene from cartoons and tell-tale.  The fact that this book supposedly was THE book that shaped modern comics as we now know them, also helped in the decision to finally buy my own books.<br /><br />I plunged in, and hard!

The costumed heroes first appeared in the 1940s and a second generation showed up in the '60s.  None of the heroes had \\""powers\\"".  That is, until Dr. Manhattan, a scientist transformed by radiation into a super-being, able to control atoms at will.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1985.  The Cold War is still casting its shadow over everyday life.  With the aid of Dr. Manhattan the U.S. was able to win the conflict in Vietnam and Richard Nixon was able to extend his Presidency into the mid-1980s.  Masked vigilantism has been outlawed by the government and the former crimefighters have adjusted to normal lives.  But global events keep the people uneasy.<br /><br />WATCHMEN is a mystery story.  An ex-hero is murdered, but why?  And by whom?  As one crimefighter tries to find the answers, the plot thickens and a conspiracy unfolds.  The story is presented in twelve chapters, each one bringing the world closer and closer to doomsday.<br /><br />WATCHMEN is acclaimed for its complex character psychologies and its philosophical undertones.  In fact, I first learned about this book from another book, SUPERHEROES AND PHILOSOPHY.  In WATCHMEN, we see how the world might react to costumed vigilantes and we get to see how such heroes think.  Why do they choose that life?  What motivates them?  How do they see the world and what would they do to save it?  Do they have the right to do anything?<br /><br />Dave Gibbons's art is very good, too.  Many panels must be studied to find little details that add to the overall density of the story.<br /><br />Great work though it is, WATCHMEN is not for kids.  There's some subject matter that would not be suitable for children.  Plus the complex story and philosophy of it all would likely go over their heads.

But did it really have the impact of Art Spiegelman's \\""Maus,\\"" which was first published in 1973 or even Gil Kane and Archie Goodwin's \\""Blackmark\\"" (1971), arguably the first \\""graphic novel\\"" published in the U.S.?<br /><br />And did Moore succeed in creating a comic book \\""Moby Dick?\\""<br /><br />First let's explore the narrative. \\""Watchmen\\"" is a dark story. It captures the pre-apocalyptic fears of modern American and Western Europe in the mid-to-late 1980s as the Cold War rhetoric between the Soviet Union and United States was at its highest since the Bay of Pigs. The novel is in its essence a questioning of authority - especially of government and traditional institutions. That's why the question: \\""Who watches the Watchmen?\\"" appears throughout the novel.<br /><br />The story centers on a group of masked adventurers in an alternative universe to our own 1980s (one in which Nixon remains president). The \\""superheroes\\"" are, in fact, regular human beings with no real powers - other than extraordinary physical conditioning and mental acumen. Doctor Manhattan is only character with superhuman skills as a result of a scientific experiment gone wrong.<br /><br />The novel opens with the murder of the Comedian (Edward Blake), one of the costumed avengers affiliated with the CIA and other secret government agencies. Rorschach, a second costumed hero, who refused to give up his vigilante lifestyle even after the U.S. government outlawed costumed heroes in 1977, investigates the murder.<br /><br />Through the investigation, the novel enters the lives of the various costumed heroes: Nite Owl (a first and a second version), Ozymandias, Captain Metropolis, Silk Spectre (first a mother, then her daughter), Doctor Manhattan, the Comedian, and Rorschach. The characters are all flawed - some of them grossly so. The Comedian, for example, is a misogynist and rapist and Rorschach is a sociopath.<br /><br />Rorschach thinks he has uncovered a plot to murder all of the costumed adventurers and enlists the help of his former partner, Nite Owl, to help him. Meanwhile, the super powerful Doctor Manhattan, who has the ability to restructure reality and to manipulate time and space, continues to struggle with relating to regular human beings. After rumors that being near him causes cancer, he banishes himself to Mars.<br /><br />The murders end up being the work of the genius Ozymandias, who has concocted an elaborate scheme to bring the world's nations together: a fake alien invasion that kills thousands of people. His costumed friend figure out his plot, but are unable to stop it. And, in the end, it turns out Ozymandias is right.<br /><br />The weakest part of \\""Watchmen\\"" is the plot, especially the comic book ending. There are so many holes in the logic and execution of Ozymandias' scheme that it's difficult to follow or understand. But the plot isn't really the driver in \\""Watchmen\\"" - it's the characters and Moore's success with deconstructing superhero mythos.<br /><br />Moore has taken stock superhero stereotypes and added depth and complexity. Rorschach, Doctor Manhattan, and the Comedian shine as the stand-outs - loners with a lot of psychological problems trying to cope in a world teeming with misery. Moore has less success with Ozymandias, Nite Owl, and Silk Spectre who don't have the depth or the conviction of the stand-out characters.<br /><br />The novel is heavy on symbolism (lots of watches and clocks, for example) and mood - but differs from comic books from the time period by providing a straight forward and objective point of view. It's up to the readers - not Moore as the author - to figure out how to react to the action on the page.<br /><br />Another interesting device is Moore's use of a \\""story within a story\\"" by having a young boy read a comic book about pirates called \\""Tales of the Black Freighter.\\"" The pirate story - about a man escaping from a pirate ship filled with dead, doomed souls - echoes the action of \\""Watchmen\\"" and acts as juxtaposition to the main story.<br /><br />The artwork in \\""Watchmen\\"" feels like a throwback to the Golden Age of comics in the 1950s and 1960s (in fact, primary artist Dave Gibbons credits Norman Rockwell as an inspiration for \\""Watchmen\\""). There's a cinematic feel to the artwork - especially of noir films with the shadows and darkness. But there's surprising little movement to the graphics and sometimes the panels feel a bit inert.<br /><br />So how influential was \\""Watchmen\\""? It is generally credited with taking superhero comics from low-brow kid's entertainment and catapulting into high-brow art. That's no minor achievement. \\""Watchmen\\"" also ushered in an era of dark and bleak story lines around comic book superheroes (can we blame \\""Watchmen\\"" for the death of Superman and Captain America?).<br /><br />But Moore certainly didn't attain his goal of creating the \\""Moby-Dick\\"" of comic books. \\""Maus,\\"" for example, is clearly a greater literary achievement than \\""Watchmen.\\""<br /><br />Influential?<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />But a hallmark of great literature?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />Read more \\""Literate Blather\\"" at the Dark Party Review ([...]",2008-11-02

It established the medium of the graphic novel henceforth as one to be taken seriously and placed alongside film as the new pictorial artform in which complex stories with rich thematic material could be displayed upon a reticulated grid of visual images. And so a new cycle of American pop can be regarded as having begun with its appearance in 1986 (the graphic novel itself was, by then, only a decade or so old, beginning with Richard Corben's Bloodstar in the mid-seventies).<br /><br /> However, within the larger and already (by 1986) very long running cycle of the mythology of the comic book superhero, Watchmen belongs to the end of the particular development that began in the 1930s with comic strip heroes like Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon and Tarzan. For the main theme of Watchmen is that the universe of the comic book hero is coming to an end, and so Watchmen represents, as it were, a vision of its Kali Yuga or, in Wagnerian terms, its Twilight.<br /><br /> Watchmen, the first serious graphic novel (after Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns, that is) opens up a window into the twilight of the superhero universe which had begun with its Golden Age in the 1930s, its Silver Age in the 1950s and its \\""Bronze Age\\"" during the Marvel Renaissance of the 1970s. During the 1980s, with the appearance of The Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen and Neil Gaiman's Sandman, the universe of the superhero entered into its sunset years, for all three works are based upon a serious questioning of many of the basic premises of the comic book universe taken for granted by its creators.<br /><br /> One of those premises is that superheroes do not die. Another is that they do not grow old and retire. Another is that they are not psychotic, but sane and rational individuals whose ability to discern good from evil can be generally relied upong. And still another is that they always (eventually) win the battle against evil.<br /><br /> In Watchmen, Alan Moore discards all of these premises, for the story begins like a classic noir novel with a murder and then proceeds to spend the rest of its narrative investigating the causes of that murder. In this case, the murder in question is that of a superhero named Edward Blake, a.k.a. the Comedian, who has been found dead, while the superhero known only as Rorschach has decided to investigate. Rorschach does not have a face, only an ever changing rorschach blot, and his investigative methods immediately demonstrate to the reader that he is a psychopath and a sadist, for he tortures people in order to get information out of them, and takes pleasure in murdering those whom he believes to be criminals. Rorschach discovers that there is a plot to do away with superheroes, for his former acquaintance Dr. Manhattan soon exiles himself to Mars in shame as a result of learning from the media that his superpowers have given cancer to all his friends and former lovers. Adrian Veidt, formerly the superhero known as Ozymandias, who is the head of a huge transnational corporation known as Veidt Industries suffers an attempt upon his life; and Hollis Mason, the former and earlier incarnation of a Batman look - alike known as Nite Owl is murdered by an angry mob. Rorschach himself is arrested and put into prison.<br /><br /> In the universe of the superhero as envisioned by Alan Moore, we are introduced to a series of wash ups, sell outs and retirees. Dan Dreiberg, the recent incarnation of Nite Owl, is fortyish and has hung up his costume; the mysterious, Silver Surfer - like Dr. Manhattan works on physics projects for the United States Government (prior to his murder, the Comedian had also been employed by the U.S. Government, who sent him out on routine missions to topple Latin American dictatorships). An official bill known as the Keene Act, furthermore, has recently been passed, which outlaws all superhero vigilantism.<br /><br /> The call for the retirees toreturn to action comes when Laurie Jupiter walks out on her superhero husband Dr. Manhattan and goes to stay with Dan Dreiberg (the second, and most recent, incarnation of Nite Owl). The two fall in love and become nostalgic about their former status as superheroes and soon decide to break Rorschach out of jail and find out who has been killing off their friends. Eventually the trail leads them to the former superhero Ozymandias, a.k.a. Adrian Veidt, who is a sort of cross between Howard Hughes and L. Ron Hubbard, for Veidt is one of the richest - and also most intelligent - men alive, and from his fortress of solitude located at Antarctica runs a corporation that manufactures superhero action figures, toys, games and also a self-help cult called the \\""Veidt Method,\\"" a sort of Tony Robbins - style pep talk designed to make any man into an effective fashioner of his own destiny.<br /><br /> When Nite Owl and Rorschach travel to Antarctica in Nite Owl's Bat-mobile style air ship, they confront Adrian Veidt and discover that he had killed the Comedian because the Comedian had already figured out Veidt's master plan of ending the Cold War by launching an attack on New York City in an effort to bring the nations together. Veidt has designed a bizarre giant monster with tentacles and has learned the technology of teleportation, and decided to teleport this giant monster right into the middle of New York City, instantly killing off half its population. By the time Nite Owl and Rorschach have confronted him, they learn that this event has already taken place and that Veidt's plan has been successful, for Russia announces its intent to withdraw from Afghanistan immediately and call off hostilities towards America. Dr. Manhattan, hitherto at work on building his own fortress of solitude on Mars, materializes at the last moment for a showdown with Veidt, but once he has realized the success of Veidt's plan, he disappears into another dimension, vowing to leave humanity behind and work on creating his own worlds.<br /><br /> Veidt is successful and the Cold War ends. The superheroes retire for good. Dan Dreiberg and Laurie Jupiter marry (Rorschach has been killed in the battle by Dr. Manhattan) and all is well that ends well.<br /><br />So what's Watchmen really about and why is it so great?<br /><br /> Watchmen is about the conflict between globalization and the local mythos of the New York - centric cult of the superhero. Superheroes were called into being during the Great Depression in order to defend the cosmopolis of New York from attack by mythical beings from the astral plane. It is a local and very particularly regional myth born, grown and shaped within and for the city of Manhattan.<br /><br /> But former superhero Adrian Veidt, the novel's villain, is the head of a transnational corporation - that is, a corporation that is not wed to any particular geography -- Veidt Industries, and intends to wipe out his former superhero friends so that they will not attempt to forestall his global plan of ending the Cold War. We note that not only is Veidt successful in ending the Cold War, but he is also successful at ending the entire world of the superhero, for by the story's conclusion they have all disappeared into retirement, death or alternate dimensions as the direct consequence of the success of his plan.<br /><br /> Also take note that Veidt attacks New York from his fortress of solitude which is located in a sealed off glass dome on the continent of Antarctica, so it is very much as though New York were being attacked by planetary energies.<br /><br /> Alan Moore, as a British artist sensitive to changes in the ether, is here dramatizing before our very eyes the coming death of the superhero mythos at the hands of transnational globalization, for the two are apparently completely at odds with one another. The myth of the comic book superhero is local to New York, for it was born in the 1930s prior to the globalization forces that World War II brought into being, since one of the end results of that war was the launching of the Russian satellite Sputnik into orbit in 1957, which effectively globalized the planet by placing it inside a dome of electric technology. (The superhero was designed to protect New York, not the entire planet). Just as Adrian Veidt places a simulated tropical environment inside a glass dome at his fortress on Antarctica, so we have placed the entire planet since Sputnik inside of a technological dome. That very act already announced the end of the superhero mythos, since it relativized New York's importance on the global stage to that of merely one city state amongst many others all now gathered together under the single umbrella of global capitalism.<br /><br /> Insofar as the superhero fails to adapt himself to the new global circumstances - James Bond, for instance, is a new adaptation, for he is the world's first truly global hero - his mythology and way of life are in trouble. The downloading of superhero comics into celluloid narratives, furthermore, is not the beginning, but rather the ending, of his popularity, for once the download is complete - in about one more decade - interest in superheroes will wane and eventually vanish, exactly as predicted by Moore's Watchmen.<br /><br /> Finally, let us not forget that Moore's novel has already made at least one prediction that has come to pass, i.e. the assault on New York City by a giant monster with tentacles in the form of Al Qaeda with its delocalized network of sleeper cells distributed over the planet.<br /><br /> The moment of the supreme popularity of a cultural form marks the advent of its disappearance, not the height of its development. This is known as a \\""sunset effect,\\"" - the most elaborate suits of armor, for instance, came in during the 16th century, just when armor was made irrelevant by the arrival of gunpowder - and Moore's Watchmen is a text that can be set aside as marking the senescence of the New York cult of the superhero.<br /><br /> Watchmen is a mighty, Wagnerian achievement and has so far not yet been surpassed in the history of the graphic novel as a medium.<br /><br />--John David Ebert, author of \\""The New Media Invasion.\\""nd work on creating his own worlds.<br /><br /> Veidt is successful and the Cold War ends.

At the same time, this book is not for children - besides the (relatively) graphic violence and complex moral issues, there are sexual situations (no nudity, of course) that fall well beyond anything normally seen in comics.  If you're a sci-fi/fantasy fan who's not really about comics, but willing to give it a chance, this review's for you.<br /><br />Set in an alternate America of the 1980's, Moore paints a bleak picture of a world on the brink of nuclear holocaust, where the growing power of evil infects even the costumed vigilantes who have dedicated their lives to fighting it.  The story takes a long hard look at what makes these \\""heroes\\"" tick, and shows that the kind of people who take this path are certain to have their own demons - demons that cause them to at least occasionally, act demonically.  The story opens with the brutal murder of a hero who calls himself \\""the Comedian\\"".  Brief, fragmented glimpses into his past show him taking down criminals, winning for Uncle Sam in Viet Nam, but also heartlessly shooting the Asian girl who claims she's pregnant with his child.  The Comedian's murder is investigated by a hero called Rorschach, who has himself crossed the line by brutally disposing of the murderer of a six-year-old girl.  Rorschach believes he has uncovered a plot to kill and discredit costumed heroes, but its true purpose remains a mystery.  Ultimately, Moore asks us to decide who the real heroes and villains are, and suggests that perhaps even the best of us may feel the need to kill sometimes, for the greater good.  But do the ends ever really justify the means?<br /><br />Even aside from the content, this book is notable for some unusual techniques seldom seen in comics.  Each of the twelve chapters ends with a page or three of text, supposedly excerpts from various documents that shed further light on the characters and situations described in the body of the story.  Another unusual (although not as effective) technique is the interpolation of a \\""meta-comic\\"" - an old-style pirate comic that one young character reads at the newsstand.  Moore uses this comic as well as flashbacks in another interesting technique - that of showing us one scene while describing another, bleeding back and forth to help inform us of the characters' emotional states.<br /><br />To be sure, the plot has some serious holes, and the ending isn't as satisfying as it might be (although it's certainly unexpected) but the intense dramatic situations and powerfully drawn (yet quite humanly flawed) characters more than make up for it.  No, this isn't Dostoyevsky, but this is not your father's comic book, either.ach of the twelve chapters ends with a page or three of text, supposedly excerpts from various documents that shed further light on the characters and situations described in the body of the story.

That's just wrong.<br />So I bought a copy, still thinking that it wasn't going to be as great as everyone said it was. Well... within the first chapter, I was completely hooked. Alan Moore has a way of crafting his work that works flawlessly within a comic book atmosphere. And David Gibbon's art has never been better.<br />Watchmen takes place in an alternate 1985, where vigilantes are a common part of society. However, they have all but completely disappeared, some retired, some with other jobs. But two remain, Rorsach and The Comedian. Upon the murder of the Comedian, Rorsach takes it upon himself to find the murderer, and ultimately answer the infamous question, \\""Who Watches the Watchmen?\\""<br />The story almost looks upon comics books and superheroes in a satirical way, underlined with a deathly serious message.

The narrative complexity, the \\""realism\\"" and the more-thoughtful-than-average consideration of what superheroes would do to the world were they to really exist all make Watchmen shine.<br /><br />But if you peel away all of the glamor and try and figure out what the work is really about, what it really says, you'll be disappointed.  The self-destructive nature of man that sets the stage for the whole drama, as expressed by the imminent apocalypse, may have been convincing in 1985 but after the fall of the Soviet Union, it's hard to buy in to.  History sure seems to have sided with the United States.  The nuclear stand-off ended peacefully.  Perhaps Moore is mocking those who thought that there could be no peaceful resolution.  Given his other views and works (re conspiracy theories, cia secret missions) it seems he really bought into it.  I'm sorry for him that he didn't have a chance to say, \\""I told you so.\\""<br /><br />As a student of physics, the made-up science stuff always makes me cringe and Dr Manhattan was no exception.  When I understood that Moore introduced Dr Manhattan as a way to ask the question, \\""What would a truly SUPER hero do to global politics?\\"" I was more forgiving.  When I realized that all he wanted to say was that all political entities should always have exactly equal powers, my stomach started to turn again.<br /><br />Dramatically, though, I think that the total suspension of the physical laws of nature for Dr Manhattan while everyone else was bound to all that and more (psychic shock wave??? come on!) made for a fundamentally unbelieavable story.  A bit of suspended disbelief is expected but having two sets of rules for the universe simultaneously operating and affecting one and other??? Of course, he has artistic license but then again, I have the ability to stop caring about the story when it becomes too ridiculous.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING<br />So, was Ozymandias right? Why would a momentary external threat erase millenia of conflict between people?  Ozymandias' plan was supposedly going to end all conflict including the simple inter-personal street conflicts taking place on the street.  He is presented as \\""the smartest man in the world\\"" and then has this infantile naive idea of how to solve the worlds' problems a la the gordian knot.  No justification is given for how one small catastrophe could so easily change human nature.  And yet, Ozymandias and Dr Manhattan, the characters that have been presented as being wiser than all others think that it would work.  If Moore meant to mock everyone in his universe, then I agree.  But if he really buys into this drivel, and it seems that he does, the ideas that he is presenting are SO childish and ridiculous, they are insulting to be exposed to.<br /><br />The beginning of Watchmen showed great promise.  Fascinating characters, a sort of puzzle--piecing together all of the heroes' pasts, some intelligence, fun references, detailed images.  But the story gets more and more ridiculous and when Moore starts to actually reveal what the real story is, the reader is hit with a two-headed attack: [1] he has had to go through so many suspensions of disbelief that he doesn't really care anymore and [2] the \\""real story\\"" is so patently absurd that the reader wishes he hadn't discovered it.<br /><br />One might claim that I \\""didn't get it.\\""  I just think that ultimately, there isn't much in it to get.  And what there is is either obvious or obviously stupid.  Maybe I should re-read it.  Frankly, I regret having read it once.<br /><br />If you're interested in the issues broached in Watchmen, about superheros in the real world and don't want to feel insulted and bored by the end of the work, don't waste your time with this drivel.  Just watch \\""The Dark Knight.\\""  (If you must waste as much time as it took me to read this book, watch it a few times.  And maybe throw in \\""Batman Begins\\"" as well.)

Moore is obviously trying hard to break cliche's, but he does so by just doing the opposite thing, so it comes off as just a cliche in the other direction and, as I mentioned, utterly predictable.<br /><br />The other problem is that most of the characters are underdeveloped, underutilized, or both.  Other characters are overdeveloped, but serve little purpose.  The end result is that the vast majority of the book is consumed by flashbacks and oddities that are only tangentially related to the main plot of the book (which could likely fit in to about 20 pages taken alone).<br /><br />As far as characters go, the two obvious extremes are Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan.  Rorschach is developed minimally, but brilliantly written and vivid.  His actions and thoughts are clear and consistent, even though he's enigmatic as a character.  Dr Manhattan meanwhile is developed hugely, but changes personality almost from page to page.  He also comes off flat, and as a character with such potential isn't really all that important to the book in the end.<br /><br />Is this worth a read?  I'd say yes, especially if you're in to comics.  If you buy in to the hype and aren't too picky, you'll probably even love it.

I remember, as a boy, my mother purchasing me a comic book (or two, if I was exceptionally good, which I really tried to be) from the local grocery store.  I think I collected a grand total of ten.  They never really moved me.  They never interested me, until later, after I gained a bit more literary experience.  Now in my early 20's, I noticed a lot of my friends enjoy comics and graphic novels; I decided that I should give them a try as well.  All this being said: I shall not judge \\""Watchmen\\"" as a graphic novel, for I am not qualified to do so.  But being an avid reader of novels, short stories, essays, nonfiction, poetry, and song lyrics, I shall judge \\""Watchmen\\"" as a work of literature.  And the verdict?  A masterpiece.<br /><br />1985 in some alternate universe, where Nixon is still president (dear God), we won the Vietnam War (not as great as you might think), and superheroes were once part of American culture.  Spurred by comic books, ordinary men and women took up costumes and monickers, patrolling the streets of their cities.  Some of them even united together.  But, in 1985, the only operative superheroes are those sponsored by the government: like Doc Manhattan, once a man, now possessed of indescribable capabilites; and the Comedian, a rough and tumble anti-hero (I hesitate to include \\""hero\\"" at all) who has just been murdered.<br /><br />Rorschach, a masked vigilante who was once a hero and is now wanted for murder, investigates.  He sees a disturbing pattner.  A \\""mask killer\\""--someone out to kill superheroes.

As an adult, I do not read graphic novels, but I do read novels and non-fiction. So, it took a lot for me to buy this. However, I am very glad I did. Although not Tolstoy, it has an amazing level of depth for the form, and a really nice mixed media style. It uses a combination of graphic novel techniques (narration, dialogue, pure image, slow motion image, allusion by image, etc), written form, book within a book, and comic within a comic. Sometimes the techniques feel forced, but for the most part, they are very effective and drive the story arc and message. The comic within the comic model such that it has two stories intersecting is very effective and unlike anything I have seen before in a book (it is a movie technique). It gets the message across very powerfully.<br />I found this very readable and enjoyable once I got past the graphic novel aspect. That is, a book normally uses scene descriptions to help you understand the context, but these use drawings. So, far less text than a book and of course dialogue in balloons and all, but you get used to it.<br />I felt the ending was somewhat artificial, like the author was told to finish it up, but other than that, it is really worth reading if you enjoy literature.",2008-09-15
US,29607993,RSW21QF97096Q,0930289234,777411096,Watchmen,Books,5,1,2,N,N,"Absolutely Stunning","After years of hearing this graphic novel lauded as one of the greatest comics of all time (and admittedly intrigued by the buzz surrounding the upcoming film adaptation), I finally sat down and read Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' magnum opus.<br /><br />And I was blown away.<br /><br />Absolutely, completely enthralled and blown away by this \\""comic book\\"" that transcends the boundaries and stigmas attached to its medium to become a truly compelling piece of literature, as stimulating and thought provoking as the works of Dickens or Faulkner.<br /><br />I should point out that while I have always been a fan of superheroes, I am not an avid comic book reader; in fact, \\""Watchmen\\"" is the first graphic novel I've ever purchased.  I state this to illustrate that this is a work that can be enjoyed by anyone, not just comic book enthusiasts.<br /><br />Everything about this book, even 20+ years after its original publication, is thrillingly fresh and compelling.  Set in an alternate 1985 where Richard Nixon is serving his third term as president, one of the novel's many pleasures is seeing just how thoroughly thought out every aspect of this alternate history is.  The story begins with the murder of a former masked hero (the book fittingly avoids the term \\""superhero,\\"" as only one of the characters has supernatural abilities), and what starts as a whodunit quickly escalates into a meditation on power, government, politics, technology, and the direction humanity is headed.  Yes, the Cold War-era nuclear-holocaust material slightly dates the tale, but the theme of mankind's ever growing ability to destroy ourselves is still relevant today.<br /><br />Yet for all its philosophizing, \\""Watchmen\\"" remains firmly grounded in character study, and the costumed adventurers found withing are given incredibly complex psychologies.  Everyone is a realistically flawed human being doing their best to figure out their place in the world.  By the novel's end, you come to understand all the characters, even the ones who have done the most horrific things (including an attempted rape and some graphic murders).  Moore and Gibbons do not pass judgment on their characters, leaving the reader to ultimately decide how he or she feels about each one.<br /><br />The way the narrative is told is absolutely riveting, filled with flashbacks and concurrent scenes juxtaposed to maximum artistic effect.  And in between each chapter is a wealth of supplemental materials to fill in the gaps of the novel's backstory, each done in the fashion of  publications that exist in the Watchmen world (newspaper clippings, excerpts from fake novels, etc.).  And artist Dave Gibbons expertly supports Moore's text with detailed artwork packed with symbolism and hidden meanings.  You could easily spend hours pouring over the panels to find small symbolic details and hints of future plot twists.  The final panel alone masterfully and succintly brings the work full-circle and is chilling in its implications.<br /><br />In short, anyone who is a fan of literature (not just comic books) needs to read \\""The Watchmen.\\""  While I have high hopes for the film adaptation, it cannot hope to match the complexity, breadth, and depth of the source material.  This is one of the most stimulating books I have read in a long time, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.",2008-09-15

It has been so long since I looked at anything like this.  I have read Dostoevsky, Sartre, Camus, Nietzsche and many others.  I cannot think why this work should be treated any differently.  It is a work which makes you think.  It also covers aspects of the graphic novel which can take you into the unreal or surreal.

Maybe it was the surge of comic book inspired movies that made me want to see what behind these amazing movies or the need for a greater story that I felt was missing, but I decided to start my kick off with Watchmen. I couldn't have picked a better book!<br /><br />The cover of Watchmen touts it as a \\""Winner of the Hugo Award\\"" and \\""One of Time Magazine's 100 Best Novels\\"", and as soon as you pick it up you will know why. It starts off heavy after the death of one of their own, the \\""hero\\"" Comedian, and picks up steam after that. But the greatest things about this book aren't things you can see right away, it's what's underneath everything that keeps you reading.<br /><br />The first thing is obviously the story; it is real. It has a back story that actually builds upon the current story. Everything written in this novel has a purpose, and I know that every time I read it it will show me something new. After the first read I'm still trying to piece everything together because I know there are more details that connect, I just haven't seen them yet. And the fact that I want to read it again is a major accomplishment considering it's size and the weight of the story alone.<br /><br />Another are the characters. They aren't your usual cookie-cutter hero's. Sure, they are based on a lot of today's modern characters but they each have their own life and story. They have their own tendencies that make them human and their own person, and it's great to see how each person, no matter how different they are, interact with everyone. They are people just like you and me who have chosen to \\""adventure\\"" for one reason or another, and their backstories are given to further strengthen the characters. They don't have any great powers (except for Dr. Manhattan) and they are wanted by the law throughout the book which makes it even more difficult for them.<br /><br />Throughout the entire story you read along as these characters get themselves in and out of trouble and the entire time they handle it like you think they would, but never does the story reveal itself or are you aware of what is coming next. Especially when it comes to the ending. The ending blows me away even now thinking about it.<br /><br />The bottom line is get this book because it's a story that will last longer than time and keep you hooked even longer.ory you read along as these characters get themselves in and out of trouble and the entire time they handle it like you think they would, but never does the story reveal itself or are you aware of what is coming next.

He described the Comic Series Watchmen and said that Time Magazine rates it as one of the top 100 novels.  I took the bait and I ordered Watchmen on Amazon.Com.<br /> The graphics are great and the writing is multi-layered and complex.  It deals with the Costume Super Heroes from the late 1930's to 1985. The story details the formation of their organizations and how they came to be.  Alan Moore creates an alternate history which is much different and darker than anything derived of in the Cold War period.<br /> In order to understand this serial Comic Series you must know history.  Please don't do as I first did and try to read things into Moore's writing.

This self-contained, marginally fictional universe is mostly set in mid-1980s New York City during a fifth Nixon term and heightened cold war tensions.  The main characters are ex-superheroes (based on old Charlton Comics characters but unique to this series) that have been banned by the US government and now seem to be mysteriously disappearing.  Besides the nearly omnipotent blue giant Dr. Manhattan, these heroes are mostly simple masked vigilantes without superpowers.

Originally a 12 part comic book series, the graphic novel \\""Watchmen\\"" is a must read for comic book fans and fans of drama novels. If you think this is a common superhero novel, think again. The group of heroes this book tells about have no super-powers, except for one. This book deconstructs the basic superhero archetype and gives us human superheroes. Characters like the Nite Owl and Rorschach suffer from all kinds of problems that everyday human beings go through. \\""Watchmen\\"" is a very human story. Now, the story is set in an alternate 1985 and it deals with the death of one of the heroes and the finding out of who did it while in the meantime, America is ever closer to a nuclear war with Russia. They are many flashbacks that tell the back story of the main characters and these flashbacks relate to the current story. In addition, there are many twists and moments that will have you on the edge of your seat. The book has a very cinematic quality to it and Dave Gibbons art is iconic while Alan Moore's story telling is legendary. Never before have I been so immersed in a comic book before. Once you pick this one up, you can't put it down. Reading it once does no justice, you have to (and you will) read again and again.

It is a gritty, complete world that uses the fantastic so sparingly as to create a truly immersive story. The characters are seriously flawed, just like all of humanity, and make some very very bad choices, especially in the end.<br /><br />Using logic that dictates that the ends justify the means the characters choose who lives and who dies in order to \\""save the planet\\"" from the ruin of war and intolerance. The protagonists in this story are kept secret, even until the end. You are allowed to make up your own mind about who is the most right or wrong. Nobody in this story is pure... except for the god-man. And he eventually decides the fate of the world.<br /><br />And here is where the writer, Alan Moore, shows his cards. By creating a character who \\""sees the big picture\\""; who \\""is above the pettiness of human beings\\"" who can't make the tough decisions, Moore has set the stage for an inevitable conclusion: some people, alot of people, an enormous number, will have to die to save the rest of us. It doesn't matter who it is, just so long as it is a bunch of them. Them. Not us. Not me. Them.<br /><br />As storytelling goes, it is nearly without flaw. Watchmen is a seminal work in the vein of HP Lovecraft's very best. Many works will take the lead on this book for one simple reason: it is a fantasy lovefest for those who want self-righteous justice.<br /><br />But, if you're not looking at it that deeply, it is also a great escape into a sweeping mystery novel that ties up every loose string in the end.",2008-08-14

I had heard about this but never gave it much thought.  Unlike Sin City and V for Vendetta, I decided that this time I will actually read the material before I watch the movie.  Well, I have to day it's not at all what I expected and now I'm not so sure I want to watch the movie at all.<br /><br />For anyone who's going to use this review as their basis for deciding wheather or not they are going to read Watchmen, let me start by telling you that this is a thinking piece, not an action piece.  It does have some action, but it's pretty sparse (though it is entertaining when it comes about.)  Watchmen is more of a character drama, and considering the graphic medium, the characters are fairly complex and interesting.  Each one has their own unique story and reasoning behind becoming a \\""costumed adventurer,\\"" aptly named due to the fact that with the exception of Dr. Manhattan, they don't have any true super powers.  I am very impressed that Moore never included any character \\""thought text\\"" to tell you what they were thinking.  He manages to do it all with dialogue, facial expressions and situations.<br /><br />I was drawn in from the very beginning.  The book wastes no time as it starts with the murder of a long time costumed hero and an ensuing investigation by his former colleagues.  We are introduced to these retired heroes one at a time with plenty of snippets of back story to explain how it all came about and why in this alternate reality, costumed heroes are a part of everyday life.<br /><br />The further I got into Watchmen, the stranger it became and as it ended, I realized it wasn't at all what I thought it would be.  It's almost a study of human character and I'm sure that someone more intelligent than I would be able to pick it apart and analyze it to death, drawing parallels to real life.  I really did enjoy it and I'd recommend it highly, but not to everyone.  There are plentyof readers who don't want to read a book (or more particularly a comic book) for story and characters alone and those readers may not find what the are looking for here.<br /><br />This brings me back to the movie.  I can't really see this story working as a blockbuster Hollywood film.  If they keep the movie very close to the source material -which I hope they will- it's going to be a lot different than people expect.  If they try to appeal to a wider audience and throw in some extra action, they're going to detract from the story and the people who appreciate the book may be dissapointed.  But, so far from what I'm seeing in the preview, it looks like it's going to keep pretty true to the book.  And Dr. Manhattan looks awesome.<br /><br />But this review is about the book, not the movie.  I really liked it.  It may be the best comic book/graphic novel I've ever read.  But, I haven't read any comics since I was a kid and even then not so much.  I don't quite think I'd call Watchmen a masterpiece or compare it to some of the best regular novels I've read, but I liked it.  It's earned a permanent place on my shelf and I look forward to rereading it in the future to see what further tidbits I can get out of it.",2008-08-13

It was one of the most stunning yet bizarre I've ever seen for a film, let alone a comic book movie. Intriguied and hearing the rave reviews by fans of the novel, I decided to buy the graphic novel on amazon and give the book a read. Only a few chapters into a book, and I was already blown away by the thought-provoking writing, stunning artwork, and superb characterization of all the characters. \\""Watchmen\\"" is set in an alternate 1985 where superheroes aka masked vigilantes exist, but have been outlawed by \\""the Keene Act\\"". Richard Nixon is still President and the U.S. won  Vietnam thanks to a god-like superhero named \\""Dr. Manhattan\\"". When one of his fellow adventures is murdered, a masked vigilante named Rorschach investigates and warns other retired crime fighters about a possible conspiracy to kill and discredit all their kind. From there, \\""Watchmen\\"" takes you one of the most complex stories you'll ever read as every action or dialogue spoken has a deeper meaning. Each characters is written with class and are each essential to the overall plot.<br /><br />\\""Watchmen\\"" works as both an epic tale about humanity and moral ambiuity yet at the same time is some what of a satire on the comic book genre. Dr. Manhattan is a Superman who doesn't care about humanity, Nite Owl II is a Batman who lacks confidence in himself, Silk Spectre II never wanted to a superhero in the first place, the Comedian sees the world as one big joke, Rorshach will do anything for justice, including cold-blooded murder and Ozymandias...well, let's just say his part in the novel is the most intriguing! These characters were all ground-breaking and beyond their time, as well as the subjects the novel tackles that were unheared of in the comic world during the mid-80s. Depression, isolation, murder, infedelity, morality, sacrifice, sexual frustration...not to mention homosexuality, racism, and politics can found within the novel. Legendary British writer, Alan Moore has crated a timeless classic which throws the superhero myth out the window and creates a new mythology all his own. Artist Dave Gibbons, is also a genuis as his art just brings Alan Moor's spectacular world to life.<br /><br />The coming months are going to be filled with unstable paranoia and frequent skeptism from long time fans and critics of the novel who are questioning the quality of the upcoming feature film. After all, This is the best graphic novel ever written and anything less then great will be very disappointing. After reading the novel, I am also very skeptical of how the movie will pan out as the novel has so much to say and I'm not sure if a almost 3 hour film can tackle all the depth of the novel. But I am trying to have faith in director Zack Snyder who is fan of novel and ever interview he has had makes you believe he understands the novel inside and out. But with some questioning casting decisions, some costume inaccuracies and running time issues, it's hard to tell whether the film will do the novel justice. I will going to the theaters with very low expectations as this could be a disaster or a complete success! Either way, \\""Watchmen\\"" is one of literature's finest achievements and I don't think they'll be anything like it as there hasn't been anything like it up to this point.",2008-08-12

US,43083835,RKCBEC468Q2GX,0930289234,777411096,Watchmen,Books,5,3,4,N,Y,"Best graphic novel ever?","It's always dangerous to speak in absolutes, but, in my opinion, Watchmen (by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons) is the greatest graphic novel ever.  I don't think I'm alone in this.  Besides the fact that it won the Hugo Award, it has also made a number of top 100 (or whatever number) lists for Best Novel.  In other words, Watchmen is good enough to actually be in the same class as all-text books.<br /><br />In a way, Watchmen is a superhero story, but that is actually only superficially true.  Particularly, only one character has superpowers; the rest are merely people that dress in costumes and fight crimes.  In the Watchmen world, most of these heroes have been retired, though a few remain active.  In particular,  the amoral Comedian continues to do covert operations for the government and the god-like Dr. Manhattan acts as a major deterrent to nuclear war (the story takes place in the mid-1980's, in which the Cold War is close to turning hot and Richard Nixon is still president).  Although only the Comedian and Dr. Manhattan are government-sanctioned, there is also Rorschach, a half-crazed vigilante who has no qualms about killing those who need killing.  In full retirement are the gadget-using Nite Owl, the beautiful Silk Spectre (Dr. Manhattan's lover) and the genius, Ozymandias.<br /><br />The story begins with the Comedian's murder.  Rorschach - who is probably the closest Watchmen has to a main character - begins to suspect a conspiracy to take out other masked men (and women), especially when Dr. Manhattan is forced into exile.  There is indeed something going on, and the majority of the book deals with finding out who is responsible and what he or she is trying to accomplish.<br /><br />In one paragraph, that is the plot, but the narrative is far more complex than can be described in an Amazon review.  There are lots of subplots (even a comic book story within the story involving pirates) and non-linear storytelling that goes back into the past to explain theorigins of most of the heroes.  The characters are also complex (far more than most superheroes at the time this was written):  many have big problems and few are truly heroic.  In addition, of the twelve chapters, the first eleven all have supplemental materials such as fictional book or magazine excerpts that give extra insight into this world.<br /><br />Although these are not familiar superheroes, they are based on certain characters from Charlton Comics and later moved to the DC Universe (it should be noted that this is a DC book).  For example, Rorschach is based on the Question,  Nite Owl on the Blue Beetle and Dr. Manhattan on Captain Atom.  And despite the fact that many superhero stories of its era were child-friendly, Watchmen is not: besides its subject matter, it's complex narrative style may be off-putting to younger readers.<br /><br />But for adults, this book is a real treat that can be enjoyed multiple times.  In fact, every time you read Watchmen, you will get more out of it; the story has that much depth.  Watchmen is not only the graphic novel at its peak, it is novel writing at its best as well.",2008-07-27

Global warming and high gas prices are nowhere to be seen in a country where electric cars are alive and well.  Nixon is still president, Vietnam has become the 51st state, and the ambitions of the repeatedly humiliated Soviet Union have been frustrated for decades.  All of this is courtesy of an immanent god-being with a decidedly temporal appetite for the ladies.<br /><br />Other, more human heroes once roamed the streets, using flashy costumes and noble deeds to compensate for their lusts and weaknesses.  Some are retired, broken, or dead.  The rest are either outlaws or comfortably employed as government operatives.  One of the latter, a WWII-era extra-normal named \\""The Comedian,\\"" is brutally murdered, thrown from the window of his high-rise bachelor pad.  Rorschach, a paranoid, anti-social younger mask hunted by the police for refusing to refrain from his illegal vigilante activities, is convinced that a conspiracy is afoot to eliminate his comrades.

It is set in a parallel 1980s America: the U.S. won the Vietnam War and Nixon is still President. The story is almost indescribably complex. It begins with the murder of a former superhero, and the suggestion that perhaps someone is killing them off.<br /><br />There are seemingly dozens of characters here, all original to this work, but Moore does an excellent job of developing almost all of them, and of balancing their exposure levels. Indeed, half of Watchmen is character development, but it's well done, and almost never boring. There's plenty of action, too, including a suitably epic and very satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />The characters are what make Watchmen great. There are so many fascinating and deep characters here, and Moore uses them to explore morality on virtually every level. For this is what Watchmen is on its basic level: a morality tale, albeit a fairly bleak one.<br /><br />Dave Gibbons's drawing style is realistic, and on the whole it's quite good (although his overweight figures look a little stiff). It fits the story perfectly. As with Moore's V for Vendetta, Watchmen features no illustrated sound effects, and they are not particularly missed.<br /><br />Watchmen is one of the greatest and most complex comics ever written, and it's held up well over time.

Suppose that one was to rate movies and books for what you would pay for the chance to enjoy them, not for their overall influence on society, but for your own enjoyment only. Value goes up, like all other goods, with low supply. So a movie like the Dark Knight, I would easily pay $60 or $70 to see. (glad i didn't have to.) Watchmen would fall in the several hundred dollar range. Every single chapter (episode, issue, whatever they're called) is completely engrossing.<br /> As someone who enjoys the comic genre I feel that it is ok for characters to be repetitive in their abilites. When many reviewers referred to the individual powers in The Incredibles (pixar) as remarkably creative I scoffed, all were rehashes. But I also didn't hold that against the movie. So many types of heroes are reused that I don't expect them to be original. So I was all the more amazed when I found in Watchmen characters that were original. Rorsharch, Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandas, The Comedian, (ok maybe the Night Owl is a Batman ripoff) are all completely... completely unique... and here's the kicker, there's a reason they haven't been copied. Because Moore created them for this exact story. They are unique products of their world and any writer who tried to use them in another story would be unable to transpose them correctly.<br /> The thing is, the entirety of the novel is like this. other unique story telling aspects, such as the comic within the novel, and the historical interludes, are delivered in a way as if the story telling required it, so Moore had no choice but to create it.<br /> It is completely rereadable. In fact, it is compulsively rereadable. Don't leave it on a readily available shelf because it will end up back in your hands.<br /> I've decided, I would pay $500 for Watchmen.

It just goes to show how much comics have grown in terms of social commentary and clashing ideals.  So as not to overlook the novel's illustrations, Gibbons' work speaks of the old gritty comic art style that I grew up without.

In the world of The Watchmen, \\""adventuring\\"" by masked vigilantes has been made illegal. Most of the superheroes have gone along with the law, and have more-or-less happily hung up their masks, cowls and crime-fighting devices to attempt the uneasy adjustment to normal life.

Night Owl, a paunchy and bespectacled nerd, wears around in a slightly-ludicrous owl costume, complete with wings and night-vision goggles. In a bit of (I think) intentional humor, his arctic outfit is actually shaped and colored to resemble a snowy owl.

There are as many intertwined plotlines here as in a thousand-page blockbuster novel. At the opening of the story, the setting is the U.S. in 1985 -- sort of. Richard Nixon appears to be in his fifth term, thanks to a constitutional amendment, and the Vietnam War was won with the assistance of a handful of costumed adventurers, only one of whom has actual super-powers. In fact, much of the story is taken up with examining what happens to caped and masked crimefighters when they get too old to do their thing. (It's a well-worn theme now, but this book invented it.) And it's beginning to seem as if someone is arranging the disposal or de-fanging of the masked ones. The narrative is not only broad, though, it has considerable depth, including the backstories of all the major heroes and heroines, how they got into the business and why, what they have in common psychologically, and allowing them to be aware of just how oddball they are, compared to the rest of society. The artwork is realistic (which I prefer, frankly), with enormous subtlety in the flow and the continuity -- beginning with the cover illustration and ending with the last page of the last chapter. Neat little details peek out from the corners of many of the panels, bits of earlier dialogue come to mind later on, and Moore knows the value of modified repetition in telling a story effectively.

Originally published in 12 issues from 1986 to 1987 by DC Comics, it's now available in its entirety as a trade paperback.<br /><br />The story revolves around a group of superheroes who have (mostly) retired from heroics and find themselves dealing with life without the mask while the world crumbles around them. Watchmen takes place in the fall of 1985, although it is a 1985 with a partially different past. In the world that Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons have created, superheroes first show up after World War II. That's where things start to get a little different. In their world of superheroes the Vietnam War is won due to their influence, and technology takes a leap forward due to the advanced mind of one of these heroes.<br /><br />The value of the story isn't invested solely in its artwork, unlike many comics out there, but rather the chapters are broken up by two or three pages of nothing but text. This is presented in the form of excerpts from different fictional non-fiction books--such as an autobiography of a character or 0police reports--many of which blatantly examine the work as a whole and reveal insightful details about the characters.<br /><br />On the surface this is a story about superheroes. But it isn't deeds or super powers that are the hallmark of these characters, but rather it is who they are. Who are these people that dress up in costumes and fight crime? (It all sounds silly when you say it out loud.)<br /><br />But the people behind the masks, what motivates them? Just because a person fights crime, is he good? The Comedian fights crime, but beneath that shallow façade is a blood-thirsty sociopath, just as likely to rape or murder as he is to crack a joke. Rorschach is another interesting case. He fights crime with amask distinctly reminiscent to a psychologist's ink blot. A criminal might not need to be thrown down an elevator shaft to punish crime, but according to Rorschach it can't hurt.<br /><br />The setting of the Watchmen sometimes feels a bit removed since it happens within the context of an America in the midst of a Cold War with the Soviet Union in the fall of 1985. Thanks in large part to the newly emergent superheroes, history has been rewritten: The Vietnam War was a successful operation.<br /><br />The setting is gritty and real, aside from the alternative history aspects that is. The artist does an excellent job of creating the look of a traditional comic but infused with a dose of concrete reality. The city is used and dirty, bars are dank holes you can almost smell, and back alleys are dark and ominous.<br /><br />In Alan Moore's vision of this world, tensions start to rise years before the thread of the story even begins. By 1977, in Moore's chronology, all \\""superheroes\\"" are either forced into retirement or work for the government. Those who chose to continue to operate are categorized as fugitives and vigilantes. When former superheroes start getting murdered, those who are left must navigate a morally ambiguous path to a shocking (and surprisingly deep) philosophical conclusion about the price to be paid for saving the human race from itself.",2007-07-23

I love comic books, and I wanted to love Watchmen. I expected to love it. It won a Hugo, after all. Well...it started off great, with the murder of a retired costumed hero, the Comedian. We're soon introduced to Rorschach, a somewhat mentally disturbed but very effective sort of good guy and a bunch of other costumed heroes, most now retired.<br /><br />The book went downhill soon after. One of the good guys, a Superman clone, is framed and goes off to Mars in a huff. A very boring chapter of his philosophical depression then follows.

What began as a way to offer cheap entertainment to kids suddenly became a storytelling medium worth taking seriously, thanks in no small part to the two greatest writers to emerge from that time period: Frank Miller and Alan Moore.  Miller and Moore, now recognized as arguably the greatest comic book writers who ever lived, revitalized a dying form of entertainment and turned it into what it is today: art.  Miller's seminal work is \\""[[ASIN:1563893428 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]],\\"" released in 1986, the tale of an aging Bruce Wayne and his decision to fight one last battle against crime.  Upon its release it was hailed as a landmark in the medium, and the greatest comic ever written.  At the time, it was.<br /><br />However, that same year, Alan Moore's \\""Watchmen\\"" was released upon the world.  Immediately it was hailed as the NEW greatest comic ever written, a milestone, and an immense achievement.  (Moore would go on to write numerous similarly acclaimed works, in particular \\""[[ASIN:0930289528 V for Vendetta]].\\"")  The praise was not undeserved, and time has only increased the amount of praise for Moore's masterpiece.  Though \\""The Dark Knight Returns\\"" seemed astoundingly deep upon its release, \\""Watchmen\\"" is a far more intricate work.  Moore infuses \\""Watchmen\\"" with a sort of undeniably true and painfully pessimistic social commentary, and handles it just as deftly (though not with such flash) as would George Orwell.  (The book often echoes Orwell's \\""[[ASIN:0451524934 1984]].\\"")  He also juggles the main storyline with a pulp comic book read by a kid within the story, and at the same time ends each chapter with essays and clippings and such from newspapers, magazines, police reports, etc., adding even more depth to an already very deep work.<br /><br />The storyline is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant, if not THE most brilliant, in comic book history.  \\""Watchmen\\"" is set in 1985, in a chaotic world only subtly different from our own.  Richard Nixon is still president, and the United States won the Vietnam War.  The biggest difference is that superheroes are real.  Inspired by the classic comic superheroes which emerged from the Great Depression, a select bunch of people began dressing up in costumes and fighting crime from the 1940s until the 1960s.  A law passed in the 70s, however, forbids superheroes and forced most to unmask.  A select few did not.  One of those who refused to quit is Rorschach, a violent, antisocial antihero.  When one of his fellow superheroes, \\""the Comedian,\\"" is found murdered, Rorschach takes to the streets to investigate.  His investigation will eventually cause ex-superheroes to reevaluate their retirement, the public to rise up in anger against their \\""protectors,\\"" and the world to be changed forever.  The plot, the scale, and the tension of the book thickens immensely with each passing chapter, until concluding with a horrific and mind-shattering conclusion.<br /><br />First off, to call \\""Watchmen\\"" the greatest comic book ever made is an understatement, and unfortunately, even that statement wouldn't give the book the attention it deserves.  It would be far more fitting to call it one of the finest works of popular fiction ever published, period.  \\""Watchmen\\"" is a work of incredible talent, depth, artistry, and meaning, a timeless masterpiece that is at once a throwback to the comics of old and a statement on the nature of humanity and the dreadful truths about society.  It's also the most mature and adult comic I've ever read.  It's likely that the audiences reading Siegel & Shuster's \\""Superman\\"" comics or Bob Kane's \\""Batman\\"" comics in the 1930s and 40s couldn't begin to comprehend \\""Watchmen.\\""  To modern audiences, it's as pertinent a work as ever there was.<br /><br />\\""Watchmen\\"" really doesn't feel so much like a comic as it does a book (partially because it's about three times the size of a normal comic), only with illustrations (by Dave Gibbons).  Gibbons' illustrations are magnificent.  Compared to the artwork of other modern comics like Frank Miller's [[ASIN:1593963149 Sin City series]], the artwork of \\""Watchmen\\"" feels very much like Golden Era artwork.  The colors are particularly vibrant, even if the color scheme revolves mostly around the more rusty colors.  The drawings themselves are excellent, their charmingly old-fashioned style perfectly offsetting Moore's very contemporary and modern writing.  However, this is an offset that works remarkably well, once again proving the old saying \\""opposites attract.\\""<br /><br />One just can't conceive the brilliance of \\""Watchmen\\"" without having read it.  It is unquestionably the finest comic book/graphic novel ever written, and I have no doubt that it will remain so forever.  It's unsurpassable.  The comic book industry remains criminally underappreciated, but if there was ever a work that proves this is a medium to be taken seriously, it's \\""Watchmen.\\""  If you have read comics before, there is no excuse for not having read the book, and if you haven't - well, I simply can't recommend it enough.  Zach Snyder's film adaptation will bring the book into the spotlight again, and that's wonderful, but \\""Watchmen\\"" was designed to work solely as a comic, and that is how it should be experienced.

I started it knowing almost nothing of adult comics, but still having high expectations because the one thing I did know was that this book was considered a landmark.  Even with demanding expectations, nothing about it disappoints.<br /><br />It tells the story of a group of aging 'costumed adventurers'.  Not true superheroes, since they have no special powers, but people who put on costumes and fight crime.  This is actually a rather odd way to behave, and the text examines the strangeness from multiple angles, with excerpts from the memoirs of one 'mask' and psychiatric reports on another.<br /><br />Into this setting comes one person, Dr Manhattan, who really does have incredible, almost godlike powers after surviving a physics experiment gone bad.  Dr Manhattan is exploited by the US to win in Vietnam and generally dominate the world, but it's an unstable superiority because his powers have left him alienated from and uninvolved with human life.<br /><br />Following riots, the government has outlawed costumed vigilantes, except for those it controls, Dr Manhattan and an unscrupulous adventurer called the Comedian.  When the Comedian is murdered, one clearly unstable vigilante who has ignored the ban, Rohrshach, becomes convinced there is a plot afoot to kill off all masks.  Meanwhile, the government is finding out it doesn't really control Dr Manhattan.  When he decides to disappear to Mars, Russia's aggressive response to the sudden US weakness may bring on WW III.<br /><br />As all this happens, we watch developments from many perspectives - not only the main characters, but a newsstand owner in New York, his customers, and a long-retired superhero how living in a California rest home, surrounded by mementoes of her thrilling past - and haunted by a secret she hopes to keep from her daughter, another masked vigilante.<br /><br />Alongwith an impressive and unconventional climax, the authors treat us to some very amusing bonus scenes after the grand finale.",2006-08-09

While it felt rushed, Watchmen was well drawn out, giving you time to choose the characters you care about, while DKR relyed more on common knowledge to move the story of batman. A first-comer wouldn't understand by DKR's quick-moving story about his past with the Joker, with his parents murder or what truly drives him. But Watchmen starts the slate clean and lets you pick and choose with a story that is as relevant today as ever.

The remaining members at the time, Adrian Veidt (\\""Ozymandias\\""), and Daniel Dreiberg (\\""Nite Owl II\\""), however, were forced into retirement. Other heroes are either incarcerated, or deceased. Now, in the present time--October 1985--The Comedian is murdered in his home by an unknown assailant, and the remaining, non-government-employed masked adventurer, Rorschach, a ruthless vigilante detective so-named after the ever-shifting ink-blots on his faceless mask, investigates the attack. Afterwards, he warns the other local ex heroes--Dreiberg, Veidt, Osterman, and Laurie--of the Comedian's demise, saying he suspects Blake's death may be part of a much bigger plan to destroy all \\""masks.\\"" Though the year is 1985, Richard Nixon is still president of the US because of some aid from Dr. Manhattan in the Vietnam war that brought about an amendment that granted him a third term in office--that, and the Comedian's implied, ordered killing of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein before they could expose Nixon's involvement in the infamous Watergate scandal. The entire \\""superhero\\"" mania is even as much as a political issue (conservatives think they are wrongly defamed, misunderstood do-gooders, and liberals consider them dangerous and should be banned). But even all of this superhero controversy won't stop Rorschach and his \\""mask killer\\"" theory, nor will it the other retired heroes when they are finally inspired by Rorschach's words, and when more attacks ensue, to return to the same world that outlawed them, and find the mastermind behind these so-called \\""mask killings...\\""<br /><br />This is it, folks. You found it--the book (along with Frank Miller's \\""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns,\\"" released around the same time as this, the mid 80s) that forever changed a previously underappreciated art form and challenged an entire medium. This is a gripping story that demonstrates that writing is more than just an art form, it is a craft, and that the true craftsman can achieve flawless perfection. What Alan Moore, a veteran fan favorite in the comic book business, did with his timeless masterwork is take the age-old concept of men-in-tights and revolutionized it into something nobody had ever imagined possible before--he placed them in the \\""real world.\\"" I'm sure all of us--young and old--have, at one time or another, pondered what our own world would be like if superpowered beings were real. If you're thinking it would make the world a better place, then you need to stop watching \\""The Powerpuff Girls\\"" and quit reading the \\""Funnies\\"" in the newspapers and read \\""Watchmen\\"" immediately. According to \\""Watchmen,\\"" there really are no such things as \\""superheroes,\\"" nor have there been to begin with. The very term \\""superhero\\"" doesn't even mean anything. The story is mainly about how much one can do to save the world, versus how much one *should* do--sanity vs. insanity.<br /><br />In addition to the fictional history of the characters, Moore also discusses true world history and the characters' reactions to them--particularly World War II, McCarthyism, Vietnam, and the Cold War, which makes this an all the more interesting, not to mention frighteningly real, read. And if you look closely, you might some significant things that can relate to today's world. The plot is very deep and complex, and a mirror of it's own self--the very last frame, if you look close enough, is a deliberate echo of the first, as is the final chapter of the first. Moore always does this in his works, and it's fantastic. There is not one piece of wasted dialogue here. Moore orchestrates everything flawlessly, even some events that might, at first, be considered unneeded are important because they fit into the final outcome (I'm being vague on purpose, don't to spoil anything big). In conclusion, Alan Moore proves himself the genius he is regularly dubbed with his undisputed classic. \\""Watchmen\\"" is a masterwork I would recommend to absolutely anyone--not just graphic novel enthusiasts (like myself), but anyone who likes intelligent, thought-provoking literature in general.

I'm too young to personally remember the effect Watchmen had on the comic genre, but my brother was in middle school at the time of its release, and when he saw me reading the book recently he said the reaction to it back then was, \\""Like, holy cow.\\""  And it's not hard to see why.  Moore's V for Vendetta was certainly a great book, but this one is so far ahead of its predecessor in terms of complexity, detail, and psychological depth it makes V look like, well, a comic book.  Like V, Watchmen has heavy doses of sociopolitical ponderings mixed in with its more traditional action and interpersonal drama, but in Watchmen Moore creates a whole universe of frequently morally ambiguous characters, telling his story on an infinitely grander and more nuanced scale than before.  This is a true novel, incorporating multiple plot strands and backstories, with as much emphasis on ideas as on the fast-paced narrative and lavishly colored and detailed artwork.<br /><br />Ironically, Moore creates a world where comic-book-styled crimefighters are (or were) very real, and very human, and uses it to explore issues that go well beyond the purview of anything that could've been dreamed up in the early days of superhero myths.  The world of Watchmen is an ugly one, filled with violence, social decay, and general depravity, where decent people strive to make a difference only to question whether anyone can, and where characters who face the darkness and insanity that surround them are defined by their reactions to it.  The book's overarching plot expertly exploits the fear and paranoia of the Cold War era, along with any society's ever-present tensions between order and liberty, as an apparent scheme to knock off former costumed crimefighters (The Watchmen of the book's title) intersects with escalating hostilities between the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the threat of nuclear holocaust hangs eternally overhead.  And at the risk of overdoing the V for Vendetta comparisons, much like that book this one doesn't ask the reader to take sides: there are plenty of competing philosophies and worldviews on display in Watchmen, and while none of them are exactly idealized, all are at least explained.<br /><br />Really, though, it's the embellishments that make Watchmen near-mandatory reading.  I've read some novels that were pretty out-there in my time(Infinite Jest and House of Leaves, to name a couple of the more prominent), and while this one isn't quite as dense and narratively complicated as those two, it's up there.  Interspersed between each chapter is an addendum of some sort, usually an excerpt of text, that sheds light on the characters and the world they inhabit.  Even beyond that, the book is filled with little asides and interruptions that give it an almost stream-of-consciousness feel.  Watchmen doesn't just show a guy sitting at a newsstand reading a chilling comic called The Black Freighter; it overlays passges from the book into the main narrative and throws in a biography of its creator for good measure.  We don't just see a militantly right-wing newspaper editor thundering his philosophy at a hapless underling; we get to read one of his editorials for ourselves.  Watchmen isn't just action or intrigue for its own sake; everything has its context.<br /><br />Much as I hate to say it, the above review has been woefully inadequte, but there's just so much in here that's worth thinking and writing about that it's pretty much impossible to encapsulate it in a few paragraphs.  Similarly, it's hard to digest everything in this book without some careful reading, but in the end it's more than worth it.  Actually, if I had to come up with a complaint about Watchmen, it's that the ending is a bit of a letdown, but after the sustained brilliance that preceded it, that was practically inevitable.

In fact, it FORCES its readers to think by plunging them headfirst into a plot that's unintelligible UNLESS one is actively thinking.  It completely destroys the typical image of innocent comics and simply superheroes.  Rorschach is not the Dark Knight; he's the mirror image of the darkest in all of us.  Dr. Manhattan isn't the American Superman; he's God, and he doesn't care about humanity.  Ozymandias isn't the world's golden boy, Laurie isn't Catwoman...I could go on forever.

Here, superheros, or \\""masked adventurers\\"" are real, Nixon has been elected to a fourth term (after winning the war in Vietnam), cars run on electric power, and the US and the USSR come within a hair's breadth of nuclear war. Its basic plot is a detective story, when various superheroes, retired after a 1977 act made their work illegal, band together to face a threat, while looking back to their days of glory.<br /><br />The superheros of WATCHMEN are ordinary men skilled in brawling or able to come up with clever technological solutions. The only character with true super-human powers is one Dr Manhattan, a former physicist who after a research accident has become nearly omnipotent and omniscient. Exploring the consequences of a human being elevated to knowing the future and able to do anything he desires is one of the truly original concepts in WATCHMEN, and Moore deserves praise.<br /><br />With all the entertaining aspects of the storytelling, it's a pity that the writing has several serious failings. Moore's plot wraps up far too quickly. I suppose that in order to hit with maximum impact, Moore wanted it all explained within one issue instead of leaving the reader to wait another month. Furthermore, the ending involves the trope of the super-villian explaining his whole scheme to the heroes before doing them in. And while one can expect some amount of psedoscience with a character like Dr Manhattan, there are some shoddy mistakes here, such as claiming Mars' surface is made of \\""silicone\\"", and unrealistically mild weather in Antarctica. While WATCHMEN has been lauded for elevating the comic format to legitimate literature, writing like this shows that regrettably it still has some way to go.<br /><br />I felt that WATCHMEN was entertaining, and the character of Dr Manhattan quite interesting, but the work is nowhere near the perfection that many fans claim it to be.ut the work is nowhere near the perfection that many fans claim it to be.",2006-03-14

They sort of intrigued me when I first learned of their existence years ago, but I just didn't grow up in a place that made them available, and I never had enough money to develop a taste. But then, about a month ago, I happened upon Time's list of top hundred great novels from the last century, and I noticed Alan Moore's Watchmen on the list. It intrigued me that a graphic novel was on the list. So, I read it, and now, I think I'm hooked.<br /><br />I was really astounded by the high literary value of the work. Watchmen doesn't require that you come to the story with any particular familiarity of specific superheroes (which is perhaps another reason I'd never jumped into the genre). Only a concept of the superhero was needed, and that's, of course, something that I couldn't escape growing up with. That said, it does require that you read intelligently. Allusions to literary figures and philosophical ideas abound. Images reoccur and are developed throughout the book, both in the prose and in the pictures.

But, as is so rarely the case, the hype is true. Nothing could possibly be the same in comics after something like Watchmen. The heroes aren't really heroes, but far from being the cookie-cutter antihero, they have surprising depth and emotion. They all perceive the world in radically different ways, and it's apparent in the way Moore writes. For example, Dr. Manhattan, the blue superhuman with the power to manipulate atoms, is narrated like no superhero has ever been before. He exists in several places at once, experiences the future, past, and present simultaneously. He has the power of God. Yet, at the same time, he is so lost in the world, he ends up having to desert it for Mars. And there's not a single moment when the reader won't sympathize with him.<br /><br />The characters are some of my favorites outside of Transmetropolitan. Despite their silly names and costumes (even sillier than the average superhero, if you can believe it), they all have a startling three dimensionality to them.<br /><br />The story is interesting and unique, starting with the murder of one of the few remaining active heroes, The Comedian, (see what I said about the silly names?

The chapters on Rorschach's and Dr Manhattan's histories especially stick out as some of my favorite in the book. Every character had realistic motivations for donning the mask. At least, more realistic than normal. But their actions once they were in the mask were occasionally questionable. Outside of two or three of the half-dozen primary characters and two of the supporting characters, everyone seemed to have a static archetype meant to further the story.<br /><br />The symbols and motifs utilized, for the most part, were very effective.

As an introduction to the genre, it is a work of epic proportions that will keep you glued to the pages well into the late hours of the night.<br /><br />It starts as a murder mystery. The victim was a \\""costumed vigilante\\"" called The Comedian, whose career began in the late 1930's. In the first chapter, we meet several of his contemporaries, most of whom are in forced retirement. It turns out that society eventually rebelled against the plethora of \\""caped crusaders.\\"" Congress passed a law banning super-heroes after a nation-wide police strike to protest their activities. One of the \\""masks\\"", a mysterious characters known as Rorschach, refused to retire.

We meet Dr. Manhattan, a being with god-like superpowers that are the result of a nuclear accident in the 1950's.

Confined to a nursing home, mom is vicariously attempting to continue an adventurous life through her daughter's exploits. Rorschach is the abused, bastard son of a prostitute, but his psychotic behavior is based on a noble value system. Dr. Manhattan is a bit like Vonnegut's Billy Pilgrim from Slaughterhouse Five in that he lives simultaneously in the past, present, and future.<br /><br />The second chapter revolves around the funeral of The Comedian, and we see him through the eyes of different people who knew him during his career. It is not a pretty picture. For a \\""good guy,\\"" he is not what you would call a role-model. The flash-backs segue with the funeral in a fluid, almost cinematic way. It might take the reader a while to get used to the segues between action taking place simultaneously in New York and California. In another cinematic device, the words from one scene are frequently superimposed on the images of the other. This is actually preparing the reader for things to come.<br /><br />There is a very interesting sub-plot which involves a kid reading a \\""traditional\\"" comic book, a pirate story, in which the words and images fuse with the events going on around him. In fact, a lot of the story takes places in a neighborhood in New York City which centers around one intersection where an old man runs a news stand. Most of the characters eventually pass through this intersection and pass the boy reading his comic, although none engage him in conversation. It really takes a second reading to appreciate the importance of this corner, and the way in which the characters have been so long inter-related without being aware of each other.<br /><br />This work was originally published over the course of a year, in twelve monthly installments as a \\""maxi-series\\"" of comic books.

There is a page from Rorschach's police blotter and psychiatric reports from the foster home where he was raised. The essay entitled, \\""Dr. Manhattan: Super-powers and the Superpowers,\\"" explores the geo-political consequences of having a real superman on America's side.<br /><br />Alan Moore spent five years creating this story, and the beauty of it is that he has described each panel in such intricate detail that Dave Gibbons' pen makes us forget we are looking at static pictures on paper. There are several scene's involving Rorschach where we are treated to three or more pages of nine panels each where there is not a single word spoken, nor is any needed. There are other places where the segue between two scenes is like a cinematic dissolve, because the graphic elements of the two panels are identical. The words and pictures of the pirate story that the kid is reading are intermixed with the words and pictures of the story we are reading. The symbols of one matching the symbols of another form a kind of verbal/visual pun-manship which is delightful.<br /><br />The title Watchmen is derived from the same source as the epigraph of the Tower Commission Report; \\""Quis custodiet ipsos custodes,\\"" or \\""Who watches the watchmen?\\"" Watchmen starts as a murder mystery, and ends with a man killing half the population of New York City in order to save the world from thermonuclear destruction.

The essay entitled, \\""Dr. Manhattan: Super-powers and the Superpowers,\\"" explores the geo-political consequences of having a real superman on America's side.<br /><br />Alan Moore spent five years creating this story, and the beauty of it is that he has described each panel in such intricate detail that Dave Gibbons' pen makes us forget we are looking at static pictures on paper. There are several scene's involving Rorschach where we are treated to three or more pages of nine panels each where there is not a single word spoken, nor is any needed. There are other places where the segue between two scenes is like a cinematic dissolve, because the graphic elements of the two panels are identical. The words and pictures of the pirate story that the kid is reading are intermixed with the words and pictures of the story we are reading. The symbols of one matching the symbols of another form a kind of verbal/visual pun-manship which is delightful.<br /><br />The title Watchmen is derived from the same source as the epigraph of the Tower Commission Report; \\""Quis custodiet ipsos custodes,\\"" or \\""Who watches the watchmen?\\"" Watchmen starts as a murder mystery, and ends with a man killing half the population of New York City in order to save the world from thermonuclear destruction.

This superheroes that mr MOore created in this comic book all have those traits, all of them seem as if they were real people but the fun part of the story is that they're really not.<br /><br /> The storyline might be a bit dated, ( the cold war being over I mean ) but if you read it from the point of view of back then, is still a preety good story. My favorite character was Rorschach, he is describen in detail in this book, and I felt sorry for they way he was treated and looked at troughout, I thought he was the most interesting character in the story.

The common thread found in the negative reviews was that they had heard alot about it and decided to give it a look, expecting it to blow their minds away. This mindset will only work against any possible enjoyment which may be gleaned from this work, since it is in the small details that make the Watchmen such a fascinating deconstruction of the medium (sequential art) and it's typical subject matter (super hereo's). None of these 'loser' superheroes are superhuman save for one (a god-like character whom is disinterested in human affairs), but deeply flawed human beings that need to dress up in a costume as much as someone \\""needs a beer,\\"" or coffee, or a smoke. This is a character based/driven narrative with numerous threads that seem only losely conected until the final panel. It is highly political in the undertow of it's narrative flow, but is concerned less with what political figures and events are depicted and more with the themes revolving around them; less an attempt at prophecy and more of a what if? Much of this is accomplished with the layout and art, which isn't flashy or visceral like fellow comic books. Dave Gibbons acheives much more by stripping it down to the basics describing tone not through line work but through choice of color palette achieving  a subtlty not unlike a Kubrick film.

Although for decades many individuals had been taking comics seriously, Alan Moore managed in a single blow to explode every assumption anyone had made about the potential of the genre.  In the world of the novel, it would have been as if the most ambitious novel ever written had been TREASURE ISLAND and the next thing to appear had been WAR AND PEACE.  Moore created a tale whose ambition outstripped anything that had ever before appeared in the world of the comic, and he executed it, with the brilliant assistance of illustrator Dave Gibbons and colorist John Higgins, with a brilliance and virtuosity hitherto unknown.  With WATCHMEN, the graphic novel had come of age, and many believe that even to this day it remains unsurpassed.<br /><br />They say the devil is in the details, and what makes WATCHMENT brilliant is as much the details as the main elements.  There are sections of the novel where Moore will be juggling several strands of the story at once, some crucial to the tale as a whole, others symbolic embellishment, and yet there is nary a moment when everything is less than perfect.  Even if one has read a host of other graphic novels, there are numerous points in this book where one has to just halt and say to oneself, \\""Comics just aren't supposed to be this good.\\""<br /><br />Essentially, WATCHMEN is about a plot to socially reengineer a better society.  That this is the story is only gradually revealed.  In fact, the book is nearly complete when the plot fully emerges.  Along the way we are introduced to a completely new and exceedingly compelling group of super heroes.  There is Rorschach, a singularly dedicated crime fighter whose mask hides an almost comically ugly visage.  There is Nite Owl, the second person to sport that identity, and the super intelligent Ozymandias.  Then there is The Comedian, who is less a funny guy as someone who realizes that the whole shebang is one big joke.  Above all, there is the blue-bodied Dr. Manhattan, the only one of the bunch with genuine super powers, but powers so excessive to make Superman seem a wimp, since he has the capacity by sheer willpower alter the physical reality around him (in a fight between the Man of Steel and Manhattan, the latter need only will everything to change to kryptonite), someone in fact more godlike than anything.<br /><br />The novel is also extraordinary for the entire world Moore imagines.  Because with Dr. Manhattan's help he was able to bring about victory in Vietnam, Richard Nixon repealed the amendment preventing anyone serving as present for more than two terms, and has continued to serve as president well into the 1980s.  With Dr. Manhattan tilting the balance of power sharply towards the United States, for whom he serves, the Soviets have had to acquiesce in all foreign policy matters.  But when he disappears, the Russians begin driving through Afghanistan and into Pakistan (an area of the world still very much in the news).  Nuclear war threatens.  No description I can make of the novel can do justice to its richness and complexity.  But this at least, I hope, gives some hint of the way that WATCHMEN strives for a narrative richness previously not seen in the comic genre.<br /><br />My one complaint with the book is in the ending.  I find it as unsatisfying as the ending of one of the greatest Sci-fi novels ever written, THE HUMANOIDS.  But while one might quibble with the desirability of the end, one can't argue that this isn't a brilliantly conceived and executed work of art.  It truly and legitimately stands as one of the great artistic achievements of recent decades.<br /><br />There have been over the years frequent attempts to bring WATCHMEN to the silver screen.  I personally think this would be a dreadful mistake.  There is simply too much content in the novel for a 120-minute or even 180-minute film to do justice to it.  Director and erstwhile cartoonist for Monty Python Terry Gilliam once indicated that he would love to do it as a twelve-part mini-series, and I think that would be absolutely perfect.  One of the things that makes WATCHMEN so brilliant is the rich detail contained within it--such as the brilliant pirate comic contained with the novel as a whole--and I think that cutting all that detail out, which a feature film would necessitate, would be a tragic mistake.  A twelve-part mini-series on, say, HBO, would result in around 660 minutes in contrast with the at-most 180 minutes of a film.<br /><br />The degree to which WATCHMEN has come to be perceived as one of the pinnacles of the graphic novel can be seen in an episode from the first season of THE O.C.  Seth, the comic/alt music geek on the show (whose taste in both areas are, by the way, tres cool, cognizant of Frank Miller, Alan Moore, The Shins, and Modest Mouse) tries to educate his later-to-be-girlfriend Summer on the modern comic, and suggests that she start with WATCHMEN, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, and the Sandman series.  And when he creates a Starter-Set for contemporary culture, he includes WATCHMEN along with an album by the Shins and Michael Chabon's THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY.

A man has just been murdered. Someone broke into his apartment while he was home and after a struggle the man was thrown through his window many floors above the street. The evidence points to a burglary gone wrong and even though the investigators aren't so sure they want to keep the case low profile so as not to draw the attention of any Masked Avengers (Vigilantes who used to patrol the city). Even though most of them have retired or been forced into retirement by the government, Rorschach is still active and has already taken note of the murder and become interested in the victim's identity.<br /><br />Rorschach's discovery of the victim's identity leads him to making contact with his old teammates from the Minutemen as Rorschach fears that someone is gunning for masked adventurers. Both past and present adventure ensues.<br /><br />This story was excellent and was probably one of the best written comic book/graphic novels I have read. This was originally released around 1986/87 as 12 separate comic books. I can't imagine having read this one chapter at a time then having to wait a month for the next installment. Luckily it has been collected in graphic novel form. The story revolves around the retired members of the old Minutemen group. Each member is visited by Rorschach as he attempts to warn them that someone may be gunning for them. In turn each character is reminded of their time in the group and begins to remember and reflect on the past and were are party to these reflections. The reward is characters with great depth coupled with an enjoyable and complex story (for a comic book) with a bonus.

You grow to respect the characters as more than 2 dimensional storyboards. In this world of masked vigilantes driven to dish out justice as a novelty hobby, they are faced with the concept of a real life superhero changing their very existence, making them obsolete. The younger generation just cannot let go of the concept of dressing up and fighting crime and continue despite the appearance of the \\""God Among Men\\"".

The hallmark is that not much here is black and white. The result is a confronting, engrossing, extensive work, which re-invented and challenged the genre and promotes the necessity for individual opinion in readers, by leaving so much firmly in the grey.<br /><br />In the end we are left to think about whether or not 'The end can justify the means'....and there is a strong echo of Hiroshima here. Obviously it can't..and must never. But here, a global solution to focus people's attentions away from war was to introduce something alien. The question of 'Who watches the watchmen?' underpins and concludes the whole book. It is one of power and responsibility, and the idea of the Watchmen being free from this, to act freely, and to have greater influence than those people who are restrained from acting properly by their systems and nations, is portrayed with unfortunately, similarly threatening results. It can only prompt individual thought and better collaboration through its lesson.<br /><br />Although it can be a bit too indulgent, and the 'comic within a comic' is given too much space, other elements that should attract you are its realism, its character depth and the unique figure of the Comedian.

And it was a graphic novel.<br /><br />Most people criticize comics as the stuff of adolescent boys, something that dreams and fantasies are made of. Watchmen is different. It was written way back in 1986, so its by far nothing new. Even so, Watchmen has a definite adult theme (when i say 'graphic' novel, i don't just mean pictures), and im sure most people would have little trouble getting into it. The themes of humanity and philosophy are better than most books that Ive read.<br /><br />Watchmen takes place in 1985, mostly in New York. In 1977, an act was passed banning all 'vigilantes'...but you can call them superheros. So, years later, all of the retired superheros are busy carrying out a normal, every day life. That is, until October 12th, 1985, when a former comrade, Edward Blake \\""The Comedian\\"", is brutally murdered. The only one still acting as a Vigilante, Rorschach (Roor-shark), suspects something and begins to investigate. Rorschach begins to piece together a mystery that he dubs the \\""Mask Killer\\"" as more vigilantes are killed. The most powerful superhero, Jon \\""Dr. Manhattan\\"", is exiled from planet earth (Jon is the only superhero in the book with the typical superhuman powers, everyone else is decidedly human) and then things take a serious turn south. World war three looms near as Russian troops invade Afghanistan and the threat of full scale nuclear war seems very real. Rorschach still believes his theory that the killings and war are connected, but has a tough time convincing his fellow vigilantes. The tension mounts very quickly as the chapters unfold.<br /><br />Thats the basic story, but theres plenty more to it. There is TONS of depth to the characters, each one has his or her back story explained thoroughly. This book has everything from immense personal conflicts to political dilemmas. The storytelling is just flat out amazing, through the cunning use of flashbacks and alternate themes, its seems very much like an extremely well directed movie. There are plenty of details to watch for in many of the panels, and writers Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons make sure to bring past occurrences up again and again...there isn't a wasted scene in the book. I was blown away at just how everything was so thought out. The characters are memorable too, and are all very human, something most superhero stories lack. Rorschach is now my favorite superhero, and you'll see why after a few pages with this mysterious, bad ass, masked, monotone figure. Everything about this book is just awesome...no wonder it won the Hugo Award in 1988, the prestigious Science Fiction award that the likes of Orson Scott Card have won.<br /><br />Sure there are better drawn comics out there, but few things can match Watchmen's storytelling, story, characters, and presentation.

For one thing, he calls comic books, (which I prefer to the pretentious term, Graphic Novels,) a 'Child's medium'.  Now I'm not sure if I should consider that prejudice or ignorence, but either way it's wrong.  I have a feeling he may actually have a thing against comics, seeing as he also gave the Pulitizer winning Maus, (which I also highly recommend,) a one star review.  Perhaps his review of Watchmen is merely another means to sustain his prejudice by slamming the very work that best shows how not just comics, but superhero comics can reveal things to us about ourselves and society.  Oh well, on to the book then...<br /><br />I really don't want to talk about the plot since that can be gathered from other reviewers' articles, instead I'd rather discuss some literary aspects of Watchmen instead.  A good companion to this book is another mini-series released at almost the exact same time as this, Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns.  Where Miller builds upon the Batman mythos to create a redefinition of what a superhero can be, Moore totally deconstructs the superhero genre from the inside out, dealing with the darker side of our facination with superheros.  Another concept central to the book is the consequences of what happens when regular people have godlike control over events and make godlike decisions that affect everyone, (a comment on Nuclear War, another key theme of Watchmen?  Interestingly, this analogy applies even better to the terrorists of the present...)  Moore provides us with excellant characters here who provide differant insights into the morality of making such decisions, (the most famous and memorable probably being Rorshach, who is scarily magnetic.)  But one thing that sets this apart from other tales of morality is Moore's complete lack of jugement of the characters; you can actually tell alot about a person by which characters they believe did the right thing.  However, what keeps bringing me back to Watchmen is the insane amount of detail.  In the span of twelve chapters, Moore creates a completely believeable world with more than 50 years of history and he's managed to cram in so many small things into the corners that say miles about some characters, that it'll take several readings to completely understand the whole book, (I've read it upward of 8 times and I'm still finding new things.)<br /><br />All in all, I can't recommend Watchmen more.  It's the Citizen Kane of mainstream comics and should not be missed.  More has remained a very prolific writer since Watchmen, but I doubt he (or anyone for that matter,) will ever reach the level he achived here ever again.  It's a masterpiece, plain and simple.  Buy it and prepare to have your head exploded.<br /><br />(P.s.

Read the book.","This book is so incredibly brilliant, my words alone can't do it even a fraction of the justice it deserves. A graphic novel that changed the way we think about comics, written by transcendent literary genius Alan Moore, Watchmen offers a look at superheroes as they would appear in real life. Driven only by enthusiasm and determination, without the benefit of superpowers (except for Dr. Manhattan, the science-born hero), these heroes live in the US of an alternate Earth, where they have fought through the 20th century, meeting with public support, distrust and sometimes hatred. These heroes are more realistic versions of traditional superhero archetypes, bearing the faults and shortcomings of rational behavior and honest human nature. For instance, the crusading vigilante (Rorschach) is a mentally-disturbed murderer, the all-powerful science-born hero (the aforementioned Dr. Manhattan) is so all-powerful he lacks concern for the world around him, and the technological genius inventor (Nite Owl, my personal favorite) is out of shape and overly dependent on his gadgets. This alternate world is equally different and unusual, history having been changed by the superheroes: Richard Nixon is still President in 1985, the US won the Vietnam War easily and World War III looms on the horizon.<br /><br />The story begins with the mysterious death of nasty, thuggish government-agent hero, the Comedian. All the superheroes have recently been forced into retirement by a government order due to public pressure (another clever example of how superheroes & reality don't mix well), and no one is able to fully investigate. However, as tension mounts and more heroes are targeted, the remaining superheroes are drawn out of retirement to solve the mystery and unravel a plan that will... well, I won't spoil it.<br /><br />The really great thing about this book is that it's impossible to predict accurately what comes next. Even the most observant reader or brilliant detective won't be ableto guess the ending (and that's a fact). And trust me, you'll like it that way! You will also love how the story looks at ordinary civilians as well as superheroes. In this way, the reader is kept abreast of the opinions, anxieties and issues of the everyday people. In fact, some of the most interesting characters are these cameo-appearance civilians: the editor of the \\""New Frontiersman\\"", the boy who's always reading comics and the prison psychologist, among others.<br /><br />I can't say anymore without giving away the entire plot (if I haven't already) except to praise this book to the skies once more. Watchmen is truly one of a kind, the greatest testament in existence to Alan Moore's genius (and that's saying a lot!). Its every page is richly layered with poetic text, insightful, thought-provoking content and cleverly hidden metaphoric messages, complemented by superb artwork. In short, it is impeccable, brilliant and nothing short of revolutionary. If you consider yourself a comic book fan, or a literary gourmet of any kind, read this book. Read Watchmen.",2004-11-23

It had a very good story for a comic. Most superhero stuff is kinda flat and predictable, but there is all sort of things going on in Watchmen. I liked the authenticity of it - it felt like it could really happen. I know superheros are a fantasy, but its fun to look at what would probably happen if they were real/ or lived in a realistic world.<br /><br />The writing by Alan Moore was top-notch, although kinda wordy at times and confusing with 2 or 3 plots running at once. The art was equally good, Dave Gibbons doing the majority of the artwork.<br /><br />If you're a fan of superhero comics, and if you're an adult(this has some nudity in it and violence and such), check this out.

Alan Moore, whom wrote this and wrote several other sucessful comics like Swamp Thing, is a brilliant writer. He's really created a world that is unlike anything you've ever read. What makes Alan Moore a very different comic writer is the fact that he does not like the idea of superheroes or supervillians. He created this story, in my opinion, with hopes of destroying and demoralizing the idea of superheroes.<br /><br />This story is very complex. There are alot of backstories and flashbacks.<br /><br />It doesn't really do me any good to try to explain the story to you, because it's very complicated.

Why does an individual choose to put on a 'halloween costume' and fight crime? To see Justice fulfilled? No. Moore teaches us that Justice's got nothing to do with this. It deals more intimately with psychosis, childhood traumas and abuse, personality disorders, sexual perversion and other not so merry instances of human existance.<br /><br />Aside from the profound psychological debate surrounding the characters, the plot offers a terrible and shivering conundrum which keeps the reader stuck to the book, at times willing to skip meals and sleep hours in order to get through the whole thing (that was personally my case).<br /><br />Absolutely astounding and worth every penny.",2004-09-25

An alternate reality where the United States won Vietnam (thanks to Dr. Manhattan--the book's only Superman) and as a result Nixon stayed President. Dirgibles instead of airplanes can be seen in the sky, there are electric powered cars and a popular fast food chain of Indian restaurants known as Gunga Diner are everywhere.<br />In this world, superheroes have been outlawed because the police felt that their jobs were threatened and so only Government sanctioned costumed heroes can legally operate. That doesn't stop Rorschach, a masked vigilante from plying his trade.<br />Why am I going into all this detail? Because Watchmen is all about the details. Moore and Gibbons vividly draw us into this world through the most minute details, often populating the backgrounds of panels so that they only become obvious upon multiple readings.<br />What is so astounding about Watchmen is that it works on so many levels. Superficially, it's a murder mystery. However, it also asks many big questions like, who makes the world? Who is responible? Is everything planned out or is it all up to chance?<br />Watchmen is also a marvel of technique. Moore and Gibbons employ all sorts of film techniques (zoom ins, close-ups, revolving &quot;the camera&quot; around somebody, lighting effects, etc) and also several techniques of rhythm. For example, look closely at the panel layout for Chapter 5: Feaful Symmetry.

You speculate on how things are going to develop in the near future, and you gamble on factors beyond comprehension.  And sometimes your story is OTBE--OverTaken By Events.  That's exactly what happened to this deserved classic.  And now it's become old hat.<br />When it was new, it provided a new view of costumed superheroes.  With their reliance on law and order, but their willingness to disregard the legitimate establishment in pursuit of their goals, they are deeply conflicted people.  But Superman and Spider-Man had disregarded this reality up to that point.  Alan Moore was the first person to investigate the flawed identities of comic-book heroes in light of how human beings relate in the real world.<br />Superheroes are seen as rapists, serial killers, men and women with vendettas.  Or they're would-be actors looking to boost their profile.  Old grudges and doubts fester under the surface for decades, unable to find release and healing.  They suffer sexual dysfunction which affects their crime-fighting techniques.  And their defense of the old order against reformers and non-conformists leads to the stifling of honest forward growth.<br />Now that Wolverine and Wonder Woman have to deal with existential dramas growing out of their vocations, this attitude isn't groundbreaking.  A reader coming to this story from contemporary comic books will find the points, which had to be examined in detail when they were new and revolutionary, to be belabored now that they're commonplace.<br />There is supplementary prose material at the back of each chapter.

But neither, I believe is it the stunning end-all achievement that it is made out to be.  It's greatest strength, obviosly, is that it's a book of morally ambiguous ideas.  The Watchmen are an assemblage of heroes who's actions are a critique of superhero culture and of the ideas that lie therein.  It is a facinating look at an alternate future, shaped in small ways by the existance of super heroes for both good and evil.<br />Where it falls flat is that it simply feels like it's nothing but ideas.  Consequently the book feels less like a coherant story and more like an aglomeration of ideas and visceral violence.  To be sure, the themes are interesting, but the whole book starts to feel like one of those third rate Heinlein novels that degenerates from storytelling into expostulation about the morality of a world that doesn't exist.<br />Which I guess brings me to my main complaint.  At their best, comic book heroes are a critique and a reflection of the complex morality and themes of the real world.  Instead, Watchmen seems like a critique of a fake world of superheroes, examining a looking glass through another looking glass.<br />In a way, I actually found Moore's 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' to be a more interesting critique, if only because it seems that Moore actually likes the characters from 19th century British Literature, whereas it's pretty clear from his other writings that he doesn't really like or respect modern superheroes.  The character's there have massive flaws, and exist in a complex, morally ambiguous world just like the Watchmen, but somehow feel more real in their anachronistic world than the Watchmen do.<br />Again, I should say that I did like Watchmen.  I just didn't like it all that much.  And even if I did, it really doesn't deserve to be diefied like it is.

I've finally read it, and I was wrong. It deserves its reputation. Violence serves theme and plot without being exploitative.<br />SPOILER: I'll discuss the story's ending. I'll also compare Watchmen to other works, such as Kingdom Come.<br />I think Watchmen is basically a condemnation of ubermensch theory (Nietzsche's idea that \\""supermen\\"" are entitled to violate society's moral laws, imposing their will on those \\""inferior\\"" to themselves.  Hitler infamously used the theory to justify Nazism. I concede I am no expert on Nietzsche.), and an accusation that superhero stories endorse this philosophy by lionizing vigilantes. Watchmen also attacks the genre's simplistic good vs. evil morality.<br />Only one character has \\""superpowers\\"" to justify claims of superiority, yet Dr. Manhattan takes too little interest in human affairs to want to control others. On the contrary, he lets himself be used as a tool, hoping to retain his humanity by pleasing people. Yet he's now too detached to morally judge his orders, becoming a living military weapon. Apparently, desire for power over others is for mortals living among mortals--like Ozymandias, the archetypal Aryan \\""superman\\"": a blonde, blue-eyed, physically perfect, supremely brilliant, self-made billionaire.<br />Achieving peace through slaughter, Ozymandias, like his hero Alexander, embodies Nietzsche's belief that ends justify means. If paradise is attainable through atrocities, as Nazi and Soviet propaganda claimed, is it worth it? And, once the eggs are broken, should one reap the benefits of the sin? (I ask this sitting comfortably in California, stolen first from Native Americans, then from Mexico.)<br />Rorschach--Watchmen's brutal, uncompromising conscience--says no, and his journal seems to give him the last word. Yet Rorschach tortures for information, sometimes needlessly. Besides, his winning may mean Armageddon.<br />In keeping with a thought experiment in Nietzsche's worldview, Watchmen's universe is an apparently godless one, as stated by several characters. Crime and Punishment's Raskolnikov justifies murder through Neitzschean arguments, but then feels remorse and, through this reluctant acceptance of higher morality, comes to believe in God. C.S. Lewis's arguments in favor of God's existence hinge on morality's independence of human preference. Watchmen's ending is too ambiguous for any divinely transcendent morality or providence to be clear to the characters or reader. As a Christian, I acknowledge the realism of this ambiguity, for even assuming that God exists and His will constitutes absolute morality, His moral intent is rarely as discernable in real life as in melodramas (the classic example of divine inscrutibility being Job's sufferings in the Bible). As Hollis Mason says in chapter 3, \\""Real life is messy, inconsistent, and it's seldom when anything really gets resolved.\\""<br />I like Watchmen--but fear I now better understand why the genre degenerated following its publication. It's a damning attack on superheroes, yet publishers couldn't stop printing their bread and butter, so self-indictment pervaded superhero books of the following years as they struggled with Moore's accusations. Also, as Neil Gaiman observes in his introduction to Busiek's \\""Astro City: Confessions,\\"" the easiest \\""riff\\"" of both Watchmen and Miller's \\""Dark Knight Returns\\"" for hacks to steal was darkness, not depth.<br />There are other reasons for the so-called \\""Iron Age's\\"" violent nihilism besides Watchmen and DKR's influence. Such trends were already growing in early 80's comics. DC had ravaged almost its entire stock of characters in 1985's \\""Crisis on Infinite Earths.\\"" There was also the need to satisfy reader bloodlust once the maligned Comics Code, for better or for worse, became a rubber stamp. Universally recognized characters synonymous with virtue in the public imagination became brutal, wrathful, petty--and if heroes became jerks, villains became the most lurid sadists imaginable.

Still, I obsessively post this review because I feel almost required as a comic book fan to say how great Watchmen is.<br />&quot;Watchmen&quot; focuses on a world which is one step away from nuclear warfare between America and a vague Soviet threat. Takes place almost entirely in New York City which is functionally drawn by Dave Gibbons. The art is different from a comparable story like &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; which has a similar setting and plot. While Dark Knight uses painted art, Watchmen has the four colors scheme which many people are familiar with, I think that the art never holds the story back, but it also never really elevates Moore's story to another level. Functional.<br />There are a lot of colorful characters;  I like Rorschach most, whenever he wasn't on the page, I would wonder what he was doing. Rorschach is actually one of the last masked adventurers left, because the government has prohibited vigilante activity. At first, Rorschach is the sole protagonist of the story, but others are pretty rapidly revealed to the reader, from the blue bodied Dr. Manhattan to the Smartest Man in the World, Adrian Veidt.<br />I really liked to find out more and more about these people, and whenever Moore chooses to elaborate on a character's personality or origins, it's usually pertinent to the greater plot.<br />Plotwise, &quot;Watchmen&quot; is remarkable. Although it looks pretty long this is an extremely tight collection, it moves well towards the ending, which is mind blowing.<br />I would reccomend &quot;Watchmen&quot; to mature people in general, it's appeal reaches beyond the cognoscenti of the comic book world, I had only read &quot;Preacher&quot; and &quot;Dark Knight Returns&quot; before reading Watchmen at first, and I loved Watchmen. However, it's pretty bloody, although not even nearly as bloody as a comic like Preacher, and it's somewhat profane although also not on the level of Preacher. It's probably like a 4 on the violence meter and 2 on the profanity meter, if Preacher was a 10.<br />A good reason to buy this, as opposed to read this in the store, is that it's pretty long. I guess that someone could feasibly complete Watchmen in one sitting, but it took me a few hours to do, and I think it would have really detracted from my overall experience to rush it. Also this is a pretty serious graphic novel, it has lots of nice layers and it's the type of thing that I imagine most people will read a few times.",2004-03-08

It bears many of the hallmarks of great literature, like an investigation of substantial themes (use and abuse of power, moral responsibility, fate vs. chance or free will, hubris, etc.) and their effects on everday people, well-rounded characters that you can never fully love or hate precisely because they're more like real people than cardboard cutouts, a multi-layered and partially self-referential narrative structure, and more.<br />Part of what makes this story so entertaining and thought provoking is the way it makes full use of its chosen medium. Watchmen is filled with visual/textual puns (not often of the humorous variety, unless it's black humor) and running visual commentaries on the text and vice versa. The medium allows Moore and Gibbons to feature mirrored or parallel strands of ideas or narrative at the same time instead of having to switch back and forth, as in purely text-based fiction.<br />As for the art, it's straightforward and effective and finely detailed, if a bit anonymous in technique and style. Actually, a more prominent, personal style arguably would have detracted from Watchmen; the seeming prosaic anonymity of the art lends the fictional world more verisimilitude--an \\""everyday\\"" look for a world of relatively realistic people you're supposed to believe in, as opposed to wild fantasy.<br />Speaking of the art, it's been said that the characters in Watchmen are poorly developed, and that's been chalked up to Moore. That seems to show a misunderstanding of the genre. Comics aren't simply illustratedtexts; the visuals in comics play an equal or greater role in the storytelling as the accompanying words do. As in film or theater, what you see of the characters--their expressions and body language and unique features--says at least as much as any written text. When you take both words and images into account, you can see that the characters here are indeed well rounded.<br />Overall, then, great stuff. It's fun to watch Moore and Gibbons have their cake and eat it, too, by revelling in traditional comic book superheroics while critiquing the very notion and adding many new layers of depth to it. Be sure to check out Moore's V for Vendetta, which is arguably an even more intelligent and \\""adult\\"" look at the masked \\""hero\\"".",2004-03-01

Before Watchmen, this question was completely ignored. Consequently, comics focussed more on the external battles between 'good' and evil' at the expense of studying the internal psychodynamic battles attending all superheroes.<br />The great part about reading any of Moore's stuff (V for Vendetta, From Hell, etc.), is that he's so obviously brilliant; unlike a lot of the other guys writing comics, his works contain a breadth of current societal/economic/political issues (although feminists could arguably point out that Watchmen reinforced gender inequality and traditional sex roles). In this way, the characters of Watchmen interact in a living, breathing, complex world: a 'realist' world. Moore also enjoys telling two stories at once through the use of intertextuality: in a vein similar to Shakespeare, a minor sub-plot informs the major storyline (note Moore's usage of the fictional 'Tales of the Black Freighter' as well as the clippings concluding each chapter) Watchmen's enduring contribution to the medium was his intersection of the comic world with the real world. So many complex themes and plots appearing in today's comics (the morally problematic hero, the sympathetic villain, drug addiction, rape, etc.) derive directly from this great and important work that dared to imagine how superheroes would really fare in the present time.<br />It should also be noted that Dave Gibbons' art had a lot to with the boldness and brilliance of Watchmen: his clever use of close-ups/fades, morphing, and cut-away techniques hearken to mind the approach of a film director rather than a traditional comics illustrator. Gibbons ably brought to life the multifaceted world envisioned by Moore and in the process greatly opened up the possibilities available to the comics illustrator.<br />Almost twenty years later, Watchmen continues to astound readers and stands heads and shoulders above anything preceding or succeeding it. I am yet to read a single graphic novel that astounded me in its scope and originality as this one did.

At the same time, though, such further readings do emphasize a few limitations, namely a very even tone (despite the wide array of approaches used, both in the text itself and at the end of each chapter), a tendency to overstress some points (which dilutes the sheer power of certain events) and a somewhat unbalanced structure that hinders the last tier. Its novelty lies more in its massive stature than in its themes: a world has been created in Watchmen's pages, with elaborate codes that remain true from the beginning to the conclusion. There's a very high sense of cohesion, not only in the story but also between the writing and the art, to the point where it becomes difficult to isolate one from the other as the project's driving force - Watchmen is as much Gibbons' book as it is Moore's. In the end, both its weaknesses and numerous strenghts have a lot to do with the series' important lenght. More than read or watch this book, one experiences it.

I say this not only including the &quot;funny-books&quot; with which this title shares its genre, but to the entire scope of &quot;real&quot; literature as well.  It can not be stated more clearly:  This is an important book.  It represents at its most basic level the desire for us as humans to return to a state of irresponsibility, to let someone else handle all of our problems, and how we are willing to hand all of that over at the first opportunity.<br />  The fact that America's nuclear weapons are not pointed at anyone in particular right now does not decrease this book's impact, nor does the fact that Russia seems willing to sell them to anyone in particular.  This book does not so much capture a moment in time as it relates that moment to how we live each second of our day.  In Miller's &quot;Dark Night&quot;, Jim Gordon thinks at one point of how FDR may have had prior knowledge of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.  How do you judge such a thing, he wonders to himself.  Soon, he realizes, all you can do is throw your hands up and realize that it's all too big for you, that you'll just have to trust that decision to somebody else, and pray that you'll never have to make such a decision yourself.  In a nutshell, that is what &quot;Watchmen&quot; is about.<br />  I would also like to quickly respond to other comments regarding the &quot;perfunctory&quot; quality of the art.  Dave Gibbons has crammed so much into those tiny nine panels on each page that the story could be read clearly with no dialogue whatsoever.  Unlike film, which is meant to be seen without constant review, comics are a medium which invites multiple layered readings.  This is percieved as a weakness of the form by many who are uninitiated, yet I believe the complexity of Joyce is present to all who truly understand how toread between the gutters(industry-speak for the area between panels).<br />  Putting the fancy-talk aside, though, this book remains at its core a great read.  The characters are fully formed, changing individuals.  The dialogue is informed and intelligent, and the art never cheats, never gives us an irregular bicep, veins rippling across its skin. I cannot reccomend this book enough, but whether you accept this or not is your choice, which I guess is what &quot;Watchmen&quot; is all about.",2003-11-18

For those who don't know, Watchmen is a fairly postmodern take on the idea of the super hero, incorporating him into Cold War politics and involving literal super powers in the arms race.  Which is not to say that this is some kind of Tom Clancyish techno-thriller; far from it.  The book is an intense, character-driven drama about the little people who put on the costumes and how they face the horrors that the world leaves at their doorsteps.  It's great, sweeping, human epic stuff, one part political thriller, one part whodunit, three parts character study, and I'd recommend it to nearly anyone.  The story starts with the murder of an old costume hero, and his former comrades, long since retired, who may be next on the murderer's list.<br />The writing: Moore's writing transcends the limitations on the medium and pushes it into a strange, beautiful, multi-faceted territory where the complexity of the characters' motivations put the reader in the same kind of &quot;moral checkmate&quot; that plagues the protagonists at the end of the book.  The parallel structure of the book's multiple overlapping plotlines is remeniscent of Thomas Pynchon or J.G. Ballard, and the sureness and consistency of his style keep the story flowing.  Since the plot is so complex, Moore reveals it in pieces by setting up individual chapters as studies for the individual characters, with key events seen from their unique perspectives.  As their different experiences of the same events yield more clues to the book's initial mystery, Moore uncovers something larger about the characters themselves, and maybe even people in general.<br />The artwork: Dave Gibbons's stated philosophy is that the art should get in the way of story as little as possible, and it's a philosophy which is clearly visible here.  Gibbons avoids obviously flashy layouts and silly-looking splash panels and merely tells the story.  There are no full-page panels until the final chapter of the book, which is extremely appropriate and helps the story and art blend into a single, unique creature.  His renderings are clean and balanced, and his anatomy is perfect.  The art is barely noticable the first time through, but it grows on you like fungus.<br />Overall: If there were ten stars on this list, this book would get them all.  It's a fantastic reading experience and a great introduction to a form that most people don't think twice about.  Try it out, and if you like it, try From Hell and A Small Killing.",2003-09-15

I haven't seen it yet. I checked out some of this comic literature, fascinated with the form as I am, to see if this was true. Watchmen (along with the dark knight returns) is the best that the super-hero comic ever gets (so the critics say) and if this is it, then no, it's not equal to literature. The complexity seen in a Joyce novel, or Dostoyevsky, deals with more than Alan Moore has ever done in a single work (and yes I'm including From Hell and A Small Killing, even combined if you like!).<br /><br />  Most of what this comic has to say depends upon your experience with comics in general. If you know the formula behind super-hero comics, understand some comic history (the types of heroes found in older comics of the twentieth century), and what had become of comics by 1985 (when moore was working out this graphic epic), then you will probably enjoy this a great deal. It is a good read, for a super-hero comic.<br />The art, however, is weak, even considering the time period. It is functional though and does not take away from the story, the inks do that! Comics of this time period (Dark Knight Returns and before that Ronin), had access to painted panels and were not limited to the old &quot;four colour&quot; format, which is how this is coloured. So the comic looks only mediocre, I guess it's the story that everyone is so keen on.<br />The story, on it's own, is pretty good, if a little far reaching.<br />What we have here is the world is doomed and only our cynicism can save us. This may be true. We also have a pirate comic in this comic, that very cleverly, tells almost the same story as the central comic. The pirate story imitates arcs that have happened, and that will happen while the story is carrying on outside of this realm. Reasonably clever, for a comic writer. Best of all we have a tough to figure out &quot;whodunnit&quot;, in classic pulp form. All these elements tie in together and the final volume of the story closes up all the stories quite nicely, yet I still have problems....why is that?<br />  If someone had told me that this was the best comic ever, I might have given it five stars, however, what I have been told is that this is equal to literature of the highest order. On that level I give this only three stars. It is not great literature. I finished reading it in one afternoon and had completely digested it, and read it a second time by the evening. It wasn't hard to tie it all together. I still can't figure out what happened in The Grand Inquisitor (one chapter in The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoyevsky), on anything other that a basic level. That basic level is more profound and potent than anything in Watchmen, which although good, doesn't even come close to living up to the hype as literature with super-heroes.<br />What this comic talks about more than anything is that man needs to be saved from himself, more than anything else. Heroes aren't there to save us from monsters, they're there to save us from our fellow man. The Comedian even mentions this quite explicitly. Watchmen is a good time if you know what you are getting into. It's a fun and intelligent comic that is worth reading if you like comics already.<br />Lastly, it is worth mentioning that I do believe in an objective principle in art. I believe that there is some objective force that decides once and for all that Shakespeare is better than Septembers Cosmopolitan magazine. There has to be an objective force in art or it means nothing at all (except to you alone, which is the same thing as meaning nothing at all!).

For a generation of comics fans who couldn't stand to hear \\""truth, justice and the American way\\"" one more time, \\""Watchmen\\"" gave us the travails of two generations of costumed vigilantes long after they were broken by their experiences.  Among these is the Comedian, a smiling sadist whose calling card (the smiley button) becomes the series' icon.  Unlike most heroes forced into retirement by age, restrictive legislation and a society less tolerant of costumed white males, the Comedian goes to work for the police state.  The story begins with the Comedian's  mysterious murder (mysterious because his identity was supposedly secret), and examines its effects on the remaining heroes - most of whom are out of commission.  The Comedian's death provides both a mystery and a useful device for the surviving heroes to examine where their lives and their world went wrong.  (In the world of \\""Watchmen\\"", advances in American technology allow for a world that can be safer and cleaner, but isn't; the advent of the superhero allows for a world that is safer and more respectful of the law, but doesn't; America's monopoly on superpower should make it more secure, instead, Nixon is still president when the novel begins, and the USSR and the US are set to go to war again).  Among the heroes is \\""Ozymandias\\"", a genius who patterns himself after Alexander the Great; \\""Night-Owl\\"" who relies on his own gadgetry and his knowledge of birds to fight crime; \\""Dr. Manhattan\\"", a scientist altered by a nuclear experiment into a super-powered god for whom walls of time (and clothing) mean nothing; and darkest of all, Rorschach, a vigilante of few words whose mask conceals a reservoir fueled by violence.<br />Moore and Gibbons' story patterns these heroes on movie stars.  Promising in their youth, when crime is simple and most of the crooks wentbad simply to get in on the heroes' action, the first generation quickly turns to seed, and then turns on each other with their memoirs.  Life is hardly better for the arch-criminals, including an evil magician slowly dying of a cancer and loneliness.<br />\\""Watchmen\\"" is a huge story - it was the story of the late 1980's (before the success of \\""Ninja Turtles\\"" fueled a run on independent comics).  There was talk of a movie, and fans debated who should be cast.  In the end, it was for naught - the guys who scripted \\""Lord of the Rings\\"" would have had their hands full trying to turn this complex story into a script.  \\""Watchmen\\"" cuts across timelines to revisit many of the same moments again and again, creating multiple subplots that skew these moments in different ways (one key moment is the meeting between the Comedian and Lori Jupiter, the daughter of a former fellow hero.  We relive that instant both before and after learning of how the Comedian had raped Lori's mother).  \\""Watchmen\\"" though dark, has a hidden bright side.  Because the past, present and future are all the same to Dr. Manhattan, he sees no point to trying to prevent an inevitable nuclear holocaust, yet even he is ultimately won over by the random miracles in which life is created and survived (there's got to be some reason why life manages to mature from a microscopic egg with everything going against it, and if we can't find out what that reason is, it's still worth protecting.)<br />Nowadays, it's fun to read because it's so obviously 1980's - its obsession with Vietnam (we didn't lose), Nixon, confrontation with the soviets and the end of western civilization make it less a story than a Time-Life infomercial.  Also, while revolutionary at the time, the deconstruction of heroes and heroism is hardly reason to be shocked today.  (The series debuted amid the \\""Iran-Contra\\"" scandal, as well as after a surfeit of scandals among \\""televangelists\\"", which eroded whatever popular trust in established figures Americans preserved after Watergate).  Ours is the generation of anti-heroes, Keyzer Soze, Clinton, Bush, Columbus and political correctness, Clint Eastwood in \\""Unforgiven\\"" - we're much to smart to root for a bunch of old white males in masks.<br />Still, \\""Watchmen\\"" is intricate and compelling.

There is so much going on in them that you are transfixed. I took an art history course, the prof of which said that there are certain vanishingly small moments in art history where everything balances perfectly. The composition, line and coloring in the art fit together so well that they can be compared to that moment when you're on a bicycle, you stop and the bike is in perfect equilibrium, before you have to put your feet on the ground. Michaelangelo and Raphael did lots of stuff like that. This book is that moment spread over something like 350 pages.<br />You can take this story in so many different ways. Take a look at the characters. It's got the suicidal god: Dr. Manhattan, who is all powerful, denies there's a god and gets along with no one. It's got a Nazi who happened to be the only person saying anything of moral worth. It's got bizarre fetishistic sex between two very human and imperfect people. It's got a narcissist who saves the earth in the short term, but may wind up killing it in the long term. And a love story between a rapist thug and his hystrionic victim.<br />Then there's the plot. The influences I can see are Robert Ludlum, William Burroughs, Michael Moorcock and possibly some great German Idealist systematizers. Ludlum because some of it looks an awful lot like the Matarese Circle, particularly when we find out what the threat the heroes face is in Chapter 11. William Burroughs because there tends to be a prevalance of degradation of humanist ideals, like in Naked Lunch. Michael Moorcock because Moore is a left-liberal type but doesn't believe in producing agit-prop. The moral model is closer to Bastable's misadventures than Ayn Rand. And the grand systematizers are there because everything falls into place. Like clockwork.<br />The art by David Gibbons is 100% stunning. I draw a bit and to this day I have no idea how Gibbons managed to pull off such minutely detailed miniscule amendments to drawings that came before. The one thing I found that detracted from the art was the coloring, which was garish in places.

In this saga the heroics of the main characters are merely a vague backdrop, while the everyday relationships that they share with other humans are the core of the story. Not unlike the Uncanny X-Men overhaul in the mid-70's, the Watchmen series presents very human &quot;heroes&quot; with very human problems, in a real society that has ambiguous opinions about costumed heroes and villains. Insightfully, Moore adds corporate and governmental manipulation of heroes to the mix as well. A key part of the Watchmen saga is the traditionalist artwork of Dave Gibbons, with a no-nonsense and basic construction of the pages. There is not a single non-rectangular frame in the entire Watchmen saga, and Gibbons' retro style adds to the human feeling of the story. The only weaknesses here include heavy 80's-style Cold War paranoia as the conflict behind the story, which bogs the story down with political moralizing that is getting a bit outdated.

Quite possibly so. \\""Watchmen\\"" is a self-contained story that follows two generations of costumed superheroes over several decades of their history (the story spans from the 1930s to the 1980s). Moore's characters are truly unforgettable: the violent Comedian, the Batman-like Nite Owl, the disturbed Rorschach, the dazzling Ozymandias (known as \\""the world's smartest man\\""), the sexy female crimefighter known as the Silk Spectre, the godlike Dr. Manhattan, and more. Much of these characters' lives are lived in the shadow of the Cold War and possible nuclear armageddon (a particularly resonant theme for those of us who remember that era).<br />Moore's complex story moves back and forth in time, and shifts in perspective among the main characters. As he skillfully deconstructs the concept of the costumed superhero, Moore deals with a host of potentially explosive issues: sexual violence, politics, mental illness, etc. This is very much an adult story.<br />One of the book's most intelligent devices is the alternation of the comic book format with excerpts of the story told in other media: a newspaper clipping, personal correspondence, a psychiatric report, chapters from one character's autobiography, etc. This gives the book as a whole a richer texture and a powerful satiric thrust. Along the way Moore also riffs on classic superhero story elements: the origin story, the superhero teamup story, etc.<br />The visuals in \\""Watchmen\\"" are amazing: some scenes are graphically violent and horrific; some magical and hauntingly beautiful.

Watchmen is not a story about super heroes, it's a story about very human people. I think that if we did live in a world with superheroes, this would be it.

For example, we have Rorschach, a hero gone mad after dealing with criminals for so many years that he himself uses criminal means to achieve his ends.  We have the Comedian who strikes me as a more realistic Captain America as he is ultranationalistic and very, very Republican and gung-ho about America.  There is Ozymandius, the world's smartest man (or so his p.r. people tell Americans), who has shaped his mind and body and greatly resembles Jay Gatsby from the Great Gatsby because like Jay, Ozymandius is a self-made man, but is also a dreamer who feels linked to two people in history he greatly admires because they sought to \\""unite\\"" the world, Alexander the Great and Ramses II (or as he is known in Greek, Ozymandius).  There's Dr. Manhattan, the only superpowered character in Watchmen and for that reason finds himself unable to relate to humanity over time and contemplates things that only gods could comprehend.

Needless to say, I've been sucked into the genre by these amazing stories, and I'm simply going down the list of highly acclaimed cult classics.  Of course, when I got to WATCHMEN, I was skeptical.  I'd heard of Batman and Sandman, but who the Watchmen?  Sounded kind of obscure, and fraknly, a bit phony.  Of course, after reading countless positive reviews claiming this book to be one of the absolute best in the history of comic literature, I had to pick it up.  Right off the bat, I could tell there was something special about this one, which maybe wasn't so noticeable in the others I'd read.<br />The story starts out simple enough, with the murder of a \\""superhero,\\"" called The Comedian.  He was evidently a member of a team, but only one of his former comrades, Rorschach  seems to care about his death in the slightest.  The others all remember him as a bad, immoral man, and therefore, a terrible hero.  At first, you'll be wondering why the others don't grieve for him as Rorschach does, but as you see what foul deeds he committed, you'll start arguing the other way.  Why is it that Rorschach is scouring the streets, searching for clues as to who may have killed The Comedian?  Why is Rorschach the only one who cares about the ex-superhero's falling?<br />In this book, much like in THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, superheroes are not seen simply as idols and virtual gods through the eyes of the public.  They're seen as a rebellious vigilante who disregard the police and take matters into their own hands.  This is the story of an alternate 1985 where the world is rapidly turning into a hell which humans are creating for themselves, where superheroes struggling for internal-order are hated and ridiculed for their valiant actions.  The superheroes themselves aren't all that important here--they simply represent the steriotypical masked figures in tights; a group of \\""normal\\"" citizens fighting to change matters which may very well be out of their control.  Alan Moore masterfully creates a multilayered epic sporting a fantastic script, filled with controversial dialogue and an interesting plot which changes the way people think about superheroes and comic books in general.<br />Rorschach's search for truth, along with the reader's search for explanation is explored through a series of flashbacks, side-stories and subplots.  The 417 page graphic novel is split into 12 chapters, each with little tidbits in-between, providing some interesting background information on the characters.  WATCHMEN is kind of a mini-series of comic-books, and was entirely original.  The characters had never appeared in any other comic before, and never appeared in another again.  When compared to THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, I say that WATCHMEN is slightly superior.  While THE DARK KNIGHT was an exciting and moving tale of Batman's aging and eventual returning to the superhero life, where he was needed most, it was very short (about half the length of WATCHMEN) and left open ends, which were covered in some not-as-good sequels.  WATCHMEN is simply a great solo-story which requires no background information or further reading, and boasts a strong, recurring theme: \\""Who watches the watchmen?\\""  Compared to other graphic novels, ranging mainly from 100-200 pages, WATCHMEN is significantly longer, not only giving you more of a bang for your buck, but increasing the amount of pleasure you'll experience from reading this book.<br />My only real gripe about this book is to do with the art.  Don't get me wrong--It's amazing stuff, filled with vivid colors that you wouldn't expect to see in such a dark story--but the action sequences leave something to be desired.  Compared to THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, filled with tons of cool blurs, lines and other cinematic goodies you'd expect to make a comic book feel more animated, WATCHMEN is severely lacking in that department.  If you try to see the book as a cartoon, like many of us do, it will look like a poorly animated one.  Or, simply a series of stills, which is what a comic book is, but almost all comics successfully create the illusion of animation and movement within their pages.  Nevertheless, the art is still amazing to look at, it will just require more imagination to see the characters moving.<br />If I were you, I wouldn't read any other reviews or check any futher into this great graphic novel.  If you do, you might back out, thinking that it sounds too corny or not your type of book.  Some people are turned off by the whole superhero idea, but Watchmen basically handles it in the most intimate and unconventional manner, bringing a whole new light to those imaginary masked-defenders of the Earth.  If you enjoyed THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, this should be right up your alley, delivering more of what the former excelled in.  If you aren't into comic books, then you should probably just head over to your nearest book store and read the first 10 pages or whatever.  Chances are, you'll find that you love this and then you can buy it on the spot.",2002-07-12

Reading Watchmen is part of my process of self-discovery.<br />If you know Watchmen, you'll understand why I feel the way I do.<br />If you don't (if you've been worshipping the sun at Cuzco, for instance, or the Gaukama Buddha at Kapilavastu), it's probably best if we start at the beginning.<br />It is 1985, and we live in a world that has known superheroes for thirty years or more.  Years ago, the public loved them, years ago when superheroes meant Minutemen.  But that was a long time ago.  Now there's legislation.  Superheroes aren't something that the Government want to encourage.  That's why the Watchmen had to disband.  And yet it seems that disbanding isn't enough for some people because some people - who we don't know - want the Watchmen dead .. . Rorshach (who is sort of a skinny Philip Seymour Hoffman playing Judge Dredd as Ignatius T Reilly), who is probably the finest invention within a graphic novel ever (far outstripping Miller's Dark Knight and  Morrison's Invisibles and Gaiman's Sandman and anybody else you'd care to mention), is on the case but whether he'll be able to find out who the perp is before the world ends . . . That's another matter altogether . . .<br />The use of TV, the various clocks that appear throughout (with the minute finger edging ever closer to the white nuclear midnight), the character of Rorshach (you keep coming back to that), the ketchup-streaked smiley face, the white frames, the colour, the pirate ship, the horror (the horror) . . . I could go on (and would at the least invitation). Watchmen is the first word in graphic novels, the first word.  If there was a word that could somehow suggest something was MORE than essential, that would be the word I would say to you now (and the word would trigger a Manchurian Candidate-style response from you, such that you rise from your seat and don't stop until you hold in your hands a copy of Watchmen).<br />This is the Daddy.",2002-05-23

The subtly of each characters gestures and movements should serve as a lesson to the popular school of comic artists who favor crude visceral bursts of color and speed lines. You will have to re-read Watchmen again and again, just to catch all the detail in Alan Moore's meticulously crafted script. Unfortunately, it has the occasional air of self-importance.

It is important not ignore Watchmen because it is a comic.  Watchmen is a great mystery thriller, analytical read, political commentator, and comic satire(even though I don't evactly know what is saying here) all in one.  Watchmen is character driven with a rock solid plot, the entire story relates back to one, insignificant seeming, scene, which is brilliant.<br />The use of graphic novel as a medium helps to express the multi-layered story.  After reading Watchmen, I realize that comics can portray more action, speech, narration, and characters thoughts than books, movies or any other medium.  The use of the Pirate Comic as commentary and comparison is excellent.<br />I can't understate how heavy and moving the story is.  I reflected on my entire life and beliefs after reading Watchmen, like The Matrix or American Beauty, but more heavyhanded(almost to a Fountainhead point).  I only hope I can find other comics as entertaining.<br />If you have never read comics, start here.

I enjoyed comics as a kid but gave them up until someone recommended I read Watchman.  Watchman takes characters you've never heard of and shows them in various stages of their lives and their careers.  I was skeptical those characters could be brought to life in any way close to what I know about Superman, Wolverine, Captain America and others from Marvel and DC that I grew up with.  Rest assured, these characters leap off the page and simply learning about where they come from and where they're going will keep you turning pages.<br />In Watchman, superheros are banned and each hero must find his own place in the world, either as a hero or as an \\""ordinary person\\"". Each hero gets a chapter  : Dr. Manhatten is the most powerful being on earth, Rosharch is a violent vigilante who refuses to stop his fight against crime (his chapter is worth the purchase of this book alone IMHO), the Nightowl is a middle aged pudgy rich guy who find that fighting crime is the real excitment in life, Osimandius is the smartest man in the world who believes he has the answers to all the world's problems and finally, there's the comedian who dies in the first chapter (no spoiler really) and the investigation into the  death of this fascinating character is the backdrop for the entire story.<br />Watchman makes you think - I read it in the backdrop of the 9-11 tragedy and even years after its publication, it still feels timely for me (in Watchman, the Soviets are the unstoppable menace). Watchman makes you feel - I cared what happened to every character (some more than others- the Comedian is a fascinating study of the anti-hero) and at the end of the book, I was sorry the ride was over.

However, I hadn't read the graphic novel in years, and upon re-reading it recently, I was struck by how dated it seems.<br />Yes, it's still fundamentally excellent graphically and in terms of characterization, but it no longer seems as mind-blowing as it did back in 1986. Super-hero comics are still full of the same Good-Guy-Beats-Up-Bad-Guy stuff that they've always had, just with different artists and costumes. The depth of super-hero comics certainly hasn't increased; if anything, it may have regressed since the late '80s.<br />In retrospect, one reason why Watchmen provided such exhilaration back in the day was because of the comic book's physical appearance. For the most part, comics before the mid-80s didn't look like Watchmen, with the then-fancy paper, the high production values, the ancillary material in the back of each issue, and the covers that looked like someone actually put thought into the design, rather than just slapping together something that looked, well, like a comic book.<br />Sad to say, as with the plots, the graphic designs and layouts of comics have retreated to their garish days.<br />On a broader scale, Watchmen's plot really reeks of the kind of Cold War thinking that turned out to be wildly wrong. And Alan Moore's black-and-white political speculation seems naive at best and laughable at worst, although there's still a good deal of validity to his overall views of the kind of sociological impact that a Dr. Manhattan would have.<br />Perhaps the most regrettable part of Watchmen is the ending. Several observers (including Sam Hamm, who wrote the screenplay for Tim Burton's Batman and the original Hollywood treatment for a Watchmen movie that never got beyond the planning stages) have pointed out that the only way the Bad Guy's plan would actually work is if he redid it in a different city every six months.<br />If you think otherwise, look no further than the World Trade Center attack--the world was gushing with Unity And The Fight Against Terrorism for about, oh, two months or so. Now the world is back to criticizing almost every move America makes.<br />Granted, Watchmen's climax is on a much larger scale than the WTC (which was terrible enough, don't get me wrong), but ultimately, you'd still have the same reaction. Yes, the world would tremble for maybe a year, but then people would get back to their old ways; it's too implausible to expect people and nations of the world to abandon their ways almost overnight. Even the destruction of a major city, in and of itself, could not possibly overthrow all of human history preceding it.<br />Perhaps the best example would be the biggest catastrophe in human history, World War II. You would think that a conflict that ruined two continents and a significant chunk of a third might cause people to think about world peace and unity. And they tried, which is why we have the United Nations. Unfortunately, the good feeling didn't last long, did it? The world is as conflict-ridden now as it was in 1939, perhaps moreso. And if World War II couldn't do it, it seems highly unlikely that Our Villain's &quot;masterstroke&quot; would be any more effective.",2002-03-26

Watchmen came at a time when comics were stuck in a rut they had been in since the early sixties, and blew everybody away. It was a product of it's time and the effect it had could never be duplicated. Most comics out today are pretty much the grandchildren of Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns. These two stories and a handfull of others changed the way we think about comic books. They introduced more mature and relevant themes that went way beyond the typical super-hero fare that dominated everything up till that point. Watchmen is a brilliantly written masterpiece of comic fiction illustrated by the very talented Dave Gibbons. Gibbons' style dosen't ever get him on to any &quot;hot 10&quot; list's because of his subdued, low key style, but perfectly brings to life Alan Moore's story with his excellent storytelling skills that no early Image artist like Rob Liefeld or Erik Larsen could accomplish because of the fact that there aren't buildings exploding every two panels and the characters have to look like real people. Watchmen slowly simmers to a boil then explodes into a very satisfing ending (regardless of what some people say).<br />This story represents what I wish we had much more of in comics, well concieved, well executed stories that advance the medium and brings it closer to an artform that will gain some respect.

I think it would probably entertain most people (though I must say, it is not for children) who could bring themselves to lay aside their intellectual snobbery and pick up a comic book for once.  It's also pretty well-laden with underlying visual repetitions and symbolism, as the various &quot;Annotated Watchmen&quot; sites on the internet attest.  I'd say at best it's a good yarn, and at times even quite emotional, and at worst it can degenerate into something a bit melodramatic and full of itself.  And again, it's a mature story--the comic book trappings belie some of its (for better or worse) somewhat objectionable content.  Yet the worst moments are few, and the best are good enough that they far more than overbalance the bad ones.  I'd say that the net result is a good one...if you're a serious comic book fan, you should read this.  If you want to know what the genre can do, you should read this.

Banned in 1977, they withered away or submitted to government supervision with the exception of the violent terror of the underworld, the outlawed Rorschach. It is 1985, the Comedian has been thrown from a building, nuclear superman Dr. Manhattan has been publicly disgraced inspiringm him to leave the planet, Ozzymandias has been shot at and only Rorschach sees an important pattern. But the main plot is just a vehicle to link the individual, flashback filled portrayals of masked heroes in the real world. They interact with actual occurrences as the notorious murder of Kitty Genovese inspired Rorschach to leave his menial job for vigilantism and the appearance of Dr. Manhattan put America in the lead of its nuclear arms race against Russia. They do not always do what is right as the madness of Vietnam inspired the Comedian to gun down a pregnant woman and anyone whose political believes include due process and anti-capital punishment sentiments despises the infamous Rorschach. They symbolize different things as the crime fighter, Ozzymandias turned philanthropist and renaissance man, Adrian Veidt spews Peale-style philosophy and the cold, withdrawn, omnipotent Dr. Manhattan considers if he is to help mankind of loom over it, symbolizing science in the nuclear age. I enjoyed the sharp differences between the characters' philosophies despite being compelled to do the same strange thing for the same goals. Rorschach beats a lowlife criminal timid, thinking \\""New York is dying of rabies. All I can do is wipe random flakes of foam from its lips.\\"" Veidt, in turn quit crime fighting becausecrime is \\""a symptom of the overall sickness of the human spirit. I don't believe you can cure a disease by suppressing its symptoms.\\"" Moore's sharp writing and ability to create atmosphere are at best as strong personalities filled with underlining clash.

Some may rave about how Watchmen is the greatest piece of &quot;sequential art&quot; on the market, but I prefer to think of it as the best damn &quot;comic book&quot; ever written.<br />Make no mistake, Watchmen is about Superheroes.  Crazy guys in tights who, for many reasons, get off on beating the crap out of bad guys.  Moore dissects them, puts them back together and breathes a new life into them that would make Frankenstein proud.  Somewhere along the way, the story ceases to be about guys in tights, and starts to be a story about all of us.  How there are little pieces of us in all of these weird, tragic and ultimately human characters.  Some of them are truly twisted, but all of them possess something redeemable, something that makes them difficult to hate.  It's this level of human complexity, boiling beneath that colorful surface that makes Watchmen great.<br />The plot is huge and epic.  To me, there's nothing better than a story that starts small and ends somewhere so huge, so far away from the beginning that we have to look back and marvel at the beginning.  Watchmen is that kind of story.  Moore adds layer after layer, some of which seem strange and out of place at first, and weaves them all together into a seamless tapestry.<br />If this were only a novel, the plot and characterization would be enough to make Watchmen timeless, but the collaboration between Moore and Dave Gibbons is unparalleled.  Gibbons uses the art to layer another story, sometimes several stories on top of the original.  I've read this book hundreds of times and I can still find little pieces of the puzzle that I never noticed before.  Gibbons style is what makes the Watchmen world so different from the ones we've seen before.  A place out of synch with our own time, yet undeniably connected.  Many artists have tried this and failed.<br />So yes, Watchmen is a story about superheroes, but in the same way that Citizen Kane is about a sled.

Moore actually clothes his literary ambitions in the costume of the super-hero genre, and then like all important Modernists he rewrites that genre from the inside-out.<br />This is a serious, speculative look at what society would be like if there were costumed adventurers fighting crime and the countries enemies, including one who does have super-powers.  The 'heroes' are people though, with faults that veer, dangerously, towards the narcissistic, the cynical, and the psychotic.  The graphic nature allows the story to be told within the context of a finely detailed and solid alternate world, with a social and political situation that has been created by the presence of the 'heroes.'  It also allows some tour-de-force storytelling, as a comic within the book parrallels the unfolding story, and is itself a masteful comic book narrative!  Also, a city intersection where much of the storytelling takes place is exacly placed, so that the visual narrative through time and space can be sighted along its different axes.

While it would qualify for this distinction in length alone (338 pages of comic book story plus 46 pages of supplemental text material interspersed between its 12 chapters), the sweeping scope of this Wagnerian epic and the ironic interplay of words and pictures that fills every page, combined with its unflinching examination of human violence-both on a personal and political scale-make this a truly momentous literary achievement, graphic or otherwise.<br /><br />This work was principally responsible for a fundamental change in the way superhero stories have been presented since the mid 1980s.  Deconstructing the traditional \\""comic book\\"" conventions of the \\""men in tights\\"" genre, Moore treated the seemingly absurd notion of costumed crimefighting with a depth and seriousness that leant it a newfound credibility. Rather than populating his fictional world with the types of demigods that fill more traditional superhero universes, Moore created a brand new pantheon of all too human mystery men and women, almost all of whom were merely eccentric but well-meaning citizens trying to make their communities a little safer.  These heroes include the scientific wizard and avian aficionado, Nite Owl; the daughter and namesake of the 1940s heroine, Silk Spectre; the paragon of human mental and physical perfection, Ozymandius; and the brutal trench coat-wearing psychopath, Rorshach, who conceals his identity behind a white cloth (pulled over his face like a stocking mask) that contains a constantly shifting pattern of black blotches.<br /><br />And what was America's reaction to these quirky costumed do-gooders?  In the 1970s Congress passed the Keane Act, a law banning costumed vigilantism and forcing most of them into retirement. The only official exceptions to this ban were the nearly omnipotent being, Dr. Manhattan (capable of anything but remembering what it was like to be human), and the gun-toting misanthrope paradoxically known as the Comedian, both of whom operated as US government agents.

Both &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns,&quot; the two greatest examples of graphic storytelling, deal explicitly with the underlying fear the ordinary citizenry have of the demi-gods they worship.  The one inherent advantage that &quot;Watchman&quot; has over Frank Miller's classic tale is that it requires no knowledge of the existing mythos of its characters because Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandias, Rorschach, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, the Comedian and the rest of the former members of the Crimebusters.<br />The brainchild of writer Alan Moore (&quot;Swamp Thing,&quot; &quot;V for Vendetta,&quot; &quot;From Hell&quot;) and artist Dave Gibbons (&quot;Rogue Trooper,&quot; &quot;Doctor Who,&quot; &quot;Green Lantern&quot;), &quot;Watchmen&quot; was originally published by DC Comics in twelve issues in 1986-87.  Moore and Gibbons won the Best Writer/Artist combination award at the 1987 Jack Kirby Comics Industry Awards ceremony.  The central story in &quot;Watchmen&quot; is quite simple: apparently someone is killing off or discrediting the former Crimebusters.  The remaining members end up coming together to discover the who and the why behind it all, and the payoff to the mystery is most satisfactory.  But what makes &quot;Watchmen&quot; so special is the breadth and depth of both the characters and their respective subplots: Dr. Manhattan dealing with his responsibility to humanity given his god-like powers; Nite Owl having trouble leaving his secret identity behind; Rorschach being examined by a psychiatrist.  Each chapter offers a specific focus on one of the characters, yet advances the overall narrative.<br />Beyond that the intricate narrative, Moore and Gibbons offer two additional levels to the story.  First, each chapter is followed by a &quot;non-comic&quot; section that develops more of the backstories, such as numerous excerpts from Hollis Mason's autobiography &quot;Under the Hood&quot; or Professor Mitlon Glass' &quot;Dr. Manhattan: Super-Powers and the Superpowers,&quot; an interview with Adrian Veidt, or reports from the police files of Walter Joseph Kovacs.

But then, you knew that.","Reading through the first twenty-or-so reviews, I noticed the same ideas repeated again and again, all of which are perfectly true:<br />1: Yes, it's a comic book, but that's like saying Citizen Kane is just a movie.<br />2: Most people will be likely to push away this book if you offer it to them because of all those silly pictures that stop it from being a novel. Should they do this, point out the little details hidden away in each scene (the recurring image of the smiling face, for example) or the way that Gibbons' art - although damned by the use of block colouring that makes it look like a mid-70s X-Men book - is so expertly detailed with each individual person in the background moving realistically (ie: the people in the background don't appear/disappear between frames).<br />3: Moore's story is complex and thoughtful and, although it can be confusing, rewards re-reading.<br />4: Despite the superhero costumes, the characters in this book are... real. They're complex people who have emotions and characterizations comparable to the finest literature. Someone mentioned that Rorschach is in the same psychotic league as The Punisher, but whilst the latter has an almost stereotypical excuse for being a murderer (his wife and kids were killed by gangsters), Rorschach's driven by much more complex reasons (growing up in an unstable home where his mother was a prostitute etc.).

A picture is worth a thousand words, to quote the old saw, but only the right picture.  Watchmen is full of those right pictures.  To me, the most powerful image is when Rorschach encounters his younger self and understands.  The frame that shows his understanding is my favorite image.  It's worthless without the context, but priceless with it.<br />I understand why people feel there is a stigma associated with the comic as a medium.  People who might look down on the medium have obviously never read Watchmen.  People who have read Watchmen and still look down on the medium as a whole are probably take themselves a little bit too seriously.<br />The book offers a compelling alternate history.  Not only the large historical events, but the smaller ones mesh in.  The world is displayed in the history that is created, with the details in place.<br />In addition, there is a wealth of reference to other works, which is explained sufficiently to not lose the reader, or not central to the story.<br />Lastly, there is a commentary on the comic as a medium, wrapped around a story within the story as a whole.  The comic embedded in Watchmen is a powerful comic in and of it's own right, but pales next to the scope of Watchmen.<br />Many levels to read and enjoy, no matter what your interest.<br />Of course, as an Alan Moore story, it features amusing synchronicity between the background dialogue (TV, cutovers between scenes, etc.) and the main action, and a dark alternate future.<br />Reading in this day and age it is, of course, somewhat dated, as has been pointed out.  The Russians aren't exactly a military threat any more, nulclear war isn't something expected soon.  But human condition is human condition.  If Adrian can learn from Alexander, certainly we can appreciate things from the perspective of 15 years ago.<br />Lastly, Watchmen offers some of the best one-liners and short quotes you can find anywhere.<br />And Rorschach.  Insane, right-wing vigilante (lest you think it's a priori negative, he's the only one who escapes with his morals intact - although how you read it depends on how you view life - that is, are his morals worth keeping intact?), I find his journey from Kovacs to Rorschach to be fascinating, and the reasoning behind how he became Rorschach is an interesting insight into the human condition.<br />Actually, the book is so grey on so many things, it's really hard to characterize it as having a particular political agenda.  None of the characters are all good, and all bad.  Given the anti-war stance, it would probably be viewed as leftist.  I think it goes beyond simple politics in its treatment of those things.<br />Rorschach tells us, &quot;You don't understand. I'm not locked in here with you.  You're locked in here with me.&quot;  It's just as true of the reader as it is of his audience there in the book.<br />Another favorite of mine: &quot;Those sure were good times.  Whatever happened to them?&quot; &quot;You quit.&quot;<br />That's Rorschach.<br />As some of the final dialogue goes, &quot;I won in the end, didn't I.&quot; &quot;In the end?  Nothing ever ends.&quot;<br />Yet Watchmen does indeed end.  Which is good, because you won't be able to sleep until it does.",2000-10-02

Regardless of whether or not you read comics, if you give this book a try you will not be dissapointed.<br /><br />The characters are as real as they get, very non-typical for comic book characters.  They grow and change throughout the book and they are not \\""4-color\\"".  By that, I mean that very few of them are good or bad morally....  lots of shades of gray.  By this, I don't mean that every character is a punisher ripoff who blurs moral lines, but that the characters have genuine struggles with their own stiff moral codes.  This adds depth to the characters and it is one of the things that sets this apart from your typical comic.  Not only is the art very good, but it achieves lots of foreshadowing and there are things in the art you miss the first time you read but you notice on a reread.  This combination of foreshadowing in the story with foreshadowing through the art is something I have never seen duplicated before or since in comics.  There are whole websites devoted to finding the art foreshadowing, just google for it.  Great characters, character development, and use of this double foreshadowing make for a very emotional story which draws you in.<br /><br />There isn't much I can say about the plot without giving it away, which would do you a disservice.

Art on the last panel of a page will be similar to the art on the first panel for the next page which starts off a new scene. The 5th  issue(or chapter in the compilation) has a symmetrical layout.  The panel  layout in the middle of the chapter mirror each other as does each outer  page.  There are background elements such as posters and newspaper  headlines on the ground that refer to or foreshadow events in the book.  That is one great thing about comics-words can be put anywhere in the art.  There is more to read than just the diolouge and captions.  The same event  is shown multiple times throughout the story, each from a different  character's point of view.  There is a ton of visual symbolism(mostly with  the first and last panel of every issue and with the Comedian's bloody  smiley face badge).  Then there is the dual story in the form of a comic  called Tales of the Black Freighter a kid at the newsstand reads throughout  the story.  Art from this comic is shown up close in some spots, but often,  only captions from this comic are layed out in the art of the regular  story, displaying how both stories run parallel.<br />Moore has made the  world his main character.  He has twisted the world for this story.  For  example, Nixon is still president in 1985 and the US won the Vietnam war.  Each chapter has a prose supplement that further provides extra backstory  for the whole Watchmen universe Alan Moore has created(such as the one for  the Black Freighter comic; the writer of that comic is even an important  character in the story).  Every character, even seemingly minor ones, are  written realisticly and the reader is made to care about their varied  fates.  Dave Gibbon's retro-60's visuals are clean, easy to follow, and  highly detailed.  John Higgins' coloring further complements the art style  of this story.<br />The plot itself is a superhero story that amazingly  removes not only the &quot;super&quot; but the &quot;hero&quot; as well.  This is an in-depth examination of why someone would want to dress up in a  face-concealing mask and play cops and robbers.  The story is so  captivating that the reader will barely notice there are very few actual  fights in the whole book.  But there's still plenty of conflict.  Oridinary  people don't react well to masked men taking the law into their own hands.  Superhero's roles are used realistically in this story.  A superhero wins  Vietnam for the US.  One goes into retirement and licenses his name for  spin-off merchandise.  Most superheros are forced by law into retirement,  but Rorschach, who starts the story off, refuses to quit fighting criminals  and is wanted by the police and the underworld alike.  Rorschach begins by  investigating the death of a fellow masked adventurer  But before story's  end, Rorschach learns his efforts are very trite compared to the actual  problems with the world.  And by story's end, the world's problems get  solved once and for all, in a way that the reader will surely be shocked.",1999-12-25

Set in a futuristic society, the graphic novel unfolds the story of superheroes after their glory days. Rorschach, the main character, investigates the sudden deaths of members of a group called the Minutemen, suspecting a “mask-killer” on the loose. His investigations result in the reconnection of the remaining Minutemen and insight into their lives, including Manhattan and his relationships, past and present. The audience discovers that Manhattan, once an ordinary man, was a victim of an experiment gone wrong, causing him to explode. He then, using only his memory, pieced himself back together and became a true superhuman, gaining physical powers as well as a different concept of time.<br />  Moore creates Manhattan to have almost godlike qualities. He is omniscient to a certain degree, aware of everything that has happened and will happen in his life. To him, all these events seem to be happening simultaneously. He is therefore able to tell the future while also living in the present and, in some way, the past. One would think that a being with such knowledge would never be surprised; however, Manhattan is still able to be surprised, even if he predicted his own surprise minutes earlier. He also seems unable to intervene and prevent events from happening, implying that while he may be omniscient, he is not omnipotent. Manhattan's character reflects a possible answer to an interesting question: “What would happen if God became human?” In the work, he immediately becomes the United States' best weapon, but he also instills fear in the people once they begin to understand his seemingly unlimited abilities.<br /> The artwork in Watchmen helps to create a feeling of Manhattan's power. He is the only member of the Minutemen who is always instantly recognizable, as his skin is permanently blue. This marks him as different, set apart from the restof the human race. His looks inspire awe and fear when he is brought into the Vietnamese War, and many of the Vietnamese believe him to be a god. His eyes have no pupils, emphasizing his different vision of time and his ability to see everything at once.",2014-10-29

Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons prove that it can be, especially with a story as complex as Watchmen. As a standalone novel, it gives comics a good name. Some may argue that the pictures aren't necessary and that the story could be told just fine through plain text, but I would retort that the images add another element to the text. Hidden in the background are little images and hints that explain the setting or implement foreshadowing, like the front pages of the newspapers. One particular image that struck me as a good use of this technique was (SPOILER ALERT!) after the monster had destroyed New York City, there was a shot of the destruction outside of a movie theater advertising “The Day the Earth Stood Still.”<br /> I also noticed another reader's review arguing that with all of the Cold War references and the appearance of President Nixon, that the book was too dated. Does no one see how this novel can apply to modern society? Think about all of the times we have turned a blind eye to evil just because “the ends justify the means.” Think of all of the people being detained without trial and tortured on suspicion of terrorism. Many parallels can be drawn between the events of Watchmen and society today. We may not have masked adventurers in our midst, but we have many people that portray themselves as heroes in America that may not be as holy as we think they are.<br /> Another comment I feel like needs to be addressed is the gritty and gory art style of Gibbons and John Higgins. Some people find it to be too much, but you'll likely find that it is no different from watching a horror movie. It typically isn't tasteless, considering that this novel is all about showing the gritty side of society. It would not make sense to have light colors and pristine images featured prominently. Almost all of the gore and death has a purpose here, unlike many of today's blood-and-guts horror extravaganzas.<br /> Overall, despite the fact that I am not a graphic novel person, and even though this is really the first piece of graphic novel literature I have read, I was very impressed with Watchmen. I think it deserves to be heralded as the king of graphic novels and is a strong contender in the argument over whether graphic novels should be considered as literature. It's on the Time Magazine 100 Best Novel list for a reason. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a thrill that is prepared to face some of society's toughest questions. Do the ends really justify the means? Read Watchmen, and be prepared to come up with your own answer to that question.",2014-04-02

I loved the multiple, yet intertwined story lines.  The detail of both the artistry and plot coupled with the length of the story make it thoroughly satisfying.<br /><br />Some characters are trying to be heroes by being as brutal as the criminals they are trying to stop.  Some are following a path that they didn't choose for themselves.  Some hold onto secrets that are silently destroying them and the relationships with those closest to them.  All of this going on while a terrible, yet well meaning, plan is being methodically carried out.<br />Grab a cup of your favorite coffee and curl up in a comfy chair to read this.  You will read, be thoroughly entertained, and trying to put together what actually looms over everyone throughout the book.<br /><br />Just as a side note, my favorite character is Rorschach.  He is oppressingly logical and handles problems with the most swift and brutal means possible.  Despite his methods, and sometimes flawed thinking, he has an almost unwavering sense of responsibility and honor.  He does, or tries to do, what no one else is willing to do because he thinks he's doing what is right.<br /><br />Great graphic novel.

I could figure out some things but the ending was still a surprise. There is no reason to hold your breath, I am NOT going to give away the ending. This book I only gave four stars to because of the gore. The book was very well written and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br /><br />Even though this book is one that is well written it's a bit dark. Well, okay it's very dark and the way people live? Not caring if a man is plummeted to his death from a high up place. Just the world in this book is messed up! Then the ones who actually do something about the world and its troubles are forced into early retirements. This is a different spin on masked avengers. This book allows them to mainly kill the bad guys. While most of us are used to Superman catching the bad guys and throwing them behind bars. This book allows the masked vigilantes to kill the bad guys.<br /><br />As you can read from the description of this book it's about us winning the Vietnam War and things of history being changed. You can really see the influence of the time when dropping bombs on each other was a real thing. This book is about things leading up to a possible World War 3 and how things result. The ending sticks with you and part of you understands the thinking behind it another part is just like wow, no.<br /><br />This is a GRAPHIC NOVEL. Meaning that there is some writing in it. There are a couple of pages after each chapter giving background information or information that could be compiled into a prequel to Watchmen, but mainly this book is a picture book. So just be aware of this fact. Instead of expecting little pictures and more writing.<br /><br />This book is named the Blue Penis, because one of the main characters is Dr. Manhattan and he doesn't like to wear clothes. So we see a cartoon-ized blue penis. The doctor is blue and so that's where the blue comes from.<br /><br />I am not going to sugar coat it, this book is gory. Not recommended for younger kids. I would give this an R rating. There is a lot of gore in this, though there are some scenes that don't go into full detail. Which I am glad about. This book contains sex, but no step by step stuff.

There is no ordinary person.\\"" This is just one the philosophical bon mots liberally resident in one of the most layered and engrossing comic books of all time. These kudos are not given lightly. In fact, Time Magazine voted Watchmen one of the best novels of the 20th Century. I believe this is because of the compelling themes:<br /><br />Real Life<br />\\""Real life is messy, inconsistent, and it's seldom when anything ever really gets resolved. It's taken me a long time to realize that.\\""<br />Life is messy and when this explored through the cast of aging superheroes, it is accentuated in a way to give new meaning to the observation.<br /><br />Anxiety<br />\\""In an era of stress and anxiety, when the present seems unstable and the future unlikely, the natural response is to retreat and withdraw from reality, taking recourse either in fantasies of the future or in modified visions of a half-imagines past\\""<br />This is incredibly deep given the fantasy lives of superheroes and their alter egos.<br /><br />Simplicity<br />\\""Nothing's that simple, not even things that are simply awful.\\""<br />Comic books once wrapped up each story neatly like a thirty minute sitcom. Then the world got more complex and comic books followed. This is reflected beautifully in Watchmen that bridges the early Batman crime fighting sensibility with the darker and deeper comic book output of the 1980's.<br /><br />But overall, the main story is a person's duality. Superheroes live two lives, wrestle between good and evil, pretend to function in larger society while finding comfort only in their dysfunctional tribe. For them, it is a solitary existence, \\""We are alone. Live our lives, lacking anything better to do. Devise reason later.\\""<br /><br />Watchmen can be read in so many ways: existential novel, murder mystery, comic book trivia game. All offer value. The artwork is tremendous, the dialogue believable, and the angst is riveting. Most enjoyable were the newly imagined crime fighters: The Comedian, Doctor Manhattan, Nite Owl, Rorschach, Ozymandias, and Silk Spectre will pull you into their world. It is a must read.iveting.

I know, I know, blaspheme!  Nevertheless, when I saw this on sale for $3.99 on the kindle, I knew I had no more excuses for not picking it up.  Boy, am I glad I did.<br /><br />Let's talk about the art.  For a comic that came out in the 80s, the art, even today, is still amazing.  I don't know who penciled, inked, and/or colored, but that person(s) did a fantastic job.  The sheer amount of detail made me sit up and really pay attention to what I was looking at.  There is one part in particular that I especially loved: the comic that young Bernard reads shows panels that are &#34;dotted&#34; to indicate they are from Bernard's comic book, juxtaposed with the smoother colors of the Watchmen panels.  I loved all the multiple perspectives of the characters (from their eyes), I loved the carefully laid out newspapers whose headlines were visible enough to remind us that the political clock was ticking, I loved it, I loved it, I loved it.<br /><br />The story was similarly fantastic.  I was sucked into the world from the get-go, and did not put down the comic until the book was finished.  Again, it was the small things that really pulled everything together: pages from Holis' book, the specific way each character speaks (the way Rorschach's speech differs between past and present!), and so many other details that just boggles the mind.<br /><br />I'm happy to have finally read this, and highly recommend the kindle version if you have a tablet and/or have no problems reading on a computer.  The colors are vibrant and the level of detail in the artwork demands you actually look at the panels and not skim over them, something that requires a larger screen and/or zoom.  On an e-reader (such as the kindle or nook), I feel that you may be waiting too long for pages to load, not to mention spending too long expanding each panel, that it wouldn't really allow you to immerse yourself into the story.",2013-05-19

Granted, I stopped reading comics in 1995 so there may have been some very good graphic novels since then. But of the ones I've read, nothing tops, \\""Watchmen\\"". It does have quite a bit of content though. There's some language, some violence and some sexual situations, but nothing feels gratuitous. The story is very real. At least as real as a story about superheroes could be.<br /><br />The reason for the title of this review deals with the reading experience I've had with my Paperwhite and my 8.9\\"" Fire. The panels are laid out in such a way that the Paperwhite blows them up full screen and it's actually a better read on that device. The fire adds color, but the panels are much smaller. Just my opinion but it's been a joy to read on the Paperwhite. It does take a lot of memory though.<br /><br />Update: 5-18-13 The prose sections of the book are unreadable on the Paperwhite and barely legible on the Fire.

I hit the store in search, as I had long thought the device would be a great fit. Amazon did it, I nabbed a sample, waited a bit, and once it opened and I skimmed I was in love.<br /><br />The Watchmen has many reviews for the physical copy, as such I recommend you look to those for information on the story. I'm much more focused on how it transitioned from print to digital.<br /><br />Visually, it looks good. Not quite as impressive in many regards, in part due to color but mainly due to the smaller screen. While navigating through the comic it has an autoflow, which lets you hit the next button to first see the full page, then zoom to the first panel and work through them progressively. Large panels were nicely split, and so were generally very easy to enjoy.<br /><br />My one complaint, is how the pages of text were broken apart. They weren't as clear as the rest, and so often stood out in memory as being too difficult to even want to read. So, having often found I wanted to put the comic down due to it, I feel 4 stars is generous.<br /><br />Still, for the most part it was quite enjoyable.
