It's complex, yet easy to understand (once you get used to the colloquial dialect).<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT -<br /><br />I like how the story unfolds. All the poor black people are finally done with work, so they sit on their porches and watch Janie as she comes home. Everybody gossips and wonders where she has been and what has happened to her. Her friend Pheoby goes to ask her, and Janie tells Pheoby all about what has happened in her life. She tells Pheoby about what Nanny said.<br /><br />What happened was that when Nanny saw Janie kissing a boy, she (Nanny) decided to tell Janie that she always wanted to see Janie get married, instead of ending up like her (Nanny). She tells Janie that she (Nanny) was a slave, and that the overseer was the father of Janie's mom, and that the overseer's wife said she was going to see her (Nanny) punished for having a baby with her husband, the overseer.  So one night Nanny and the baby (Janie's mom) escaped.<br /><br />Eventually they were taken in by nice white people who helped put Janie's mom through school. Then Janie goes on to explain that one day her mom literally crawled back home to Nanny. It turns out she (Janie's mom) was molested by a schoolteacher, of all people. That's how Janie ended up coming into the world (she never meets the schoolteacher, who is her natural father. He's out of the story. He's just barely mentioned).<br /><br />Anyway, Nanny said that she didn't want any of that sort of thing to happen to Janie. So Janie met Logan Killicks and married him. At first he was nice to her, but then he treated her like dirt, so she left him for another smooth-talking guy named Joe Starks, who was also called Jody.<br /><br />Joe was very ambitious. He married Janie, then made himself become the mayor of the town, and of course, Janie became the mayor's wife. At first, Jody was nice to her, but then he was less and less kind and sweet as time went on. For example, he didn't let her wear her hair down. He scolded her about every little thing. They ran a grocery store, but he always told her she was doing everything wrong. Also, he didn't like to see her talking to anybody. He was very bossy and controlling.<br /><br />After about 20 years, Janie became hardened and eventually told him off. She didn't hate him or anything, but she didn't let him mistreat her anymore, especially when she noticed that he was not as handsome as he used to be, and he had begun getting saggy and flabby and frail and weak. He soon died from poor health<br /><br />After about eight or nine months, Janie was visited by another smooth-talker whose nickname was Tea Cake. They started hanging out together, and cooking fish and corn bread and eating together, and going hunting and fishing and to the movies. Eventually Janie and Tea Cake got married. Tea Cake wasn't a bad guy at all, although he was mainly good for only gambling (and winning), and growing beans. Growing beans is what he did when they moved to the Everglades in Florida.<br /><br />Then there was a terrible hurricane. Tea Cake and Janie seemed to be watching the sky (but &#34;their eyes were watching God&#34;, to see what God would do about the hurricane, and to see whether God would let them live).<br /><br />While trying to escape the hurricane, Tea Cake got bitten by a dog when he was trying to prevent the dog from attacking Janie as she hung on to the tail of a cow in order to survive the hurricane floods.  Eventually, Tea Cake ended up getting rabies (it wasn't specified in the book, but the symptoms of rabies were described---for example, Tea Cake could no longer tolerate water). When he lurched toward her with a gun in his hand, she had to end up shooting him dead.<br /><br />She went to trial and was found innocent. After the trial, she picked herself up and went back home, and the story ends with her telling her friend Pheoby that this was the way things happened.ittle thing.

The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky. It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins.

Good story.","Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston was a historically significant novel and one I knew I needed to read, especially given Alice Walker's [author of The Color Purple] recommendation!    It surrounds Janie Crawford, an African American women who has had her fair share of hardships throughout her forty-year life. The product of an inappropriate student/teacher relationship, Janie is raised by her Nanny [a former slave] when her mother Leafy runs off to live her own life of chasing jazz and liquor. Before Nanny dies, she marries Janie off to an older farmer, Logan. Logan is looking for a field hand, not a wife, and Janie finds herself terminally unhappy.    She soon falls in love with Joe Starks and runs off with the lovable scamp. Joe wants Janie to be the trophy wife and run the family store, avoiding any social interaction or event. Joe is a controlling man who finally slaps Janie and leaves her. He ends up passing away from kidney failure, but not before Janie can tell him that he never really knew her or let her be free.    With Joe's estate left to her, Janie becomes a rich woman in her 30's with plenty of suitors. Her favorite is romantic and endearing Tea Cake, who is much younger than her, but respectful and caring. They move to Jacksonville to start their life together and Janie is truly happy until Tea Cake is bit by a rabid dog. He contracts rabies and goes mad, trying to kill Janie. She shoots Tea Cake out of self defense and kills him. There is a trial, which Janie wins.    The ending was abrupt... I thought, at least. The story was heartbreaking and empowering. Janie wanted a marriage filled with love and happiness. One in which she could be herself. Even if her marriage to Tea Cake does not last long, it is the truest love of her life.

I will do my best to explore my pros and cons about my feelings about it, but these are simply my opinions about a book that has many, many people before me whose opinion is different.<br /><br />To begin, the woman Hurston follows a traditionally strong, feminist, and amazing life, not to mention the work that Walker did in order for us to appreciate and study Hurston more during her lifetime.  She lived a life that sincerely is ingrained in the idea of Americanism as a whole, and her work is a testament to that.  TEWWG is an amazing book - written with focus, drive, and steady application of Hurston's understanding and work in Ethnography and Anthropology.  It is masterful, clocking in at less than two hundred pages and speeding through the story without sacrificing style and structure (although structure is arguable considering it was ahead of its time for when it was written).  There is nary a wasted word, and that is the beauty of the work, in my opinion.<br /><br />My complaints come from my own volume of reading as well as the critical reception it has with the world at large.  While I am not discounting their opinions at all, I think my own come from the breadth of work that I have read from hundreds of other feminist, African American/American authors from the time and since.  First, I think the life of the author needs to be separated from the text - just as modern criticism requires.  In doing that, the book is mediocre to me.  That the life of the author notwithstanding, just the use and bending of structural rules, an African American woman protagonist, and appearances of dialect does not a good book make.<br /><br />The dialect doesn't change, even though the setting does in several instances in the book.  The structure and approach to telling the story in the stringy-oral history format has been done many times prior to her writing this, and while what she does is amazing, there were many before her that did it better (and authors that she likely read as a highly-educated woman herself).  I also found the brand of feminism the book portrays was interesting - that many consider this to be a great work of feminist literature, however we find the main character being driven by, owned by, and directed by the men in her life seems to be implausibly feminist to me.  Is it that she has bad experiences in her life?  Is it that she shoots and kills the man she loves at the end?  Is it that she is beaten and lives to tell about it?  I am not sure that any of these things account for the feminist argument at all - the writing of the bad experiences has happened many times regardless of sex, race, and time period.  The killing of her lover is out of mercy, and if she didn't she would be facing down the same grisly fate he was when he was killed.  If it wasn't her, it would have been nature, and she did it because she was a good woman.  Notwithstanding this data, she is also acquitted of murder, as she should have been.  The abuse she faced was rampant to her world and the world of the women around her, again, regardless of race or (mostly) time period.<br /><br />Between these three main ideas, the idea of the \\""Black Experience\\"" seems lost to me with the exception of the fact that it is a document of it, and that is all.  Am I discounting how well she portrays it?  No.  I think it is fantastic.  But I also think there are many other \\""Black Writers\\"" (I put it in quotes as capital B and W - indication of the canon) who do it better, and perhaps I am suggesting that because she is a woman and writes about her experience in this way that maybe that puts the work on certain pedestals that should hold room for better works.<br /><br />Simply put, I thought it was a great book, but I also think that there are many more that fit into the same categories that are much better books.  I also think that the life of the writer, who was a prolific, smart, strong woman who has a tragic end, should not be taken into consideration in the study of the work.  The meaning is in the text, so that said, my favorite and most amazed feelings for the book arise from the storytelling and the writing itself.  Beyond that, to me, it may not be as brilliant to the work of her contemporaries.  In terms of the African American, Feminist, and other places where this book is considered a masterpiece, I simply think that compared to others that fit into those canons, genres, and bookstore departments, it has a bit of room to grow.ks.

Nanny gives advices on her choices of a husband. Phoeby is on Janie's side all the way. She means to the reader to follow Janie's adventure as passionately as she does.<br /><br />The protagonist is her own antagonist if any as she (Janie) is the only heroine of her time living intensively three marriages and no one to defeat her lifestyle.

In a crescendo, she handles her relationships pragmatically.<br /> She leaves the first husband because she does not love him anymore; She is faithful, for thirty years, to the second `phallocratic' until his death; She melts into a third relationship with a much younger man who makes her discover a new way of happiness and fun. This third romance ended dramatically after  the turmoil of a hurricane where one had to end the life of the other to survive.<br /> In other words, gradually, the first marriage fails in a lost relationship, the second  ends in disappointment, and the third  cries out dramatically with accidental death. Per say, life is a struggle.<br /><br />Nora Neale Hurston is ahead of her time with her novel superbly drawn with her main character embraced by the other characters in the story.

Gifted in a way a virtuoso is, gifted in a way that can't be taught or bought, but only received through some divine blessing.  Such is Hurston and this book.  I have never read Hurston before and am so delighted to have discovered her.  What an absolute literary treasure.  It is a pity there are so few of her works.  I'll have to space them out so I don't exhaust them too soon.<br /><br />Janie marries first to escape from home to man picked out for her by her grandmother.  He was so much older and she found she had traded one kind of servitude for another.  It must be better to marry for love, she resolves.  Longing for that, Janie walks away from her marriage into the arms of a man who makes her a great many promises which he keeps.  She is a fine lady with nice things, held up on a  pedestal.  But still, Janie longs for love.  Finally, she takes for a lover a man twenty years younger who makes her wildly happy, wildy angry, and wildy sad.  Which of these choices is right?  Which is love?<br /><br />Hurston is a true master of human emotions and can express in a few words oceans of what is unsaid and still understood by the human heart.  This is a book on women's right--and the unfairness of being a female in her time period.  I love that Hurston stays true to her voice, to the story, even though Janie's action are so difficult, so controversial, and yet, ultimately, so true.",2012-11-29

The book deals with the themes of personal identity, race, love and men through the eyes of Janie Crawford - a thrice-married woman in 1930's Florida.  Janie is vulnerable and tough, sheltered and worldly, coddled and self-sufficient.  She is a study in contrasts.  She is a woman.<br />Their Eyes Were Watching God is, to me, a uniquely black woman's story but the themes of this novel transcend color.  It's the story of a woman, of women.<br />And my first reaction upon finishing the novel was that it is sad.<br />Their Eyes begins with a young Janie, raised by her Grandmother, the maid in a white household. Janie and her Grandmother live together in the white family's back house and little Janie plays often with the white children.  Janie's identity issues begin at a young age, \\""Ah was wid dem white chillun so much till Ah didn't know Ah wuzn't white till Ah was round six years old.\\"" Janie goes on to tell the story of a photographer who came around one day and took pictures of all the children. When the photographer came back to the house with the developed photographs, Janie didn't recognize her self in the photos.  She literally did not know who she was or what she looked like; she didn't know she was a black girl.<br />The search for her identity as a woman - a person - is what drives Janie's choices and the story.  At 16, her dying Grandmother marries her off to a local man.  He is not a man Janie loves but she marries him despite her feelings.  That marriage doesn't last.<br />Through Janie's two subsequent marriages she learns what she wants, and what she doesn't want, out of life.  Janie's second husband is ambitious and successful and he treats her as though she were his possession.  He is thoughtless to Janie's wants and needs; her only role is as his wife.  Janie becomes a bit hardened with this marriage, but more sure of herself as a woman.<br />Janie's third husband, a younger man, gives her a taste of what life and love are about.  Janie is opened up to new worlds, both outside of her small FL town and inside herself.  Janie's third husband is a man who loves her and understands her and lets her be her self.  The story doesn't end happily.<br />It is through Janie's relationships with the men in her life that she learns to stand on her own, to be her own woman and to live her own life.  Janie is brave and independent and a beautiful example of womanhood.<br />This novel is a lyrical poem.  There are turns of phrase that are filled with beauty and honesty and Hurston's usage of colloquial dialogue brings a realism to the story that would be lost if she had had the characters speak \\""proper\\"" English.  It is a beautiful story and a definite call to live life on your own terms, \\""two things everybody's got tuh do fuh theyselves.  They got tuh go tuh God, and they got tuh find out about livin' fuh theyselves.\\""<br />I also urge you to dig deeper into the life and legacy of Zora Neale Hurston.

This can be both a great advantage in attracting the reader's sympathy but, if executed poorly, wears down the reader's patience.<br /><br />Their Eyes were Watching God is certainly a book that straddles that boundary of personal narratives between sympathy and impatience. The story revolves around a woman named Janie Crawford who is constantly searching for love, fulfillment, and a joy that is barely within her grasp in the South. She goes through three marriages, each to three very different men. Love is a difficult thing to find, let alone hold onto in these hard times, but it is a powerful force that drives Janie to move from one man to another to pursue it.<br /><br />At first glance, this story sounds very much like a typical romance revolving around tragedies and pursuits. But Zora Hurston is relentless in treating her characters and many difficulties arise from circumstances beyond any of the characters' control (i.e. natural disaster). There are no happy endings but it seems that there is no sense of resolve from Janie after experiencing the loss of her home and loved ones.<br /><br />Still, in spite of the irresolute protagonist and the slow pacing of the story as it developes, Their Eyes were Watching God is a good read for those who are interested in life from a woman's eyes in the post-civil war South and the futile pursuit of love and satisfaction.",2012-07-25

The story wasn't bad; a bit dull, but still had interesting moments. My problem with this book was the protagonist, Janie. Now if Janie were a real person, of course I'd sympathize with her troubles.  But knowing she was created by an author who wanted to make a statement about race, I feel that the way the protagonist was presented was obnoxious.<br /><br />Janie's plight stems from the fact that she is 3/4 white, but lives in the African American community in the days of instituted racism. All right, I understand how upsetting that must be for such a person; to be resented by other blacks, but still not \\""white\\"" enough to be treated as an equal by white people; to know that white blood got into your family through rape. Janie's plight, in that sense, is very sympathetic. That being said, I got very tired very quickly of hearing about what a curse Janie's \\""beauty\\"" was. How all the men wanted her, how all the women were jealous of her, because her pale skin and strait here were just soooo much more beautiful than regular African American features.

I'll never forget the struggles I watched her go through, but I didn't feel any sense of transcendence, no higher meaning to the struggle. Call me a sap who loves formula, but there's something to be said for the hero's journey and the quest for the elixer.

So when a friend suggested we read it together I went into it truly knowing absolutely nothing about the story. I was immediately struck by how beautiful the writing is. Some of the sentences are just gorgeously constructed and evocative and sophisticated. It took me about one hundred pages or so before the phonetic speech became natural for me to read. At first I stammered over it as I read it in my head and it made my reading a lot slower than normal, but once it clicked I was perfectly fine and could read at my normal speed.<br /><br />Janie is an interesting character. I enjoyed her positivity and how she kept pushing on looking for her happiness and her ideal of love until she found it. But she also frustrated me a little. I think sometimes she lost herself in the pursuit of love and would let the men in her life overrun her. She was both strong and weak. It frustrated me enough that by the end of the novel, the end of her journey, I wasn't as emotionally invested in her as I think the reader is meant to be.

Scott Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway, that of enduring American literature.\\"" Hurston's story is unusual and forceful, her language magnificent, her characters induce strong emotions.<br /><br />Hurston (1891-1960) received two Guggenheims for her writings. She wrote four novels, a dozen short stories, two musicals, two books on black mythology, dozens of essays, and a prize winning autobiography. Yet, because of the prejudices of the times, she died in a welfare home and was buried in an unmarked grave. Alice Walker reawaked people to her writings and marked her grave in 1973. A movie was made of this book staring Halle Berry in 2005.<br /><br />Hurston tells how Janie Crawford, a black woman, grew up in dire poverty and was raised by her devoted grandmother. When Janie allowed a boy to kiss her and began to become aware of sex, her grandmother tried to protect her by persuading her to marry, even though the man interested in her was considerably older than Janie. Her grandmother promised that love would come. But despite her attempts, Janie failed to find satisfaction with the older man, left him, and married a man closer her age, a go-getter, a man sure of himself. The two went to Florida where this second husband made himself the mayor of his community. He insisted that Janie live up to his high ideal of a woman. He frequently criticized her, although he loved her deeply and only wanted to improve her. When he died, Janie found satisfying love for the first time with a gambling man. But this third marriage also ended sadly.<br /><br />Hurston's language, both when she writes in good English and when she uses a black patois, is beautiful. The following are some examples.<br /><br />Describing the failure of Janie's second marriage, Hurston writes:<br />So gradually, she pressed her teeth together and learned to hush. The spirit of the marriage left the bedroom and took to living in the parlor. It was there to shake hands whenever company came to visit, but it never went back inside the bedroom again.

It's been on my to-read shelf for awhile so my friends and I decided to read it for our long-distance book discussion group this month.<br /><br />Published in 1937, Hurston writes of the love story of an African American woman in Florida during the early decades of the Twentieth Century. It is a powerful and moving tale of love and gaining ones freedom through personal choice. It is also a haunting and horrifying tale of loss.<br /><br />Janie has been doing what every body else wants her to do for years. Now, her second husband is dead. She is a middle-aged, beautiful widow of means. Tea Cake, a young and handsome gambler has caught her eye and woos her with promises of love. For the first time, she is falling in love. Ignoring the cultural \\""rules\\"" and throwing caution to the wind, Janie follows Tea Cake to Florida.<br /><br />Initially, I had trouble getting into this novel. The main problem was that as a used book someone else had underlined and made notes in it. It's a risk one takes with used books but these notes were especially distracting (we certainly were not thinking alike). Fortunately, the first reader (obviously a student) either tired of the book or got so involved in the story that the notes stopped around page 42.<br /><br />The second hindrance was the Hurston's use of the local dialect. She wrote as the people spoke. (\\""Naw, Nanny, no ma'am! Is dat whut he been hangin' round here for? He look like some ole skullhead in de grave yard.\\"" p.13.) She was an anthropologist and a folklorist and writing the tales of her subjects verbatim is part of the trade. I got used to it and by the end of the novel it was no longer a problem.<br /><br />Hurston's use of language is simply beautiful. She is at her best when describing about nature and especially the power of the 1928 Okechobee Hurricane (resulted in the lake breaching the dikes--thousands were killed).<br /><br />As an anthropologist, Hurston also understands people and the social rules that bind people and tie them down. Janie is a complex character and I enjoyed watching her grow into herself in this novel.<br /><br />This novel is a true American classic and deserves a place with the works of Steinbeck, James and Faulkner.logist, Hurston also understands people and the social rules that bind people and tie them down.

I appreciated the realism, but it made for awkward reading for me.<br /><br />The story is told in flashback and recounts the life of Janie Crawford, starting with her mother abandoning her, through her teens being raised by her grandmother, to her adult life and three marriages, both arranged and by design. I enjoyed watching Janie grow and mature through the story and I enjoyed her self-confidence. Despite that, I never really felt much for her or anyone else in her life or the events they faced.<br /><br />The theme I took away from the book was the idea of finding ourselves and our place in the world and working for - and expressing - our independence. Obviously difficult for anyone in 2011, and I can only imagine how difficult it would have been for an African American woman in Florida in the 1920's, or for an African American writer in the 1930's. What I enjoyed most about Their Eyes Were Watching God was the universal search for love and independence. And the knowledge that love isn't something we simply get. It's something that develops and builds.<br /><br />It's an interesting title and I'm not really sure what it means exactly and I'm not sure that it matters. Since the story is from the perspective of one character telling a story to a friend in response and reaction to the prying eyes of the gossiping and judgmental neighbors, my thought is that the title is telling us that the richest life isn't lived by watching others, but by watching God. What's the definition of \\""richest\\"" and what God? I guess those answers are up to you",2011-03-21

Recently my class had been made to read this book for about a week and a half. While the plot of the story was really well paced; however, the language for the conversations were entirely written in very hard to decipher and understand completely Southern dialect. Like the majority of my classmates, it took me forever to understand exactly what the characters were even talking. While I did kind of like the book after reading it, I wish could have had more time to leisurely read this book since the teacher made us read entire chapters before class meetings.<br /><br />It's rare that I like the main character in a novel, but I really liked Janie's spirit. For the majority of the story, she was a fiercely independent woman. Her life was tough but she managed the best she could for the story's time period. During that time period, she would have been seen as insolent and daring as women were supposed to be subservient and weak-willed to their husbands. Despite having her spirit and dreams crushed, she never truly gave up in this emotional. She has been abused, humiliated and silenced into submission multiple times, but she never gave up. She had her heart broken multiple times, and she even found her one true love while she developed into this remarkable character.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this novel is how the characters were given a chance to develop more than just bluntly labeling it for the readers. After getting used to the language, it became an enjoyable read for me even though some of my peers still didn't like the book. Overall some parts were rough to read, but other parts it was like fine poetic verse.",2011-02-24

I'm not so sure it wasn't deservedly forgotten.<br /><br />The plot concerns an African-American woman who goes through a series of husbands before settling her heart on one who is deserving but shiftless.<br /><br />There are snatches of incredibly good writing here and there, e.g.:<br /><br />\\""All gods who receive homage are cruel.  All gods dispense suffering without reason.  Otherwise they would not be worshipped.  Through indiscriminate suffering men know fear and fear is the most divine emmotion.  It is the stones for altars and the beginning of wisdom.  Half gods are worshipped in wine and flowers.  Real gods require blood.\\"" (p. 145)<br /><br />. . . but on the whole the novel was trying.  Mainly this was because the characters talk in an argot that will force you to pay strict attention, and isn't that convincing anyhow.  Think of Joseph's patois from \\""Wuthering Heights\\"" and square it.  Here's a sample:<br /><br />\\""Don't mind us, \\"" Lulu smiled, \\""just go right ahead, us can mind yo' house for you till you git back.  Mah supper is done.  You bettah go see how she feel.

It got very trying, not simply because it wasn't just the flavor that Hurston endeavors to give you, but an actual literal transcription of this kind of talk, which is frequently befuddling.  What's worse, the characters speak like this on one page, then a few pages later are more or less back to normal.  Might I take this opportunity to dredge up one of Mark Twain's rules of writing:<br /><br />\\""When a personage talks like an illustrated, gilt-edged, tree-calf, hand-tooled, seven-dollar Friendship's Offering in the beginning of a paragraph, he shall not talk like a minstrel at the end of it.\\""<br /><br />Perhaps I'm being too hard on Hurston.

When I scanned the first page of the book in the bookstore, I hesitated because of the phonetic use of words -- it seemed too distracting.  Then I thought about how I managed to get through and enjoy \\""A Clockwork Orange\\"", so I thought I could manage this Their Eyes as well.  I hope that readers can push past how words are being pronounced/written and simply concentrate on what is being said.    On the surface, this book is simply a love story.  There is so much more: finding love and finding a voice .  Janie Crawford/Killicks/Starks/Woods is searching for love and her voice and twice she comes up empty before joining with the love of her life, Tea Cake.  Her first husband, Logan Killicks seems to want a hired hand more than a wife.  Joe Starks, while he may love Janie, does not love her in the way she needs to be loved and will not go out of his way to do so, either.  It is not until Janie meets Tea Cake does she not only find love, but her own sense of self as well.      Janie's grandmother wanted Janie to live a comfortable life -- a stable life.  Nanny (grandmother) didn't want Janie to ever have to answer to anyone or be anyone's \\""mule\\"".  If that meant a marriage of convenience, so be it.  Love had to take a back seat to stability.  But Janie was just a teenager at the time and never got the chance to find who she was supposed to be.  So Janie ran off to be with Joe (Jody) Starks in order to find love.    With Jody, all of Nanny's dreams for Janie were fulfilled.  Janie lived in a big home and had lots of money, but still Janie was unhappy because Jody needed Janie to be seen and not heard.  Jody didn't even want Janie to enjoy the townspeople in a game of checkers or in any of the conversations at the general store.  Jody needed complete control of everyone and everything in order to feel important.  Janie again had to stifle her ownvoice in order to keep the peace with Jody.    Tea Cake comes along and sets Janie free.  Janie never needed the \\""finer\\"" things in life to be happy.  She needed freedom and that is what Tea Cake provided and encouraged.      So, yes, this book is a love story but not with the traditional happily ever after.  Although Janie and Tea Cake don't live together for the rest of their lives, Janie finally finds herself.  She knows what the perfect love feels like, she knows what she wants from life, she finds her own voice.  Janie has lived life, where as her peers simply want to gossip and make disparaging remarks about her new found freedom.  But Janie doesn't mind.  Why?  Because she is FREE!",2010-03-29

I found it very rewarding, however. I did not give it 5 stars because I felt that-- in spite of the extraordinary use of language -- the story-telling was a little weak and choppy.     In addition, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Florida history.  The descriptions of working \\""down in the muck\\"" at the edges of the Everglades are fascinating.  Also, then, as now, not everyone heeds hurricane warnings and the description of the storm is fantastic!",2009-09-06

However it is also so much more than that. Hurston preserved for posterity the colloquialisms and cadences of black southern culture, one generation removed from slavery. But she does so in a universal and thought provoking novel that explores the very building blocks of the human condition: love, our personal dreams and growth, and every person's search to be true to themselves.<br />Although the protagonist of TEWWG is a black woman named Janie in 1930s Florida, she speaks to every mature reader who has ever invested in one minute of self reflection.  Janie has persevered and grown through two failed marriages, the lust of youth and sexual self awareness, the stings of gossip and envy, the fulfillment of true love (and the devastating consequences of its loss) and the sense of peace that comes with self actualization and contentment with who one is as a person.<br />Hurston does all of this with her supreme use of figurative language, and her simple gifts of storytelling. This is one of the simplest (in terms of its style and construction) novels I have ever read, and yet its themes and complexities reveal new gifts to me on every rereading.<br />This novel deserves the attention it receives, and it deserves yours! Pick it up, but don't forget about it once you've read it. Its riches are revealed anew as our own life experiences evolve and change.

I think it provides important insight into a facet of the American experience given limited exposure in modernism, but as an actual work of literature I don't think it is of the same caliber as the work of Hurston's contemporary Langston Hughes (among the greatest of American poets of any time or race) or her rival Richard Wright. It is enjoyable, the dialogue is uniformly revealing and lovely, and it ends on an upbeat note utterly unusual in American modernism, but I feel that much of the prose, and especially the metaphors, are somewhat labored, especially when Hurston makes excursions into transcendentalist ontology. In other words, it does not read like a novel with its reputation should--it is good, but not great. I also question its contemporary importance and influence on the landscape of American literature, considering it was the efforts of Alice Walker that rescued it from relative obscurity. That said, its importance is in opening up a realm of narrative that was hitherto unexplored, and her voice is certainly unique. I disagree with Wright's criticism of her as basically pandering to white audiences, as she does not base her novel so much on attacking whites as elevating blacks--the visceral repudiations of Wright and Hughes are lacking. Hurston's subversiveness is more subtle, and it seems as though she is trying to create a world which is not framed by white culture--neither through exalting it nor lambasting it--rather than attempting to curry favor with the majority audience. I think this book is worth reading for historical value and as a work of literature, but in terms of narrative craft it falls short of contemporaneous works.",2009-05-06

Perhaps one of the knocks against Their Eyes Were Watching God is the lack of plot--which basically consists of Janie experiencing three separate marriages and one tragedy before returning to her home--but it is evident that this journey is deeper than the surface value allows. In many ways, Janie Crawford's experiences are a sort of buildingsroman, or coming of age, in which she gets stronger with each life episode and comes back to a better understanding of who she is and what life is about.          Janie experiences two failed marriages before finally meeting someone who allows her to live, Tea Cake. Although Tea Cake doesn't have the status that either of Janie's first two husbands had, he has a personal quality that helps her express herself more. Starks, the second husband, was a man with great ambition, and although he goes on to be mayor, he keeps Janie secluded from the community. Janie's first marriage was loveless in a way that arranged marriages might have been, and the romantic ideal of \\""marriage bringing love\\"" Janie realizes, is a fraud. However, with Tea Cake, she is able to live a little, and he has a real aspect to him that the others didn't have.          Certainly another aspect of Janie's character is her self-realization after her spiritual journey. She comes to understand what makes her a complete person, and has a more complete voice in life. It's ironic because Tea Cake, perhaps more than the others, brings on the most scrutiny and judgment from the \\""others\\"", those who are from her community. But Janie, at this point in her life, can hold her own, and comes to a realization of what is critical in the life experience.          One of the more challenging aspects of the novel is getting used to the dialect. If you have read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, then you know that certain passages are hard to get through, and this novel is similar. As one reviewer commented, listening to this novel on tape or CD would be a great way to experience this dialect for how it should sound. Therefore, it takes a bit of time, but eventually one gets accustomed to it, and can proceed at a quicker pace.          Another interesting facet of Hurston's book is the deeply symbolic nature. Janie's hair seems to be synonymous with self-expression and having a voice; she only is able to free this voice later in the novel when married with Tea Cake. In her second marriage, Janie's hair is kept hidden from all society, and seems to equate with the restrained relationship she has with Starks. The storm that Janie experiences toward the end of the novel seems to be evident of life's struggles and overcoming them. The novel itself is very circular, as it end and begins in the same spot, with Janie having \\""been to the horizon\\"" and back.          Over all, this is a novel that merits much praise, and it is great to see the revival of this great author.",2009-03-08

Janie was raised by her former-slave grandmother, who pushed Janie into a life of quiet conventionality as a farmer's wife.  Unsatisfied, however, when a man with big dreams comes along, Janie flees.  Despite the promises she was given, Janie is again pushed into a life of quiet, albeit more comfortable, conventionality as the wife of a small town shopowner and mayor.  When her second husband dies, Janie is left self-sufficient and free to choose the direction of her life.  She decides to marry a drifter named Tea Cake for love.  With Tea Cake she leaves the town that made her wealthy and heads to Florida.  Here she lives a happy and almost pastoral life as a field worker until fate deals her a devastating blow.    Their Eyes Were Watching God is among the most influential African American novels of the 20th century.  Though not uncontroversial, the novel deserves its plaudits.

She raises Leafy who gets raped by her teacher and gives birth to Janie. Leafy abandons her baby daughter in the care of her grandmother who raised her with other children.

It shouldn't be overpraised, however, simply because of the skin-tone and genital configuration of the author...which, in these times, is probably asking too much. (If students held in captivity are forced to read A BLACK FEMALE WRITER, you could do a lot worse--a whole lot worse--than ol' Zora.)    Hurston has a mostly pleasing style, with few-and-far-between intrusions of pretension (plenty of jargon-laden pretension can be found in the forward and afterword, though)...the black vernacular is a bit wearying after a while, but the plot moves briskly--sometimes extremely briskly--and is never boring. (The novel hits its stride, however, only upon the introduction of Tea Cake.)    I'd wager a few bucks that this was one of Oprah Winfrey's book selections...but that should not be held against it. It may seem a credible bagatelle to a white devil like myself, but I'm sure there are many black women for whom this could be, like Alice Walker, the most important book in their lives.",2008-02-03

It's a lost masterpiece. Thanks to Alice Walker and Oprah Winfrey, the book was brought back to the public's attention.<br /><br />One of the issues with reading Hurston's novel is that it's written in dialect--in Hurston's rendition of how Southern Florida black dialect could be spelled out to her. So reading the book is a bit slow; you have to sound out the words in your mind. If this is a problem, then I'd suggest you listen to the book on tape (ably performed by Ruby Dee) and then read the book afterwards.<br /><br />The story has barely a plot; Janey is a young woman whose grandmother was born in slavery. Her aspirations are no further than the front porch; to live in comfort means being simply able to sit, to sit on the porch and not be in constant motion, working every hour of every day for bare subsistence. She finds an older, established husband for Janey and insists she marry. Janey, then, has a life where, with reasonable work, she can fill her belly and sleep in shelter. Her life is not much better than that of a well-cared-for mule.<br /><br />One day, Janey runs off with Jody Starks, a man of means who charms her with his worldy ways. This is a man going places. And they do go places; to Eatonville, a town that was chartered as an African-American community. Starks sees opportunity in every corner of dusty Eatonville, buys land, builds a store and a house and installs the beautiful Janey as a symbol of his mastery.<br /><br />As Mayor, Starks has appearances to keep up. He has Janey stay in the house or work in the store, and when in the store, she is to keep her head covered. Janey has a wealth of long abundant hair, which Hurston uses as a symbol of life. Janey's hair is flowing and startling; men covet it. As the hair is covered, so is every enjoyment and thought Janey has. She chafes for 20 years under Stark's restrictive rules.<br /><br />The scene where the \\""town mule\\""--a mule freed by Starks from an abusive owner and that became a sort of mascot, dies and is buried in the swamp is exceptional writing, worthy of Mark Twain. The mule is eulogized (by Stark, standing at one point on the mule as podium) and then abandoned to the waiting buzzards. The following scene where the buzzards arrive to do their undertaking is a flight of fancy that is hardly equalled in American literature. All along the book, Hurston takes smaller flights of language; her descriptions sometimes soar, or are humorous or completely imaginative.<br /><br />Janey runs off after Stark's death with \\""Tea Cake\\""--a younger man. While her first two marriages were for the sustenance of the body (food, shelter, comfort, a home) this marriage is for the sustenance of the soul. Tea Cake plays guitar, plays games, dances, gambles, sings and flirts. Hurston is too clever to make him perfect; he hurts Janey, as only someone who loves another person can hurt them, and he is a bit of a cad, yet he brings out something in Janey that no life of pure material wealth could do--freedom and sensuality and joy. The culmination of the story is rather contrived, but still, the completion of the three marriages tells almost a fable-like story of a quest for personal growth. Janey comes home to Eatonville, and tells her story to Phoeby, her friend. The rest of the tale is up to us to fill in.<br /><br />Sometimes the writing reminds me of Virginia Woolf--the interior dialog and mood of the character is the action as much or more than the action happening on the story's stage. Sometimes Hurston reminds me of Twain in her delving into the linguistic richness and uniqueness of Floridian life. Her education as a folklorist sharpened her ear, but her deep honesty into the interior life of women is what makes this story so great. It's definitely one of the top American novels and deserves to be read.novels and deserves to be read.",2007-10-17

Hurston's mastery of language places this work in the top tier of Anglophone literature, and the broadness of her comprehension defies spatial, temporal, social, or political confines.  Her novel is powerful because it is humane and universal in scope.  The story enchants because the voice relating it is unfailingly compassionate.    This lyrical voice was owned by no one but Hurston herself.  Throughout her professional life, she remained true to her vision regardless of praise or criticism.

I admit to having avoided Zora Neale Hurston for years, for all the wrong reasons. I react badly to appeals to political correctness, diversity, and white male guilt. But these prejudices were completely blown out of the water by actually reading this radiant book. For Hurston simply writes about PEOPLE  -- people of a particular race, gender, time, and place, yes -- but people whose human identity flourishes from these circumstances without being in any way confined by them. I don't think I have read any work of African-American literature that is so little concerned with race tensions, poverty, or the legacy of slavery. As Henry Louis Gates Jr. quotes in his fine afterword to the Harper Perennial edition, Hurston wanted to write about \\""racial health -- a sense of black people as complete, complex, UNDIMINISHED human beings, a sense that is lacking in so much black writing and literature\\"" [emphasis hers].<br /><br />For all that, THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD is a difficult book to begin. At first, Hurston seems to be writing in two languages, likely to be equally foreign to many readers. One is the phonetically rendered dialect of her characters, which her contemporaries criticized as making them sound ignorant, but is in fact part and parcel of their vigorous life. The other is the free-form poetry of her descriptions, ordinary words strung together in unexpected ways so that they become quite new. But soon the two voices become as one: the voice of thought unfettered by academic rules. And the power of unfettered thought, the possibility of being oneself without regard to rules or roles, is the enduring theme of the book.<br /><br />The story is a simple one. Janie Crawford, fortyish, independent, returns to her community in 1920s Florida, which she had left two years before to marry a much younger man, nicknamed Tea Cake. While most of the women gossip disapprovingly, assuming the worst, she starts to tell her friend Pheoby not only about her life with Tea Cake, but also about the two marriages that preceded it. The first, when she was only a teenager, offered her protection. The second brought a measure of material prosperity. But it is only in the hand-to-mouth existence of the third that she has been able to discover her true self. Janie's story, which began in defiance, ends in quiet luminosity -- and there are many years of her life still ahead of her.<br /><br />Zora Neale Hurston was also a folklorist, and her writing is illuminated not only by the gossip, traded insults, and tall stories of the Florida blacks, but also by a country mythology that brings in animals and even plants as characters in the story. There are wonderful set pieces, such as the funeral of a mule that begins as a holiday for the entire community and ends with a humorous description of a group of buzzards waiting on permission from their leader before stripping the bones. Other sequences build detail upon detail to terrifying effect, as the South Florida hurricane of 1928 that forms the climax of the book, and precipitates its concluding events.<br /><br />The Harper Perennial paperback is a joy to read, with a cover design by Robin Bilardello that calls to mind a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, an excellent foreword by Edwige Danticat, and the Henry Louis Gates afterword. One piece of advice though: read the afterword first, if you like, but save the foreword to the end, as it gives away many details of the plot that you will enjoy discovering for yourself, surrendering to Hurston's magnificent narrative rhythm.not only about her life with Tea Cake, but also about the two marriages that preceded it.

This was a very important period of time in the United States, because these decades truly were an especially prolific time for great African-American artists, writers, dancers, musicians, photographers and others to truly express their gifts to the world.  Hurston was no exception.  Born in Notasulga, Alabama, and eventually relocated to Eatonville, Florida, Hurston based much of her novels on the experiences of those around her, in the predominantly African-American Southern town.  With a degree in Anthropology, she found the opportunity to do ethnographic research on those close to her, and truly wove some fascinating and unflinchingly realistic looks at the Southern Black experience.<br /><br />THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD (written in 1937) follows the story of the main character Janey, and her experiences with three very different sorts of men, told in flashback style to her best friend, Phoebe.  Janey's idealistic image of the relationships between men and women is not realized in reality.  In fact, the common theme of woman \\""as mule,\\"" or beast of burden, for men, keeps resurfacing.  This novel has been criticized by scholars and intellectuals alike, for what is described as a racist depiction of Southern Black life, during the early part of the 20th century.  For me, this was not the case.  I really believe that Zora Neale Hurston was channeling the experiences of many Black women she interviewed, over time, and wanted to present a realistic picture of the hardships they endured and [sometimes] overcame.

The vernacular captures the poetic rhythms of the characters' speech, and the story is structured in a satisfying arc complete with torrid romance and a climactic event of biblical proportions.  What really provoked my thought about this novel is that it is one of the few that I have read that does not explicity depict black life relative to racial struggles; The Color Purple by Alice Walker, who is greatly inspired by Hurston, being another novel.  Hurston received much criticism for this seeming exclusion of social reality.  I am initially inclined to agree with this criticism.  As the gains from reconstruction withered to nothing in the 1920's and appalling waves of racism affected millions of blacks, Hurston decided to write a mostly-racism-less novel about a voluptuous woman and her runaway lover, Tea Cake?  And yet, upon, further reflection, I believe that the novel does address racial issues but within a more symbolic scope.   <br /> <br />Take, for instance, the contrast between Eatonville and the Everglades, the twin settings which divide the novel into its two antitheses.  In Eatonville, a prosperous all-black town, the heroine, Janie and her mayor husband, Jody reign over the town, evoking a capitalistic hierarchy quite similar to that of white society (with all its oppressive characteristics intact).  Despite their material success, they are miserable, and the townspeople are alternately suspicious, fearful, and obedient.   Contrasted with the more typically African-American values of community harmony and group cooperation in the Everglades the novel seems to imply that black emulation of white society is a soulless endeavor.  In the Autobiography of Malcolm X, Malcolm X repeatedly warns his readers of the problematic attainment of a false sense of prosperity rooted in subservience to white ideals.  Hurstonand Malcolm X are probably put on diametrically opposite sides of the civil rights spectrum, but Hurston's implication could be more socially-rooted than her literary critics believed. <br /> <br /> Discounting this analysis completely and assuming that the novel is truly devoid of any social/racial commentary, the novel, by focusing on a woman's search for self-fulfillment, paradoxically limits its scope from that of the racial struggle and expands it to that of the human struggle, thereby reinforcing esteem in blacks and indirectly aiding the movement for equality.  If there is one criticism I have of this novel that I feel without any qualms or nuances of opinion, is that Janie, as a character, is too strictly defined by the men in her life.  As Janie evolves her awareness of her own identity by engaging in relationships with Logan, Jody, and Tea Cake, the novel focuses more on the personality traits of the aforementioned male characters when more psychological analysis of Janie herself would be welcome.  That all said, I greatly enjoyed \\""Their Eyes Were Watching God\\"" and the way it challenged my preconceptions about African-American literature.",2005-04-03

Where all dat money her husband took and died and left here? What dat ole forty year ole `oman doing wid her hair swingin' down her back lak some young gal?\\""<br /><br />I know nothing of Zora Neale Hurston except that she wrote a great classic in Their Eyes Were Watching God sometime in the nineteen thirties.<br />The book makes its focal point around Janie Crawford, the envy of all other black sisters because of her light skin and her below the waist long hair.  A strong and independent Afro-American woman, Janie knows what she wants out of life and leaves her town of Eatonville searching for it; finding herself at the altar on three occasions.<br />Forced more or less into the first marriage with Logan which did not last longer than a snowball in hell, Janie does her best to be a good wife, but at this stage she is still young and does not understand what is required of her in this unity which is on the verge of breaking down. As this happens, she quickly hooks up with the sweet talking Joe Starks, a man whom she looks up to and who will become the mayor of the small county where they live. Life with Joe Starks is different to the marriage with Logan as all the folks respect Starks who is responsible, thoroughly arrogant, stubborn and forces his opinions and standards on Janie, like it or not.<br />But a reprieve comes in Janie Crawford's life after the death of the Mayor, which finds her grown into maturity and with a better comprehension of the world around her, and a better understanding of her desires and how she may acquire this love which has eluded her all these years. From her past experiences Janie reaches out for marriage the third time over with a man twelve years her junior, and this is when she will taste love at its sweetest for the first time, and be acquainted with pain, racial prejudice and great loss. For lovers of classical books, this book comes highly recommended!!!<br />Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 28/03/05)",2005-03-28

Her transformation and growth occurs based on her relationships with the men in her life.<br />* The author refuses to make her heroine some kind of a \\""super-woman\\"" character.  She is an ordinary woman carrying her vulnerabilities on her shoulder as she searches for love in her life.  Not until she has experienced that love is she able to define love and come to peace with herself.<br /><br />More thoughts:  This book garnered immense criticism from Hurston's contemporaries in black literature at the time.  When compared, this book to the books by Richard Wright (her strongest critic), you can feel the difference in the expression of anguish and pain of the black people at the time.  I feel that the difference is primarily felt since Hurston's commentary on the situation is via a female voice.  Hurston's heroine had more of a universal sorrow which broke the boundaries of color.  I suppose that is why the social issues which were expected to be addressed by a writer of color at the time did not come across as the primary concern of the author. This eventually lead to \\""rejection\\"" of the book by her contemporaries.",2005-03-25

This is an amazingly rich story filled with interesting and tragic characters.  The story spans almost forty years of a woman's life, and the action never stops thanks to three husbands, three towns, a hurricane, and a murder trial. Characters range from the frivolously humorous to the intense, and the dialogue is at times witty and insightful. Filled with numerous tensions, conflicts and cliff hangers, no wonder they attempted to make this a movie-- too bad the tv version didn't do this fine novel justice. <br /> <br />The premise, that a 40 year old woman looks back on her life filed with love and tragedy is simple and told in a clear, straightforward manner.  The author thoroughly explores a human being's search for identity through a unique character -- a black woman in the 1930s. Janie struggles to find love and watches it either melt away, change or try to kill her, but she grows stronger with each experience.   <br /> <br />Janie arcs nicely from a wild, undisciplined girl to a woman who will stand by her lover even in the face of death. Her husbands are well drawn, though the first husband and third, Tea Cake were the most interesting.  The story only lags a bit during her long relationship with Joe, her second husband.   Secondary characters, such as the gossipy townfolk and the three men who hang on Janie's porch telling tales, are classics, providing humor and warmth to this otherwise harsh tale. The relationship between Janie and Tea Cake is filled with tension and drama, and will bring audiences back for more: is Tea Cake just after her money? Will he gamble away her life savings? Will they survive the hurricane? Who will have to kill who first?  Thanks Ms. Hurston for an amazing tale. <br />",2005-03-20

As a reader, I was charmed by her girlhood dreams of love only to see them dashed by an arranged, albeit safe, marriage. I gradually began to understand her struggle against familial and social expectations in order to strike a fine balance between personal happiness and the type of love she has always dreamed of. She is unable to do so under the subjugation of her first two husbands. It is only with Tea Cake that she finally discovers acceptance of herself, the ability to exercise a good amount of free will, and as near an equal partnership as she has ever known.  <br /> <br />Their Eyes Were Watching God is an interesting story because the narrative changes in an almost inconspicuous manner. There is a third-person narrative that is interwoven with Janie's personal telling of her story to her best friend Phoeby. The narrative changes succeed in not jarring the flow of her story which never ceases to entertain, amuse, and move the reader.  <br /> <br />Hurston's story is lyrical once you accept the cadence of Janie's voice. The author's acute sense of dialogue is really what embroils the reader in Janie's story. The dialogue between characters is a passport to a world where people sat talking on porches and seemed to live a hand-to-mouth existence.

Janie quietly protests her end of innocence and with the obedience of a child quietly marries and old field hand who had acquired much in the eyes of her grandmother.

I can understand that her grandmother did not want to leave her \\""uncovered\\"" after she was gone (meaning without anyone to care for her). She wanted Janie to have better covering than and security than she presently had. The author's choice of title was not by fluke, it was apparent that in the midst of the storm that all she and Tea Cake could do was keep their eyes upon God. It was through the storm that affirmed their love and it was because of the storm that tore them apart. <br /> <br />The thread that I mentioned earlier was apparent even more after she married her first husband. My discernment was that the character still enjoyed her freedom, but out of a certain desire for security was uncertain as to exactly what freedom that she longed for and desired. I feel that after she met her second husband the young go-getter. She felt that at last her dreams could be fulfilled. But later there is disappointment by way of physical and verbal abuse. <br /> <br />There seems to be a thread a growing thread and throughout the book it is woven and finally connected into a final bow.

This piece ceases to bore its reader in all aspects, whether a person may be looking for a particular style, narrative, dialect, or even just a book to read while vacationing.  This book relates to each individual on some sort of basis, mainly fitting within a family?s past hardships or dreams.  African Americans, being the main characters particularly in this novel, were shown in a different light, as well as the ?color line? being non-existent. <br /> Janie Starks is introduced at the beginning of this novel as a figure of mystery, as a woman who ?had come back from burying the dead?.  Automatically at the beginning Hurston excites the reader into finding out the story behind this secret woman that so little is known about.  Pheoby Watson, a close friend of Janie, visits her home to see if she can hear about Janie?s story.  The story she explains fills the rest of the work with wonder, sorrow, and dreams.   <br /> As the novel begins, the reader can easily conclude that the setting is in the South, with the repetitive ?southern drawl? dialect used by each of the characters.  Only the people that Janie meets in the Everglades speak a bit different, because their origin came originally from the Bahamas.  The dialect can easily be understood if the reader chooses to pay close attention to the spelling and practice reading quotations out loud.  Once you get the hang of it, reading this difference in language becomes much easier.  There are some words, such as ?jook?, that may lead to questioning amongst readers.  If the reader is not aware of the meaning of certain words, this may also throw them off track for a few pages.  What I enjoy the most about the dialect of this novel is that you can start reading it without knowing the pronunciation and meaning of some words, but finish the novel with a great understanding of almost a different language and culture. <br />Another ideal point that this novel holds is the easy-to-follow narrative.  There were not many places where a reader would become lost.  Speaking quotations are normally followed by a name to help the reader easily identify which character is saying what and when.  Though the novel was mainly a narrative as told to Phoeby by Janie, there were parts that could lead a critical leader to confusion.  At times, Janie was not present for some scenes, yet the reader was made aware of what happened there as well.  It really made me wonder, how can she be explaining this if she wasn?t even present?!  I question if this was done purposely on Hurston?s behalf, or possibly an oversight?  All in all I believe the narrative portrayed a very positive sense and contributed with the dialect to maintain a connection with the reader. <br /> The style of the novel was absolutely wonderful.  A 6th grader, as well as a graduate student from Harvard could read this novel and completely understand some of the main points.  It is easy to understand and great to add to a book list for a well-rounded reader.  Being that this novel was written a time ago, much of factual history can be found in relation to the times, such as the flooding of Lake Okechobee and the acknowledgement of the Jim Crow laws. <br /> With the above explanation of dialect, narrative, and style and why they are so important in critiquing this novel, I would truly like to hit upon the aspects of feminism and race that were so prevalent throughout the duration of reading.  Hurston was not only African American, but she was female on top of all that.  Her position in society was quite marginalized, and I believe her written work truly helped convey that women should no longer be considered property of their men nor domesticated servants to please their husbands at every command; women should seek men for love, for commitment, for someone to support them and their endeavors they may seek.  The pear tree found in this novelmay only be mentioned quite briefly at the beginning, but it holds all the dreams of women and plays a very important role in decision-making for Janie. <br /> Though race is prominent in this novel, the ?color line? that so many authors criticize is not present.  I was shocked at one quote, ?Us colored folks is too envious of one ?nother. Dat?s how come us don?t git no further than us do.  Us talks about de whiteman keepin? us down! Shucks! He don?t have tuh.  Us keeps our own selves down?.  This I had never heard from an African-American.  This particular point of view doesn?t seem to be present in many pieces, especially those of slave narratives.  It truly showed me that there can always be two sides to every story.  To relate it to present day racial problems, maybe affirmative action isn?t holding the races down; races themselves may be merely suppressing their future.  I acquired a greater understanding of the African American race and truly felt that I could relate some hardships with characters, regardless of my race or ethnicity.   <br /> In conclusion, I greatly recommend this book for use by any reader who is truly interested in a great read.  This novel has everything a reader could desire: thrill, dreams, excitement, sorrow, hardships, and the enduring American freedom.  I believe this book has shaped a greater understanding and acceptance of races in my beliefs, and this will help me for many years to come.  So take the chance, grab this book, and enjoy!   <br />",2004-07-21
US,32728083,R3JQGNYRI8IBGO,0060931418,624509678,Their Eyes Were Watching God,Books,5,4,5,N,N,"An American Classic: &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;","In an early scene of a classic American novel about a woman, her lovers and her life, an ardent and passionate woman draws the stares and consternation of the women of her community as she walks down the street. As familiar as this scene may seem to readers and fans of Nathaniel Hawthorne&#146;s classic &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, this scene opens another American classic, Zora Neale Hurston&#146;s magnum opus, &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God.&quot; When originally published, the book received some critical acclaim, but was panned by many of Ms. Hurston&#146;s contemporaries, most notably Richard Wright. This contributed to the book fading in and out of circulation (and mind) for some forty years until it was rediscovered in the mid-seventies and has since ultimately experienced (and rightfully so) a huge revival among popular readers and the American literary community. Zora Neale Hurston and her novel are enjoying the same type of resurrection and redemption that her heroine Janie ultimately experiences as she attempts to live her own life. Ms. Hurston&#146;s extraordinary use of a combination of a beautifully poetic narrative voice and wonderfully rich southern African American dialect makes &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; an enjoyable and fascinating read. <br /> Written in the mid-1930&#146;s (as the Harlem Renaissance was fading), and set in rural Florida &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; tells the story of Janie Crawford, an idealistic young black woman desperately searching for love and meaning in her life. The book opens with Janie&#146;s return to the hometown of Eatonville that she left earlier. Janie makes her way home amid the glaring eyes and gossiping tongues of the &quot;porch sitters&quot;, &quot;&#146;Where&#146;s dat blue satin dress she left here in?&#146;&quot;, and the lusting men who objectify Janie, &quot;&#133;the men, were saving with the mind what they lost with the eye.&quot; After having silently endured all of this Janie sits down with a friend to finally tell the tale in her voice&#151;herstory as opposed to history.  <br /> Janie Crawford story is one of self-revelation as we see her attempting to find the love she needs, herself and her own voice through three marriages. In the process of reliving Janie&#146;s life in this manner, Ms. Hurston allows the reader to walk and experience along with Janie as she gleans the truths, confronts the lies, learns from her mistakes and ultimately begins the process of learning and defining herself. Janie&#146;s early life is marked by duality&#151;idealism/pragmatism, privilege/disadvantage, and black/white. Raised on a white farm among white children, Janie doesn&#146;t realize her blackness until one day she looks at a photograph that had been taken of her and her playmates. Her Grandmother, &quot;Nanny&quot; who has raised her, childhood and her young adult years constructed Janie&#146;s. Nanny wants Janie to live a better life than both she and Janie&#146;s mother had (both Janie and Janie&#146;s mother were products of rapes). However, Nanny&#146;s idea of want constitutes a good life and Janie&#146;s differ distinctly.  <br /> Nanny&#146;s plan for her only grandchild centers around Janie marrying&#151;as early as possible&#151;a settled, hardworking provider (perhaps motivated in an attempt to circumvent the possibility that she might be raped while still young), &quot;Tain&#146;t Logan Killicks ah wants you to have, baby, it&#146;s protection.&quot; The idea of marrying for love and companionship take second place to putting oneself in a reasonably secure life. Janie wants more, her idea and vision of her married life doesn&#146;t depend so much on comfort and stability but one of pastoral beauty, &quot;This singing she heard had nothing to do with her ears. The rose of the world was breathing out smell&#133;She saw a dust-bearing bee sink into the sanctum of a bloom; the thousand sister-calyxes arch to meet the love embrace and the ecstatic shiver of the tree&#133; So this was marriage!&quot;  <br /> Janie&#146;s has little control of her own life at this point and though she protests, she gives into the marriage to Logan Killicks that Nanny has arranged for her. Janie is not happy in this marriage and ultimately leaves Logan for Joe Starks, a man who at first appears to be a breath of fresh air into Janie&#146;s life. Joe Starks is an African American self-made man in the tradition of Benjamin Franklin. He has come to Florida with lots of money in his pockets and proceeds to purchase the land and then build, and incorporate an all black town in Eatonville, installing himself as Mayor, Postmaster and general &quot;Pooh-Bah&quot; of the town. As their lives progress together however, the shine begins to wear off of Joe and their marriage, as Joe&#146;s voice, personality and presence overshadows and oppresses Janie. She is no longer Janie; she has evolved into &quot;Missus Starks&quot; and &quot;The Mayor&#146;s Wife&quot;.  <br /> Janie&#146;s next begins her love affair with &quot;Tea Cake&quot;. Though older than Tea Cake in years, Janie&#146;s spirit and love of life are more of a match with Tea Cake than with either of her previous husbands. With Tea Cake Janie experiences some to the love and freedom that she has hungered for. She is able to feel like a woman and just as importantly feel the love of a man. In a well crafted scene, Tea Cake visits a lemon tree to make lemonade for Janie, thus harkening back to the earlier scene of Janie discovering love and intimacy while reclining among a grove of fruit trees. Janie&#146;s relationship with the youthful and apparently less respectable Tea Cake upsets many of the people of the town, but Janie has grown to the point that she has decided that for once she will choose her destiny. Janie&#146;s destiny is inextricably bound to Tea Cakes as she leaves the safety of Eatonville for the sanctuary of the wild Florida Everglades.  <br /> Throughout the novel Janie&#146;s voice is sometimes heard and sometimes silenced, and it is through her silence or speech that we see Janie&#146;s maturity and strength. In the end Janie&#146;s own voice and the fact that she speaks while others are silenced, ultimately saves and redeems her.  <br /> Ms. Hurston presents the reader with a complex heroine and narrative, that challenges every reader to accept them as presented. Janie, is a complex woman who is neither perfectly pure nor corrupt, but end in the end just Janie Crawford. So too is Janie&#146;s story. Janie at times appears weak, as when she gives in to the wishes of Nanny, yet she is strong enough to leave the security of Logan and his farm in search of the life that she inherently knows awaits her out there in the unknown somewhere, if she has the courage to pursue it. Janie may appear intimidated by certain people or aspects of life yet she faces her future calmly during a climatic trial.  <br /> Ms. Hurston weaves a story as complex as its main character. Ms. Hurston&#146;s novel though often read as a feminist narrative doesn&#146;t bombard the reader with an ideology of the power of women over men or vice-versa, but presents us with a vignette into a life of a woman&#151;a real live African American woman&#151;who will not be defined by any of the narrow terms that other people in its pages want to define her with, whether they are black, white, men or women. The story could easily be read as an anti-feminist novel in that, though Janie wants desperately to be in control of her own life, she knows that her life is so worthwhile that she eagerly wants to share that life with the man that she loves, thus possibly acquiescing this control to a man again. The reader must approach this novel from the aspect of it ultimately being a story about this woman. Ms. Hurston does not put her in the context of a black woman living and competing in a white world, nor does she concretely present her as a woman livingin a man&#146;s world, though she deftly navigates both of these issues. What Zora Neale Hurston has accomplished with Their Eyes Were Watching God is present the reader with an honest and beautifully crafted novel about a life&#151;an African American Woman&#146;s life&#151;that is worth living and reading about.  <br />",2004-07-21

The Language may require some getting use<br />to but it is well worth it. The novel incorporates a myriad of<br />oral performances- personal narratives, folktales, and sermons-<br />and charts the comming to womanhood of protagonist Janie Starks.<br />The novel is not for those who demand sex or high drama,instead<br />it is a video of words that depict the entirety of the basic <br />concerns of black folk in a new town of their own.

Janie was married to an older man(Mr. Logan<br />Killicks) through her grandmother when she was about 16, Mr Kil-<br />licks could never satisfy the desires of his ambitious maidens<br />heart,therefore Janie runs away with the dynamic,most ambitious<br />Joe Starks who promises her everything except the loving she de-<br />sires.At first Janie imagines this is the relationship she has <br />dreamed of until Joe's male chauvinistic beliefs begin to <br />stifle her ambitions. After 20 years of marriage,and the death<br />of Joe, Janie meets a young \\""Jiggalo\\"" named \\""Tea Cake\\"" who <br />helps her come to some self actualization which she is pleased<br />with. Because citizenship, and racial equality were hot issues,<br />Jim Crow was in fulleffect,and lynching of black men a regular<br />Sunday outing durning this era in America, Hurston's novel was <br />the target of much criticism from literary peers like Richard<br />Wright because there was no voice of black militancy,or outrage<br />at circumstances confronting black folk,and the issues seem to <br />have been ommited from the story, with the exception of Janie<br />discovering she was the child of a white rapist school teacher.<br />I feel Hurston's millitant was Janie herself. She was a woman <br />that was always told what to do, and when to do it. Most of her<br />actions or lack of action throughout the novel were motoviated<br />by submission, or liberation.<br />As the vernacular thickened, and the climax is approached,Janie<br />achieves the freedom of love,freedom of speech, and the liber-<br />ation of her feminine conscious through her affair with Mr. Tea<br />Cake.

US,17204543,R35AI6BP5LFBZ0,0060931418,624509678,Their Eyes Were Watching God,Books,5,1,2,N,N,"Their Eyes Were Watching God and Why it is an Excellent Book","Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston is truly a major American book that everyone should read at some point in their life. This piece deals with romance and the minority?s story because the main character, Janie, is an African American female.  In this text Hurston writes about the everyday life of the minority not the extremes or rare occurrences. By looking closely at this piece we are able to see why this novel should be read by everyone.  <br />     The novel centers on Janie who is a minority within the minority. Not only is she an African American which makes her a minority to the white class but she is very light skinned, making her a minority within the black class. Although this makes her an outcast within her society Hurston allows the reader to know that she is comfortable in her own skin right from the start when she returns home to talk to Phoeby. For the most part, Hurston leaves the white race out of the book. Many authors place the African Americans and other minorities in the margins; however, Hurston is able to turn things around and place the white race in the margins instead. She is able to write a text about African Americans while leaving out the usual slavery issues and the color line. Hurston is able to shed some light upon the issue of why the African American race is kept down. She writes, ??He?s liable tuh do it too, Hicks. Ah hope so anyhow. Us colored folks is too envious of one ?nother. Dat?s how come us don?t git no further than us do. Us talks about de white man keepin? us down! Shucks! He don?t have tuh. Us keeps our own selves down?? (39). Some of the common ideology is turned around when Hurston presents ideas like this to her readers.      <br />     The story deals with romance and this is one aspect that makes the book appealing. Janie compares love to a pear tree and the image that Hurston paints is so sweet and sensual that the idea engulfs us into believing what true love and marriage really is. Hurston writes, ?She saw a dust-bearing bee sink into the sanctum of a bloom; the thousand sister-calyxes arch to meet the love embrace and the ecstatic shiver of the tree from root to tiniest branch creaming in every blossom and frothing with delight. So this was a marriage? (11). This pear tree represents the love that Janie is searching for throughout the novel. It is interesting that love is found in the most unusual person.  <br />     The dialect is a little difficult to understand at the beginning; however, as you progress through the book it becomes easier to comprehend. This gives a more accurate portrayal of life in the south. Hurston writes, ??Ah don?t mean to bother wid tellin? ?em nothin?, Pheoby. ?Tain?t worth de trouble. You can tell ?em what Ah say if you wants to. Dat?s just de same as me ?cause mah tongue is in mah friend?s mouf?? (6). The language is so accurate because Hurston studies anthropology. The voice that Hurston gives her characters make them seem realistic and not just a character in a made up novel.  <br />Another thing that makes this an excellent novel is the thought provoking moments that Hurston includes within the text. Some of them seem to be simple but when you stop and think they make sense and force you to look back upon your own life. Hurston explains, ?There are years that ask questions and years that answer? (21). The poetic language that Hurston writes makes it easy to flow through; however, because she writes these thought provoking sentences, the reader is forced to slow down and think about the meanings behind the words that fill the pages. Hurston says, ?The years took all the fight out of Janie?s face. For a while she thought it was gone from her soul. No matter what Jody did, she said nothing. She had learned how to talk some and leave some. She was a rut in the road. Plenty of life beneath the surface but it was kept beaten down by the wheels? (76). This image of Janie being the rut in the road is something that most readers can relate to. At some point almost everyone has felt the way Janie feels throughout the text and because Hurston is able to use the thought provoking images, the reader can relate to the book.  <br />     By looking closely at the text we are able to see why this piece should be read by everyone. It takes the usual conventions of an African American text and turns them upside down. Hurston writes about love and romance that makes us think about our own lives.  The dialect, although a little difficult to understand at the beginning, makes us step into the south when reading this book because it is a more accurate portrayal of the life the characters are living. In this book Hurston writes in a smooth, poetic type voice that includes these thought provoking moments that makes the reader stop and remember his or her own life and relationships. This amazing piece of literature is highly recommended for all to enjoy from the high school student who has not experience everything in the book to the grandparent who wants to reflect about the experiences they have already had.    <br /> <br />",2004-07-20

After her second husband died this all changed. She met a man named Tea Cake and fell in love. This was the first time Janie ever experienced true love.<BR> I use to feel like Janie. I felt like I was trying to live my life up to everyone else's expectations. This was fine until I realized I was unhappy. I'm also a risk taker in love like Janie. Even though everyone had bad thoughts of Tea Cake and Janie's relationship Janie doesn't care. She went off and married Tea Cake anyways.

From there, Hurston  does a spectacular job of keeping the reader interested by jumping to Janie's childhood, leaving all questions unanswered; thusly creating suspense. We learn of Janie's emotional dealings with racism and having to be black, and her own personal ideology of love. Before she knew it, she was married and had moved. Then ran and was married again. Then he died and ran off to, yes, be married yet again.<br />Through Janie's three different husbands, she comes out in the end the same, independent, beautiful black women she had started as. In each husband scenario she is treated as a possession, a strong statement for Zora Neale Hurston on the mistreatment of women. As well, in each romantic chapter she is tried to be broken and sculpted, much like the stubborn mule that was taunted by the men of Eaton. With the mule, it was only when he was freed that he could finally be content and at peace. Here, Hurston is assimilating the townsmen with sexist men and the half-broken starved mule with the independent women who were constantly being cut down. Unfortunately, no matter how desperately a flower is pruned and beat down, it will sprout and bloom just a vigorously, if not more so, than in the beginning. Dissimilarly, her first husband Logan gives her nothing, but does give her grandmother security in knowing Janie is well taken care of. Joe Starks, hubby no. two gives her wealth and a name in the community, but Tea Cake gives her a sense of adventure and enabled her embrace her beauty as a woman and a living, working human being. None the less, she returns to Eaton, only to discover even more of a buzz had accumulated in her absence.<br />Likewise to her ability to capture the tone of the community, is the amazing talent of Hurston to depict the emotion and dialect of the people featured in the book. Although the simplistic phonetically-spelled terminology seen throughout the novel is prevalent, the author incorporates `common' English in the narrative as well, making for a beautifully artistic technique. This method is effective in illustrating the mindset and intellectual capacities of the characters. Mayor Starks is an eloquent orator and this shows through his terminology, while the more common folk are, well, more grammatically challenged. Each character posed some sort of influence on Janie throughout the novel, whether major of minor, constructive or not. Each and every major persons in this book evoked some emotion from Janie; laughter, a sense of inferiority, malice or love.<br />Janie ends as she starts, only more of a woman, more of a lover, and even more at peace with life, love and herself. Zora Neale Hurston did a spectacular job of portraying the conflicts facing a black female in a white man's world, leaving the reader with a confidence that indeed, we shall overcome.",2004-05-27

I must admit that I chose &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; simply on account of its length; of course I waited until the last minute to read it.  I was expecting it to be another book about the oppression of blacks by whites-I cannot count how many of that theme I have read.  I opened the front cover, dreading the next 200 pages.  As I began to read, however, I was intrigued.  Hurston had created a character, Janie Crawford, who was searching for a voice, for her own identity, a topic that I could actually relate to, especially now, as I head off to college.  Janie, like most of my peers, didn't know who she was.  She was married early in her teen years and for most of her life had been a trophy wife to Jody, her second husband.  Not until she met Tea Cake did she begin to have a chance to discover herself.  Originally, all she knew about herself was that she was a woman.  Her mulatto background added to the confusion of where she belonged.

Hurston was a member of the Harlem Renaissance movement, but was abhorred by Richard Wright who criticized her severely.  Nonetheless, this book was an alternate pick of the Book of the Month Club when originally published.  A short time later, some very ugly charges were leveled against Hurston; she eventually cleared her name but she never really got over it.  Her books went out of print and she died, penniless, and was buried in an unmarked grave.  Alice Walker found what was presumably Hurston's grave and erected a monument that reads, in addition to her name and dates, &quot;Genius of the South.&quot;<br />Their Eyes Were Watching God has quite a bit of Hurston's life, and more importantly, her beliefs invested in the main character of Janie Crawford.  The novel is framed by Janie's return to Eatonville, the first all black incorporated city in the United States.  Everyone in town is gossiping about her, and Janie tells her story to Pheoby, her best friend, and asks her to tell the townsfolk.  Janie was raised by grandmother, Nanny, a former slave, who marries her off to an older farmer, Logan Killicks, when she's 16.  She's not happy in that marriage and she leaves and marries Joe Starkes, who takes her to the new town of Eatonville.  He becomes mayor there, and builds a store that becomes the center of town life.  Twenty years later he dies, and she hooks up with the love of her life, Tea Cake, who is much younger than she is.

The novel constits of many characters that help inspire the novel in many ways. The main character, Janie, is an African- American woman that struggles her whole life to find \\"" true love\\"" in her marriages. Being victims of rape, her mother and grandmother have placed an image for love of men different from her feelings of what love should be. Another factor that stood in her way of being happy was the fact that she was an African American woman at that time. At her time, the African American woman had to struggle with the world around her. Most women at that time were not respected or treated the way a woman should be. So it revels the hardships that many African American women went through at that time. Unfortunately for Janie she had to go through two marriages before she finds \\""true love.\\"" I found this very saddening because being a woman I could relate to the lost feelings she yearned for. Love is a wonderful feeling and comes in many different forms. For example, the love you have towards a child is different from the love a wife would have for her husband. As you read through the hard times Janie yearns for love from a companion, you sort of feel what she is feeling. It's as if you can feel the sadness she is feeling. Then when she does find love with her third husband, you feel the sparks and love they have for one another. The best part of the story was the ending.

I believe that it's not only a feminist novel, but any person that is fascinated and touched by the power of love will definitely be attracted to this novel. It conveys the struggles this young African American woman went through to find her life companion, soul mate and lover. What really attracted me to the character Janie was how she tended to get back up on her feet despite her numerous falls. Moreover, the construction of the novel and the slang that was used made me, as the reader, feel as if I personally knew her and felt every sorrow and happiness that she went through. Janie conveys a determined and strong character. Throughout her beginning life, she felt the lack of affection and emotional love. Her being forced to think that love is revealed after marriage was really a myth that her grandmother embedded in her mind. Her grandmother's downfalls in life taught her that poverty is the main necessity for a fulfiller and happier marriage. The failing of her first marriage causes her to realize that poverty it not the basis of love. Poverty was just a way that her grandmother thought would protect her. I think that when Janie followed and lived with this myth, she just ended up wasting her time. When she finally does find her ideal love, it made me feel her happiness and overwhelming passion that was tucked away for so long. She ultimately found and brought to light passions that were hidden in her. It's hard to believe how she can still reveal love and affection even though she was never able to show it. Her suffered and bruised heart was healed with the power of love. Her last marriage is what she always dreamed of. The ending of the novel is surprising and it will shock you.

Both books drew many feelings out of me.  However, the main character Janie brought something out of me that inspired me to write.  I found myself relating to her in so many ways and wishing that she would one day have the life that she truly deserved.<br />     When the book first started, I felt sorry for Janie.  She was the gossip of the town and had only one true friend.  The sad thing was that people mainly disliked Janie because of her beauty, not because of her character.  Many were simply jealous.  Deep down I could never imagine what is would be like to be raised by any one other than my parents.  True enough, she had the love of her grandmother, but never knowing your parents seems unbearable.  Once I read on, I came to think...how could she ever really know herself without meeting her parents?  Having my parents as a vital role within my life helps complete me.  I'm blessed to know both of them inside and out and through them, I find my identity, my history, and most importantly myself.  There must have been a deep hole that could never be filled for Janie since she did not have the same opportunity with her parents (or even one parent for that matter).  Perhaps she expected men to fill this hole.  I know personally I could never be whole without my parents.  Then on top of that, she only had stories to go off of to learn what her mom was really like.<br />     Janie's first marriage to Logan did not go as expected.  However she trusted the words of her grandmother and hoped that one day she could ignore the love she didn't have for him to focus on his wealth and be thankful.  Those words sound so familiar.  My mom has told me on more than one occasion that you marry for finance not romance (but she claims that with my father she was lucky to receive both :) ).  Nanny's words sounded like a replica of my mother's.  I sympathized with Janie because how could you marry and stay with someone that you didn't love.  It seems impossible.  I always thought that love was more important than the wealth and possessions of a man.<br />     Throughout the novel, Janie seems to search for this ideal horizon of how she wants her life to be.  As a reader, this kept me interested because the author creates this sense of hope for Janie within the novel.  This leaves the reader wanting the best for Janie and hoping that by the conclusion of the novel, her happiness will be attained.  Isn't everyone on a quest in life?  Don't we all have this ideal image of how we want our purpose of life to be served?  One of the saddest things for me to imagine is for someone to go through life unhappy.  You only have one life.  Why shouldn't it be the best that it could possibly be?  I believe with all my heart that happiness is something that we all deserve.  Through Janie's ups and downs, I remained hopeful that her character would find that something to fill the hole in her heart.  I hoped that one day she could be complete and find the happiness that everyone deserved.  <br />     I believe that this book speaks to women.  This is my opinion.  I would find it hard to believe that a woman would not be able to identify with some aspect of this book.  I could personally relate to so many!  This book touched me in regards to the absence of her parents in her life and also within her quest to find her horizon that would grant her the happiness that she never had.  However, I found the main themes to center around identity and happiness.  I felt that this book also lets women know how they should be treated.  If you know who you are and you are happy with who you are, you will know exactly what you deserve in life and you will come to realize that settling is not an option.<br />I hope that future readers enjoy this book as much as I did, especially women readers.  Within this book, there are so many things that women can relate to.  Happy reading!!!",2004-03-31

I think men and women will enjoy reading the book because it is a story of relationships between men and women, their attitudes and thoughts during the 1930's. The story is told in first person, but we glimpse the attitudes of the men through Janie's narrative. Women were expected to be obedient and subservient to their men. Men showed their love through their provision for the family, not through a lot of romantic dreaming.  That women needed men to take of them was instilled in Janie before her grandmother died. Janie was forced to marry her first husband so that grandmother could die in peace knowing that her granddaughter would be taken care of. <BR>      When smooth talking Jody Sparks came along, promising to take her away from such a life, and place on her rightful pedestal, Janie at first hesitated,because Jody did not represent pear blossoming trees of love either. But Jody represented freedom, and hope. She flung off the apron that tied her to Killicks, and ran off and married Jody.<BR>Janie was forced to suppress her selfhood under her husbands' dreams for himself. Janie was not allowed to speak her own thoughts, nor was she able to be what she needed to be.

Janie's character is strong in this story, yet she is considered meek and feminine.  Although her marriages were unfulfilling and loveless, Janie does not make a move on her own to end them.

The literature class I was sitting in on drew out the symbolism of the two husbands prior to Tea Cup.  And how this symbolized black women at that time in history.  I found this interesting.  I also enjoyed the postscript on the life of Zora Hurston, and how obscure she was until several years after her death.

Zora Neal Hurston deals with the emotions of one young African American woman, Janie, and the three men who have come into her life.  The author keeps us in Janie's mind even when she is not in the first person.  She starts out in flashback, girlfriend to girlfriend telling her story to her neighbor and best friend Pheoby.  We women are more prone to share our feelings with another about things, especially our great and not so great loves.  In this story, Janie had it all. <BR>The first man was Logan Killicks, who is her older, unattractive but financially stable first husband.  This was an arranged marriage by her grandmother.   I tried to remember what I was like as a teen at her age and couldn't begin to imagine how I would accept being setup to marry an old man who was looking for free labor for his farm in the form of a wife. I put myself in Janie's place and I know that is the time of life when we have all these dreams about love and life and how that one special man is out there for us.<BR>Even though we were born in different times and places, at her age I thought I was going to live a fairy tale with the man of my dreams as most girls do. Then life takes over and in her case it took over way too young.  Janie dreams about the love she thinks may be in her future and then she gets married to this old guy. The young Janie struggles and tries to find some personal fulfillment in this loveless marriage but it does not happen.  I had very mixed emotions about Janie at this point in her life.  She acted spoiled and lazy and I had to keep reminding myself that she was acting like a normal teenage girl. She had all the temperament and emotion that goes along with a difficult stage of growing up. <BR>The second man is Joe Starks who entices her with words, his dreams and his plans for the future.   I started to believe this was going to be it for Janie.  He told her that she would not work for him but rather have others doing things for her.  I should have known that if it sounds too good to be true it usually is.  While Joe was intelligent and aggressive and quite the entrepreneur I think Joe was worse for her. While he successfully provides for her, this relationship is not good.  I would hate to be treated like a possession and a man talking down to me as if I cannot be his equal would be insulting and unacceptable to me. This is how Joe treated Janie.  He is verbally abusive and jealous and he wants Janie to be seen and envied but not heard.  What I like in this part of the book was Hurston starts to tell you what Janie is feeling and thinking.  You start to rally behind her and I waited for her to just tell Joe where to go. I started to appreciate Janie's opinions and thoughts but wanted her to speak up more then she did.   The physical abuse was intolerable to me.  Violence towards women was common and accepted at the time.  I wish that was when Hurston had given her the voice and courage to stand up for herself and liberate herself from him.  That is easy for me to say being the reader who is not in danger and involved in a domestic dispute.<BR>Her third marriage was with the fun-loving and wild Tea Cake.  She shares more with him then the other two combined.  He offers little in the way financial security, which was the opposite of the first two, but he offers much more in the way of sharing and introducing her to life experiences. You see more emotion in Janie when she is with him then throughout the first half of the book.  While reading, I was not quite sure if he was a gold-digger out to woo a wealthy woman or if he was truly interested in Janie herself.  Looking for the balance here, I would want the financial security Joe provided with the romance and fun experienced with Tea Cake.  That would be perfect for all of us but not likely possible. Being a realist though I know that life does not work that way for most ofus, and it did not for Janie.  I know that when it is the right man, sometimes the rules go out the window along with logic and for Janie, Tea Cake was the right man and the life he offered her was what she accepted and embraced because she was with him.  At least Janie got to experience the \\""love of her life\\"" even though she had to go through a lot to get to that point.

We're introduced to Janie Crawford as she returns to Eatonville, FL.  Shunned by the people of this small town, she relies on her best friend to relate her experiences back to them in an attempt to satisfy their curiosity.  Weaving in flashbacks of her life as a child and on through her adulthood to the present moment, we're able to see Janie's growth.<br /><br />Raised by her grandmother, Janie was led to believe that a marriage to a wealthy man would bring her happiness; even if that wasn't the case initially. Unfortunately,  wealth alone is not enough for Janie; yet she learns to set boundaries on what she will and will not accept from a man.  Soon after, she leaves town with a smooth-talking man who promises her the world.  While he becomes quite successful and is able to provide for her, it's not the materialistic things she has her heart set on.  When he dies, she is given one more opportunity to find true love with a younger man who ends up being her soul mate.<br /><br />Through Janie's relationships, the dialogue, and settings, readers are able to see her internal conflict with what society forces upon her, what she's been taught to believe, and her feelings.  The story captures her struggle for equality, not only because she was black, but also because she was a woman.<br /><br />Sometimes a person needs the hardships of life, as well as a deep look inside themselves to truly be happy with their lives. While the romantic relationship between Janie and her husbands are at the forefront of this book, it contains so much more.  It is about Janie finding peace, acceptance, and embracing who she really was. Through Hurston's lyrical tone and the use of the time period's dialect, this story is brought to life beautifully. We're not only able to hear Janie's thoughts; we're able to feel them too.

It was most certainly memorable.  But was it uplifting?<br />I feel more than a bit funny just asking that question, much less answering it.  Not being black myself, I'm probably not the best person to decide just how inspiring this book is.  The story to me came across as very real.  It has its moments of joy and humor, but it also had plentiful helpings of sorrow and pain.  So where is the inspiration?  How is this the prototypical Black novel of affirmation?  Is the affirmation found simply in the telling of the story, no matter how sad?  Does putting the pain and sorrow into words of beauty somehow empower the victim?  Is it the fact that the heroine perseveres in the face of so much adversity, and finds joy in life when there is little to find?<br />Honestly, I felt more pity for Janie than anything.  Time and again she proves to have an enormous heart, her most endearing quality as a character and also the one that gets her into the most trouble.  She is trusting when perhaps she shouldn't be, loving when perhaps she shouldn't be, and forgiving when perhaps she shouldn't be.  Her judgment is less than perfect and is often clouded by emotion.<br />It's hard to find inspiration in any of the other characters either.  Joe Starks is too ambitious, mostly in the pejorative sense of the word, and shows little respect for Janie.  Tea Cake comes across as conniving, deceitful, and manipulative.  And none of the other characters seems all that bright.<br />But maybe it's precisely in the realism of the story that the inspiration lies.

In addition to her volumes on folklore and ethnology, she wrote four novels and several stories and coauthored a play with Langston Hughes, all of which drew heavily on the material she collected for her studies and on events from her own life. Of her works of fiction, &#34;Their Eyes Were Watching God&#34; is undoubtedly her best and, after reading it a second time, I have even more admiration for her accomplishment.<br /><br />One of the reasons the book resonates today with so many readers is the story's major theme: the difficulty of reconciling the struggle between social approval and well-being, on the one hand, and passion and self-respect, on the other. The heroine, Janie, must often do what is expected of her (by her grandmother, her husbands, or the community) at the expense of her own pleasure.<br /><br />Yet Hurston intends to do more than tell a simple story of a Southern black woman looking for Mr. Right. The author introduces characters and sketches that have less to do with the advancement of the plot and more to do with creating an environment: what life was like for black communities in Florida during the early twentieth century--the humor and the resentment, the misery and the fortitude, the camaraderie and the backstabbing. Characteristic of this leisurely documentary method is the manner in which the town's older inhabitants razz one another or the tale of Matt and his yellow mule, which manages to be at once funny, appalling, touching, and inspiring. All in all, the use of dialect and the meandering style make this novel not an &#34;easy read&#34; but a rewarding one.<br /><br />It saddens me that so many high school students are required to read this book.

With a novel like this, that has been embraced by so many, to say that you did not care for it is almost like sacrilege. And yet, when it comes down to it, you have to speak your personal opinion. I found a lot of good things in here, but on the whole, I wasn't taken by it.<br />The story itself is about Janie Crawford, a young black female in Florida who wants to marry for love, but whose mother forces her into a union with this old man simply because of his economic status. Janie listens to her mother, who tells her that love will come after awhile, but soon discovers that, instead, once the honeymoon is over, what comes is a different sort of treatment. She runs away with a smooth talking city fellow named Jody who has big dreams. His idea is to create a town of all black people. Janie runs off with him and helps him open a store then become mayor of Eatonville. At first, Janie thinks she has found the perfect life, but Jody refuses to acknowledge her, putting her conversely on a pedestal (the Mayor's wife) and runs her down (embarrassing her skills in the store). When Jody dies, Janie is courted by a young man named Tea Cake. With him, she discovers love. To end there, however, would be a fairy tale, and this is a story where not everyone lives happily ever after.<br />The book contains a lot of dialect--almost all of the dialogue is in the language of the Florida black community--and after awhile, you get used to it. I mention it because it would likely put some readers off the book.<br />Hurston also wrote an ethnography of African-American stories and myths called Mules and Men, and I'm much more interested in checking that out than more of her fiction, which, as accomplished as it is, just didn't appeal to me.n checking that out than more of her fiction, which, as accomplished as it is, just didn't appeal to me.",2003-06-08

I do not often give 5 stars, but this novel deserves it. First of all, the language -- whether it be sentence structure, dialect, or the beautiful metaphors -- make this a wonderful read for that reason alone. Yet the content of the book on top of that makes it absolutely superb.<br />The premise of the novel is one southern black woman's (Janie) journey through life from her early years as a teenager to mid-life, as she attempts to find happiness and that too often elusive ingredient of love in her life. And although at one point she finds it (though it is short-lived and ends tragically) you'll find yourself both happy and sad for her as nothing about this book is formulaic or cliche. It should also be noted that the novel seems to have a fable-like quality to it at times. Not like the magical realism found in &quot;Beloved&quot; as this book seems realistic throughout, but you still can't help but sometimes feel you've stepped into a bit of an Aesoph's fable; but it works as you're never taken out of the moment.<br />I also have to say that the two chapters where Janine first meets Tea Cake are two of the best chapters (both in writing and in content) that I've ever read. You can actually &quot;watch&quot; them falling in love in a lyrical, magical, and wonderful sort of way. In fact, I've gone back a couple times just to re-read those two chapters, and each time have been unable to keep myself from smiling like a great, big dope (which believe me, is saying a lot for this reader). Also, the last page of the novel is written beautifully as well. I would love to quote it here, but I would not want to ruin the experience for a potential reader, and it is far more effective within the context of the novel once you reach that point.<br />Judging from the title, it may lead one to think the book may be &quot;preachy&quot; in terms of God and/or religion, but surprisingly, it's not. Granted, in the very last chapter, it does get maybe a tad heavy handed in a couple places, but since the novel has not done anything remotely close to that throughout, you don't even notice it as you continue to let the words of Janie's experience seep into you.<br />So do yourself a favor -- whether you read classic literature for literary dissection, or simply for sheer enjoyment, you can't do wrong with this book as it's one of those rare treats that incredibly allows for both.",2003-05-01

The protagonist Janie had grown throughout the book--from her teenage years of nascent sexual maturity, to her eventual self-actualization while with her third husband Teacake, Janie's progress as a Black woman was one filled with much yearning and anguish. Yet, the beauty of the book was that Janie found what she was looking for--\\""so much life\\"" and so much \\""peace.\\"" Moreover, she did this while bearing the \\""brunt\\"" of being both a Black and a woman. <BR> The tale of Janie took place in various locations in Florida during the early 1900s. And though the time was apparently long after the drudgeries of the slavery era, there was an atmosphere of relinquishment and servility among the Blacks. However, this did not take away from the vivacity and hue of the Black communities, as it was still one steeped with vibrant culture and colorful language. Born and raised in Eatonville, Florida, Hurston's personal experiences with the Black community gave ample manifestations in the language and actions of the characters. The relentless, and comical, lashings from Sam and Lige against the miser Matt Bonner, who refused to sufficiently feed his malnourished mule, demonstrated this colorful language:<BR> \\"" Dat mule of yourn, Matt.

For Janie's grandmother (Nanny), these dreams entailed sitting on a high pedestal--being like the White \\""Mastah\\"" on the Big House porch. And the anxieties of not achieving so much was unbearable for her. Yet, for Janie, her aspirations were different. <br /> Simply put, this book could be considered as merely a love story. Yet, it was more than that. It was a tale of lost dreams in others--while of redemption and fulfillment in one--Janie. It was a rebellion against conventions, however well-meaning and outwardly innocuous--yet, inherently dangerous and imprisoning. Also it was an assertion of the self amidst the scornful looks of compliance:<BR>  \\""Ah reckon Ah looks mah age too. But Ah'm uh <BR> woman every inch of me, and Ah know it. Dat's <BR> uh whole lot more'n you kin say.\\""<BR>Furthermore, Hurston's master crafting of the language and structures accentuated these dreams, and this fulfillment. For the language was sensuous in many ways--fluid-like in its flow, yet, cogent in its expression of feelings.<BR> Their Eyes Were Watching God stood long among the ranks of the revered in American literature.

Set in the post-civil war south, the fiction novel takes place in an all African American community - a town called Eatonville.   The novel explores the life of protagonist Janie Crawford, a black woman who has grown through her experiences with three husbands.  <BR> Well known black authors, such as Richard Wright, criticized this book when it first came out for not portraying black people well.  Wright was outraged by the dialect Hurston used.  He said Hurston wrote it to give the white majority what they wanted to hear.  However, I think the dialect and dialogue helps any reader feel a stronger connection to the scene.  It wouldn't be realistic if she wrote it in proper English.  <BR> Hurston also focuses the novel on black people in a black world-not black people in a white world.  This is unique to most novels of this genre.  The majority show much oppression from the whites, and the blacks' struggle to deal with that oppression.  Hurston, on the other hand, portrays black people in a more ideal, yet nonetheless realistic manner, through their interactions with a homogeneous community of African Americans.<BR> Hurston does not just focus on the trials and experiences of humankind, but that of females especially.  She puts an emphasis on feminism.  We see Janie's struggle to think for her self and speak out.  All three of her husbands demean her in one way or another.  She gives a very realistic portrayal of human emotions as a result of specific events that have occurred.  Alix Wilber said, \\""In Their Eyes Were Watching God, Zora Neal Hurston breathes humanity into both her men and woman, and allows them to speak in their own voices.\\""<BR> Hurston brings the content of the novel to life through her use of words and imagery.  The way she uses metaphors captures images and feelings that normal words cannot execute.  She described Janie and said, \\""She stood there until something fell off the shelf inside her.  Then she went inside there to see what it was\\"" (p 72).  We can find language like this throughout the whole book, which makes it quite enjoyable to read.<BR> Hurston's use of character personalities and interaction stirs emotion and provokes thought.  I think she successfully portrays Janie's inner thoughts and feelings.  It helped me realize that emotion is universal.  I have friends that feel similarly to Janie about the way they view themselves.  Hurston also explores Janie's growth and self introspection.<BR> I recommend this book to anyone.  Hurston's use of dialect, language, and character development allow the reader to explore and learn.  It deals with such issues as: oppression (mostly against women), self-worth, happiness, and true love.  We can all learn something from Hurston's thoughtful novel.",2003-03-20

The story takes place in the state of Florida apparently after World War II.  Janie grew up with her grandmother, who gave up everything to raise her and her mother.  Janie's grandmother lived a hard life, which is the reason why she wanted Janie to marry a wealthy person.  Janie had her own ideas about love, but she was not strong enough to stand up and defend them.<br /> Life with Logan her first husband was not good because she married him thanks to her grandmother, who forced her to do so.   She did not love him and besides that, Logan did not treat her good.  She prayed for the end of this relationship.  Latter she met Joe, and she thought that he was the man of her dreams, and the type of romance that she was looking for.<BR> One day when Janie and Logan were arguing really bad, Logan threatened her with an ax and he told her that he will kill her.  She ran out of the house with Joe, and that afternoon before the sundown she married Joe. They moved to a town where there were a lot of black people.  Joe bought land and then he sold it to black people that were moving to the town, he set a store also.  After the years went by he became the major of the city.  For Janie life was not easy with Joe either. He treated her as an ornament.  He was so interested in becoming somebody important in the community that he did not pay attention to Janie, and eventually he became aggressive.  Before he died Janie told him that the problem in their marriage was that he did not listen to her.  When he died Janie acted like she was sad, but inside her heart she was happy.<BR>        One evening Janie met a guy named Tea Cake in the store, they played and flirted for a little bit, and that was the beginning of a new relationship.  Compared to the relationship between Janie and Joe, the relationship between Tea Cake and Janie progressed slowly and playfully.  The people in the town criticized her relationship because for them it was too soon for Janie to meet another person.   Phoeby, Janie's best friend shared all the secrets of the relationship, and sometimes Phoeby wondered how her friend Janie had such a big change because she did a lot of things with Tea Cake that she did not do before.  <BR> Tea Cake was a new world for Janie.  He took her to places that her Phoeby latter described as \\""places where she [Janie] had never been\\"".  At this point Janie was so tired of not living the life she wanted.  Janie often described her life as her \\""Grandma's way to live\\"".  She decided to sell the store and move out of town.<BR>  Janie and Tea Cake got together.  It is interesting to see that their relationship as a couple was not easy either, but this time things were different because Janie loved him.  They overcame a lot of bad situations such as when Tea Cake took all the money from Janie and spent it with his friends.  He latter on recovered the money by gambling, even though they had to move out of town because some people were mad against Tea Cake.  Latter Tea Cake had an affair with a woman named Nunkie.  Janie even forgave Tea Cake for beating her up because he wanted to show Mr. Turner's brother that he had control over Janie.  Then in the stormy night Tea Cake get rabies from a dog that bit him on the face.  This caused Tea Cake to become quite bit insane, that he even shot Janie with a pistol.  Janie shot him with a rifle and she killed Tea Cake.  She explained her cause to the court and she got free from all charges.  She prepared a nice funeral for Tea Cake and then she returned to her old town, and she shared her story with Phoeby.  The book ends describing how happy Janie felt at that time about how she had lived her life.",2003-03-20

In her novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, Hurston puts the South on canvas, capturing the flavor of her culture and the landscape of the time period.  Hurston employs dialect to recreate the atmosphere of Eatonville, Florida, the first all black municipality.  Although the phonetic spelling requires a little effort at the beginning, it adds distinct style to the novel and produces greater veritability in the characters.  In order to advance the plot, Hurston uses vivid prose, creating images and analogies that capture the imagination of the reader.  Hurston often switches between dialect and prose, using prose to move the story along and dialect to recreate specific events.  The combination of these two elements create a novel that captivates its audience and holds the reader's attention from the first line to the last page.  <BR> Her novel focuses on the life of Janie Crawford, a young woman searching to find herself.  The novel follows her through the course of three marriages and various cities.  Each husband reveals different traits about her and each environment provides Janie a chance to explore her potential and find herself.  Janie's grandmother arranges a mismatch of a marriage to Logan Killicks, a wealthy black farmer in her hometown.  Janie's sixteen years paled in comparison to his thirty-six years of experience and Janie's hope of blossoming love in marriage wilts within the first year.  He treats her as a mule, or property rather than a wife and person.  Seeds of discontent grow ripe and a young, rich man, Jody Starks, steps into Janie's life.  Her discontent drives her out of the house and into the arms of Jody Starks and they run away to Eatonville.  Jody quickly establishes himself as the mayor and sets Janie on a pedestal.  But Janie wants to step off the pedestal and into the society around her.  Her husband refuses to allow her to let down her hair and join with the townsfolk in daily life creating smouldering resentment for her husband and his `big man' image.  This resentment sparks an argument that drives a wedge in their marriage.  Their relationship deteriorates, as well as Jody's health, and eventually he dies.  Janie continues to run the store she owns, and meets Tea Cake, a man who opens Janie's soul and allows her to spread her wings.  Their romance quickly leads to marriage and more opportunities to grow as she moves away from Eatonville to live in the Everglades, harvesting beans.  Through this relationship, Janie discovers the joys of living.  She finally feels the freedom she has yearned for since her youth.  Her relationship with Tea Cakes ends in tragedy and forces Janie to return to Eatonville to start again, but this time with a greater knowledge of who she is and what life is about.<BR> This novel prompts the reader to search within and recognize the desires the lay suppressed beneath the surface.  Each reader should ponder the questions that confront Janie throughout the novel and come to find God, and find out about living.  I highly recommend this novel to all readers, for pure enjoyment as well as a thought-provoking piece of classic literature.",2003-03-20

It certainly is that, in fact it's one of the most natural, poetic, subtle and unapologetic celebrations of black culture I've ever read.  But it goes way beyond just being black writing.  Even more than being about blackness, it's about being a woman, and even more than that, it's about being a human being and the perpetual quest for self-realization in the midst of an imperfect world.  <br />This book was widely criticized when it was published for not directly taking on the issue of black-white relations.  But in a way, it is what makes this book more universally meaningful in the end than, for example, the writings of Richard Wright or Ralph Ellison.  The incredible rage and disillusionment present in some other black literature of the time is absent from this book and it gives the book a much more timeless feel.  <br />Her characters were also accused of being racial stereotypes, but in fact, because they are not stuck in the role of being pitted against their white counterparts, Hurston's characters are allowed a freer range of identity, action and emotion.  At liberty to be more than just \\""black people\\"" they are a full spectrum of human beings.<br />Beyond all the literary reasons to read this book, is the fact that it is a beautifully moving story of a woman searching to answer the calls of her soul for love, freedom, happiness and self-expression in the midst of the people around her who don't seem to value these things.  I recommend this book to any woman who has ever felt the tug of longing in a relationship, or wondered if the chance will ever come to express the fullness of your womanhood.  I resist calling this a feminist book.  I guess you could say it is, but I think it's more of a book written by a woman with a lot of wisdom about her own heart.  I would also recommend it to men, but I can't speak to what it might be liketo read it as a man.  I imagine men feel the same longing for fulfillment and self-expression and so it might be just the same.<br />I absolutely wept at the ending, because the ending is so beautiful, but also because the experience of this book as a whole is so rich and full and funny and generous and wise.

Like the proverbial lore of the Phoenix rising, it not only adds resilience to the authors legacy but proves without a doubt that good workseven neglected ones should be reexamined for overall viability and content analysis despite determined imperviousness to shame. The previous statement alludes itself to efforts by the establishment not understanding the style in which it was written, and the authors ways of languishing (albeit negatively) in the publics eye.

This is a book that, despite its lofty status as a classical force of a national epic, it offers a people his or her own spoken language freshly caught on paper and raised to the heights of poetry.<br />Their Eyeshas universal implications for women in that it protests against the restrictions and limitations imposed upon women by a masculine society. Zora illustrates and give credence to a heroine, Janie Crawford, who must make a major decision about the course of her life. This fluid love story full of thoughtful interpretative realism, pays tribute to a black woman, who, thought constricted by the signs of the times, still demanded to be heard. The characters resonate with colorful imagery: Janies three husbands, Mir. Killicks, Mayor Starks, her best friend Phoeby, Tea Cake, and the other images that she allows to come to life. The story is rather awkwardly told by both Janie, and an omniscient narrator, and is revealed, for the most part, in a flashback to Phoeby Watson. The key to the novel is Janies idea of marriage, which is pitted against other, less romantic ideas of a perfect union. Janie ends up on trial for the murder  in self-defense of the man she loved. The people who knew the couple side against her at the trial, hoping to see her hanged. It is the whites the judge and jury, and a group of women originally gathered just for curiositys sake  which see into the anguished depths of a black womans love and acknowledge her dignity and ultimate innocence. Janie feels no compulsion to justify herself to the town, but she gives more homage and insightful explanation to Phoeby.<br />This is a book that should be read by all, with its main thrust toward life and the fact of it being an affirmation rather than denial of why women possess much more strength than menat least in this adaptation. I like it because it speaks for the self, for equality, for the pursuit of happiness instead of possessions, and lastly, it speaks for and seems to recommend a way of life uncluttered by tradition, sterotypes, and materialism. Zora had the right idea and made statements. She left us with a good signature, reminding us that we may yet learn the possibilities of ourselves only If you kin see de light at daybreak, you dont keer if you die at dusk wit so many people never seein de light at all.

Everyone was quite amazed at the book in class and it seemed as if this was going to be a great read. So, on a lazy Sunday afternoon, with a fire ablaze in the fireplace, I relaxed on the couch and began to read Hurston's classic. It was not a delightful evening.<br />In the book the main character Janie goes through life wondering what true love actually is like. Her elder Grandmother arranges a marriage with the stinky and church going man Logan after an Janie has an innocent kiss with a young man. The marriage is not what Janie desires. She has no love for this man, and he really doesn't have any desire for her. It seems to be a set up marriage where one expects the other to function in a team. There is no love in this relationship. <br />Time passes on and Janie yearns even more to get out of this marriage. Then, out of the blue, a man by the name of Joe Sparks appears, or better known as Jody. Jody is a man with goals in life. He talks of great wealth and hoping to get involved in a town that consists of nothing but African-Americans. Janie is so amazed by this man's personal ambitions that she agrees to leave Logan and head out with Jody for a new start. <br />Joe is a man who cares for Janie, but it seems as if he doesn't really love her. All he believes is that personal wealth will bring a woman to him. This is not the case for Janie. Janie is a woman wantsto love and be loved. Joe is just a man who gages things in personal wealth and just wants Janie to look pretty like all the possessions he holds. This does not set well with Janie.<br />In time the relationship between Jody and Janie fades away like beams of sun when eclipsed by a cloud. As Jody becomes ill Janie tells him what she thinks about him as being just another possession of his. This enrages Jody and he passes on. It is the beginning of a liberation that took so long for Janie to have.<br />Janie is established financially and runs Jody's old store. When attending to her business on an idle afternoon, as everyone in town had gone to some game, an unknowing character comes around, good old Tea Cake. The man that Janie yearns for is Tea Cake. He shows Janie how to have a good time by playing checkers, going fishing, and socializing with others. This is the beginning of Janie becoming herself. Tea Cake loves her deeply and will do anything for her. Janie loves Tea Cake and will do anything as well. The love that she imagined underneath the pear tree in bloom is finally around.<br />All good stories have some sort of odd-ball situation that occurs that stirs up a conflict. Hurston decided to have a hurricane arrive that causes a great heroic rescue. In the storm a lake is about to flood the great muck plains that encompasses the two lovers. They decided to escape when the situation gets rough. In the desperate journey for dry land, Janie becomes in dire need to be rescued. She grabs hold of a cow, which for some reason has a rabid dog on it. The going gets tough as the dog is trying to attack Janie. Tea Cake sees the trouble and comes to the rescue killing the dog and being bitten in the process.<br />A month goes by and the two lovers are safe from the hurricane and living life to the fullest. Tea Cake is coming down with a sickness. A doctor diagnoses it as rabies, and Tea Cake loses his sanity. Eventually Tea Cake tries to kill Janie, is denied by her, and she shoots him. A trial occurs over the murder, she is found innocent and the story ends.<br />This novel is a read for the romance enthusiast. I can say that in no way I am one of those individuals. In class it seemed a good chunk of the class loved the book and the women just yearned for a Tea Cake of their own. Yes, he was the best husband and wanted to have Janie be herself. He loved her and she loved him. The thing though is that this novel's ending is one of the oddest things I've ever read. The circumstances where a cow has a dog on it! What are the odds of this?!!? Do hurricanes produce circumstances that cats ride dogs? Also, the trial scene came out of nowhere too. The novel could have ended with the death of Tea Cake, granted some editing would have to be done. I'm not one to say one way or the other, Hurston's story is hers, but I am not a fan of it.<br />To recommend anyone to read Their Eyes Were Watching God, I would ask just one question to someone who was wondering about the novel, \\""Do you like romance novels?\\"" If yes, then this is a must read. If not, I would recommend the drunken antics and lost generation attitude of Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. Hurston shows that true love will triumph over death, but the way she portrays it is not entirely well rounded.",2002-12-10

Specifically, it is concerned with her arrival at a certain state of self-awareness and self-reliance as a result of her relationships with her three husbands.  <br />The protagonist, Janie Crawford, was raised by her grandmother, whose memories of slavery and poverty inspire her principal desire for her granddaughter to marry well and become a respectable lady.  She compels Janie to marry a dull and much older man named Logan Killicks.  Salvation is close at hand, however; one day Janie meets an attractive young man named Jody Starks and soon runs away with him to get married, despite not having divorced Killicks.  <br />Jody is ambitious and motivated; he wants to be a \\""big voice.\\""  He takes Janie to a new, ungoverned \\""black\\"" town called Eatonville, quickly takes charge of building and improving it, and becomes the mayor almost by default.  He runs the store and post office and forces Janie to work for him, constantly treating her with condescension, humiliation, and possessiveness, for which she occasionally retaliates in kind.  He assumes that her status as the mayor's wife is sufficient to keep her happy, when what she really wants is her own voice and not to have to live in his shadow all the time.  When he eventually dies of kidney failure, she rejoices in her emancipation rather than mourns.<br />Soon Janie meets Tea Cake, who is quite a bit younger than her and more easygoing, fun-loving, and reckless than Jody.  They get married and move to a farming village down in the Everglades, where Janie gets the opportunity to socialize more openly with the common folks than she did when she was Mrs. Starks.  Janie and Tea Cake's marriage ends in a very ironic way that I will not reveal, but it is this climactic event which transforms Janie into the woman we presume she will be for the rest of her life.   <br />Race relations between whites and blacks are not a major focus of this novel.  There is acknowledgement of the effects of segregation in the complexion-obsessed Mrs. Turner, who thinks the black race should be \\""lightened\\"" so as to be more acceptable to white people; and after the harrowing hurricane scene, it is revealed that white corpses take precedence over black corpses in the receipt of coffins.  For the most part, however, the novel is concerned with the everyday relationships among its black characters and the slang and pronunciational nuances that characterize their interaction.<br />At the time of its publication, this novel was criticized by some black writers for not being sufficiently angry or socially or politically active, but it doesn't need to be.  It is a bold, assertive novel about a woman who learns to affirm her sense of self-worth, and that is as sufficient a statement as can be expected of literature.",2002-03-01

It is one of the only books I've read that I have truly and completely enjoyed.  Your interest will be maintained throughout the entire book in this compelling story about the main character, Janie.<br />Janie's story takes place in the South just after the turn of the 20th century, and Hurston gives powerful descriptions of the race and gender relations of that era.  Janie is racially mixed, and the book explores how she is consequently barred from the white world but excluded in many ways from the black world.<br />At the beginning of her story, Janie remarks, &quot;Ah know exactly what Ah got to tell yuh, but it's hard to know where to start at.&quot;  Hurston's charming use of dialect serves to enrich the reader's understanding of the character's culture and adds to the novel's atmosphere.<br />Hurston paints us a world rich with imagery and symbolism of nature, love, and life.  You will not be able to resist Hurston's exquisite accounts of the world, as when she writes, &quot;Oh to be a pear tree -_any_ tree in bloom! With kissing bees singing of the beginning of the world! [Janie] was sixteen.  She had glossy leaves and bursting buds and she wanted to struggle with life but it seemed to elude her.&quot;<br />The most compelling aspect of the novel is the personal journey that Janie goes through.  The reader will follow Janie as she embarks on her search for love, with all its disappointments and fulfillments.  Janie's experiences teach her about herself and what she wants in life.  Through this self-realization, she secures her identity and reaches empowerment.  This book will make you cry, it will make you laugh, it will enrage you, but most importantly it will make you _think_.",2002-01-23

After reading it though, the meaning started to become clear. Hurston's characters in this book are portrayed as people, rather than just black people. Hurston shows their disagreements, loves, and wishes as belonging to real people, that exist in their own right, rather than as an oppressed underclass, or a contrast to the white world. Racial struggle is, in fact, rarely mentioned in the book. After I read this, I started on Native Son, and in the first five pages I saw more references to oppression and inequality and so forth than in Huston's entire book. With some minor story changes, and a change of the dialect, the story could be about any group of people, as the plot does not depend on everyone's emotions being entirely fixed on the one idea of a racially unjust society.<BR>Hurston's other achievement here, I think, in addition to the universal feling of the story, the contrast of two rich voices. The blend of the \\""pure\\"" English of the narration and the black dialect voice of the characters comes out stronger than if either had been used exclusively.<BR>I was supposed to read this book for English class last year, but didn't get very far into it.

This novel is truly one of those great works that remains both entertaining and deeply moving; it is a book for classrooms, for reading groups of all types, and for individual readers.<br />In &quot;There Eyes,&quot; Hurston tells the life story of Janie, an African-American woman. We accompany Janie as she experiences the very different men in her life. Hurston's great dialogue captures both the ongoing &quot;war of the sexes,&quot; as well as the truces, joys, and tender moments of male-female relations. But equally important are Janie's relationships with other Black women. There are powerful themes of female bonding, identity, and empowerment which bring an added dimension to this book.<br />But what really elevates &quot;Their Eyes&quot; to the level of a great classic is Hurston's use of language. This is truly one of the most poetic novels in the American canon. Hurston blends the engaging vernacular speech of her African-American characters with the lovely &quot;standard&quot; English of her narrator, and in both modes creates lines that are just beautiful.<br />&quot;Their Eyes&quot; captures the universal experiences of pain and happiness, love and loss.

The Southern dialect makes the novel a bit hard to read at first, but soon you'll pick up on it and won't even notice (as always when dialect is used extensively in a book.) The novel is an interesting, and slightly atypical portrayal of black community as seen at the time of the Harlem Rennaisance. The reader becomes sympathetic with the main character, Janie, during the course of the book, as she is a realistic and lovable character despite, or maybe because of, her sometimes irrational decisions. One feels for her as she struggles for acceptance and independence and falls prey naively to men that are less than she seemingly deserves. The dialogue was entertaining, and some of the language was lyrical and uplifting and, occasionally, profound, and, oftentimes funny. So why less than 4 stars? The ending of the book is unsatisfying. After such a journey, one would expect a somewhat clearer resolution. I don't really see the point or theme of the book, what Hurston was really trying to get across. The body of the book could be looked at as a discourse on the true meaning of love. Janie encounters false love at several points, and then finds true love in an unlikely source, eventually. But this doesn't seem to be the book's main message (if it has one.) Maybe it can be looked at as the epitomal tale of a character of this type, say the Catcher In The Rye for young black women (I realize, of course, that this novel predates Catcher, but you will appreciate my example.) Or perhaps it was just meant to be a realistic, if somewhat romanticized, portrayal of a young black woman growing up in the early part of the century. On this level, it succeeds. On a deeper level, perhaps it doesn't. In any case, this IS an enjoyable book, and I can see the cause for the recent upsurge in the scholarship surrounding it and it's being taught in public schools.

I'm Searching For A Real Love Someone To Set My Heart Free Real Love.................... I'aanayammm Searching For A Real Love&quot;<br />                       By Mary J. Blige<br />     If Zora Neale Hurston were alive, I believe she would have  really liked that song, seeing as how it's sort of a theme for &quot;Their  Eyes Were Watching GOD&quot; and Janie herself.  The specific  verse &quot;Someone to Set My Heart Free&quot; is not only saying what all  women want but what all women need.      Janie was me; Janie was you; just wanting someone to make her  feel alive; a life she was excited to live.  I can't imagine what it  must have been like growing up back then  with all the rules and  judgements her grandmother put on her.  She probably couldn't wait to  get out of that house, which explains her nonchalant marriage to  Logan Killicks.      A good, hardworking man he was, but an exciting vibrant lover,  in every sense of the word, he definitelty wasn't.  We all want a man  to take of us, but not just financially, but emotionally, physically,  and spiritually too. Some people who feel confined in relationships  live through them,  but there are a choice few who decide to break  away.        Take, for instance, Rose from the movie, &quot;Titanic&quot;.  She was  engaged to marry Cal and knew she was headed for a life of boredom,  so she made the dangerous, life-altering decision to run away with  Jack, and even though Jack died before her, just like Teacake died  before Janie, do you think either woman regretted her decision???        Living with Logan was getting more and more everyday like the  funk of old clothing that never gets washed.  So when Joe Starks came  strolling by with his fresh suit and clean cut appearance, he was  like a breath of fresh air.  Janie didn't stop to think about the  consequences; she just left.      A lot of lessons were learned through this relationship on <br />Janie'spart. Money isn't everything was one of them. I asked myself  why didn't she leave Joe like she left Logan??? She obviously wasn't  happy.  I believe Ms. Hurston had a lot of love and respect for  Teacake and wanted her audience to have those same feelings.  I like  to think there was one main reason she didn't bring Teacake into the  story until after Joe's death. If Teacake had come into the picture  while Joe was still alive, the readers would be critical of Janie.   She already ran off from one husband.  Doing it again would have  questioned her value as a character to be taken seriously.      &quot;What now&quot;, she must have thought after Joe's death, She had  lost most of her youth with this man and still didn't feel complete.   Then he showed up.  He was a man that didn't have a lot of money, but  knew how to take care of his woman with the little he had. He was a  man that didn't have a consistent means of transportation, but he  showed his woman the world in his own way.  He wasn't a man that had  an extensive education, but his unique brand of speech and persuasion  could convince anyone that he was a force to be reckoned with.   Teacake had the confidence of DMX, the devotion of Forrest Gump, and  the unconditional love of Jack Dawson.  Who couldn't love a man like  that??? Definitely not Janie, furthermore me, myself.      Richard Wright, renowned author of the African American classics  Black Boy and Native Son stated that &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching GOD&quot;  was a work with &quot; no theme, no message, no thought&quot;.  I like to think  Ms. Hurston was just an author ahead of her time.  The themes,  messages, and thoughts presented in this book were surpressed in her  day, but are now welcomed in ours. People were so busy being  oppressed back then, they didn't focus on how happy a Teacake could  have made them.  But now all of us are looking for a Teacake, and  there aren't enough of them to go around.<br />GOD BLESS,<br />Tamara",2001-07-09

The novel showed the opression from racism, and also the hardships from sexism at the same time.  Janie, an African American woman post Civil War, spent the first thirty years of her life within the boundaries her society had set for her.  She was made to live below whites and men.  She submitted to live a sheltered, confined existance, which brought her no happiness until love set her free.  Tea Cake, a man many years younger than Janie, saw beyond what she was supposed to be.  He saw into her soul and not only allowed her to live, but loved her for it.  Tea Cake and Janie had a rare and pure love that people live their entire lives to find.  They rebuked what was expected from them and followed their hearts.  The couple made the best with what they had, and what they lacked they made up for with love.  Their Eyes Were Watching God is a novel that people of all ages and races can relate to.  The humanity portrayed in this book is so simple that it is touching, showing Hurston's genius insight.

Through this and other aspects, Hurston provides an inspirational novel for all to enjoy.<br />The way a group conveys their ideas affects how others listen and the validity of their comments.  Perhaps Hurston's decision to express her characters in Southern black dialogue came from this notion.  With the exception of Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, most blacks in books expressed themselves much like a white person, even though the way they talked clearly differentiated them from the whites.  From the old gossips on the porch to Janie herself, emotion seeps from their words, as if the hardships they have endured have harbored their effects on their language.  Although the dialect may make the characters sound uneducated at times, Hurston succeeds at allowing deep thoughts and universal truths to come out of Janie, Tea Cake, Logan, and Jody.  For instance, Janie voices her opinion on love and age differences when she says, &quot;Ah'm older than Tea Cake, yes.  But he done showed me where it's de thought dat makes de difference in ages&quot;(115).  This is an idea that many people are for and against, and Hurston is ahead of her time by addressing it through Janie.  Tea Cake's intelligence shines through his cumbersome words as well.  Younger and not near as well off as Janie, he has had to learn life's lessons the hard way.  When Janie questions whether he really wants her to go to the Sunday School Picnic with him, he replies in his joking but sincere way, &quot;Me scramble 'round tuh git de money tuh take yuh--been workin' lak uh dawg for two whole weeks--and she come astin' me if Ah want her tuh go!&quot;(109).  His refutation in regional Floridian talk reflects how hard he has had to work his whole life and how much Janie means to him. If all the men in Janie's past had treated her as Tea Cake does, her happines would have been fulfilled many years before.<br />Though character dialogue can be hard to comprehend in Their Eyes..., the final feeling one feels after reading it is one of pride for the black race, while at the same time getting a taste of what it would be like to be black.  Hurston deals with the hardships of African Americans superbly through her acute ability to write the way blacks talk in this classic novel.",2001-05-02

At age 16, Janie Crawford believes that she has every right to find true love on her terms. The day she lay beneath a pear tree in her grandmother's backyard and witnessed a bee pollinating there was the day she realized the sensual pleasures she wanted very much to experience in her life. But instead of her being able to explore these feelings and find her soul mate, she is confined to a couple of loveless marriages. The first was to a much older man, Logan Killicks, out of financial security and respectability (under the advisement of her randmother). The second marriage to Jody Starks was out of desperation to escape her first marriage and for security. But it will be Janie's third marriage to a much younger man, Tea Cake, which allows her to feel a sense of freedom in choosing  someone to love openly for the very first time. Of course when the Eatonville community she lives in shows their displeasure over her relationship with Tea Cake, Janie throws caution to the wind by marrying and moving away with him to start a new life in the Everglades. Even though her third marriage ends tragically  with her killing Tea Cake in self-defense, she doesn't seem to regret her experience. In fact, she makes peace with all that has happened in her life and returns to Eatonville in spite of the envious stares and gossip from the people speculating what happened between her and Tea Cake. She comes back no longer under the ownership of a man, but as a self-assured independent woman who owes no one any explanations.<br />After reading this novel and discovering that Zora Neale Hurston was the recipient of 2 Guggenheims, the author of 4 novels, 12 short stories, 12 essays, 2 musicals, and 2 black mythologies, I could not help wondering how this literary giant disappeared from us for nearly 3 decades.

Janie Crawford-Killicks-Logan-Woods is almost impossibly dull and unrealistic in her role as the lead heroine. Being a young (but progressively older) black woman in the rural turn-of-the-century South she seems to have the mobility of a Harrier jet. She marries with little or no consideration, walks out on marriages, and seems unimpeded by either long-distance train fare, Jack Crow laws, or, for that matter, the conventions of standard English.<br />Janie's quest is one for identity, although, being as witless as she is, she constantly gets caught up in deceptive romances that quickly turn into abusive relationships. This tale would be tragic were the heroine anyone but Janie. As it is, it leaves the reader hoping.<br />The writing? In a word: florid. Hurston's prose is purple to the point of being ultraviolet.

Even at its thankfully brief length, it is preferable as a mediocre doorstop to an intolerably pointless novel. <br /><br />Despite a modicum of skill at depicting life in small towns, Nora Zeale Hurston is ultimately unsuccessful in her attempt to write an enjoyable book.  There are characters, though not likable ones; a romance, though highly unconvincing; a plot-- sort of; social commentary, though heavy handed and unsubtle.  In short, Eyes has the elements of a novel that could and has worked with better writing (see A Room With a View).  Unfortunate, then, that no such prowess is displayed. <br /> Perhaps the most flawed aspect of Eyes is that it is not written in English.  I refuse to concede that the overdone vernacular dialogue contained within is English, particularly as it is fraught with inconsistencies:  &quot;lak&quot; and &quot;like&quot; are used interchangeably, as are &quot;yo'&quot; and &quot;you&quot; and &quot;mouth&quot; and &quot;mouf,&quot; adding to the confusion of any reader unfortunate enough to be slogging through the conversations.  Nor is the prose any better (though it CAN be positively identified as English); it waxes melodramatic and insipid.  &quot;A sobbing sigh burst out of Janie&quot;?! Dear me. The story-within-a-story format doesn't work either, particularly when dialogues Janie has no way of knowing and previous conversations with the friend to whom she is narrating her life story show up.  Surely both Pheoby and Jane can still remember what they said to each other without Janie's having to repeat the entire conversation?  The logic escapes me.<br /> Regrettably, the characters are equally baffling.  Janie alternates between being incredibly rash (in my opinion, anyone marrying someone of about a fortnight's acquaintancedeserves what she gets) and projecting a paragon of wise, black womanliness.  This perfect specimen retains faith and optimism through the harshest trials to such a degree that it's nauseating.  And did I mention that the magnanimous and courageous Janie is also a beautiful woman, excellent cook, and fast learner?  Tea Cake is less perfect, though he does still repeatedly reassure Janie of her beauty and worth and even helps her cook dinner without being prompted.  (This is realistic fiction, not fantasy, right?) Subsequently, their 'romance' is as flat as the characters themselves and inspires no interest. <br /> Barring characters and writing, Eyes still has a chance for redemption through masterful social commentary...which it does not possess.  True, there IS social commentary.  Every now and then, there is a brief but transparent rant on the lack of power of black women, or white injustice to blacks or the black inferiority complex.  After awhile, these lose their power to amuse with their unsubtlety and become merely tiresome.  They are too obvious to have much impact. <br /> Dreadful as the language may be, it at least provides the perfect word to describe the entire book:  monstropolous.  (My inability to find it in a dictionary strengthens my suspicions that Eyes is written in a language loosely based on, but inferior in structure and consistency to, English.)

But she had the great misfortune to fall afoul of her fellow black  intellectuals, like Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison, who took offense at her use of vernacular  language in her stories and who thought that her writing was not sufficiently negative about the black  experience in America.  Her opponents were better connected politically and saw to it that she was  dismissed by the Left intelligentsia.  She died in obscurity in a Welfare home and her works went out  of print, largely forgotten.  Then, in 1975, Alice Walker wrote a piece for Ms Magazine, about her  search for Hurston's grave and began a reawakening of interest in her work.  Walker's attentions seem  to have been amply repaid, as this fine novel seems to have been a significant influence on her own  book The Color Purple.<br />Their Eyes Were Watching God tells the story of Janie Crawford.  Raised in Florida by a  grandmother, she experiences several loveless marriages, but develops into a strong and independent  woman, then finds love with an itinerant worker named Tea Cake...Besides the central theme of Janie's growth as a woman, the story is similar to The Color Purple for  the almost eerie absence of white people.

The only  downside in this book is that the dialogue in the beginning is very  confusing, and I almost refused to go on with the book unless I knew what  it meant.  However, you do learn what it means later on in the book.   Sometimes, because of the type of accent and speech, you have to actually  analyze what each word means in a sentence to 'decode' or understand what a  character is saying.  Despite this confusingness among some readers, this  book is an outstanding work of literature.",2000-08-22

The story begins with Janie telling about her life, but then the author takes over the book. In the  beginning, Janie returns to see some people she used to know sitting on  their porch. After they dine with food she brings, Janie begins to tell her  story, with Hurston soon taking over the point of view.<br />We first hear  about Janie's grandmother wanting her to marry Logan Killicks, an older  man. She protests her decision, but her grandmother wants her to have  someone who can offer Janie the security and protection of his older age  and a large potato farm. The marriage occurs in the next chapter, but soon  after Janie leaves her new husband to be with another man - Joe  Starks.<br />Joe and Janie go off to another place in Florida. Joe becomes  mayor of a new town, named Eatonville, of all black people. Joe also builds  a store in this town. At first, Janie is enjoying this relationship. But  after the town starts developing, Janie doesn't enjoy life with Joe as  much. This is partly because Joe is becoming the man of the town and Janie  feels left out. She is asked by Joe to run the store, as Joe is busy doing  town duties as the mayor, such as getting a new street light  installed.<br />Later, many other events happen in the story, but if I told  you anymore I'd spoil the book.<br />The author, Zora Neale Hurston, uses the  dialog of Negroes in the story. Phrases such as \\""Aw, Tea Cake, you just say  dat tuhnight because de fish and corn bread tasted sort of good\\"" let you  imagine the dialect used by southern black people. The characters created  by the author really do let us know that they were blacks. We know this  because of the way they talk, and because of the life that they are living  as explained to us by Hurston. <br />One theme of this novel relates to man  versus society. In this case, man is Janie and society is the men of thesouth. Janie finally realizes all the hardships she has been through and  how her life has changed.

The story opens with the return of Janie to the mud and shack village that she  left with her first husband. Now, after experiencing Florida as a poverty  stricken, dependent wife, Janie recounts to her village friend Pheoby, all  the extremes of life that she has  journeyed since her departure some years   before.  Told in black dialect, this epic self- discovery and testament to  fortitude, spirit, and human  dignity steals the heart of the reader who is  willing to listen to and experience with Janie all the travails that are  heaped upon her in 1930's Florida. Janie's growth becomes the reader's own  discovery of life for a poor black woman with intelligence, need for love,  and pure determination to survive in the face of enormous obstacles of  human and mother nature.  The characters that populate Janie's sojourn are  powerfully described by the author. There are all of her husbands, her  friends, animals, the Florida terrain and weather, and others.  However,  the most mesmerizing character in this eloquent novel is Zora Neale  Hurston's lyrical and hypnotic use of language.

The rich, &quot;brown&quot; tones are like an unknown music that  resonates  forever in your soul when you leave this incredible volume. It  has a cadence, a poetry like no other.

Although earlier works had examined the particular plight of  black females, most notably Harriet Jacobs in her celebrated slave  narrative, fiction had shied away from presenting convincing,  three-dimensional portraits of black women. There are numerous reasons for  this, mostly rooted in sexist and racist attitudes, but Hurston broke  through the nonsense with this novel, an in-depth study of an amazing  fictional woman named Janie Starks.<br />Janie is amazing because of her  strength and determination. She is not afraid to speak her mind, demand  justice, or please her own desires. Her first marriage, to a unlikeable man  named Logan, ends when she decides he's not good enough for her, and takes  off with a smooth-talking ambitious man named Jody. Jody becomes mayor of a  growing black town, but Janie soon becomes tired of Jody's selfish behavior  and his rather rude treatment of her. But Janie never whines, or bemoans  her lot. She acts to change the situation, and in her strength we glimpse  not only hope, but the struggles for equality, both in terms of race and  gender. If Hurston took flak for not painting a bad enough portrait of  white racism, one doesn't need to read too carefully between the lines to  find scathing criticism in this book.<br />And yet, there is one feature in  this book which softens Hurston's accomplishments, and that is her decision  to render all dialogue and conversation between African Americans in a  thick dialect. One may give various reasons in support of doing so, and of  course there is no right or wrong about the issue, but at times her use of  dialect reduces powerful individuals to one-dimensional cariacatures.  Although her use of dialect was meant affectionately and to suggest  authenticity (Hurston studied anthropology for many years before turning to  fiction),it too often reeks of the minstrel tradition and Br'er Rabbit  stories, and serves to distance not only the reader from the characters,  but the omniscient narrator as well, who speaks in perfect, flowing,  beautiful prose.

Scott Fitzgerald and Edith Wharton, tore apart the classical love story, dependant as it was on outer union, on a coupling of circumstance and fate. Age of Innocence is a biting parody,  exposing the superficiality of, for example, Jane Austen's society romances  (despite their unsurpassed wit). Gatsby buys into classical script, but the  carefully constructed narrative of Romantic love he tries to realize is  shattered by the realities of a modern age.  He is left, staring at an  empty window because he cannot believe that Daisy is not behind it gazing  at him, but downstairs coming to terms with her husband. Their Eyes Were  Watching God, however, fills the void left by others' criticism. At first,  romantic love sweeps Hurston's heroine too off her feet: &quot;From now on  until death she was going to have flower dust and springtime sprinkled over  everything. A bee for her bloom.&quot; But this is unsatisfying, and  eventually the book reveals a love story for the modern age, which finds as  its essence not external union, but inner, personal fulfillment and genuine  partnership. This is not to say Hurston's vision is more 'realistic,' or  less rare, but that, as an ideal, it is far more relevant than its  predecessors. Hurston's lovers find in each other not alabaster idols, but  a mutual epiphany. &quot;They seemed to be staring at the dark, but their  eyes were watching God.&quot;",1999-12-03

I think there are fair criticisms of this book (some of which are brought up further on in the reviews), but I feel the last two reviewers did not put in the required effort to understand the book.  The dialect, although it takes a few pages to get used to, really helps to bring the scenes to life, to put you into that setting.   While much of the subject matter could make a white person uncomfortable, this is a tale of one person's experiences and thoughts, and while it happens to be fiction, it is based on the reality at the time (and many would argue, to some extent the reality today).  As a white reader I also think I had to understand the benefits I recieve living in our society, just because of the color of my skin, otherwise it would have been easy to get defensive and look down on the characters in the book. Effort IS required by the reader, as in any book worth reading, but if you put in that effort you will be hard pressed to find a finer, more moving story, and you may find yourself changed for the better in the process.",1998-04-10

In haste she marries Janie off to a much older man who ends up being emotionally abusive. Janie escapes from this unhappy marriage when she runs away with a rich and ambitious man. Although initially blinded by his sophisticated ways Janie begins to feel undermined. It is only after the end of this second marriage does she find true love and her true voice in a relationship with a young man.<br /><br />Hurston's writing can be wonderfully poetic and touching and through it she poignantly describes universal emotions. Much of the book is written in the idiomatic African American way of speaking which can be difficult to understand for those not familiar with it.<br /><br />Despite some brief displays of brilliant writing the book doesn't have a clear purpose. The reader can't tell if Hurston intended for it to be a powerful feminist piece of work or a soppy love story. Maybe it was meant to be both and that is troubling because it means the female protagonist could only find herself and liberate what had been suppressed through romantic love instead of through self-love and acceptance.",2015-07-01
