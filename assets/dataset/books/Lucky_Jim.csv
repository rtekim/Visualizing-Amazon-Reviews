US,36348634,RWNHBRUBX7A8K,0142180149,283114178,Lucky Jim,Books,5,2,2,N,N,"One of the best English comic novels of the 20th century","The 1950s saw the birth of a new genre in English literature, the campus novel. There had been earlier novels about university life, but these generally concentrated on the students more than the lecturers, and often, as in Evelyn Waugh's \\""Brideshead Revisited\\"", the hero's university career only formed part of the book, being dealt with as a part of his overall life story. C. P. Snow's \\""The Masters\\"" from 1951, set in a fictitious Cambridge college and dealing with the lives of the college's academic staff, is sometimes regarded as the first British \\""campus novel\\"" and \\""Lucky Jim\\"" from three years later as the second.<br /><br />Jim Dixon is a junior lecturer at an unnamed provincial university, possibly based upon the University of Leicester where Kingsley Amis's close friend Philip Larkin had once worked. (The hero's surname may have been suggested by the fact that Larkin's address in Leicester was in Dixon Drive). Amis took his title from an old song- \\""Oh, lucky Jim, How I envy him...\\""- but as the novel opens Jim does not seem to be particularly lucky or enviable. Indeed, his life can be summed up in the words of the theme-song from \\""Friends\\"":-<br /><br />\\""Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.\\""<br /><br />He hates his job, his subject (mediaeval history) and his boss, Professor Welch. He is perpetually short of cash and forced to live in a seedy lodging-house. His relationship with his girlfriend Margaret appears to be going nowhere and, while he has set his cap at an attractive blonde named Christine, that relationship also appears to be doomed as she is the girlfriend of Welch's artist son Bertrand.<br /><br />Jim is in many ways a flawed character. For one who hops to make a living by teaching history, he displays a surprising lack of enthusiasm for his subject. He drinks too much, often treats Margaret badly and can be rude and tactless. He devotes a lot of energy to pursuing feuds against those who annoy him and can be oddly childish, as when he scribbles on a magazine belonging to a colleague. And yet he is the novel's hero. Although this is a third-person narrative, everything is seen through Jim's eyes and Amis clearly intended us to sympathise with him. Remarkably, Amis largely succeeds in this aim.<br /><br />One could say that Jim is lucky in his enemies. If he is flawed, those surrounding him are often much more deeply so. Welch is absent-minded, evasive, pedantic and a pretentious culture-vulture who finds it difficult to get on with people. Margaret is neurotic, hysterical and manipulative. Evan Johns (he of the defaced magazine) is treacherous and back-stabbing. Worst of all is Bertrand, portrayed as dishonest, pompous, self-important, snobbish, a bully and a womaniser who cheats on Christine with a married woman. Bertrand's ideological attitudes are an odd combination, probably very rare in real life, of the values of the Bloomsbury Group with those of the Monday Club, but Amis was using him to satirise an omnium gatherum of opinions, including pacifism, artistic bohemianism and right-wing Toryism, which he regarded as objectionable or ridiculous. (At the time of writing \\""Lucky Jim\\"", Amis was still politically on the left, although in later years he would move to the right).<br /><br />Amis was often grouped with the likes of John Osborne, John Braine and Alan Sillitoe as an \\""Angry Young Man\\"", one of a group of young writers who emerged in the 1950s. Although the \\""Angries\\"" never identified themselves as a movement, and certainly never had anything like a formal membership or a manifesto, they did share certain characteristics, notably a dissatisfaction with the existing social order, particularly the class structure of fifties Britain. Their heroes were often rebellious young working-class men, and this is true of \\""Lucky Jim\\"". Jim is from a working-class background in Northern England, something which sets him apart from the more bourgeois Welch family and may explain their mutual antipathy.<br /><br />Some one of the \\""Angry Young Men\\"" railed against virtually all aspects of their society, but from Amis's point of view the early fifties were not such a bad period in which to be alive- certainly not when compared to earlier periods in history. One of the targets of his satire is the tendency to retreat into nostalgia for some idealised past, something of which Professor Welch, with his romantic fantasies of some pre-modern pre-industrial England, is particularly guilty. He pushes Jim, much against his wishes, into giving a public lecture on the subject of \\""Merrie England\\"" and is not amused when Jim, under the influence of alcohol, uses the opportunity to subvert everything Welch believes in. Amis was himself a university lecturer (teaching English at the University of Swansea) and another of his target is the academic life itself. To an outsider, universities and colleges may seem like tranquil seats of learning, but Amis, shows them to be as riven with feuds and jealousies as any other institution and suffused with a hypocrisy and pretentiousness which Jim instinctively finds unacceptable. (These themes were to be taken up by later campus novelists, such as Malcolm Bradbury in \\""The History Man\\"").<br /><br />Some of the criticisms of the novel expressed on these pages seem rather wide of the mark, such as the allegation that it is too socially narrow in its scope. It was never Amis's intention to imitate the likes of Dickens or George Eliot by writing a sweeping \\""condition of England\\"" novel taking in all social classes. One might expect the characters in a novel set on a university campus to be drawn from a fairly narrow social range, although as I point out above the politics of social class do play a part in \\""Lucky Jim\\"".<br /><br />Amis has also been criticised for a \\""lack of ambition\\"", for failing to tackle all the great questions of the Meaning of Life. This criticism ignores the fact that one can illuminate the human condition just as effectively though the medium of a comic novel set in an English provincial university as through a grand panoramic novel about life, the Universe and everything. And \\""Lucky Jim\\"" is a brilliantly comic novel with some wonderfully humorous passages. I particularly enjoyed Amis's satirical barbs aimed at some of his characters, especially the insufferable Bertrand, and the accounts of Jim's drunken lecture and of Professor Welch disastrous musical weekend, in the course of which Jim manages to set fire to his bed. It well deserves the reputation it has won as one the best English comic novels of the 20th century. Although it was Amis's first novel, and although he was to write many others over the next forty years, it probably remains his best-known work.",2012-10-05

This is the novel that established Kingsley Amis' reputation, and remains his most famous work. Regrettably, rather late in life, it is the first work of his that I have read. If you like your novels with heroic characters, whose actions should serve as a role model for you, or your children, well, this novel is not for you.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of Jim Dixon, a junior professor, in his first year at one of the newly opened provincial universities after World War II. He is the proverbial square peg being jammed into a round hole; he is neurotic, dysfunctional and alienated, as are most of the characters. Wartime austerity is slowly loosening its grip; he lives in a boarding house, and counts his cigarettes out, not for health reasons, but rather financial ones. Early on, we are introduced to one of the perennial curses of academic life: the \\""publish or perish\\"" mantra. Plagiarism is the essential aspect of the denouement to that theme. The exigencies of organizational life, the need to impress one's superiors, and appear to be a good \\""team player,\\"" best expressed by a couple earthy epithets that would never make it past the censor, permeate the tale. Philandering, mainly of the unrequited variety, is also a dominant theme. As in other \\""drawing room\\"" novels, the sexual and financial dynamics are omnipresent, and one \\""needs a scorecard to tell who the players are.\\""<br /><br />Amis has a fine ear for dialogue, and utilizes it brilliantly to draw and define his characters. The humor can be laugh out loud (LOL) hilarious. To mention one scene, Dixon is trying to obtain a straight answer for the History Chairmen, Welch, if he will be re-contracted for a second year. Welch bloviates, almost certainly unintentionally, about any subject but... the issue at hand. In another scene, one woman is nominally complimenting another, naturally a potential rival (aren't they all?) but Dixon knows what is coming, so he \\""...tensed himself for the inevitable qualification... `I don't like women of that age who try to act the gracious lady.

At the time I don't think I was all that impressed.    Much later I read one or two other Amis novels and quite enjoyed them and recently I have read about ten, finding them mostly absolutely hilarious, especially `Take a Girl Like You', `One Fat Englishman' and `Girl, 20'.    Lucky Jim is quite different from these middle period novels in that the main character suffers from severe anxiety nearly all the way through about his career and his love life. As David Nicholls says in the introduction to my copy, most of the passion in it is Dixon talking to himself about his hatred of certain other characters.    Later Amis novels also feature such hatred, but in these it is more likely to be expressed rather than an inner monologue, and in later books the protagonists are much more confident individuals, though their behaviour is not necessarily any more socially acceptable.    Nevertheless Lucky Jim is reminiscent to me of several other novels written in the fifties and sixties about young people and their uncertainties. I am thinking of `Billy Liar', `The L-Shaped Room' etc.    One reviewer refers to Dixon's extraordinary attitude to women.

David Lodge, who wrote the Preface for the Penguin edition now being sold by Amazon, is equally a great writer of academic farces (e.g., \\""Changing Places\\"", \\""Small World\\"").    However, Lodge's Preface is entirely out of place in this edition of Lucky Jim. Admittedly. it is an insightful, but nonetheless academic piece of writing, by a former professor of English literature. For another, I believe it has, in whole or part previously appeared elsewhere in a collection of Lodge's essays (of which no mention is made; if I happen to come across it, I'write another blurb about Penguin's deceit in the matter). Third, and most important, it gives away one of the key points upon which the plot hinges, one that in the book only comes to a head close to the end and suddently makes things fall into place. The editor who thought the book could be enhanced by joining Lodge's name with Amis', failed to realize the Preface sabotages the development of Amis' narrative.    It is further evidence for my suspicion that all decent editors were taken out some years ago and secretly shot. The alternate possibility is that Penguin wanted to add Lodge's name (now better know than Amis')on the cover as a cheap gimmick for advertising purposes.

Jim Dixon is a junior lecturer in medieval history at a \\""red brick\\"" university where he suffers very much from being under the thumb of the vague and ineffective Professor Welch and his monstrously pretentious and bullying family; he also feels weighed down by another lecturer, Margaret, whose attentions he has courted because she is sympathetic rather than because he is attracted to her. Jim's biggest problem, however, is most likely himself: lazy, misanthropic, and prone to drink and smoke far too much, he constantly gets himself into horrible situations where only his luck can pull him out.    Very, very funny, the book has some comic set-pieces that are unforgettable after the first time you read them (such as the famous hangover scene at Professor Welsh's house) or that never fail to pall (the early madrigals scene). The book has continued to receive attention largely for its portrait of the UK after the Second World War. Amis is very critical of the university educational system and its approach to passing almost every student regardless of their performances, and the attack on Professor Welch's ridiculously pompous family seems like a backlash against British high-brow culture; Jim's lecture on \\""Merrie England\\"" is clearly a direct critique of British notions of both its past and present during the mid 50s. With his raging temper and disgust at everything around him Jim is very much akin to the Angry Young Men in the plays and novels of Osborne, Sillitoe and Cooper, although the mood here is very comic rather than dark. Contemporary readers with any sort of feminist sensibility might be troubled by Jim's attitude towards women, which is also much in keeping to theAngry Young Man literature of the time. (Jim comes to see the friendly and helpful Margaret to be as much of a menace to him as the nasty Welches, mostly because of her emotional neediness and her lack of physical attractiveness.) The writing is terrific, and the set-pieces are very funny, but the book is even more important for what it reveals about a certain kind of mindset in England at mid-century.",2010-11-20

He despises his boss - an elderly, absent minded and rather self important gentleman called Professor Welch - and doesn't even like his subject, Medieval History. (He only ever studied it himself because he'd seen it as the easy option when he was a student). He's had a few unfortunate encounters with his fellow academics since he started - he'd barely arrived at the college when he accidentally caught the Prof of English with a stone on the knee, and then knocked over the Registrar's Chair at his first Faculty Meeting. (If only the Registrar himself hadn't been on the verge of sitting down...) There had also been the essay submitted by one of Dixon's pupils had submitted an essay heavily criticising a book written by one of Welch's ex-pupils. What made this difficult to sweep under the carpet was the level of Welch's involvement - the book was written at his suggestion and under his guidance - while the essay was based heavily on Dixon's lecture notes.    Jim, however, does have a few allies - including Alfred Beesley, (who works in the college's English Department), Bill Atkinson (someone always happy to provide Jim with a cover story) and Carol Goldsmith (the wife of a colleague at the history department). However, Jim spends most of his time with Margaret - another member of staff at the university. It's not that he particularly wants to - rather, he more or less feels morally obliged to. The problem is things have now got to the point where they're widely seen as a couple. Margaret is now \\""recovering well\\"" at Welch's house after a recent (apparent) suicide attempt. (Prior to Jim, she'd been spending some time with an utter cad called Catchpole...who, rather understandably, ran off with his new girlfriend to North Wales for a couple of weeks). Jim had been supposed to meet her for a pot of tea that evening , but had backed out to write the following day's lecture...it's something he feels rather guilty about that, bearing in mind what had happened. (This guilt is something Margaret shamelessly trades on throughout the book).      Since Margaret is staying at the Prof's house, Jim can't avoid visiting once in a while. One of the most significant - not to mention disastrous - visits is for a weekend long artistic gathering. Jim manages to set fire to his bedclothes, destroy his bedside table, and make an enemy of Bertrand - one of the professor's sons. Bertrand, a pretentious artist with an awful beard and a significant superiority complex, arrives from London for the proceedings with a very pretty guest called Christine Callaghan. Jim naturally is smitten - but is afraid to make any move...partly for fear of what it will do to Margaret, and partly because he knows stealing Betrand's girlfriend will lower his standing in the Professor's eyes even further. Still, at least he's interested in Christine herself...unlike Bertrand, who's only interested in her uncle - the noted art critic, Julius Gore-Urquhart.     An amusing and easily read book.

And so it is. But when one finishes and tries to analyze the source of the humor, one finds, somewhat surprisingly, that the hero Jim Dixon, drifts in and out of situations that construct backgrounds that are patently phony, mostly to the reader and only partly to Dixon himself. It is his reaction to all this encrusted phoniness that serves as the ideology that led to the existence of the Angry Young Men dogma that was then afflicting a post-war England. For Amis, humor was the means by which this frustration at not being able to do anything about it caused him and his readers to laugh at a society whose only saving grace was that what you saw was definitely not what you got.    Jim Dixon is a young college instructor, trying hard to fit in when he quickly realizes that he should not fit in but plows ahead anyway. Since he is non-tenured, his continuing employment depends on the good will of his department chair, Professor Welch, a man who argues that life ought to be unhampered by the restraints of a confining culture, but whose deeds shout out the contrary. Dixon is dating a younger colleague, Margaret Peel, a rather plain-jane type who inexplicably sees in Dixon the salvation to her own need to have free love without the responsibility to maintain it. At a party, he meets Welch's equally pontificating son, Bertrand and his date Christine, to whom Dixon is attracted. The humor of the novel resides in some slapstick scenes, a leading example of which occurs when Dixon falls asleep while smoking with predictable results--he very nearly burns down the guest room of the Welches in which he was staying.            Amis hints early on that his true reason to write LUCKY JIM was his dissatisfaction with the compacency that he saw as ossifying England. He deduced that far too much of England was an empty facade full of empty people performing empty functions. Jim Dixon himself lectures on topics of which he is ignorant but hopes that no one can see his lack. Professor Welch is much like himself, only on a higher level of incompetence. Both Dixon and Welch are involved in an equally spurious revival of folk art. When at the novel's end and Dixon is seen as \\""lucky\\"" in the sense that he has a new job and a new girlfriend, the reader is puzzled what Dixon has done to deserve his luck. And that is the point. He has done nothing to be lucky, but he has had the sense to avoid the excesses that afflict the Welches. Jim Dixon is simply not ossified enough to avoid his luck. For him, coming in third in a four man race is good enough to win the top prize. For Amis, that was not good enough. LUCKY JIM tells the world that.",2006-08-13

It's also his first novel, which makes him one of those writers who spent their entire career trying to live up to early success.  Despite Lucky Jim's preeminent reputation, several later novels are at least as good: I'd mention as my personal favorites The Anti-Death League, The Green Man, Ending Up, The Alteration, and The Old Devils. <br />I think this is my third reading of Lucky Jim.  It remains a very enjoyable book. It's the story of Jim Dixon, a history lecturer at a provincial English university shortly after the second world war.  Jim is involved in an unsatisfactory relationship with a drippy fellow lecturer called Margaret Peel, who uses emotional blackmail such as implicit suicide attempts (she took sleeping pills after breaking with her previous boyfriend) to keep him on the string.  He hates his job, and he hates his boss (Professor Welch) if anything even more, while worrying that he won't be retained for the next school year.  He hates phoniness in general, particularly that represented by Professor Welch, who is into recreations of old English music (recorders and all).<br />The plot revolves mainly around Dixon's growing attraction to Christine Callaghan, a beautiful girl who is nominally Professor Welch's son Bertrand's girlfriend -- but Bertrand is also fooling around with a married woman, and he's a crummy artist to boot.  Also, Dixon is working on a lecture about Merrie Olde Englande, which he hopes will impress Professor Welch enough that he can keep his job, but every sentence of which he hates. The resolution is predictable, if rather convenient for Dixon (involving a rich uncle of Christine's), but it satisfies.  The book itself is really very funny: such set-pieces as Dixon's hangover-ridden lecture, and his disastrous drunken night at the Welch's, remain screams after multiple rereadings.<br />I should say that some things bother me a bit. Some of Dixon's stunts (such as stealing a colleague's insurance policies and burning them) seem, well, felonious. And of course Margaret Peel really is someone he's better off breaking up with, but the way Christine is presented as naturally good because she is beautiful does seem rather sexist. Still, all this can be laid to accurate description of a certain character -- and if we root for Jim (as we more or less naturally do), it should be with some uneasiness.<br />All this said, Lucky Jim is deservedly a classic of 20th Century fiction, and an enormously entertaining book.",2003-03-07

For me, it succeeds best in its first role, but that may be because if has lost some of its bite in the intervening years since its first publication. Jim Dixon, the title character, is a new lecturer in history at a mid-sized college. He finds the work almost stultifyingly boring, but the real horror is trying to achieve tenure when faced with Welch as his immediate superior. And then there's Margaret, his girlfriend, although he can't quite remember how she came by that designation, who, although pleasing enough to look upon, seems destined to be always upset with him, which is dangerous, since she tried to commit suicide when her last beau left her suddenly.<br />Imagine Wodehouse writing a Wooster/Jeeves novel in which Jeeves becomes pure blind luck, Aunt Agatha is split into component irritations, and Bertie is a young teacher with a taste for drink and a bit of a chip on his shoulder. Then exchange the fantasy 1920s setting with a realistic early 60s one. The result is as fabulous, funny and appealing as a well-written Mad TV or Monty Python skit.<br />On the strength of this novel, Amis became a spokesman for a generation of \\""angry young men.\\"" I'm not qualified to comment further on that, which means I need to do some self-education on the British novel in the 1960s. Amis seems to have been the Vonnegut equivalent for Britain, that is, a novelist whose social commentary was stronger than the genre in which their books were based, which landed them with a mainstream audience. Just looking at some of his other titles reveals that Amis had an affinity for popular literature, even though his was never ghetto-ized. I'm hoping that some of his other books, like The Anti-Death League, will be as rewarding as this.have been the Vonnegut equivalent for Britain, that is, a novelist whose social commentary was stronger than the genre in which their books were based, which landed them with a mainstream audience.

Probably the most significant theory advanced by Lodge is that Amis wrote his book with one eye on Graham Greene's novel, \\""The Heart of the Matter.\\"" Lodge convincingly argues that \\""Lucky Jim\\"" is actually a comic inversion of Greene's story. Of course, if one has not read Greene's novel, this point may not register on the radar. But what is important is that Lodge proves to us that \\""Lucky Jim\\"" is much more than a collection of funny scenes. Most will read this book because they have heard that it is uproariously funny, which it certainly is, as the book does contain enough humor to cheer up the most heartless people among us. However, don't get hung up on the humor and forget to look deeper.<br />\\""Lucky Jim\\"" is set in the seemingly unfunny world of academia, specifically British academia. The hero of the story, James \\""Jim\\"" Dixon, is a young man on the make, fresh out of school and dutifully working at his first real job; a position in the history department at an obscure provincial university. Jim really hates his job. This hatred stems from the cast of assorted characters Jim must put up with on a daily basis. Jim's biggest problem is Professor Welch, the head of the history department. Welch is a forgetful fool who holds Jim's future job in the palm of his hand. Then there is Margaret, a neurotic fellow lecturer who latches on to Jim and won't let him go. Welch's son Bertrand, an arrogant \\""artist\\"" who torments Jim while flaunting his girlfriend Christine (who Jim quickly becomes enraptured with, creating a tension that leads to several hilarious confrontations between the Welch family and Jim) also makes an appearance. Rounding out the cast of quirky characters is an annoying student who knows more about medieval history than Jim.<br />Of course, Jim causes problems for himself with frightening regularity. He sets his bed on fire during a weekend retreat at the Welch's, delivers a lecture on \\""Merrie England\\"" after imbibing way too much alcohol, and makes phony phone calls to the Welch house in an attempt to discredit Bertrand. The humor is classic British wit: slow and masterfully written in the way only the British can achieve. Jim's description of a hangover will bring a knowing chuckle from anyone who has ever downed too many at the bar. These scenes are extremely funny and help to drive the book to its happy conclusion.<br />Amis spends an enormous amount of time poking fun at the British upper class. Welch and his family are endlessly skewered as Jim constantly shows them up. That Jim ultimately conquers his enemies must be Amis's way of showing the ultimate triumph of the \\""commoner\\"" over the entrenched British aristocracy. This tension reached an acme after World War II, when the British educational system expanded its programs to include the British lower classes (it is no mistake that Jim mentions his stint as a lowly soldier in the R.A.F. during the war, thus qualifying him as a sort of everyman hero).<br />What didn't work as well in \\""Lucky Jim\\"" is the interaction between Jim and Christine. These encounters tend to be wordy and too steeped in emotional minutiae. Even some of the dialogue between Jim and Margaret ends up becoming rather tedious compared to the rest of the book. This is probably due to the comedic scenes in the book; they are so funny that everything else pales by comparison. But the dialogues do serve an important purpose in the story: they reveal the concerns of people trying to make their way in a world that places them at the bottom of the ladder.<br />\\""Lucky Jim\\"" would make an excellent gift for anyone who needs a good cheering up.

His portrayals of certain characters -- namely, the selfish, incompetent Welch family -- are implausible to the point of distraction.  The character of Jim Dixon would be likeable enough, if not for the unfortunate fact that Amis develops his protagonist's personality through Jim's constant mockery of his professor's family.  At the book's end, the only really good thing we can say about the guy is (as 'Gore-Itchbag' puts it), &quot;It's not that you've got the qualifications .... You haven't got the disqualifications, though, and that's much rarer.&quot;  Jim is a bloke with a good head on his shoulders, but has no desire to do anything beyond drink a pint of bitter at the nearest pub and chat up the lovely Christine.  Not a bad guy, really -- just not interesting enough to balance out his nasty distaste for and sophomoric pranks aimed at the Welch family.<br />But that's not to say the book lacks any merit.  There are incidents as exciting and/or comic as in any other novel ruled by middle-class convention (one reviewer above noted the hangover scene in chapter 6; see also Jim's coup at the ball and his drunken debacle of a speech).  In terms of writing, you will not find prose more clear or brisk than Mr. Amis's -- and Jim's overwhelming feelings of ill-will are somewhat excused by the sheer originality, fluidity, and wit of his turns of phrase.  The simple punchline metaphors always stand out (&quot;like Genghis Khan meditating a purge of his captains&quot;; &quot;Welch's nose itself, a large, open-pored tetrahedron&quot;), but the best moments show off the author's flexibility with language, like the running gag of Jim's &quot;Welch tune&quot;: &quot;This tune featured in the rondo of some boring piano concerto Welch had once insisted on playing [Jim] on his complicated exponential-horned gramophone ...and Dixon had fitted words to it ... 'You ignorant clod, you stupid old sod, you havering get...' Here intervened a string of unmentionables, corresponding with an oom-pah sort of effect in the orchestra. 'You wordy old turdy old scum, you griping old piping old bum...'&quot; and so on.<br />In short -- if any character were half as rich and friendly as Amis's pen, this book would be engaging.

But whereas Wodehouse wrote about silly characters worming their way out of silly situations with silly dialogue and behavior, &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; presents a scenario in which humor is developed more subtly through natural irony, cynical sarcasm, and things that are implied rather than said.<br />The protagonist, Jim Dixon, is a lecturer in the history department of a not-so-highly acclaimed British university.  He is lazy, immature, and hates his job and his boss, Professor Welch, the head of the department.  Jim feels obligated to attend Welch's boring weekend parties, singing corny madrigals with insufferable members of the university faculty.

I became a big fan after reading &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; and  have since read and enjoyed many of his other books, but this remains far  and away the all-time favorite.

LUCKY JIM is light and humorous, but has profundity in it, too, and is a brilliant novel. The language is poetic and highly literary, but at the service of the story. A lot of &quot;literary&quot; writing buries the story, (Well, like in Martin Amis's stuff, for instance), but LUCKY JIM has wonderfully poetic sentences, that, even if you did not notice their poetry, serve a reader who would only need the sentences for their furthering of the narrative. There is not a single word wrong in this novel. It's perfect down to the last syllable. And I know I'll read it again sometime, and parts of it numerous times.
