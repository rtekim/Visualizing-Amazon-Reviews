I even referred back to the other glowing reviews, printed them out, and carried them around with the book, hoping their enthusiasm would infuse the pages and  make me want to read them.<br />Didn't happen.  I am overwhelmed by the  thought that if I turn the page, and all the characters suddenly die, I  simply would not care.  I've only gotten to page 300, though, so maybe the  magic begins later.  My only solace is that over half of the women in my  book club feel the same dull torment.<br />I'll try to tackle the book again  in six months.  If I change my mind, I'll post another review.",1999-03-03

Lessing does an amazing job of holding many strands together. Apparently she wrote it exactly as is published--page after page rather than completing the &quot;notebooks&quot; and short novel separately and spliting them into final form later. I must admit that one notebook did give me a bit of grief until I caught on to Lessing's plan, but it was well worth it--especially for the last 80 pages or so.<br />The author decries the labelling of her book as being about the &quot;sexual war&quot; between men and women. I agree. Far more is contained here. Lessing addresses everything: the political, the social, the personal, sanity, insanity, truth, the sexual, the notion of accepting any experience for the sake of just that--experience. And of trying to keep oneself &quot;whole&quot; when fragmenting is the only protection against the pain of living. But how can one justify avoiding the pain of life when she subscribes to &quot;experience of all&quot; as self-education? Maybe the answer is the meaning of life.",1998-06-15

One wonders how a dialogue between Doris and Henry Miller might have been (perhaps she had one?) or Lawrence Durrell. They too broke boundaries in style and expression in pursuit of the big existential questions around meaning, love, justice, equality, loneliness and sanity, but seen through a man's lens.<br />Doris was, as I understand it, disappointed that the book was seized upon and claimed as a feminist tract. Indeed. For it's subject matter is much bigger than that.",2014-04-25
