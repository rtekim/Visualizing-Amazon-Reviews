US,24301316,R28AXMQ25UH5UL,3943799492,383761219,"Loving",Books,4,0,0,N,N,"It doesn't really help that her best friend Zoe is in love with the school womanizer ...","In&#34; Loving&#34; by Katrin Bongard, book blogger Ella has to do a school project with the hottest boy in her year. It doesn't really help that her best friend Zoe is in love with the school womanizer Luca as well. At first, Ella absolutely hates the idea of having to spend time with him, but soon she realizes that he might not even be what he seems to at first glance at all.<br /><br />I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did. It's written in very simple language which makes it a very quick read as well. The school project that the protagonists Ella and Luca have to work on together is about Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.<br /><br />When you take a closer look at the novel it's pretty obvious that it's a retelling, only with reversed roles. Initially Ella absolutely despises everything about Luca and looks down on him because of all the terrible things she has heard about him. To her he's a player, doesn't care about his ex-girlfriends' feelings, and is also pretty stupid. But when they're forced to work together and therefore also spend a significant amoutn of time together for school, their opinions of each other slowly change.<br /><br />A Book Blogger Portrayed Accurately, Hallelujah!<br /><br />I love how smoothely and fittingly Bongard incorporated Ella's pastime blogging hobby. I've only ever read one novel starring a book blogger before and in that one, it didn't even play a role for the plot. It absolutely makes sense for Ella, the introverted book nerd, to do this and to prefer it to going to parties and going out in general.<br />It's so fun to find all the things that we are concerned with in the novel, even accompany her to a major book expo! She's a thoroughly well-developed and absolutely believable character and her being &#34;one of us&#34; makes it even twice as remarkable that Bongard pulled it off realistically. In general her characters don't really seem to act their age. Especially Ella is very mature and down-to-age and even the so-called teenage meltdowns she has regarding Luca don't even seem dramatic enough. High schoolers don't keep it together and are always quiet and collected like her. I would have loved more major drama that really gets ugly, because that's what high school is like. Luca and Ella seem like new adult characters in college to me. I recall that some people have even labelled this a New Adult novel. I don't really agree, it's set in high school and the language is comparable to Middle Grade, so it's somewhere inbetween and a mash-up of all three genres.<br /><br />Problematic Character Development<br /><br />During the course of the novel protagonist Ella goes through the typical ugly duckling transformation which ends in her being the object of desire for a lot guys. I'm not a fan of that. I know that in reality high school boys are that superficial and will start to notice girls the second they take off their glasses and dress a little more extravagant - however, does this really have to be the topic of a novel for teenagers? I would have loved this way more if Bongard left out the whole lasik surgery thing and the makeover and just made Luca fall in love with Ella for her personality. Maybe he does fall in love with her because of who she is, but he would have never been intersted in her in the first place, has she not become a swan.<br /><br />The way that Ella develops in the novel and completely turns her habits inside out (starting to do sports, makeover, extraversion) doesn't make her sympathetic and frankly, it doesn't give off a positive vibe for teenage readers her age. You don't have to live up to society's expectations to be happy and fall in love. That's exactly what the novel advertises for - change everything about you and the hottest boy in school will like you - yay.<br />To me, that's a very problematic view point. However, if we're not talking about deep matters and all, I can fairly say that I enjoyed this novel a lot. I read it really quickly because of the easy writing style and because I loved that Ella is a book blogger and talks about the little things we bloggers worry about a lot.<br /><br />Rating:<br />★★★★☆<br /><br />Overall: Do I Recommend?<br />I devoured this. There are quite some points that I don't like and that definitely made me consider putting this up as a regular recommendation, which I rarely do and only with insanely good novels. &#34;Loving&#34; is absolutely not what I expected and that's a good thing. It's a cute, quick, but probably easily forgettable read. It's nice if you're a blogger yourself and one of those books you can read over and over again when you're on a vacation. It's beachy somehow, it's light and it's entertaining. Well-deserved four stars and a recommendation to all you book bloggers out there.ecause of the easy writing style and because I loved that Ella is a book blogger and talks about the little things we bloggers worry about a lot.<br /><br />Rating:<br />★★★★☆<br /><br />Overall: Do I Recommend?<br />I devoured this.

Ella and Luca need a lot of help in my opinion because once they say one thing wrong, someone ends up leaving, they talk, get back together and it starts all over again.<br /><br />It was a cute read most of the time and I loved seeing Luca doing the little things for Ella. These characters are young so the 'I think I'm in love' thing is thrown around more times than I can count but I got use to it.<br /><br />The most shocking thing from the whole book was Alex. Didn't see that coming. I guess that was the only 0.0 moment.<br /><br />Don't know where I stand with this one but the author did do a good job. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick, YA/NA love story.",2014-07-01

This book was as cheesy as I remember but in a nostalgic way.  However, the transcription for Kindle is HORRENDOUS!!  I do not exaggerate.  I would love to know who the editor was on this piece of material - perhaps I could have his job.  My fifth grade child could do a better job - easily.  I have never seen so many errors in one piece of writing in all my life and I used to edit college freshman composition papers as a teaching assistant! Who okays these things for mass market anyway Kindle, Amazon or the book publisher?  Shame on whoever it is.  Don't purchase if typos on every page will bother you.",2010-11-30
