Moreover, there is enough diversity among the characters who populate the book that one seems justified in concluding that Malamud was not telling us of life only within the social, geographic, and temporal limits just acknowledged. Instead, The Assistant provides cheerless but profound insights into the character and quality of human life that covers and indefinitely large domain with uncertain boundaries.<br /><br />The eponymous assistant is a grocery store clerk, quick to learn but also quick to err in ways that he immediately regrets but that plague him indefinitely.  An orphan raised in a succession of work-house foster homes, he is a drifter with no profession, no trade, no friends, no family, no religion, and no place to go.  Nominally Italian because of his swarthy, broken-nosed appearance, he could be anything.  Even his job is something that he stumbled into clumsily, gradually, and ostensibly for the short term.  Though it provides room and board but little more, at least for now it's a stable place that affords him a storekeeper's sociability and is a source of aspirations that are new to him.  Still, save for the new-found, short-term job and the store, the assistant is as alone and isolated as one can be, not by choice but because that's the way things are.<br /><br />His boss is a Jew, one who does not practice his religion formally, but who adheres to its laws.  At age sixty, he is becoming dispirited and demoralized.  Other merchants, some with the scale, marketing skill, and capital to be competitive, are stealing his customers.  Even his next-door neighbor did the smart thing, gave up dry cleaning and wangled a liquor license, and has conspicuously prospered selling booze.  The boss, the small-scale, hard-working merchant who puts in sixteen hour days seven days a week, is a throwback, obsolete, an easy mark, and in his own way just as isolated and out-of-touch in the Twentieth Century as his assistant.  He pays his bills as he can and wonders how long he can endure.<br /><br />The boss's wife and daughter are long-suffering.  His wife seldom leaves their upstairs home except to enter the store.  Her closest companion is fear of starvation.  The daughter, a young and attractive woman, loved by her parents, aspires to a degree in literature but works as a secretary, contributing most of what she earns to keeping the store going.  Is it a close family?  in some ways, but its members, like the assistant who orbits its periphery, live mainly inside their heads, with fears, memories, diminishing hopes for at least a marginally better future.  But they talk little about their thoughts and feelings, and, again, we have people who are fundamentally isolated and disconnected.<br /><br />The assistant's efforts to maintain the little store are heroic.  But where else would he go and what would he do in hard times?  For reasons that are understandable but also forgivable, his social ties to the boss's family are more and more frayed and distorted. He becomes frail and despondent, sacrificing his vigor and young man's zest for life.  Yet he persists and keeps the store going.  When good fortune falls into the boss's lap, it quickly disappears, up in smoke like a cheap cigar.  Even good luck is a stranger to this isolated old Jew.<br /><br />The assistant muses over what little he knows of history, acknowledges the misfortune of the boss and his family, and concludes that this is the life of a Jew.  Aware of his own suffering, decline, and isolation, despite his tireless efforts to be a better person, he concludes that he too is a Jew.  He has little else but that self-imposed identity.<br /><br />Life is contingent, fraught with chance, unforgiving, and offers more bad luck than good.  Faced with these prospects, perhaps Malamud has concluded that even the most fortunate among us are, for the long term, Jews after the fashion of the assistant, ultimately isolated and alone.ud has concluded that even the most fortunate among us are, for the long term, Jews after the fashion of the assistant, ultimately isolated and alone.",2013-06-11

I admired the economy of Malamud's writing style, especially since I had to read two very long novels by Saul Bellow for the same class. I thought all the characters in this book were sympathetic: the grocer, the thief/assistant, the daughter, the wife. Each had their own hopes, dreams, fears, desires, all of which crashed against one another in a tiny grocery store in Brooklyn.<br /><br />One thing about this book bothered me: that Malamud had Frank keep repeating the same mistakes over and over, and at times it seemed as if the author didn't know when and where the novel should end. Too many mini climaxes of action aren't as interesting as one major one. I was also bothered by the religious ending: It didn't seem to flow naturally from what came before.",2011-09-27

The conflicts they face are very real and the mistakes they make all have painful consequences.  At times the story moves slowly, perhaps to enhance the dreary life in the dreary store, but there are enough tragedies (such as a robbery, rape and worse) to keep the reader on edge and nervous.  Ultimately this tale works on an internal level, where the reader must look within and question the basis and nature of morality.

The male main character is a verbally and emotionally abusive man/child with no real redeeming quality. If he doesn't get his way, he sleeps with as many other woman as possible, throws a tantrum and degrades his so called love with as much name calling and emotional torture that his poorly written character can muster. The female main character is a spineless one dimensional character that is frustrating and horrendous to read. Her boyfriend and best friend treat her as if she were nothing more than a speck of dust on a doormat and she smiles and accepts whatever they throw at her. Oh don't get me wrong, she occasionally grumbles but then smiles and hair tosses and her world is perfect again. There should be a clear warning that this book contains as much mental and verbal abuse as this does. I, for one, world never have purchased this if I knew what it was. I wish I could erase all traces of it from my memory. I wish I could get my time and money back.

I didn't like or dislike the story. I'm more disappointed if anything. The author had an opportunity to do something spectacular here but they missed the boat.    First off, I like Emily to an extent. She's feisty, but at times, I would've loved to have smacked her upside the head for allowing certain behavior from Adrian to dictate her personal life. I never warmed up to Adrian due to his caveman behavior. Adrian is a 25 year old boy...not man...boy. He's spoiled and entitled. There's almost nothing redeemable about him. His treatment of Emily and those around him baffled me. His take charge attitude might be charming to some but I found it off-putting. He never matures, even after learning the lessons, which should've changed him for the better. He takes, takes, takes, demands, demands, demands but never learns to give, give, give, compromise, compromise, compromise. By the end of he book, I really didn't care if Adrian & Emily got together or broke up.    There were times I found myself laughing or smiling because it was truly and genuinely funny, but those moments are few and far between.    The book at over 500 pages is too long. There's a lot of useless information thrown in which never furthered the story. I found myself skimming through most pages because of redundancy. A lot of grammatical and punctuation errors. If revisions are made to both main characters and to the story, I would willingly reread the story and change my review because that's how much I want to love this story.    Side note: I've noticed the price of this book rise from an affordable .99 cents (again, free when I downloaded) to an abominable $5.31, now for those who've yet to read this book, please borrow from someone who'll loan it to you.

I felt that the book was on the bipolar side. I liked portions of it and then hated chunks of it. I was really torn. I was aghast and laughing at the same time. I am going to say 2.50 stars overall. The hero and heroine were a 2 star, but the wacky supporting cast and the hilarious bantering get a 3 star.  The book opens with the H interviewing for assistants. Judging by his interviewing methods, he has not taken any sexual harassment courses. The H was physically all over the h during the interview. Then he was all over her while she was working for him. Hmmm, I continued to read despite my harassment training.  The H is a 25 year old billionaire running his father's firm. He frequently cancels his morning appointments for a round of smex in his office with 4 or 5 of the ladies from the firm. He continues a round with the ladies after meeting the h. Although he and the h were not in a relationship, they share a kiss that throws him for a loop. The only redeeming factor was that he called one of the woman by the h's name during smex. He is really immature throughout most of the book, so it is difficult to see him running a firm or pursuing a relationship. The H falls pretty hard for the h and is uber possessive of her throughout the book. That was kind of cute. He grows on you as the story progresses.  The h is a 24 year old college grad looking for work. I am not sure why she accepted a job after the very physical interview with the boss. The h is a doormat until she quits her job in a middle of an argument. It took her some time to wipe off the footprints from her back. She could have stood up to the H earlier in the story, but she does not. She allows him to make decisions for her on her living arrangements and her personal life. She just accepts the H making all her decisions until the argument. She starts to grow on you after she quits her job.  The supporting besties and family members make numerous appearances and have some pretty funny lines that keep the story flowing. The book was fairly long with a pre epilogue and an epilogue and a post epilogue. Most of the story format consisted of bantering from everyone and most of it was fairly entertaining.  I would have liked to see more of:  1) The hero's pov. The entire book was from the h's pov. What were some of his thoughts when they shared that memorable first kiss? Thoughts when sharing a bed without benefits? Thoughts of his friend and the h on a lunch date? And thoughts of the h when smexing with the ladies after the kiss?  2) The heroine stand up to the hero earlier.  3) More mature leading characters.  I would have liked to see less of:  1) The hero smirking on every page.  2) A lot less of eyebrow waggling from the males  3) less of everyone saying &#34;shut up.&#34;  I did not think I would like the story, but it kind of grew on me as did the leading characters.",2014-12-23

KINDLE FREE. Yay! Honestly, the writing style is good. I say this because the style was a lot better written than some books I have read by other authors. The author have developed characters and were not all over the place with these traits However, all the male characters were pigs. Constantly, making sexual remarks to the main character. I think the only male character that was remotely likeably was Allen. In the beginning, I liked the main character, she was a strong lead character, but she had her &#34;I am going to give in&#34; moments that increased throughout the book. I started disliking her for not sticking up for herself more like she had in the beginning. Her friend was so annoying because she was defending Adrian and all his moody and CONTROLLING traits. I mean I read a comment that someone posted saying, &#34; Who wouldn't love to have a man like that?&#34; Um hello, I would not. Why do you need a man who does not let you talk to other men, even if you are friends? or having a guy who throws little kids tantrums when he does not get what he wants? Talk about immature. Just thinking about Adrian's controlling and childish ways angers me.<br /><br />--------Spoilers--------<br />Being specific to what is wrong with this book and the interaction between the two main characters.<br />1. When her parents and brother come to visit, Adrian shows up and claims that he is her boyfriend (they are not even dating!) after she told him that he is not allowed to come. I was in rage when this happened. The main character (Sorry I don't remember her name, other than being called shortcake) was mad. Yes! and she told him to leave and she was going to clean up the mess (the lie) he made. Thank you! but what happens next, he is still there and she did not tell her parents the truth. If that was me, I would have told my parents the truth.<br /><br />2. She sleeps without a bra. Okay, whatever. My problem with this is that Adrian gropes her when they sleep in the same bed. May I remind you that they are still not together. Adrian pushes her to sleep in the same bed as he basically gropes her. WTF! Seriously, why is she even sleeping in the same bed. I would have just gone into the other room and locked the door, especially if I am sleeping braless, but then again, I would not even be sleeping anywhere near this guy. Not in the same bed, or room, or apartment.<br /><br />3. This is a HUGE deal to me. She moves in with him!!!!!!!!! She told him, for a whole week, no! And when her parents come to visit, he tells her parents this. WTF!!!! and what is worst is that she DOES move in with him even though she is not happy about his! My goodness. WHAT. IS. WRONG. WITH. THIS. FEMALE? I would have called the cops or actually moved in with my parents or somewhere else to get away from this psycho or at least get a restraining order on him!<br /><br />-----------------------<br />I did not even finish this book. I had too many problems with this whole &#34;I have money and you are going to get fired if you do not do what I want and you cannot even speak or hang out with someone else because I am going to punch them in the face. You are mine! and only mine.&#34; I did comments that this is him just being protective of the people he loves. *snort* yeah, right? This guy is clearly insane and psycho. Somehow though, she falls in love with him, they get married, and have children (read this in another comment here on amazon)..... (Silence)...... I have no idea what to say about this. I just know that I am really mad. My question is &#34;Why? Why would you do this to yourself? I know in society there are women getting abused in their relationships and I know she is not getting hit....but why put yourself though this?&#34; It is very similar situation, minus the getting hit aspect.<br /><br /> I do not recommend this book and I suggest the author to really focus on some other plots that give you that strong female and a sweet guy, or something, because she is really good at writing.",2014-11-12

Unfortunately I just couldn't stomach either of the principle characters, pretty much from the moment they were introduced.

I like strong, intelligent female characters, and male characters that have an \\""edge\\"" to them.  I would describe the principle female character in this book as vapid, helpless, and absent of even the most basic common sense.  The book would have you believe the principle male character is a driven, tortured, hyper rich, successful businessman.  Based upon his behavior I would describe him as rude, crude, obnoxious, and penniless due to all the sexual harassment lawsuits he would have to settle.  It is possible at some point in my life I have read a book with a less likeable male lead character, but I just can't think of one.

I wasn't sure I wanted to waste anymore time and actually do the review. But, because I felt cheated in the end, I felt I needed to write this. First, I'll start by saying that the sample I read was intriguing. Enough so that I purchased the book for $4.61. And I'll also say that after finding out the author was very young, it was her first book, and she had done it on a free writing site that I would try and cut her some slack. That being said I think if I hear someone use the term smirk, blush, or squeak in the near future I might slap them upside the head with my kindle!!! Seriously, someone had to have read this before it was published. How could the over usage of words go unnoticed?? I almost started tally marking how many times he smirked at her. I swear he only grinned like twice and smiled I think once??? But he smirked over and over and over again. I found myself rolling my eyes at 30% and entertaining myself more at the repition rather than the story itself. Emily blushed so much that I pictured her as hot tomato through the last half of the book. One word: thesaurus. Please use one next time. I almost called it quits three times, but couldn't.... I'm just too cheap to have it go to waste. I mean, did I mention I paid 4.61! So, back in to the story I went. Emily had to be the biggest prude I have read as a heroine. After she realizes her attraction for Adrian she still squeaks/blushes every time his body shows his \\""excitement\\"" for her. Uh, what??  The biggest discovery about myself and the book as a whole came at the very last page. I love to indulge in a hot, steamy, romance and there is no sex scenes in the entire book, not one!!!!!!!!!!!! As I browse over my kindle to see books in the library I realize this is my first romance book that didn't have a sex scene.<br />****spoiler on next line - don't read further if you don't want to know****<br /><br />It is apparent that sex is being had just not for you to read about. Other characters comment on all the sex these two have, but you'll never actually read it for yourself. Which is where my self discovery came. I LOVE a raw, hot, get in your head type of story where you experience it ALL!!!! Sex definitely included!! My $4.61 deserved to read when Emily finally gave in to the temptation and frankly I didn't get it!! This is where the author's age comes into play. I will cut her some slack, because I think she still has a precious innocence that doesn't know that some people would like to read about Adrian's face buried between her legs or taken against the wall with such force a picture falls crashing to the floor. But this Romance Junky is not innocent and absolutely wants to read something that has me squirming in my seat  :)",2014-07-17

The editing is very poor, although after about 25% of the book you start to just ignore it. I imagine that the author of this book is a teenager attempting to write from the point of view of working adults with no  idea of what a real adult would actually do. I almost stopped reading when the heroine wanted to get out of work on a Friday night to watch Vampire Diaries (really? She's not 16). Also it seems that in order for the author to emphasize emotional dialogue, the speaker MUST SCREAM IT! Why are all emotionally or excited exclamations (especially Amy's) in all capital letters? On top of that, why does Adrian keep putting his arm around her waist? While they are sitting down, standing up, walking, etc. It would have been nice if he were actually able to be a playboy, ie. seduce her in some way. I imagine the author does not actually know how a grown man would attempt to seduce a woman and that is why she kept having Adrian put his arm around Emily's waist over and over and over and over! I half expected his to stomp his foot and flail around on the floor throwing a temper tantrum like a 3 year old. Tsk Tsk Elle Brace, the Adrian you describe would not constantly act like a child.<br /><br />In spite of the stunted and often illogical behaviors of the 25 year old characters, this author has potential. I hope the Elle Brace takes the time to work on her craft and doesn't rely on the praise of the Wattpad community.

The heroine, American, says things that make NO SENSE to the American ear: &#34;I put a piece of fries&#34; in my mouth...huh?  She qualifies Wal-Mart, as one of the bigger stores in America...HUH?!?!?! I agree with previous reviewers...the dialogue between the heroine and the hero's dad makes no sense if you want the reader TO LIKE the hero's dad. And, those are only a few problems.  Throw in awkward phrasing and plot shifts that ask one to suspend disbelief to a point where the reader can't take it any more. I can suspend my disbelief to believe that a heroine falls for a vampire...but *SPOILER ALERT* I cannot believe we get half way through the book, the heroine is living with the hereo...and she still wants to think of her as his boss.  GAG. I agree with reviewers, too, that I WANTED to like this book, it has funny scenes...the hero has some good ALPHA  mojo...the heroine can be funny (if maybe she belongs to the bygone 1940s America morality...who would not want to kiss their freaking HOT boss?).  This book felt like a second draft...it needs some fine-tuning.

Adrian's father was a creeper because he always mentioned Emily's boobs, even in front of his wife and Adrian. The story dragged and would have been shorter if the author cut in half the many references on how hot or beautiful Emily was.

I just couldn't! I'm usually a total sap for these types of books, but for me this one fell extremely flat.<br /><br />First of all, I really really did not like the characters... I hated the fact that Adrian acted like a bipolar and jealous birthdays a majority of the book. (It would have been a lot better if the author had actually written him with the disorder and played in to it a bit...)  I didn't like the fact that he felt the need to sleep with several women when he didn't get his way. I'm sorry but sleeping with a million girls isn't the way to win over the heart of one. And I hated that he tried to be funny when there were serious situations (like when he \\""rescues\\"" Emily from that \\""scary\\"" situation in the hotel room). I also reallyyyyyy disliked Emily too. She was way too immature for me, considering she freaked out at the comments Adrian made to her... I'm sorry, but I've heard worse comments from strangers than most of the stuff he said to her.<br /><br />The book wasn't romantic to me at all... yes there were some cute moments and sayings, but a majority of it was BLAH. Adrian didn't try very hard to woo her, and I still can't believe how long it took before they KISSED.... seemed very odd to me, considering they were sharing a bed most nights... I never even knew Emily fell in love with Adrian because the author doesn't go in to detail about it. All you know is she's attracted to him and he drives her crazy. (Honestly when she confessed her feelings, I was totally caught off guard!)<br /><br />I also thought it was kind of weird how they built up to the sex...but never went into detail about it. I'm not saying i wanted 50 shades of grey status...but when there's anticipation for it, and they just breeze over it without and mention whatsoever, it was kind of a let down....",2014-06-22
US,51435337,R164FDNRGCCEHU,B00KLGZ27Y,151911400,"The Assistant",Digital_Ebook_Purchase,5,5,7,N,Y,"Perfect beach read","I don't usually leave reviews, but this one was cleverly written and deserves a nod. This review might have spoilers but hopefully nothing to ruin the book.  There were a few spelling or grammar errors that should have been caught in editing, but I was still highly entertained by this book. It has the usual storyline boss is infatuated with his assistant but I assure you it's much more.  Emily isn't the usual assistant, she has brains, self-confidence, and humorous attitude.  I think that is what draws Adrian' s attention. He's definitely a little spoiled and used to getting what or who he wants.  He's not shy in his advances and also not shy when real feelings begin to come into play. This also is not a book filled with sex in the office so if you are looking for that kind of book, this isn't it. There are no details when that finally happens (and I'll tell you right now, it won't happen for a long time. This isn't a book that creates love from sex) and I liked that about this book.  It showed Emily had standards and wasn't going to get caught up in this guy giving her attention.  Because of Adrian's spoiled ways he does have some temper tantrums and is possessive even when she isn't his. So as shocking it was to see in the beginning, I'll tell you he gets better as his character grows...although it will always have some part of who he is, she just balances him.  It's his cocky attitude, her quick wit, and the clever banter that had me laughing throughout this book.  Even the conflict in the book isn't some ex girlfriend coming in to ruin it and cause Emily to have doubts-let's face it, Adrian never left me wondering if his feelings were to.  If some cheating scandal came into play, it would have been hard to believe with all he said and did.  It just isn't that kind of book. But the conflict that happens, does adds meat to the story so it's not just boy meets girl. The only character who annoyed me was her best friend, Amy. She was just so loud and annoying at times, I couldn't be friends with her ;)  If you are looking for a light read but with strong characters and story line, this is your book.",2014-06-22

It was easy to read. The plot was kind of interesting, however there was a lot of flawed logic and many contradictions throughout.

(Ooops!  I just made a typo and was a little surprised that Anna didn't offer to fix it for me).<br /><br />Imagine being an unkempt, overweight, agoraphobic man setting up a new computer in order keep your online façade of a life under control.  Once you, Stuart, switch the bugger on, a sexy, while still annoying, help program named Anna keeps popping up, unsolicited.  At first, she is a mere version of the dreaded Microsoft Office Assistant, Clippy, from years ago.<br /><br />I hate to give much plot away in the review of a book, but Anna turns out to be a far cry from that obnoxious little paper clip.  You remember the one, \\""It looks like you are writing a letter.  Would you like help?\\""  Anna is just as nettlesome, but in an entirely different way.<br /><br />This story takes some twists and turns, some are expected, others are not.  All in all, I had a delightful couple of hours reading the dialogue-heavy tale of Stuart and Anna.  The perfect download for an afternoon on the beach.",2011-05-14
