With prototypical noir private detective Philip Marlowe as the protagonist, Chandler's novel grabs the reader's attention and doesn't let go until the very end.  Yeah, we're all headed for the big sleep soon enough, and nobody knows that better than Marlowe.  He moves in circles where death comes early to a lot of folks, both good and bad.<br /><br />Marlowe sees the underside of life at its ugliest and most dangerous, but somehow he manages to avoid becoming a mean-spirited cynic.  He's got a cynical streak, sure, but there's a lot more to him than just cold, dark skepticism, doubt, and mistrust.  Almost in spite of himself, Marlowe is the kind of guy who, though he's hard as nails, cares about cadaverous old men whose basic decency is belied by wayward adult children, spoiled by excessive wealth and unnaturally nasty to those who refuse to give them exactly what they want.<br /><br />Marlowe, in fact, cares about a lot of people that we'd expect a hard-boiled private eye to dismiss as the products of bad choices, mishandled opportunities, and not worth the trouble.  He's a tough guy, a sharp dresser, attractive to women, smart and street-wise, but he's not arrogant.  Confident, sure, but not a showboat or the sort of person who takes advantage of others who are impressed by his reputation and desperately need his services.<br /><br />Chandler doesn't tell us much about Marlowe's background.  He once worked as an investigator for the Los Angeles County District Attorney, but that's pretty much it.  I think we can infer from what we read that Marlowe went private because he didn't want to be constrained by excessive rules and regulations as to how investigations were to be done.  He's got a good head for his line of work, so why let himself be hamstrung by red tape and undercut by the political connections of the rich and famous?<br /><br />One thing Marlow might have done but systematically avoided was using his skills and reputation in amoral pursuit of big money.  Instead, he charges a modest daily fee plus expenses, and this is a guy who lives in a small apartment with a bed that pulls out of the wall.  He could have gotten a lot more, but he's comfortable, well put together, with suitable transportation, money for decent restaurants, and he doesn't miss not having a secretary.  Modest and frugal almost to a fault, but he doesn't do without anything he really needs.  Besides, there is substantial gratification in having the admiration, even when grudging, of high officials in what we now euphemistically call the criminal justice system.<br /><br />One of the things that is especially interesting about Marlowe, complete with his unexplored background. is the fact that he's not just another semi-articulate gumshoe.  His thinking has the complexity and sophistication of a genuinely literate and polished operative.  When he characterizes a story he's been told during the course of an investigation as \\""... a little pat.  It had the austere simplicity of fiction rather than the tangled web of fact,\\"" it becomes clear that he's not the sort who is at a loss for linguistic concepts that enable him to think things through unhampered by lack of wit and learning.  The guy is smart, savvy, and well-suited for the complex intellectual labor that comes with his job.<br /><br />Marlowe likes the ladies, and they, for the most part, like him.  However, even when he's in a circumstance to pick an choose, he puts the job first, not compromising his position by succumbing to temptation.<br /><br />At the end of The Big Sleep, Marlowe mourns the loss of a woman he found especially appealing with a couple of stiff drinks.  Sadly the scotch just makes things worse, but he takes what comfort he can in having enabled a dying old man to salvage his pride.<br /><br />Marlowe is a street-level philosopher who is keenly aware that eventually everyone \\""just slept the big sleep, not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell.\\""  He didn't kid himself:  he is part of the nastiness, as are all the best  noir protagonists.  But like he said, so what?  When you're dead, you're dead.<br /><br />The Big Sleep is a pretty complex novel with some interesting, likable, loathsome, and indifferent characters.  The best part of Chandler's book, however, is Philip Marlowe:  the quintessential noir protagonist. Marlowe is a great character, and The Big Sleep is a fittingly titled first-rate read, complete with dated references to what we then called \\""smut.\\""  How tame when compared to today's porno!<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading The Big Sleep, and others will, too.

I decided to check out the writing this time around and The Big Sleep seemed like the right one. I expected hard boiled and got an interesting introspective view from what is essentially a down at the heels private investigator.<br /><br />Marlowe is asked to General Sternwood's home to discuss getting his youngest daughter Carmen out of a jam. She has signed some IOUs for a lot of money and the man wants to be paid. Marlowe suggests looking into the situation closer and deciding whether or not the debt (or rather blackmail money) should be paid, and he thinks the general should ignore the markers.<br /><br />During the conversation, the ailing millionaire talks about his son-in-law, Rusty Regan, and how much he misses him since he walked out on his elder daughter, Vivian. He knows Regan was a bootlegger, but a good man who wasn't just after his daughter's -- or rather his -- money and he spent a lot of time talking with the general. What Carmen and Vivian want to know is if Marlowe was hired to find Regan. He tells both women, and everyone else who seems to think that's the only reason Sternwood would hire him, that he was hired to handle another matter. No one seems to believe Marlowe.<br /><br />Marlowe finds Carmen naked with a dead man on the floor and steps in to handle things. When he returns to the house, the body is gone, as is the film and camera that shot pictures of Carmen while drugged and naked. Things get more interesting from that point on.<br /><br />Chandler creates a believable situation with dangerous rip tides and under currents that Marlowe manages pretty well. Marlowe is always a few steps ahead of the bad guys -- and gals -- and able to adapt to all situations. What is so surprising about Chandler's writing is how he gives each character and the story such depth and complexity. The writing verges on poetic and the situations as real as the morning newspaper. Chandler demonstrates the relationship between police and criminals and how Marlowe fits seamlessly into the mix without giving up his principles. The women are dangerous and unpredictable and Marlowe handles them with experience and dispatch. He is ready for anything.<br /><br />The Big Sleep refers to the big sleep that all of us must take in the end, whether it is with a bullet or the slow embrace that comes with old age and infirmity.

Chandler had already dabbled with the character type in a series of short stories published in Black Mask magazine for the previous half dozen years, stories he then cannibalized for plot elements for his novels, but it is in the extended narrative form that it fully flowers.<br /><br />Not that plot is the main focus here. Sure, there's a mystery (several, in fact) that drives the narrative, but it is Phillip Marlowe and the gallery of scoundrels, perverts and psychopaths he encounters in the course of his investigations that provides the primary source of reader interest. Chandler does two things superbly that I think are critical in the detective/mystery genre: he invents great characters and he writes great dialogue for them. A good detective story depends on the interaction between the characters as they become embroiled in and seek to solve the mystery (usually a murder or murders but not always). The characters and how they interact verbally are therefore fundamental. Chandler here shows himself a master at both skills as The Big Sleep is essentially a series of confrontation scenes pitting the glib Marlowe against a rotating cast of colorful degenerates.<br /><br />Supporting the characters and their interactions is Chandler's atmospherics, which are set in a pre-war Los Angeles that was still viewed as a backwater in many ways by most of the rest of the country despite being home to the powerful film industry. And Chandler's Los Angeles, like Roman Polanski's Los Angeles in Chinatown, is a glitzy facade hiding sleaze in all corners. Marlowe--cynical, profane, alienated and doggedly uncompromising about his principles--serves as the moral center as well as the stylistic one since we get the story from his first person narration.<br /><br />I can see why this novel was popular in its day, with its explorations of an underworld of sordid sex, pornography and homosexuality (Marlowe is not exactly politically correct about gays, by the way, so if that bothers you, be warned). Unfortunately, Chandler was not exactly a prolific writer. He would only produce five more novels in his lifetime after this one, and by 1939 he was also mostly done with short stories. He collaborated on a couple of screenplays but that was really it. Damn shame...",2013-07-08

The plots are so intricate and convoluted that the twists and turns fascinate, even if the end is known. And the dialogue is just as fresh and clever the second time around.<br /><br />The mystery here begins with the hiring of private detective Philip Marlowe by a dying millionaire with two wayward daughters. What starts with a simple case of blackmail quickly escalates into multiple murders and an underworld of gambling, pornography, and narcotics. Along the way, Marlowe is enticed by not one, but three, seductresses, and faces down several armed adversaries, all the while maintaining his cool and his principles and staying one step ahead of the game. The ending is somewhat surprising but logical, with all the clues given beforehand.<br /><br />The multifaceted character Philip Marlowe is subtly and admirably portrayed. He is cynical and sentimental, sympathetic and pragmatic, tough and tender. Just the kind of guy I would like to know if I ran into a spot of trouble.<br /><br />The dialogue, as always with Chandler novels, makes me envious of Philip Marlowe in the extreme. I certainly wish that I could think of such splendid come-backs on the spur of the moment. Don't all of us wish we could?<br /><br />For readers today, the plot is slightly dated, because pornography (what would now be considered as soft pornography) and drug use are not as scandalous as they once were. Also, the attitude portrayed here toward homosexuality is subtly derogatory. Still, the time this was written (1939) must be taken into consideration, and the novel could easily be translated into modern day crimes and attitudes and still be valid and believable.<br /><br />One of the best of the best of the hard-boiled detective genre.",2013-03-19

Dames, and their witty comebacks.<br /><br />The Big Sleep, a hard-boiled detective yarn, was much too confusing.  You think you are learning the myriad of main and peripheral characters, and then you drift for a minute because of a piece of stray lint on your sleeve and are out to sea and asking \\""Who is that?\\""  You think you are following the long plot arc, but then you take a sip of your chocolate milk, check your text messages, and have no idea why there are gun shots being fired.  I enjoyed this film, but it makes you work hard.  Some of the mystery is intentional and a puzzle, while other aspects of the scattered story are just the result of poor construction.  I like a challenge, but when you layer in lots of repartee and characters that seem to drift in and out and then inexplicably reappear, viewers get lost.  Nice try, but you lost me.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart plays Philip Marlowe, a private eye with a knack for getting into trouble and reeling off snappy remarks.  In particular, he is skilled at making clever small talk with attractive women.  And they all seem to want him.  One, in particular, played by Bogart's way-too-young-for-him real life wife, Lauren Bacall, seems to be nothing more than a prop used to create some cheesy romantic tension and to manufacture a throwaway kissing sequence.  (I also did not understand the musical number with Bacall.  Totally unnecessary; must be a 1940s thing.)  The dialogue between Bogart and Bacall is good.  Maybe a little too good and too sharp for reality.  In The Big Sleep's reality, everyone is witty.<br /><br />I never figured out why it was called The Big Sleep, either.  Maybe that is a figure of speech that is new to me?<br /><br />There is an abundance of smoking and drinking in this movie.  Wow.  Really, who carries around a bottle of rye in his pocket and then whips it out for a sniff when he is stuck inside a book store with an attractive brunette because of a torrential downpour?  From the openingsequence with lit cigarettes to Bogart's constant drinking and smoking, it is no wonder this guy died young.  Although I am not a big classic film guy, I cannot imagine that these vices were as prevalent in other films from the era.  The over-indulgence of tobacco and alcohol throughout this picture gives you the impression that the characters are living hard, taking chances, telling lies, covering up, and easing their pain with booze and smokes.  Effective.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect is the careful treatment of drug use and pornography.  When Bogart happens upon a woman stoned out of her gourd in a chair, we never really know exactly what she was doing to get in that beleaguered state.  Likewise, it is only hinted at that she was posing for nudie pictures and that a dead man found near her was a seedy pornographer.  There are subtle pointers, but the movie never jumps out and smacks you across the face with what would likely be explicit in today's movies.  The beating around the bush makes watching this movie a little frustrating, but also satisfying when you get to fill in the blanks on your own.  It is a bit like a choose your own adventure book.<br /><br />I would not place The Big Sleep on a list of my favorite detective movies, but it has some merit.  You will enjoy the dialogue.  The star power of the leads is bright.  But the plot twists too much and leaves you scratching your head.",2013-02-22
US,23920004,R1BI3AE4EFVZXE,1907590307,849452523,The Big Sleep,Books,4,2,2,N,N,"Great read, fascinatingly different than the 1946 movie","Raymond Chandler<br /><br />The Big Sleep<br /><br />Vintage, Paperback, [1992].<br />8vo. 231 pp.<br /><br />First published, 1939.<br /><br />============================================<br /><br />I thought it was high time to read this novel. It was a shame, really, that I had seen the [[ASIN:B000FFJYA2 1946 movie]] with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall some five times already, yet had never read Chandler's classic novel. Detective fiction is not exactly my cup of tea, but, then again, neither is any other specific genre: as long as something is well written and exciting, I would read just about anything. As far as Chandler (and, for that matter, Hammett) is concerned, Somerset Maugham's admiration for his colleagues, as amply expressed in his vastly entertaining essay ''The Decline and Fall of the Detective Story'' (in the collection \\""The Vagrant Mood\\"", 1952), doubtless additionally stimulated my interest. Before going any further, here is the usual warning.<br /><br />Please be aware that, if you haven't read the book or seen the movie, I am going to spoil both for you. Plot details and memorable lines abound below and it's certainly better to experience them for the first time in the original versions. The book is my primary objective here, but the movie will be discussed in some detail as well.<br /><br />On the whole, though \\""The Big Sleep\\"" was not quite as exciting and entertaining as I had expected, it was a fascinating read of considerable merit. The story is complex and complicated - racket, blackmail, no fewer than five dead bodies, some of them ''behind the scenes'', some not - yet it is expertly paced and subtly told, keeping you well on the edge until the last few pages. There are several twists and, though I was well prepared for them by the movie, they were hardly less unexpected on paper. The generally superb dialogue is, in my opinion, the best feature of the novel. It conveys dramatic situations with great vividness and even greater suspense. I don't know if the pen is mightier than the sword, but here spoken words certainly seem to be mightier than the gun, no doubt because use of the latter is mightily stimulated by the careless handling of the former. That the conversation is occasionally a little too slangy to be easily understood is most probably due to my insufficient knowledge of the language, not to Chandler's handling of it. ''See if this bird is wearing any iron'' or \\""Let's dip the bill\\"" are quite clear from the context, but some other gems like ''put the bite on the peeper'' or ''pitch dimes against the wall'' are not. Never mind. It's a very effective and often amusing dialogue; check this example that found its way into the movie more or less verbatim:<br /><br />''Yes. How come that you had a key?''<br />''Is that any of your business, soldier?''<br />''I could make it my business.''<br />He smiled tightly and pushed his hat back on his gray hair.<br />''And I could make your business my business.''<br />''You wouldn't like it. The pay's too small.''<br /><br />Similar fast exchanges of pointed remarks, in combination with very accurate descriptions of faces and reactions, make for superb dramatic scenes in which you never quite know who's hiding what and why. The verisimilitude is indeed cinematographic: you see and hear the guys as if you were watching a movie. Marlowe's marvellous sense of humour does enliven both the narrative and the dialogue. It is a welcome relief from the generally gloomy atmosphere. Favourite examples include unforgettable description of Agnes \\""as limp as a fresh-killed rabbit\\"" or Carmen's raising her eyebrows \\""like a theatre curtain\\"", one of her favourite tricks which was supposed to make \\""me roll over on my back with all four paws in the air\\"". I can certainly see why Raymond Chandler is generally regarded as a fine prose stylist. Unfortunately, his pen is not uniformly that good.<br /><br />My major disappointment with the book is the narrative. It is Marlowe himself who tells the whole story in the first person singular, but his short, abrupt sentences, with much too many repetitions of personal pronouns, often sound like slaps in my face. Despite the fact that such writing suits the subject rather well and despite Marlowe's refreshing jokes now and then, there are a number of places where the writing detracts more than it adds. The action scenes in particular - tail jobs, gun fights, etc. - come off rather tedious and unconvincing. It wasn't until the middle of the book that it turned into a page-turner and I became really involved in the subtleties of the story - and in the character of the story-teller. Also, in the early chapters in particular, there are many unduly extended descriptions of surroundings. Of course this is essential - some sleuth if he is not observant! - but it does tend to become boring. Last but not least, there is one point in the dialogue where it falls short of its generally high quality. Surprisingly or not, these are Marlowe's conversations with the female characters, most notably the Sternwood sisters.<br /><br />So the book does, or at least in my case it did, require a considerable amount of pages to become really absorbing. But after that there was no stopping until the end. Apart from the intricacies of the plot, the most compelling thing about The Big Sleep is, of course, Marlowe himself. In addition to a lively sense of humour that sometimes produces similes one wouldn't expect a ''private dick on a case'' to have in his vocabulary - ''the sunshine was as empty as a headwaiter's smile'' - Marlowe has a professional integrity that's difficult not to arouse admiration. He is unscrupulously honest and loyal. For ''25 bucks and expenses'' a day he risks constantly his profession and his neck, often getting in trouble with the police in order to protect his clients. Perhaps what impresses me most in Marlowe is his astonishing indifference to the gentle sex. \\""I was nauseated by women\\"", as he himself put it colourfully at one place. I am not sure I would kick out of my bed the stark naked Carmen but he certainly did. (This is why Chandler should have omitted the lame flirt with the Silver-Wig, aka Mrs Eddie Mars, in the end; it is unconvincing and irrelevant.) One doesn't read detective fiction for characterisation of course, but it is just wonderful to have at least a main character who is smart, sympathetic, amusing and, above all, plausibly and convincingly drawn.<br /><br />The movie and the book make a most interesting comparison. The novel is much bolder, much more noir than the version for the screen. You wouldn't expect to find Carmen in Geiger's house wearing only her earrings, would you? But that's how you find her on the pages; it's rather more effective than the gorgeous dress in the movie. Another example is the relationship between Marlowe and Bernie Ohls, the D.A.'s chief investigator. It is friendly and full of lighthearted chaff in the movie, quite unlike the strained and often sinister conversations in the book. On the whole, however, the screenplay is pretty close to the novel and makes a fine use of some of Marlowe's most memorable lines, such as those about guns:<br /><br />\\""My, my, my! Such a lot of guns around town and so few brains!\\""<br /><br />[Disarming yet another bad guy:]<br />\\""Somebody's always giving me guns.\\""<br /><br />The book also has the advantage of providing much better understanding of the plot and a much fuller picture of what it is to be a private detective. Take for example the remarkable Chapter 18 - entirely missing in the movie - where Marlowe is hard pressed between the hammer and the anvil, that is between the police and the D.A. This was the first time when it dawned on me how tricky a business being a ''shamus'' must be. On the one hand, you are running a serious danger of being filled with lead by a number of shady subjects with itchy fingers into whose lucrative affairs your meddling is not exactly welcome. On the other hand, you are in the almost equally serious danger of being arrested for interfering with police business - for example by not reporting a murder, something Marlowe actually did and frankly admitted would do again - in order to protect the interests of your client. Then the least that can happen to you is to lose your license. As for the plot, it is somewhat confused and rushed in the movie, nor is the changed ending that adds another corpse any improvement over the original. In the latter, everything is perfectly clear and Marlowe is given several long speeches that would sound gorgeous on the stage.<br /><br />The most notable difference between both versions is the greatly enlarged relationship between Marlowe and Vivian in the movie, no doubt designed as a vehicle for Bogie and Bacall. Chandler didn't take part in the writing of the screenplay, but no fewer that three people (William Faulkner among them) did a splendid job. In this respect, the interaction between the sleuth and the elder of the Sternwood sisters, the movie is indeed greatly superior to the novel. It contains one of the coolest romances ever put on the screen - \\""I guess I'm in love with you\\"" - and though something like that does exist in the novel as well, it is infinitely better handled in the script. And there are, of course, the unforgettable last lines of the screenplay, again entirely missing from the novel:<br /><br />Vivian: You've forgotten one thing - me.<br />Marlowe: What's wrong with you?<br />Vivian: Nothing you can't fix.<br /><br />Considering my well-known passion for horses, I cannot but quote the legendary conversation that heaps one double entendre over another. It's an unforgettable scene, especially with Lauren Bacall's sultry looks and husky voice, not to mention the hilarious prelude:<br /><br />Marlowe: How'd you happen to pick out this place?<br />Vivian: Maybe I wanted to hold your hand.<br />Marlowe: Oh, that can be arranged.<br /><br />[He gives her his hand and she gives him - one of her gloves. A little later, sipping their drinks:]<br /><br />Vivian: Speaking of horses, I like to play them myself. But I like to see them workout a little first, see if they're front runners or come from behind, find out what their whole card is, what makes them run.<br />Marlowe: Find out mine?<br />Vivian: I think so.<br />Marlowe: Go ahead.<br />Vivian: I'd say you don't like to be rated. You like to get out in front, open up a little lead, take a little breather in the backstretch, and then come home free.<br />Marlowe: You don't like to be rated yourself.<br />Vivian: I haven't met anyone yet that can do it. Any suggestions?<br />Marlowe: Well, I can't tell till I've seen you over a distance of ground. You've got a touch of class, but I don't know how far you can go.<br />Vivian: A lot depends on who's in the saddle.<br /><br />The screenplay also makes much more fun of the scenes between Marlowe and Vivian, and these, too, are magnificently played by Bogie and Lauren. These moments, regrettably, are either omitted completely from the novel or changed out of recognition:<br /><br />Vivian: You go too far, Marlowe.<br />Marlowe: Those are harsh words to throw at a man, especially when he's walking out of your bedroom.<br /><br />Vivian: I don't like your manners.<br />Marlowe: And I'm not crazy about yours. I didn't ask to see you. I don't mind if you don't like my manners, I don't like them myself. They are pretty bad. I grieve over them on long winter evenings. I don't mind your ritzing me drinking your lunch out of a bottle. But don't waste your time trying to cross-examine me.<br /><br />Last but not least, indeed perhaps most important of all, the romance between Marlowe and Vivian gives a very plausible motive of the former's rather illogical behaviour. For why does the private dick continue with the case when Geiger's dead and he's been paid off? The book does address the issue, by Marlowe reflecting that leaving the case is the smart thing to do - then the does the opposite for no good reason and entirely out of character. The movie improves greatly on that, for there Marlowe continues the rather dangerous game for Vivian's sake, having shrewdly perceived that Eddie Mars \\""got something on her\\"" and she is in deep trouble.<br /><br />What is both amusing and annoying in the movie, but entirely missing in the book, is that Marlowe is constantly surrounded by swooning females everywhere he goes: the book store, the taxi, the snack bar, the library. Occasionally these scenes have some charm, too. My favourite is the gorgeous taxi driver.<br /><br />Taxi Driver: If you can use me again sometime, call this number.<br />Marlowe: Day and night?<br />Taxi Driver: Uh, night's better. I work during the day.<br /><br />Finally, to finish with the dialogue, it should be said that the screenplay also improves many of Marlowe's conversations with other female characters. In the book these are often verbose and protracted; and sometimes the choice of words is not the most effective. For example Marlowe's last words to Agnes - ''Like hell you did'' - have a better alternative in the movie. Small wonder that she couldn't think of any retort:<br /><br />Agnes: Well, so long, copper. Wish me luck. I got a raw deal.<br />Marlowe: Your kind always does.<br /><br />Marlowe's troublesome relationship, or lack of such, with the seriously disturbed and hopelessly nymphomaniac Carmen is much more amusing on the screen than Chandler's awkward treatment in the novel. Here are two cute answers to Carmen's profound statements and questions which, as far I can remember, do not occur in the book:<br /><br />Carmen: You're cute.<br />Marlowe: I'm getting cuter every minute.<br /><br />[Few seconds later:]<br /><br />Carmen: Is he as cute as you are?<br />Marlowe: Nobody is.<br /><br />All in all, a great movie and a great book, although both could have been done better. The many differences work in both directions - some are improvements, some are not - and make for many rather fascinating comparisons. The movie, for me, still remains worth seeing mostly because of the scenes between Bogie and Lauren, a subplot either badly neglected or badly executed in the novel. All of these scenes - in Vivian's bedroom, in Marlowe's ''boudoir'', in the car, in the bar - are tremendous examples of sexual innuendo suggesting a steamy affair. (Incidentally, Chandler once paid one of the best compliments to Bogie by saying that he could be a tough guy without a gun.) On the other hand, the major plot is much more effective in the book. The no-nonsense male-to-male conversations, the relentless grimness of the characters, and the subtle shades of the story are significantly superior to anything in the movie. I understand most of Raymond Chandler's other works also include Philip Marlowe. It is probably safe to say that he has earned my future reading attention and that's just about the greatest compliment I can pay him. \\""The Big Sleep\\"" being his first novel, I am curious if he later improved on it..

Occasionally these scenes have some charm, too. My favourite is the gorgeous taxi driver.<br /><br />Taxi Driver: If you can use me again sometime, call this number.<br />Marlowe: Day and night?<br />Taxi Driver: Uh, night's better. I work during the day.<br /><br />Finally, to finish with the dialogue, it should be said that the screenplay also improves many of Marlowe's conversations with other female characters. In the book these are often verbose and protracted; and sometimes the choice of words is not the most effective. For example Marlowe's last words to Agnes - ''Like hell you did'' - have a better alternative in the movie. Small wonder that she couldn't think of any retort:<br /><br />Agnes: Well, so long, copper. Wish me luck. I got a raw deal.<br />Marlowe: Your kind always does.<br /><br />Marlowe's troublesome relationship, or lack of such, with the seriously disturbed and hopelessly nymphomaniac Carmen is much more amusing on the screen than Chandler's awkward treatment in the novel. Here are two cute answers to Carmen's profound statements and questions which, as far I can remember, do not occur in the book:<br /><br />Carmen: You're cute.<br />Marlowe: I'm getting cuter every minute.<br /><br />[Few seconds later:]<br /><br />Carmen: Is he as cute as you are?<br />Marlowe: Nobody is.<br /><br />All in all, a great movie and a great book, although both could have been done better. The many differences work in both directions- some are improvements, some are not - and make for many rather fascinating comparisons. The movie, for me, still remains worth seeing mostly because of the scenes between Bogie and Lauren, a subplot either badly neglected or badly executed in the novel. All of these scenes - in Vivian's bedroom, in Marlowe's ''boudoir'', in the car, in the bar - are tremendous examples of sexual innuendo suggesting a steamy affair. (Incidentally, Chandler once paid one of the best compliments to Bogie by saying that he could be a tough guy without a gun.) On the other hand, the major plot is much more effective in the book. The no-nonsense male-to-male conversations, the relentless grimness of the characters, and the subtle shades of the story are significantly superior to anything in the movie. I understand most of Raymond Chandler's other works also include Philip Marlowe. It is probably safe to say that he has earned my future reading attention and that's just about the greatest compliment I can pay him. \\""The Big Sleep\\"" being his first novel, I am curious if he later improved on it.",2012-11-07

He first meets Carmen, the younger daughter who is a few cards short of a full deck. The General stays in his hothouse, looking like a near corpse. He tells Marlow about Rusty Regan, the older daughter's third husband, who suddenly disappeared last month. The real job is the gambling debts of Carmen. Before leaving, Marlowe meets Vivian, the spoiled and ruthless older daughter, who asks about his assignment. Chandler painted a picture of a powerful and corrupt family whose wealth far exceeds their judgment. Marlow represents the real people who must follow the whims of the ruling elite. Chandler used many words to describe the surroundings and background, more literary than Hammett or Gardner.<br /><br />Marlowe began to investigate the man who had Carmen's gambling chits. Geiger's store rents \\""rare books\\"". Marlowe followed Geiger to his house, then waited and watched. When he heard shots Marlowe broke in. Carmen was seated, nude with pin-point pupils. Geiger lay dead on the floor. Marlowe rescued Carmen and drove back in her Packard. Marlowe walked back to Geiger's house (not taxi driver with a memory for him). He found Geiger's body has disappeared! Next the Sternwood's chauffeur is found dead in a car that went into the ocean; was it murder? Marlowe shadows Geiger's store again, and learns more. The journey towards the truth continues.<br /><br />Who killed Geiger? And Taylor the chauffeur? Gathering the facts allows the solution of the puzzle. Chapter 19 tells how the newspapers covered the stories. Chapter 25 has the news on a missing couple that Marlowe isn't looking for. Marlowe drives to this small town, locates the isolated house, and finds danger (Chapter 27). Marlowe explains his actions to General Sternwood, and gets another assignment (Chapter 30). The surprise ending occurs in Chapter 31. Little hints had been sprinkled throughout the book, but a reader would not pick them up. We see what we expect to see in most cases. The final chapter has the solution to Regan's disappearance. Marlowe orders the solution to the remaining problems and leaves, trusting his advice will be taken.<br /><br />The moral of this story reminds me of \\""Love Story\\"" where someone poor falls in love with someone rich, and the poor person comes to a bad end. As Owen Taylor did. Do the rich get away with murder, literally? Do the wealthy spend their time with drink, drugs, gambling, sex, and other thrills? Would higher taxes on estates and trusts prevent this problem? Note how the super rich use the underworld to solve problems that can't be delegated to lawyers.",2012-07-07

After several of the mysteries I've read recently I got that urge. This may be the fifth or sixth time I've read The Big Sleep and once again I was not disappointed.    Chandler and his books have been credited with giving birth to a new genre of fiction - hard-boiled PI (private investigator) mysteries. Dashiell Hammett, (The Maltese Falcon & The Thin Man), is usually also mentioned in the same breath. I don't disagree with that opinion, but I think the comparison between the two authors and their stories - mysteries set during the same time period - is no more than superficial. But that's a discussion for another time.     The Big Sleep introduces Philip Marlowe, the quintessential PI - tough, smart, cynical but uncorruptable - who is hired by an ancient and ailing General Sternwood to get to the bottom of a blackmail plot targeting one of his young, spoiled, temperamental daughters. 200+ pages later at the conclusion of the book this \\""mystery\\"" isn't the point anymore, in fact it was just the tip of the iceberg. And that's the magic of Chandler's books. It's not the whodunit that keeps one reading - but rather the characters, the story, and the world that Marlowe journeys through while solving his case. The mystery is just the vehicle.    This is simply great writing which makes for great reading.",2011-07-01
