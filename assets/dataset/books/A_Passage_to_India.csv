US	41387930	R1QGS1P4IHJX7C	0156711427	842807821	A Passage to India	Books	1	3	11	N	Y	European Worship	I thought this book was pretty good until page 270. Until it dawned on me that Aziz, accused of rape, would forfeit his 20 grand because of European manipulation... Adela, who falsely accuses rape, because of a hallucination/heatwave (complete BS that she made up), starts buddying up with Fielding to get him to 'see her side of things'.<br /><br />Yes, the Brits may have pushed the trial on without her consent, but honestly it would have taken no trouble for her to sign a personally written document freeing Aziz from accuse (she was being monitored all the time however, but still, she's the stereotypical weak English woman that somehow ends up being forgiven/loved at the end; which makes absolutely no sense).<br /><br />In short, this cray bisch accuses Aziz of rape because she doesn't want to get married; she befriends Fielding to keep her money and then promptly leaves after Aziz refuses her money. Look on page 290 ~ 291: It's disgusting, literally the next paragraph after Aziz's generosity, Adela decides to leave India.<br /><br />There's also things that stick out that make one go, &#34;ookaay, that makes no sense:&#34;<br /><br />Mrs. Moore's magical ascent to being a spirit/worshipped. This old lady literally does nothing and yet she's loved by the Indians (Forster, is an Englishman mind you).<br /><br />I'm not a 100% sure about this, but the ending feels... rushed. Tacked on. There are probably a bunch of typos, but I couldn't tell.<br /><br />Fielding's a white man to the core. There are few very short interior thoughts that reveal his/Forster's true thoughts regarding the Indian.<br /><br />On a scale of a 100... 65/100 (D)<br /><br />I was hoping for a riot. I was hoping for justice. But nope, instead what you get is: Whites are right; silly Indians, your wealth is for the Empire.	2015-04-28

Forster, as it highlights tension between castes, race, and also contains a conversation on good versus evil. All topics and questions are what we  struggle to answer today. Forster presents us his thoughts in the matter through a character saying, &#34;Good and evil are different, as their names imply. But, in my own humble opinion, they are both of them aspects of my Lord. He is present in the one, absent in the other, and the difference between presence and absence is great, as great as my feeble mind can grasp.&#34; (Forster 198) A quote sending a message of mortality and that the world is bigger than what we believe it is. We are given a brief insight on each character's history but given a detailed explanation on their thoughts. Forster opens up our imaginations through comprehensive information on the setting. Intricate details draw us in due to our curiosity.<br /><br />Character progression and relations rise naturally and fears are introduced early into the book, some of those we ourselves find hard to reveal. Fears such as disappointment and truth is one of the emotions portrayed by the author. A sense of shock is a constant presence throughout the book, not just pertaining to fear but also certain aspects of characters and twists in the story surprise the reader in a way that we do not see in many books. A Passage to India is an original take on race relations and offers thoughts and ideas that have not been so watered down as I see in books I read today or I may not have read that many books yet.<br /><br />Margaret Drabble is correct in stating that “A Passage to India is one of the great books of the twentieth century and has enormous  influence. The book may have influenced the writers and speakers of today and the past, which many would not doubt. There are books that I have read that comes to mind as the author voices a group or in this situation a culture and somehow represents this race elegantly almost believing he is of that race.	2015-04-14

Forster's A Passage to India indeed gives the reader passage not only to India but also to anywhere cultures swirl around each other but never blend. Powerful imagery projects an India tourists only admire as a frieze, as one character Miss Quested observes. Her older traveling companion, Mrs. Moore, at first sees a mystic India. \\"She watched the moon, whose radiance stained with primrose the purple of the surrounding sky. In England the moon had seemed dead and alien; here she was caught in the shawl of night together with earth and all the other stars. A sudden sense of unity, of kinship with the heavenly bodies, passed into the old woman and out, like water through a tank, leaving a strange freshness behind.\\" Those Englishmen longer in the country simply tried to recreate home with their clubs, gin, English plays.  India was to be avoided. Their duty was to keep peace and profit. The characters act as symbols for the racism, prejudice, turmoil, and misinterpretation of days to come. No one seemed to really \\"know\\" India, not even those who really desire to know. We begin to wonder if we ever really \\"know\\" anywhere or anyone.	2014-08-05

I have to admit I didn't like it as well this time. The plot revolves around an Englishwoman unfairly accusing a Muslim Indian doctor of attempting to assault her while sightseeing some Indian caves. However, set in a time when the British controlled India, the book has several sub-themes. One is the condescending attitude and behavior of the Brits toward the Indian people and the consequent mistrust and dislike the Indians felt toward the Brits. Another is the vast cultural divide that made friendship almost impossible between the Indians and Brits at that time. My problem with the book is that many of the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that E.M. Forster attributed to the Indian people don't ring true to me. It feels like the author's personal attitudes about India were foisted onto the native characters. Nevertheless, it's an interesting story, lyrically told, and gives little glimpses into the Hindu and Muslim customs of old India.	2014-08-01

Virtually every character is shaded in gray as is the key incident involving Aziz and Miss Quested.<br /><br />Some of the more overtly racist and vile personnel of the British Raj lament during different points in the novel that they're essentially there for the good of the Indian population; the ends justify any and all brutal means according to their self-serving justifications.  They're bringing civilization to the backward masses, no more no less.  Which of course is a timeworn clich&eacute; ranging from Manifest Destiny in Latin America with the United States to the French in Indochina and the Dutch in Southeast Asia.  Since the European invasion swept the world over 500 years ago it has never gotten old in the minds of some.<br /><br />A nebulous ethical and moral background cloud Forster's work on almost every page.  Forster himself once remarked that even he wasn't totally sure as to what exactly occurred in the Marabar between Aziz and Miss Quested and that this deliberate use of vagueness acts as a parallel to what many aspects of India were like for the colonizing personnel.  The subject population is not immune.  At one point Aziz, the Muslim, remarks about his sometimes strained relationship with the majority Hindu population that &#34;It is useless discussing Hindus with me.  Living with them teaches me no more.  When I think I annoy them, I do not.  When I think I don't annoy them, I do.&#34;<br /><br />Fielding himself is clouded in ambiguity.  He steadfastly supports Aziz believing he’s innocent against the appalling allegations but at different times harbors stereotypical views that powerful Brits cling to regarding the natives.  Ruminating that they always do something disappointing, he then goes on to cite a single instance of pilferage and Aziz fleeing from the authorities.<br /><br />Running throughout the novel various members of the British Raj are reminded from time to time that they’re only seeing a tiny sliver of India, that only a certain segment of it has ever been opened up to them, that a portion of India will forever remain enigmatic. In this way ‘A Passage to India’ remains as a piece of literature that at its core keeps the heart of the story in a crucible of non-clarity to strengthen its theme of powerful philistines and their ultimately unsuccessful attempt at hegemony over an inscrutable land.	2014-04-08

Though it is a heavy read, it's divided into three motif-based sections which helps the reader understand about values and clashes within the struggling society. The conflicts between Aziz's own Islam religion versus Hinduism shows how India was already divided within itself before the story begins. The first and last sections, &#34;Mosque&#34; and &#34;Temple&#34; respectively, create a great representation of the contrasting faiths.<br />Aziz's culturally-accurate emotional character is perfectly outlined as the typical Indian back then. His enthusiasm to welcome his British guests regardless of the political unrest between them brings forth the plot and climax of the story in the second section &#34;Caves&#34;.<br />I really liked the heavily ambiguous climax scene. Forster makes readers think independently by not confirming what exactly happens to Adela in the caves. She blames Aziz but some may think it was just a hallucination she goes through due to a lack of emotions towards Ronny. Maybe she assumed she was being sexually harassed due to an increase of lust after the topic of love comes forth with Aziz. Maybe it was a spiritual encounter that presumably Mrs. Moore only knew about.<br /><br />Overall, a great piece of literature, and recommended to anyone if they wish to learn about a compelling time period in history!	2014-01-07

I found the book to be a quick read, even the most mundane points were extremely readable. This is due, I believe, to the manner in which Forster captures the interesting dynamics and contradictions of human relationships. Thus he does not rely upon a number of absurd and exciting occurrences that drive many novels. This is pointed at rather directly in the book itself,<br /><br />\\"Most of life is so dull that there is nothing to be said about it, and the books and talk that would describe it as interesting are obliged to exaggerate, in the hope of justifying their own existence. Inside its cocoon of work or social obligation, the human spirit slumbers for the most part, registering the distinction between pleasure and pain, but not nearly as alert as we pretend. There are periods in the most thrilling day during which nothing happens, and though we continue to exclaim 'I do enjoy myself' or 'I am horrified' we are insincere. 'As far as I feel anything, it is enjoyment, horror' - it's no more than that really, and a perfectly adjusted organism would be silent.\\"<br /><br />Not violating his own declaration, Forster weaves a tale in colonial India that is exciting and powerful without feeling artificial.	2013-03-23
US	22245838	R3GAFS8XJPKO20	0848817540	842807821	A Passage to India	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A deeply complex, densely packed, microcosmic epic of a novel	This deeply complex, densely packed, microcosmic epic of a novel is elusive and profound and in the end perhaps self-defeating. How can Forster encapsulate what he admits is indescribable? How will the reader ever understand what he says is ungraspable by the human mind?<br /><br />The story of a Passage to India is the least of its substance and is quickly told. Adela Quested arrives in India along with her prospective mother-in law Mrs Moore, to see whether a brief and lack-lustre attraction she and Mrs Moore's son Ronny felt in Grasmere might translate to marriage to him in Chandrapore, where he is the City Magistrate. But the insufferable Anglo-Indians, whose community she would have to join, the kind but unreliable Indians with whom she will never be able to strike up a meaningful relationship and India itself combine to render the prospect untenable, even if she loved Ronny. Then a mysterious experience in a cave unhinges Miss Quested, and her passage to India is at an end.<br /><br />It is more interesting to consider the aspects of the novel which both add to its complexity and provide its substance. As her name suggests, Adela is on a quest, to see `the real India', to understand it. It is a cerebral pursuit; only a matter, she thinks, of going there and looking about. The impossibility of such a task is the main thrust of Forster's novel. India is too vast, too varied, too old; a melting pot of culture and religions, a hugely diverse geography of mountains and plains and forested hillsides, a seething mass of multitudes. India cannot be `seen' by the human eye nor, it is powerfully suggested, understood by the human mind.<br /><br />Yet, while emphasising its immensity, the writer also manages to convey its minuteness. Scenes are repeatedly placed within a larger context, a man on the neatly-tended veranda of the club, the club against the sprawling city, the city against the backdrop of mountains, the mountains against the `overarching' sky, the sky itself against the incalculable firmament. This dichotomy results in `muddle' and `mystery'; India is an enigma.<br /><br />The diversity of Indian society adds to its complexity. The intricate differences between Indians of different races, castes and beliefs create a minefield, as well as the delicate mores which must be observed if social relationships between Indians and the British are to be pursued. The unfathomable Indian compulsion to tell a polite and sincere lie rather than an unpalatable truth muddies conversational waters at every turn. Add to this the ridiculous British impulse to force India into a neatly labelled box, to behave as though still in Blighty. But the gaggling chaos of the bazaar, the ramshackle, fly-blown bungalows of the populace, even the well-to-do residences of rich Indians, where guests are frequently tardy and dinner is always late, will never be regulated into the regimented rows of bungalows of the Civil Station. India is ungraspable, a live thing, many-hued, exotic and infuriating by turn.<br /><br />The failure of the British in India to appreciate these facts results in incidents which are, on one level, high comedy, on others, deeply shameful. The officious Surgeon General, the pompous Collector, the whole entourage of petty officials and their bigoted wives congregate at the Club (where no Indian is permitted unless he carries a tray of drinks) to decry India and Indians; they chafe and pontificate within their ludicrously inappropriate evening dress as India shifts and changes and defies categorisation.<br /><br />Amid this atmosphere of vastness and littleness and difference, the characters are constantly engaged in attempts to make connections. In a series of set-pieces, like formal dances, Forster tries to make meaningful links; between British and Indian, Hindu and Muslim, man and woman, man and man, but no two souls are a neat enough fit and even birds of a feather fall out in the end. No one has a wide enough vision or a big enough heart, or, if they have it one moment, it has changed into something else the next. Mrs Moore and the hapless Dr Aziz manage a fleeting spiritual accord, and the strength of it arms Aziz for the ordeal to come, but then India's immeasurable depth swallows Mrs Moore's faith, and she slips from Aziz' grasp.<br /><br />It would be easy to despair, in this mutable and somewhat nihilistic universe, where `everything exists but nothing has value' and where communication, Man's most precious resource, is reduced at last to an empty, meaningless echo. But Forster's mantra throughout the novel is a double helix of hope. As the tiny earth spins into the infinite universe, as the enormity of our own personal India engulfs us, as friends disappoint and loved ones leave, `goodwill, goodwill and more goodwill' and `kindness, kindness and more kindness' is both our bond and our blessing.g enough heart, or, if they have it one moment, it has changed into something else the next.

As the tiny earth spins into the infinite universe, as the enormity of our own personal India engulfs us, as friends disappoint and loved ones leave, `goodwill, goodwill and more goodwill' and `kindness, kindness and more kindness' is both our bond and our blessing.	2013-03-15

Forster's \\"A Passage to India\\" will always be discussed for its cultural and political aspects, one cannot help but admire the extraordinary writing. In his latest book, \\"How to Write a Sentence\\", Stanley Fish keys in on the final sentence of \\"A Passage to India\\" where Aziz and Fielding ponder the possibility of friendship and reconciliation between them and between their worlds:<br /><br />\\"But the horses didn't want it - they swerved apart; the earth didn't want it, sending up rocks through which riders must pass single file; the temples, the tank, the jail, the palace, the birds, the carrion, the Guest House, that came into view as they issued from the gap and saw Mau beneath: they didn't want it, they said in their hundred voices, 'No, not yet,' and the sky said, 'No, not there.' \\"<br /><br />I have to agree with Fish that the sentence is just remarkable--animate and inanimate objects conspire to bar the \\"connect\\", the relationship. But I would also argue that so much of the book, so many passages [NPI] merit<br />admiration. Throughout the novel, Forster exhibits the command of George Orwell and the foreboding of Joseph Conrad:<br /><br />\\"She had come to that state where the horror of the universe and its smallness are both visible at the same time--the twilight of the double vision in which so many elderly people are involved. If this world is not to our taste, well, at all events, there is Heaven, Hell, Annihilation--one or other of those large things, that huge scenic background of stars, fires, blue or black air. All heroic endeavour, and all that is known as art, assumes that there is such a background, just as all practical endeavour, when the world is to our taste, assumes that the world is all. But in the twilight of the double vision, a spiritual muddledom is set up for which no high-sounding words can be found; we can neither act nor refrain from action, we can neither ignore nor respect Infinity.\\"<br /><br />There are witty lines that pepper the novel, as well, such as \\"Adventures do occur, but not punctually\\" and \\"Life never gives us what we want at the moment that we consider appropriate.\\" This is a wonderful novel that demands our admiration and respect. It is a work that reminds of what a writer at the height of his craft can do.	2013-03-05

Mrs. Moore and her future daughter-in-law, Adela Quested, are captivated by the country on their visit and want to see more of the real India. Unfortunately, they get more than they bargained for during a planned visit to the Marabar Caves outside the city, which leads to misunderstandings and courtroom drama that changes lives forever.<br /><br />A Passage to India is E.M. Forster's most famous novel and for good reason. The book says a great deal about British attitudes toward the Indian culture and people during the 1920's. Forster portrays a love-hate relationship among key players. The difference in cultures and lack of understanding is superbly drawn, as is the barely concealed disdain between the British and locals. You can almost feel the simmering animosity threatening to erupt into a full explosion.<br /><br />The book is fairly long at 421 pages, yet I wished I'd known more about how secondary characters dealt with the aftermath of the trial. Forster barely mentions some of the characters afterward, which is a shame. Still, this is my favorite of his collection, and well worth reading.	2012-11-20

Forster sets the scene, develops the characters, creates tension (not dramatic tension; just tension), and then...<br />And then the characters realize that the tension isn't going to be easily resolved and decide that the best course of action is to abandon the effort and drift aimlessly for the last 100 pages or so towards an unsatisfying d&eacute;nouement. I was almost finished with \\"A Passage to India\\" when it dawned on me that the novel's climax was long past and I'd somehow missed it. I still was waiting for the story to begin. I eventually resigned myself to the fact that Forster's intent in \\"A Passage to India\\" is to describe a situation rather than tell a story. Yes, there is a plot of sorts, but Forster's real aim is to depict two cultures at an impasse at a particular point in history: 1) indigenous Indians chafing under British occupation in the early 20th century, yearning for independence but unable to envision a unified nation of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs; and 2) British colonists determined to maintain the status quo, and genuinely convinced that their presence in India is necessary because the natives are incapable of ruling themselves. Forster's refusal to provide the reader with a sense of resolution serves a symbolic purpose, emphasizing the impossibility of bridging the cultural divide so long as the relationship between the British and the Indians remains one of ruler-and-ruled. The novel's unconventional structure (the climactic moment takes place relatively early on; the novel's chief dramatic complication is never worked out; loose ends are not tied up) also serves a purpose, underscoring Forster's view that there are no easy answers to the complex racial and cultural issues examined in the novel. However, though these elements may be useful from a symbolic perspective, they make for frustrating reading.<br /><br />The novel's action takes place in the fictional Indian city of Chandrapore, which is under British colonial rule. There is a great deal of latent hostility floating around Chandrapore. The native Indians resent the presence of the Anglo-Indians and engage in subtle acts of rebellion against them while maintaining a surface-level politeness. There is friction between Indian Muslims and Indian Hindus, who do not understand each other. The British colonists, most of whom regard the native inhabitants as inferior beings, are deeply suspicious of the few Brits who treat the Indians with respect. Finally, there is painful awkwardness in each and every attempt at social interaction between the friendly Anglo-Indians and the natives. Courteous gestures are misinterpreted and come across as insulting or gauche. Conversation is strained, rife with blunders and cultural misunderstandings. The tension is palpable. Reading about these social failures becomes agonizing after a while and the reader begins praying for a reprieve, hoping for just one successful picnic or party or even a few moments of stress-free small talk. But the prayers go unheard. Forster is unrelenting, and there is no relief. One-third of the way through the novel, I began developing a nervous tic.<br /><br />Often in my book reviews, I complain that the author didn't spend enough time on character development. Forster certainly cannot be accused of this, particularly when it comes to his Indian characters. If anything, these characters have too many layers, too many contradictory qualities; they are too multi-dimensional to be quite believable. I got the impression that Forster was trying to embody the characteristics of an entire country in a handful of characters, to convey all of the nuances, complexity, and contradictions of India herself through them. It doesn't quite work. For example, the character of the Indian physician Dr. Aziz tells us much about Forster's view of Indian Muslims - they are emotional, touchy, mercurial, proud, fond of practical jokes, impulsive, insecure, wary of outsiders, pious, tied to their land and culture, etc. - but Aziz as a person, as an individual, is lost along the way. He becomes too diffuse to seem real. Forster achieves more success with the character of Cyril Fielding, a British man who tries to maintain a friendly relationship with the native Indians. Fielding's personality undergoes subtle and not necessarily positive changes during the course of the novel. These changes, which are connected to the novel's larger themes, are revealed in a deft, understated manner which highlights Forster's skill as a writer.<br /><br />I am glad that I read this novel. It certainly was not a waste of my time and it gave me some insight into what life was like for both Indians and the British during this particular period of British colonial rule (tense!). However, I'm a little puzzled as to why it is hailed as one of the greatest books of the twentieth century.

To what extent can British and Indian people coexist when you factor in beliefs and values? Are there biases that we form against outsiders, either internal or external? Forster undoubtedly raises important issues about colonialism, and the efforts of two sides to respect each other, and for this I can see the literary value and relevance attached to his novel.<br /><br />Still, there was something lacking about this reading experience. Part of it was the characterization. The characters were not only flat and forgettable for the most part, but also were unsympathetic and rather annoying. I know that Forster, to an extent, gave each of these characters flaws, but some of the main characters seemingly lose their heads and collective reason at the most inopportune times. Aziz is a curious one: his bitterness towards the British knows no bounds, yet his has this bizarre compulsive adoration of Mrs. Moore after only having seen her two or three times. The only one that seemed to have any sense was Fielding. Another issue was the dry writing style. The way it is written you feel so disengaged from everything that is going on. You feel distant from the experience, and hardly sympathize or care for these characters, even when Aziz is trying to uphold his name after being falsely charged. There's moments where the narrative moves at a plodding pace, especially in part one. It's only in part two that things finally get going, with the trip to the caves and subsequent trial.<br /><br />Forster is able to finish the novel strong, and there are some wonderful and poetic descriptions of the landscape, the Marabar Caves and Chandrapore, however this was still a mediocre read. As this was my first Forster book, I'm still anxious to try another one from him. In the end, I can see the literary significance of A Passage to India, but maybe it's a bit overrated.	2011-12-17

Forster gives amazingly nuanced attn to the Indian (Moslem and Hindu) characters as well as the British principals. He navigates well between male and female characters and sensibilities - a hallmark of insightful gay artists, who find themselves between 2 worlds.  The result is that the reader is able to view multiple situations, characters and attitudes, coming away with both the complexity of colonial society and the pratfalls - large and small - that its participants undergo as they try to hang on to status while seeking understanding. They also consciously MISUNDERSTAND things, with near tragic outcomes.  The final chapter has a memorable encounter with Aziz and Fielding, a Moslem \\"vs,\\" an atheist Britisher, as they jockey (they're mounted!) for position and understanding. Not a neat ending, but a satisfying one.  Dastor is brilliant in his characterizations, rivaling the guy who does the Harry Potter books, Jim Dale.	2011-11-21

This was not useful for my class when the professor wanted us to go to a particular page, which was often.  The plot of the book itself is decent: the trials (literally) and travails of intercultural exchange in colonial India circa early 1900s makes for a decent read for a schoolbook.  The dialogue was generally good, and the descriptive text evocative.  At times, though, I wanted to throw my book against the wall.  Some of the characters seemed pure caricature, annoyingly so, and I did not care for how Hindus were viewed at an authorial level.  Also, sometimes Forster seemed to be too in love with his own descriptions to scale them back from multiple rage rambles.

At the crucial encounter between  Mrs. Moore and Aziz at the mosque she tells him \\"God is Here.\\"  Part of the spiritual quality of the novel is found in the spiritual exploration of various religious points of view - from the Muslim, Hindi and Christians.  One example is between Mrs. Moore and her son, the City Magistrate.  For him religion is about keeping order, particularly important when you are in charge of \\"natives.\\"  While his mother has a deeply spiritual view of a Christian God, believing that \\"God is love.\\"<br /><br />There is also the interesting struggle for Aziz to embrace the spiritual but as a doctor not fall victim to the superstition.  For him superstition is the past and he worries that India will remain backward if it doesn't free itself from magical thinking.  Yet he doesn't embrace Christianity, the religion of the hated English who are not just the rulers of India but the exemplar of the Westernization, the form of modernism Aziz and progressives like him look to as creating a modern and even free India.<br /><br />Yes the novel grapples with colonialization and while sympathetic to the Indian cause - more than a generation before India frees itself from the British Empire - it isn't blindly sympathetic.  Aziz is not terribly sympathetic - desperate to please the English yet also rebellious and full of hatred for them.  He constantly shoots off his mouth and gets himself in trouble, particularly in his invitation to take the English ladies to the Marabar caves.  He had never been there and had no intention of following through on his invitation except that the ladies insisted on his honoring the invitation.  Hence we have the plot of the novel.  Other Indians are presented in even less flattering light.<br /><br />I like the ambiguity of the incident at the caves.  We see the events through Aziz and not Miss.Quested eyes.  And later we have to piece it together.  We never really know how she came up with the story that Aziz was to blame.  Probably Ronnie, Mrs. Moore's son and Miss.

The twists and turns of the plot are carried off with aplomb, the characterizations are sharp (I guess -- there aren't any people today like the characters in this book, for a variety of reasons), and the dialogue is well-crafted.  In the end, alas, it's a whole lot of fuss and bother about ... about what? It's never made completely clear.  The fact that Forster was gay, and had to repress it, screams from every page; one just wants to reach in there and pull him into the 21st century somehow.  It is abundantly clear that the relationship of Dr. Aziz and his friend the school superintendent is the only one about which Forster really cares -- and yet since this is after all a Victorian novel, Forster has to equip Aziz with a dead wife and a taste for Calcutta rent-a-ladys -- has to make him hetero, in other words. Everyone says, \\"This is a novel about sexual repression,\\" and that can't be disputed; however, it's not first-rank stuff, and Forster himself knew that. At times things just sort of lumber along, and the machinery is visible.  Still, if you're interested in India or planning a trip there, this is an excellent way of finding some things out about the country's history.  Forster fouls his own nest -- he hates the English -- and if that sort of thing doesn't bother you, you'll be just fine with \\"Passage to India.\\"	2011-06-16

Forster in 1924, is on many short lists of greatest novels written in the 20th century, and deservedly so.  It is a period piece, set in the British Raj of the 1920s.  It is rich in imagery and symbolism, focusing on bigotry, hypocrisy and mistrust among the various nationalities and religions present within the story.  Idealism, naivety and human nature also play parts.<br /><br />At its heart, is the friendship between the Muslim Indian professional, Dr. Aziz, and the English dowager, Mrs. Moore, who has accompanied her son's presumptive fianc&eacute;e to meet him in Chandrapore.  Aziz, Mrs. Moore and Mr. Fielding, a British schoolmaster, struggle to bridge the abyss existing between the British and native cultures.  For their troubles, they are punished, each in distinctive ways.<br /><br />Having seen the movie, an excellent flick by the way, I was intimately familiar with the tale.  The Victorian style of writing, however, really brought the story to life and breathed life into the characters.  Some may find the writing too florid or archaic for their tastes, but I found it beneficial in setting a mood for the story.<br /><br />While the driving force behind the book is the social interaction (or lack of) and the cultural divide between the British administrators and what they view as their morally and intellectually inferior native Indian subjects, a subtext is the mistrust and tension existing between the Hindu and Moslem religious communities.<br /><br />As Aziz becomes increasingly disenchanted with his British overlords, he begins to fall in with Indian nationalists.  The question of the viability of an \\"Indian\\" state, in the presence of such a politically, ethnically and religiously fragmented populace is periodically raised.  Very perceptive writing, coming as it does over twenty years prior to Indian independence, civil war and ultimately partition.	2011-01-17

The 3 stars are more for character development.  Very few of the characters, or their relationships, were believable to me.  An example:  Aziz develops a deep affection and respect for Mrs. Moore -- feelings important to the overall plot -- however, they have only met maybe 3? times.  Ok, maybe Aziz is an open-hearted man but Mrs. Moore's son also says Mrs. Moore 'loved' Aziz.  For me, it required the willing suspension of disbelief.  Miss Quested's revelation about the case was surprising and not well explained.  Convenient, it seemed.  Even Aziz's and Fielding's friendship suddenly existed without much foundation amid a great deal of misunderstanding and awkwardness.    However, the picture the book paints of colonial India and the behavior of the British was fascinating.  I felt despair on behalf of Aziz and intense frustration and dislike of the ruling British.  The book certainly transported me, despite the issues I have with it.	2010-02-16

It makes one wonder if Forster had felt used up after the subjects he tackles in \\"A Passage to India\\" or if he felt that he could do no better.<br /><br />\\"A Passage to India\\" is set at the peak of the British colonial era and is rife with the racial tension that lurks beneath every mean aspect of daily life.  It is the tale of various characters.  One of the main characters is Dr. Aziz, a Moslem Indian who desperately wants to befriend certain English people but knows he may be overstepping his bounds.  One Englishman he successfully befriends, for a while, is Mr. Fielding, the principal of the local school who seems not to have developed the racist attitudes of the other English people who dwell in Chandrapore.  It is also the tale of two visiting women - Mrs. Moore, an old Christian lady who innocently befriends Dr. Aziz by accident.  She has brought with her Adela Quested, a young woman eager to see the \\"real\\" India who finds that she will not do so if she agrees to marry Mrs. Moore's son, Ronny.  In an attempt to bridge the gap between the races, Dr. Aziz sets in motion a series of events that will have near-fatal consequences for himself as well as those he tries to befriend.<br /><br />Forster had a rare gift for storytelling that is natural and unforced.  His writing is a mix of subtle humor and astute observations about human nature, raising questions of philosophy and religion in an attempt to ponder the nature of racism that bored so deep a root in British colonial India.  What is remarkable about \\"A Passage to India\\" is that while it is set in a very concrete time and place, the themes it raises transcend time and offer some insight into present conflicts.  It is easy to see why \\"A Passage to India\\" is considered to be one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, for Forster was at his peak form in this eloquent ode to the impossibilities and the improbabilities of friendship.easy to see why \\"A Passage to India\\" is considered to be one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, for Forster was at his peak form in this eloquent ode to the impossibilities and the improbabilities of friendship.	2009-09-16

And, of course, there is the usual griping from students for whom \\" A Passage of India\\" is required reading. I can only offer this bit of perspective. Once, a few decades ago, the novel was required reading for me, too, and I recall liking it well enough to want to see the film when it came out. Then, \\"A Passage to India\\" gathered dust on my shelves for quite a while. Recently, I picked it up again, wondering how a novel published in 1924 would hold up, especially compared to some of the fine novels about India that have been published in the last decade: Mistry's \\"A Fine Balance,\\"  Adiga's \\"The White Tiger, Roy's \\"The God of Small Things, Desai's \\"The Inheritance of Loss,\\" among others.<br /><br />It held up. I enjoyed it thoroughly, probably more than the first time I read it. So if it has been a long time since you read\\" A Passage to India,\\" pick it up again. And if you're at student struggling to appreciate it, finish the novel and put it away for a few decades. You'll like it better the second time. \\"A Passage to India\\" is one of those great books that, like Conrad's \\" Heart of Darkness,\\"  is indispensable to an understanding of imperialism	2009-08-22

First of all, I should say that as I grow older I'm learning that everything I read more than five years should probably not be included in the list of books I've read. I first read A Passage to India in 1994. I know this because in my quasi obsession, through most of the nineties, to catch up on reading the important books years I had never read, I wrote the dates at which I started and finished each book on the inside cover. When I picked A Passage to India up again this summer, I was stunned to find that, except for a few hazy vaguenesses, I had forgotten the book completely. I certainly had no memory of its beauty. At the heart of A Passage to India are the issues of race, friendship, decency, and the clash of cultures in British India at the turn of the 20th century. Forster's story is polyphonic, which is to say it is told from a number of voices. His prose is beautiful enough to stop you, and the novel's larger questions are ones that continue to resonate with the world's denizens even at the turn of this century.	2008-03-06

He is a magistrate in Chandrapore, India, during the British occupation of that country.  The two ladies make the acquaintance of Dr. Aziz, a local doctor who offers them a chance to see the \\"real India\\" by visiting the Marabar caves.  Hoping to please the British ladies, he plans a wonderfully complicated and expensive journey.  However, an unfortunate misunderstanding erupts into a tragic affair that point up the cultural differences and seething anger between the two cultures.<br /><br />Was Miss Quested attacked by Dr. Aziz in the caves?  This question becomes the central issue which propels the plot and lays bare the hostility and polarizing feelings of superiority and inferiority prevalent at the time.  The reader is swept into the life of Dr. Aziz as more misunderstandings cause a permanent rift with his dearest friend and gives him a genuine hatred of the English. While the pompous Heslop contends his countrymen are in India to do justice and keep the peace, the appalling behavior on both sides explodes at a trial and lingers long after.<br /><br />Forster is adept at not taking sides, at showing both the British as well as the Indian side of the issues.  In his fair and balanced telling, the reader can alternately sympathize with Dr. Aziz or Miss Quested.  Neither wins when the truth is revealed and both are forever scarred by the incident in the Marabar caves.<br /><br />In 1984, David Lean brought this drama to the big screen and, in my opinion, actually improved on the source material by making the characters more sympathetic and capturing visually the beauty of India.  Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested atop an elephant riding to the Marabar caves is a breath-taking scene and one any viewer will long remember.	2007-12-13

He also gives the perspective of several of the British residents and guests, and through this ensemble assembles a compelling picture of how colonialism affects the colonialized, the colonializers, and the relationships between the two. Some of the ideas remind me of Paolo Freire's [[ASIN:0826412769 Pedagogy of the Oppressed]], in which he explains the dehumanizing impact of an oppressor relationship on both the oppressor and the oppressed.    The prose is beautiful, and Forster contextualizes his message with lively dialogue, beautiful images of rural India, demonstrations of the difficult relations between Hindus and Muslims, and other elements of conflict within Indian society as well as between the Indians and the British. The story isn't fast-paced, but with a little patience it draws you in. And the language is delicious. I listened to the audiobook narrated by Sam Dastor, and he does a very good job with distinctive voices and accents in a book filled with essential dialogue (except in the one paragraph when an American missionary makes an appearance; his accent was unlike that of any American I've ever met).    A reviewer for The Guardian wrote when the book was first published in 1924 to \\"congratulate him [Forster] upon the tone and temper of his new novel. To speak of its `fairness' would convey the wrong impression, because that suggests a conscious virtue. This is the involuntary fairness of the man who sees.\\" Forster's vision is well worth reading.

Their engagement sizzles out in the heat of the Indian summer.  Other major characters, Dr. Aziz and Professor Fielding, are great friends, to the point where Fielding severs relations with his separatist British friends in honor of his wrongly arrested Indian friend. But, through strange facts and circumstances, Aziz begins to hate, then detest and ultimately love him again.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest love, with no hate, is Mrs. Moore.  She loves Indians - not just India. Indians respond with a loving chant of her name - Esmiss Esmoor.  She rises to the divine. But, alas even she must demure to the almighty British imperialistic state - this is a 1924  novel when India and Britain were in a love-hate relationship of their own.<br /><br />This novel is Forster's great rebound. Thought to be a severely suffering writer-blocked novelist, he could reach no more for Italy to spur him to the typewriter (\\"A Room with a View\\" and \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\").  Unlike \\"Room\\" or \\"Angels\\", he does not deliver an ethical question to the reader as handled by British aristocracy.  The moral or ethical question here is directed to all Brits -- rich or poor, new to India or born to India -- and asks if what they do to others is devastingly harmful, let alone inappropriate.<br /><br />Divided in the three parts, the book sets you up [Part I: Mosque], slams the British [Part II: Caves] and sums it up [Part III: Temple].  To his credit, Forster's delivery of this book may have been as recklessly brave  as Fielding's protection of Dr. Aziz - the British with whom each associates would not kindly take to each's allegiance to the \\"other\\" side.<br /><br />Much akin to America's great \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", this novel deals with the classic trial of a great citizen of the oppressed who allegedly acted wrongly to one of the young white women.

US	49818928	R2TJDS7W81NVNW	B000FUO0C4	842807821	A Passage to India	Books	5	13	16	N	N	The Echoing Malabar Caves Speak Loudly and Clearly	At its core A PASSAGE TO INDIA is a darkly pessimistic view of the future between India and Great Britain. When E. M. Forster published it in 1924, England had but recently begun to divest itself not only of its overseas colonial empire but also the attendant mind set that was proving more difficult to eradicate.  Many English still believed, even if subconsciously, that Indians, in their swarthiness and what to the English seemed like their grubby living conditions in Bombay were utterly incapable of carrying on in any meaningful way without the constant assistance of Britain.  It was against this background that Forster wrote of the bitterness and harsh feelings that he saw as deeply ingrained on both sides.  Ironically, for those who view his book as a raw but honest portrayal of this mutual acrimony, Forster himself is guilty of the same underlying assumptions against which he so eloquently rails. <br /> <br />The dramatic focus begins with Dr. Aziz, an intelligent Moslem physician who sees the English as arrogance personified but is inclined to think that with a growing understanding and compassion, the walls of prejudice may be breached and India and England may co-exist in reasonable harmony. He is aided in this belief by his association with Mrs. Moore, a liberal Englishwoman, and Cyril Fielding, an equally understanding principal of the British Government College.  However, when Aziz attends a bridge party given by various English personnel, he is rudely treated and is humiliated, causing him to rethink his earlier optimism. The climax of the book occurs when Aziz invites Mrs. Moore and her friend Adela Quested to visit the mysterious Malabar Caves, where wind and echoes resound.  During their trip, Adela hears the wind and becomes disoriented. She later claims that Aziz assaulted her, a crime for which he is arrested and tried in court.  This trial becomes a national event, and when Adela recants her accusation, Aziz is freed, but he is terribly embittered, and India itself sees the accusation as yet another example of English condescension.  The novel ends with Aziz breaking all ties with his friend Fielding. <br /> <br />Early in the novel, Forster clearly states his belief that it may not be possible for English and Indians to live in harmony.  He suggests that in the early and friendly relations between Aziz and Fielding such a harmony may be realized, but as the book's events reveal, that this harmony is but an illusion, as wispy as the sounds echoing from Malabar Caves.  The friendship between the two is not strong and is based more on shared philosophical goals than personal affinities.  During the course of the bitter trial, this friendship proves incapable of supporting the strain and is finished.  The other liberal, Mrs. Moore, is conveniently spirited out of the book so she need not testify on Aziz's behalf.  When Forster closes with Aziz defiantly proclaiming that he is now staunchly in the camp of those who oppose social reconciliation, there is a tendency to overlook what undercuts what otherwise might be Forster's surface sadness at his view that matters between England and India are irreparably breached.   Forster is so relentlessly insistent in his belief that this gap is permanent that the reader begins to wonder whether Forster's reasons lie more with subliminal agreement with the \\"white man's burden\\" rather than any objective assessment of undeniable fact. Further, when he allows Mrs. Moore to so conveniently avoid helping Aziz during the trial, Forster may simply have found the path of least resistance and thus not have to worry about questioning his own underlying assumptions.  The problems, then, in identifying and confronting the issues that Forster raised in 1924 are as elusive today as were the echoes that resonated so loudly in the Marabar Caves the day Adela Quested opened that can of racial worms.    <br />	2006-08-28

Talovich (in the Spotlight Reviews as I write this) for his analysis of the archetype underpinnings of the novel.  It made me reconsider the novel as a whole and appreciate it all the more.    A Passage to India was written in 1924 and it bears similarities to some of Forster's literary contemporaries, most notably Orwell's Burmese Days and the short stories of Somerset Maugham.  Here we have India, ancient, diverse, plagued with ancient schisms, a \\"muddle\\", under the authoricratic rule of colonial Britain.  The British portrayed here conform to the rule: stuffy and prejudiced, with no love for their foreign station, maintaining a thin veneer of the Victorian role - to keep themselves \\"proper\\", warding away the dust and sweat and sweltering heat of an exoticism they can never truly understand, nor wish to incorporate.  It's all about tennis and tea-time and the Club.  As a contrast to these rigid expatriates, Forster introduces two arrivals, Mrs. Moore and Ms. Quested, initially starry-eyed and curious about the subcontinent, willing to taste the culture - if only taste, and nothing more - to satisfy the instinct for romance and adventure.  This leads them into contact with the Muslim Dr. Aziz, who promises to show them India and ends up doing so more than any of them wish; \\"that incident at the Marabar Caves\\" results in explosively exposing the dichotomy of social conduct and temperament between disparate cultures, the superiority-wound ever-festering beneath the Western mandate to civilize and the East's own long-standing hierarchy establishment.     To wit: \\"It was, in a new form, the old, old trouble that eats the heart out of every civilization: snobbery, the desire for possessions, creditable appendages; and it is to escape this rather than the lusts of the flesh that saints retreat into the Himalayas. (chapter 26 pg 235, old penguin edition)\\"    At first I was a bit puzzled by Forster's approach, but as I read on it dawned on me that the author was displaying not just the discomfort and isolation of the British, but that of Aziz as well.  As a Muslim, he is forced to inhabit three worlds: that of the dominant Hindu population, that of the snooty colonials and, deep within, that of his own faith and culture, marginalized by sheer population.  Victimized as much by his own people as by the judgment-cry of the West, he eventually chooses exile, augmented in the final section `Temple'.  The `Author's Voice' character, the atheist and open-minded Fielding, also capitulates to the home-town creed by the end of the novel, sacrificing his freedom for the reward of security, the buffer against the exile's loneliness, and his final meeting with Aziz - in which the earth itself seems to grumble that reconciliation between East and West cannot yet happen - is more powerful because of where these two characters have gone and what they have, in effect, given up due to outward pressures.    A Passage to India is widely regarded as a masterpiece of the 20th century, highlighting the internal conflicts that would, in time, lead to Indian independence, casting a caustic eye to the irrevocable differences endemic to East/West relationships whenever superstition and racism rear their ugly heads... an all too common occurrence.   Recommended.	2006-07-17

The entire book is a rollercoaster of friends and foes. The book will keep you puzzled at who really is the antagonist and protagonist of the story.  The book has many symbolic meanings within itself that deal with humanity and conflict in general. <br /> <br />My favorite character in the book was Mr. Fielding. He related to my own character in so many ways. He seemed to be one of the few who wanted to understand the Indians (Muslim and Hindu).  <br />The book is dealing with the conflict that the British and Indian people had when the British Raj was in power. Looking from both sides of the spectrum, it really exposes the prejudice one had for another. Not only is it a matter of separation in India by the Indian and British, but it also deals with another internal conflict in India with Muslims and Hindus. Truly, it was a divided India. <br /> <br />While sometimes a tedious read, \\"A Passage to India\\" plays out to be a very well-written story full of rich history, interesting characters, and very opinionated peoples. This book is highly recommended to anyone who would like to understand some very interesting customs of India. Check it out!	2006-06-27

Forster is definitely an artist, but in A Passage to India his artistry falls short of the mark.  As in all of his novels, the themes of this book are both timely and yet eternally relevant; however, the composition of the story doesn't live up to the standard he set with Howard's End.  The echoes of Forster's philsophical standards are here, but there is a sense of cynicism and hopelessness that obscures the moral value of the book.  Whereas in A Room with A View Forster managed to stamp the entire novel with a certain ideology through a few well phrased and placed passages, A Passage to India is more of a \\"muddle\\".  And while that metaphoric fog adds to the picturesque effect of the story, it makes the thematic elements more obscure and less open to the reader.   <br /> <br />This book is good, as far as the story goes, but Forster could and did do much better.	2006-06-05

With that their horses swerve apart, the path divides, rocks jut up and all the obstacles, from the sky to the town below \\"said in their hundred voices, `No, not yet,' `No not there.'\\"  Forster, like Kipling, wrote of an unbridgeable gap between East and West.<br /><br /> Cyril Fielding is an educator who as the audacity not to take the British stance that Aziz, a respected doctor, tried to violate Adela Quested in the Marabar caves.  What really happened is the book's question, and to show its complexity we visit the world of the British club, and begin to understand its expatriate members and their opinions on the locals.  We see the national challenge that the Hindus and Moslems face with each other, and are privy to what to many would be a very confusing Hindu worship ceremony.  We also hear and see the perspective of the nationals to the Britons and to their control, and see them dream and strive for some type of workable nationalism.  Written in an engaging prose and helped by solid character development, A Passage to India is the work of a gifted writer.  I discovered Forster by confusing him with C.S. Forrester, the author of The African Queen, and discovered that I was familiar with his works from the films A Room with a View and Howard's End, both adapted from his books. Forester was an insightful writer of the human condition, and I was impressed with many of his comments:<br /><br /> \\"Mrs. Moore did not take the disappointment as seriously as Miss Quested, for the reason that she was 40 years older, and had learned that life never gives us what we want at the moment that we consider appropriate.

Yet as important are the cultures, history, religions and way of life between groups of people, all expressed adroitly by Forster.

Forster liked to visit India if I recollect correctly. <br /> <br />A few years later, I watched the film, and many of the loose strands came together in my mind. Sometimes, a visual interpretation of a book helps, and it certainly did for me. But, my confusion never really went away because of the way in which the novel ended. It was left to the readers to decide what had happened to Miss Quested in the caves, and having Dr. Aziz along on the trip certainly did not help him. <br /> <br />This book might be a difficult read if the reader is not informed about India, and how the nature of the colonial rule went through some fundamental changes in the early 20th century.  <br /> <br />EM Forster writes well, and it might be worth reading because of that. Hopefully, you will not be confused like I was when I read the book. I have not had the heart to read the book again. One of these days I just might, and then maybe I shall post a revised review of the book.	2005-10-28

As an Indian, born and brought up in India, this book appeared  <br />extremely shallow to me...the Indian characters are unbelievable and their descriptions highly biased..the portrayal of Hindus especially is highly ludicrous...also the story seems to indicate the superiorty of the British people throughout; even though Forster shows the British people in a poor light, he saves the day by making a martyr of Mrs Moore and Miss Questad... <br />Forster probably never went to India, nor did he really know any  <br />Indians, his novel is India seen through the eyes of a British  <br />Colonialist who \\"thought\\" he knew everything about India and Indians.

The two women wanted to see the \\"real\\" India, during their visit, instead of the cultural institutions back at home. In the novel Ronny, Mrs. Moore son was to be married to Adela Quested. A lot took place during the visit. Miss Adela and Ronny had a slight fall out a little after the beginning of the story.  They had agreed to not get married. Shortly after they had agreed to not get married, they had gotten into a car crash, and I guess that the shock or excitement of the moment had changed their minds. Aziz, a young Muslim doctor in India, was accused of sexually assaulting the young Miss Adela Quested in the caves of Marabar. Miss Adela went back to Chandrapore in India to tell what supposedly happen in the caves.  What really went down was that in the caves Adela had finally realized that she didn't love Ronny, so she tried to bust a move on Aziz.  She messes up by in sulting Aziz by asking how many wives does he have.  Aziz had gotten up set and left Adela in that section of the cave. That's how things had gotten twisted.  Miss Adela then went to the court with that lie and had gotten Aziz arrested.  That little lie had gotten out of control because it then turns to a civil case like England vs. India.  Latter on Ronny sent his mother Mrs. Moore home to England because she knew that Adela was lieing, on the trip back to home Mrs. Moore had passed, but before she did she realizes that there is no \\"real India\\", but rather a complex multitude of different Indias. Miss Adela Quested then confessed in court, Aziz was released, Ronny left her, and Miss Adela Quested was exiled from England and was to never return.	2005-04-28

It deals with the tension between the British and the native Indians of India, as well as with the tension between the Hindus and the Muslims.  It also deals with the mystical in its portrayal of characters in search of the infinite and eternal.  The book is divided into three sections which correspond with the seasons of the Indian year - the Cold Weather, the Hot Weather and the Rains.  Each section of the book is dominated by each of the seasons.  Each section also focuses on one of the three ethnic groups found in India during this time (1920's).  They are Muslim, Anglo-Indian and Hindu.  This is a very deep book, that has to be read at least a couple of times in order for the reader to pick up all the nuances.	2005-02-06

It starts out with Mrs. Moore and Miss Adela Quested coming to India to visit Mrs. Moore's son and Miss Quested's future husband, Ronny. Both ladies are wide-eyed and want to see what the \\"real\\" India is like. They long to have conversations with real Indians and to experience the life of India without British influence. Eventually, they meet Dr. Aziz, a local Indian physician, who tells them that he will show them the \\"real\\" India. Part of Aziz's \\"real\\" India is the nearby Marabar caves. He takes them to visit the caves where something happens that changes the entire story. As a result, relationships between the British and Indians are tested. <br /> <br /> The writing style of this novel is so eloquent in describing the world of British Raj in India in the early twentieth century, that it is also able to be applied to life today. Take this quote from page 272 of the novel, \\"Truth is no truth in that exacting land unless there go with it kindness and more kindness again, unless the Word that was with God also is God. And the girl's sacrifice - so creditable according to Western notions - was rightly rejected, because, though it came from her heart, it did no include her heart.\\" This passage stuck in my mind because it reminded me that even though this story was written over eighty years ago, its core and main message could still be applied to life today. <br /> <br /> E.M. Forester, the author of A Passage to India, writes in such a way that he pulls the reader back to India under British rule in 1924. Through his speech and way of describing the interactions between the English and Indians, I felt like I was actually in 1924 watching everything taking place. Forester is a perfect example of a \\"classic author.\\" His style is so polished, yet unique that he was able to create a novel that draws the reader in and makes the reader question life and humanity in general. I was especially impressed with Forester's sarcasm and his ability to be cynical of British rule of India, even though he was British himself. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. Although, at times, I did feel that some parts just dragged on and on, I do think that I was then able to truly appreciate and learn from the lives of Aziz, his friends, and the British. In the past, I have always heard of the British Raj in India, but I never truly understood the impact of the British on India until I experienced A Passage to India. <br />	2005-01-17

None of the characters is particularly engaging, and indeed some are barely tolerable.  This is a 360 page book that reads like a 600 page book.  I'm not what you'd call a plot-junky, but this book was just too slow and too boring.  There are only three or four memorable scenes in the whole book, and only one of them possesses any dramatic tension.  I think Forster set out to make a statement about relations between colonial power and colonized people.  Certainly he accomplished that, but then again he could have done it in a page or two.  Instead he threw together a mediocre work of literature to demonstrate his point.	2004-05-14

That's where it ended--as soon as I started to read it. The book was long, and tedious, begging for more action. As I trudged through the book and finished it, I realized that its significance lies not in entertainment, but in the thought provoking questions it raises. This is its one area that totally redeemed my painful experience. <BR>  The book focuses on the racial tension during the British occupation of India in the early 1900's. The story develops emotions and feeling within its characters based on their perceptions of others through distorted racial prejudice. It raises the question: Is it possible for the natives to befriend their English occupiers?<BR>   When two women, Mrs. Moore and Adela Quested come to India, they seek to see the &quot;real&quot; India. They soon befriend Dr. Aziz, who is Indian. As Aziz shows them the country, racial tension soon creeps in. Much attention surround the Marabar Caves, and from this the central crisis arises. The fleeting romance between Adela and Mrs. Moore's son Ronny, plays an integral role in the racial accusations brought against Aziz. <BR>  Relationships prove to be the focus of the novel, and shows what prejudice does to them.

Unfortunately, Forster lacks so much imagination in creating the story it is unbelievable! Forster (...) fell in love with an Indian living in England prior to writing the book. This young man would tell Forster about India and it's culture fascinating him to the point he had to write a book about it. This is what A Passage to India is about and nothing more, the writers fascination with Indian culture during British rule.

That's a testament, though, to just how compelling E.M. Forster's novel was and is.<br />Two English ladies, one young and strong willed and the other her elderly chaperone, visit India with the intent of fully immersing themselves in Indian culture--unlike their compatriots, who segregate themselves from the Indians and relegate them to little more than a slave class. However, during a cave exploration, something inexplicable happens to both of them and they find themselves unhinged from the experience.  What follows is a sad story about the clash of two cultures that form immediate and unshakable assumptions about each other.<br />Forster has been criticized for being somewhat one-sided in his portrayal of the English-Indian conflict, painting the English as belligerent, pompous bullies and the Indians as lovable and continuously wronged. I suppose that criticism is valid to a reader looking for clinical fairness, but as Forster himself is recorded as saying, he was sick of fairness at the time he wrote this novel and composed his story instead from the heart. I can completely understand this sentiment.  In any conflict, when one side is so decidedly dominant and thus has all the advantages, fairness seems like an almost irrelevant concept.  What Forster has done here is fashioned a compelling story populated by perhaps some of the most psychologically complex characters ever put to the page.<br />Which is both good and bad.  On the one hand, fully trying to understand the inner workings of these characters' minds makes for a very interactive reading session.  On the other, Forster makes his characters almost TOO realistically complex, so that I feel that I can't fully understand any of them.  Whether intentional on Forster's part or not, this pretty much works overall for the novel, sinceit is about people who can't fully understand one another.  But I would be lying if I didn't say that it also makes the novel at times somewhat frustrating, and ever so slightly dry.<br />Don't let this criticism overshadow the praise I have for this novel, however.  It's a towering achievement of 20th Century literature and deserves the esteem it has won from the literary community.	2004-02-18

Secondly, all types of foreign vocabulary was introduced to me, and lastly--Forsters whole way of writing was just too complex. Then to add to all this, the story was not interesting at all. Who (but boring people, of course) cares about those boring people anyway. Maybe I didn't like the book because it was so difficult and I was not grasping the deeper meaning behind it.

A classic that kids shouldn't be assigned to read in 10th grade, as I was. I truly hated this book, didn't understand it at all, at all. The symbolism, the racism, the class system, the whole period of the British raj - it all went right over my head. Then, to discover it in adulthood! Well, it was an awakening. It was as if I'd never read it before, and indeed on most levels, I hadn't. What really happened in the Marabar Caves? Was it an assault? A dream or hallucination? An actual rape? Nothing? A case of mistaken identity? This mystery, unanswered at the end, lies at the heart of A Passage to India. We have Muslims, Hindus, and the British Christians mixing within the society. Dr. Aziz is a good and gentle man, a friendly, open-minded, highly educated Indian who is eventually accused of assaulting a British women - and that sort of thing doesn't go over well with the high-mucky-mucky of the era. According to the political sensitivities of the era (1920s), there's always bound to be trouble when you mix the races within society.<BR>Passage to India presents British colonialism at its worst with a marvelous and deeply-layered cast of characters.

But how does one go about it?  What can you learn of place from the geographic features or urban landmarks and settings?  What can you learn from talking with the locals?  Can you ever really understand them?  <br />These are some of the questions that Forster uses to shape the message of his novel. Some of the English in \\"A Passage to India\\" seem to feel that they can get a feel for India by physically experiencing some of the geography.  Others believe that it is possble by meeting and talking with the Indians.  Yet either approach is stymied one way or another - India is vast in its geography, cultures, languages and religions.  \\"A Passage to India\\" asks readers what are the barriers to and limitations of to comprehension and even friendship between peoples in an environment of unequality  under colonialism and diverse cultures?<br />\\"A Passage to India\\" is Forster's parable of race and identity and the locale of India, as a crossroads of cultures, provides a remarkable apt setting for getting his points across. The plot is slim but detailed, the timeframe in which the events occur is specific, making the pace of the novel relatively easy to follow,read and analyze.  There are a handul of characters in the novel, which allows Forster to more fully develop them.  In their dialogue many of the themes that Forster explores and points of view that he relates - the colonial English and their Indian subjects - come out in complex, rich detail.<br />Moreover, since the novel is set in India on the verge of its independence, other questions present additional complexities. How do countries with various, strong ethnic and cultural identifies form a single nation? This theme emerges as Forster delves into dialogues between the indigenous characters who all share superstitions, fears and misgivings about one another based on ethnicity, culture and religion but above all share a strong, common loathing of the British. Is a distrust and dislike for \\"the other,\\" the \\"outsider\\" strong enough to build a national identity? Read \\"A Passage to India\\" and think through this question and others.  These questions are relevant to today's societies as they were to the India Question in Forster's age.	2003-02-18

Forster, in my mind, seemed to suggest implausible romance, pretty scenery, and Helena Bonham Carter, and I'd never actually bothered to read one of his books.<BR> Now I can hardly wait to read another.  I absolutely loved this book, without quite knowing why it was so magical.  I do know that I found the first chapter absolutely perfect, as it allows the reader to go into a &quot;descriptive section&quot; daze, and then jerks are attention suddenly back to the Marabar caves.  And with the exception of one or two patches that dragged a little but were soon over, I found the rest of the book equally magnetic. <BR> I enjoyed Fortster's deftness in portraying all the characters, not so much as individuals, but in terms of how they felt about each other.  In particular I loved the relationship between Fielding and Aziz, while understanding completely the dislike each had for aspects of the others character.<BR>The ending is marvelous.  So often books that hold your interest like this just peter out, but it's refreshing to find an author like Forster who understands that what makes for an ideal conclusion is to give the readers a taste of what they want, and then hold back the last little bit.	2003-02-14

Forster was written in 1924 but could have been written today, for its complexity of viewpoint on the issues of empire, race, cultural divides, and the possibility or impossibility of friendship under those conditions. I found Forster's viewpoint quite modern--there are no good guys or bad guys in this book, just human beings, some hopelessly blind to anything that doesn't fit with their world view, some bumbling along in an effort to break the stereotypes, some honest, some not. <br />Two Englishwomen arrive in India and resolve to experience it without the prejudices their compatriots exhibit. The picture Forster paints of the relationship between the English and the Indians, and how the English change once they arrive, is quite compelling. The English are masters of the subtle put-down, avoidance of eye contact, keeping staff waiting. They smile indulgently at the ladies' desire to meet real Indians and experience the country, knowing they will change quickly. A trip to the Marabar caves turns into a disaster, quite predictable, with everyone accusing Aziz, their escort, of assaulting Miss Questead. No one knows what really happened. <br />Miss Questead changes her story at trial and Aziz goes free. But no one knows how to handle this unexpected turn of events. One would think things would go back to status quo. But the trial has unearthed all the conflicting feelings the races have for each other--the English are convinced of Aziz' guilt based solely on the fact that he's Indian, the Indians are confirmed in their view that the English cannot be trusted. Miss Questead is ostracized for telling the truth, the Indians break off    their small attempts to form friendships with their occupiers. Aziz retreats from all contact with the English and irrationally suspects his only English friend of betrayal. <br />In the end both sides retreat, but ominous signs of a profound conflict to come are all around them. Knowing the history, we see that theeventual ouster of the English is inevitable--what is amazing is that Forster saw it more than 20 years before it happened.	2002-12-08

Forster didn't like people? <br />That's certainly the feeling I got while reading this book. It's not that it's a bad book, per se, it's just that, well...you kind of get the feeling that Forster doesn't really care about his characters. Instead of pulling you in and making the characters come alive so that they are real to you, and familiar, and friendly, Forster tells his story as if he were a zookeeper describing to you the behavior of the bonobos. There is an unbreachable glass wall between the reader and the characters that makes it hard to connect with or relate to the story. To make matters worse, Zookeeper Forster only seems to describe the bad behavior of the bonobos. He dwells continuously on the bad traits of his characters. He seems to think nothing of ruthlessly pointing out their faults and foibles, and dwelling on them incessantly. He completely humiliates the characters in the eyes of the readers, thus making even the \\"nice\\" characters, such as Dr. Aziz and Mrs. Moore hard to like. The moment you do begin to like any of the characters, Forster immediately returns to his critical mode, and once again exposes and harps on the faults of the characters, driving you quickly back to your former \\"who cares what happens to Adela Quested?\\" feelings. All this combines to result in a cooling of the reader's interest...at least it did in my case. While the story is interesting, and not completely dull, it is hard to get really caught up in a story where you don't care about any of the characters. While I have read worse books, I have also read books that are much better, with more likeable and realistic characters, and more gripping plots. However, this book is a classic, and provides an excellent and compelling look at race relations in 1920s India, and so I would reccommend it for those reasons. But, on the other hand, you can get a better written and more enjoyable read with essentially the same plot by reading \\"To KillA Mockingbird.\\" You'll like the characters better too.	2002-09-27
US	49396726	R17ZW5IJXV7YGN	0156711427	842807821	A Passage to India	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Great memorial to British India	With all due respect to Rudyard Kipling, E.M. Forster's \\"A Passage to India\\" seems likely to remain the definitive novel about British Imperialist India written by an Englishman.  It does not merely see India as a picturesque land in which to set an exotic adventure, but examines the complicated relationships between the British and the Indians with penetrating wisdom, astuteness, and fairness.  Forster is not shy about portraying the British attitude towards the Indians as one of bigotry and condescension, but he also notes the considerable cultural and religious conflicts between the Muslims and the Hindus.   <br />Most of the action takes place in a city called Chandrapore and concerns the friendship between a British school principal named Cyril Fielding and a Muslim physician named Dr. Aziz.  The novel's events are set in motion in an empty mosque, where a praying Aziz meets an elderly Englishwoman named Mrs. Moore.  After some friendly conversation, they take a liking to each other, and Aziz learns that Mrs. Moore's son is a man he knows well -- Ronny Heaslop, the Magistrate of Chandrapore.  Later, having tea at Fielding's house, Aziz meets Mrs. Moore again and her companion, a young lady named Adela Quested, who is vaguely affianced to Ronny.  Eager to see the \\"real\\" India, Adela enthusiastically accepts Aziz's offer to go on a picnic to the Marabar caves, a nearby tourist attraction, and Mrs. Moore is convinced to accompany them.<br />Forster lavishly describes the journey to the caves -- by train and then elephant -- and the caves themselves, each of which apparently is shaped somewhat like a frying pan, with a short corridor ending in a circular chamber.  The outing proves to be much more eventful than the three spelunkers expected.  Mrs. Moore, haunted by the eerie echos the caves propagate, crosses the threshold of insanity.  And upon their return to Chandrapore, Adela claims that she was sexually assaulted in one of the caves and accuses Aziz, who is consequently arrested and tried for the crime.  <br />Of course, there are a few different explanations for what really happened to Adela in the caves, but the British are prejudicially biased against Aziz.  This puts Fielding in a quandary, as his defense of his good friend Aziz infuriates his British compatriots and gets him kicked out of his club.  When Adela later admits that she can't confirm Aziz's guilt, Ronny acknowledges that a retraction of the charges would embarrass the British; he even hustles his mother out of India because, as a witness, her increasing incoherence would damage the case for the prosecution.   <br />Although the cave incident and the subsequent trial drive the plot, the novel is more about the clash of three headstrong societies (Muslim, Hindu, and Christian) forced to dwell together amidst political turmoil, and how certain members of these societies manage to reconcile themselves to each other's differences.  The final scene between Fielding and Aziz, in which Aziz uncannily predicts an independent Indian nation resulting from British dissolution, is a poignant display of this theme; for all the trouble and conflict in the world, there is always room for friendship and understanding.	2002-08-21

It is the story of Aziz, an Indian, and Fielding, an Englishman, and the friendship between the two men that develops in the wilderness of India. \\"A Passage to India\\" is shot through with issues of power politics, class, gender, religion, and even truth itself; Forester takes on quite a lot in this book and handles it quite well.<br />Perhaps the most striking feature of \\"A Passage to India\\" is how well it has aged through the years since it was first published in 1924. In describing the Indian people, Forester touches on two issues in India which continue to this very day: unity and religion. Considerable time is spent on describing the Indian people and the challenges they faced in unifying such a large and diverse population, challenges which continue to exist to this day. Even more pertinent, Forester describes the mutual animosity between India's Hindus and Muslims, their mistrust toward and misunderstanding of each other, and the resultant difficulties.<br />Of course, at the heart of Forester's book is India and her conquerors, the English. Aziz and Fielding's friendship plays out like a microcosm of this relationship and through it Forester explores the potential for reconciliation between the two civilizations. Several aspects of colonial life, from the degradation of the natives, to the mystery of \\"the Orient\\", to the inexplicable metamorphosis that is worked on Anglo expatriates, is brought to life and analyzed in clear, sometimes poetic language. For his own part, Forester seems intent on Indian independence, yet cautions that the Indians of which he writes may not yet be ready to assert their independence.<br />The dichotomy between the isolated, existentialist Europe which tramples upon the organic, wholeness of India is also examined. Europe is presented as technologically accomplished and all-powerful, yet lacking the love of life that the Indians take for granted. Forester asserts that in Europe it is always work or rest, and that only in the East is the meaning of leisure understood. Forester further presents us with a view of a society which is slowly being transformed from community to isolation: Aziz cautions Fielding that every third servant is an informant, while the natives and expatriates alike are aware of the rigid class system that is slowly solidifying, and the attendant politics and rules that come with it. Although Forester is aware that class issues existed in India long before the arrival of the Europeans, he also understands that something peculiarly Eastern is being destroyed along with the Indian way of life.<br />Forester's book is one which captures the best of both worlds. It brings together a very human story of friendship which will appeal to the emotions and hearts of anyone who has ever built a friendship. Yet it also presents a beautiful portrait of a colonized people and their colonizer, appealing to the intellect of anyone who wonders what it was like back then, or even what it is like now in subjugated nations. If you like fiction at all you should read this book.	2002-07-10

It is my favorite classic that I have read yet. It is a story of racial tensions in the steaming, exotic land of Chandrapore, India, where the British have a Cantonment with clubs, and the natives have villages with muddy roads and mosquitoes, and are expected to submit to the will of their dominators. Yet in the early 1900's, at the time Gandhi was still in South Africa, after two centuries of British rule, the native people, Hindus and Muslims alike, are growing tired.<br />When Adela, a young woman engaged to a British magistrate, and Mrs. Moore, the magistrate's mother, come to India to plan for the wedding, they are hopelessly enthralled and terribly naive. When Dr. Aziz, a young Muslim physician, meets Mrs. Moore in a mosque, he is charmed by her reverence in that she took off her shoes upon entrance. From here, a great friendship is formed. Adela, too, desires to befriend the natives, yet her efforts are regarded with contempt by both British and Indians, as both sides know and agree that it is impossible to be friends with both natives and Europeans. Only one has suceeded in that account, and his name is professor Fielding, known as Cyril by his students. A single, eccentric college professor, Fielding teaches Hindu and Muslim university students, while still mingling with British socialites. When he meets Adela, he too, scorns her aspirations. Thus, he also warns his Muslim friend, Dr. Aziz, not to bring her to the Marabar Caves.<br />It was supposed to be a very simple excursion to one of the most beautiful sites in local India. Aziz had not really meant it about taking Adela and Mrs. Moore there--had thrown it out as a casual suggestion--but being British, Adela and Mrs. Moore take him at his word. The trip turns to disaster, though, when a mysterious figure tries to rape Adela in one of the caves. Since no one has seen the attacker and no one can account for Aziz's whereabouts, he is soon blamed. In a climax that is chilling yet realistic, A Passage To India shows us what the best and worst of human nature and human prejudice can lead us to.	2002-07-10

Quested and Mrs. Moore who take a trip to India in order to have Miss. Quested married to Mrs. Moore's son.  When they get their Mrs. Moore meets a local doctor named Aziz, and the two strike up a friendship.  Their friendship however is criticized by the British in the area but they arrange to have a picnic in the caves near by.  In the caves Miss. Quested is seemingly assaulted and we see the full brunt of racialist thought in India.  <BR>    <BR>As entertainment, this novel was decent.  I wasn't compelled or bored, it was simply ok.  As a satire however it was fairly weak.  I found it unconvincing and a weak portrayal of an important subject.  The crime against Miss. Quested was ridiculious and it's hard to believe someone would be that hysterical.  <br />Technically I found the novel to be decent.  I wasn't blown away by Forsters writing even though he wrote it in obvious poetic undertones.  Overall I wasn't greatly impressed with this novel and I wouldn't call it a classic or any sort of statement about racism.  Read some Richard Wright or To Kill a Mockingbird for insight into racialist thought.	2002-07-03

The plot concerns the arrival in Chandrapore, India of Ms. Quested and her potential mother-in-law, Mrs. Moore.  They come to visit Mrs. Moore's son, Ronny, who is engaged to Ms. Quested.  Ms. Quested and Mrs. Moore are the typical new arrivals, and they desire to see more of the \\"real\\" India than they can see with their fellow Brits, who tend to gather in the state Club and socialize only with each other.  They become involved with Dr. Aziz, a local Indian physician, who promises to show them the famous, nearby Marabar caves.  Dr. Aziz is solicitous toward the Brits and craves their friendship, but he clearly has negative feelings toward them also.<br /><br />At the Marabar caves, an incident occurs (or does not occur) to Ms. Quested that alters all of the characters and their town inextricably.  There is a trial and a bit of a mystery, but the focus is always on the characters and their conflicts.  In particular, the tension between the English and the people of India is beautifully portrayed.  The characters are multi-dimensional, as are their motives, which makes for a fascinating read.  I found the book to be quite moving and sad - a true classic.	2002-06-21

In the book, all the primary characters communicate with one another in English but miscomprehension abounds; there is a disconnect.  The disconnect is both vertical and horizontal: a disconnect between the English and the Indians but also one among the English and among the Indians.  And, here, there, moments of reaching out to the other interrupt the prevailing tension.<br />This is the first Forster book that I've read completely.  I have seen all the movie adaptations of his books (except A Pssage To India) and have enjoyed them thoroughly.  But an attempt at reading A Room With A View wasn't at all successful (stopped twice at chapter 3) and I gave up (perhaps a little too hastily) reading any of the books themselves.  Recently however, I have become intrigued with Indian authors and books about India and suddenly, A Passage to India popped into my mind and I picked up a copy.  Forster's prose reminds me of F. Scott Fitzgerald's  in its<BR>nuanced simplicity although the former can at times become somewhat abstract.   Forster conveys the complexity of colonial India but the read was spectacularly easy, aided by many humorous points.   Halfway through the book, I was so impressed by the book and wondered if it had made it onto the Modern Library's best 100 works of fiction in the 20th century.  And it did.	2002-04-04

Forster's 320-page novel probes the intimate workings of the human heart and mind, especially when brought into the stark, Victorian contrast of cross-cultural prejudice.  Set in India during the Raj (British imperialsim at its height and worst), the story reveals how Anglos strive to maintain a proper distance from the natives they felt destined to rule. The frustrated Indians--themselves fragmented by religion and caste--struggle in various ways to be accepted as fully-accredited persons by the dominant race, who dismiss them categorically as &quot;niggers.&quot;  Each sub-society seeks to perpetuate its social survival, for self-image is precious to all members of humanity.  Still the Anglo community has a long memory of perceived disloyalty, while that of Indians is even longer.  Despite decades of uneasy coexistence between the Masters and the Conquered, sparks of rebellion quickly ignite when fanned by the flames of confusion, false accusation, racial bigotry and social polarization.  <br />  The two naive Englishwomen who have booked passage to India should have read a manual on social survival skills; it simply will not Do to upset the proven status quo--however it seems tipped in the favor of Western power. The herd instinct must prevail or all is lost; woe to those Anglos who defy experience and tradition in dealing with treacherous, scheming, unreliable or childlike natives.  Whom to trust and whom to defend--whom to choose as a loyal ally, a friend or even a life's partner?  How can one make these critical decisions in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion, <BR>cultural snobbery and religious extremism? <br /> The normally straightforward British lifestyle is suddenly complicated in a myriad ways as soon as one is transported to the steaming sub- continent.  What is it about India which brings out the worst or hidden weakness of the British?  Is it safe, wise or even possible for natives to seek lasting relationships with Anglos?<BR>Will it ever be an equal partnershp? Can the East truly accept and peacefully coexist with the West and vice-versa?  This is a novel of deep instrospection, as readers are forced to analyze the devastating ripples of human error and frailty.  Despite many instances of captivating dialogue and fast-paced events, PASSAGE TO INDIA remains a classic psychological novel.	2002-02-23

Beautifully written and interesting, it portrays a very believable world of people who quite probably no longer exist.  Everything is visualized, from the tedious monotiny of the 'proper British sort' of the early 20th Century to the haunting menace and lingering sense of doubt that such a shallow and repressed existence must struggle with.  Add to that the mysterious and incomprhensible alien nature of a foreign society the lead characters never imagined and the force of the book can take on a fascinating sociological spin.<br />Of what I've read, this is my favorite book by Forester, an author whom I regard as a pretty and absorbing writer of generally dull moments.  This book simply succeeds in keeping the reader rivited on numbness in the face of catastrophe more consistantly than Howard's End or A Room With A View.	2002-01-14

I was excited about reading it; everyone says it's good and I think India is interesting. However, having read the book thoroughly, even the confusing first half, I am not sure what the focus was supposed to be. Other reviewers said it was a look at the culture of India, my English teacher said it was a portrayal of different kinds of people, some people say it's the mystery of the trial concerned with racism and prejudice... I am not sure what I am supposed to be left feeling at the end of the book.<br />This was not a &quot;bad&quot; book - I am glad I read it and I would recommend it to others. It doesn't have an exciting plot or particularly likeable characters, but Forster has good insight into society and what makes people make and break friendships. I was left feeling confused on almost every level from this book, but in some ways it was an eye-opener. It should not be read to learn about India, since Forster seems to mention customs and interesting places offhandly and as a matter of course; it should neither be read as an investigation into what makes people tick. If you want to save yourself confusion, don't read it at all. <br />However, I liked the book because it was puzzling. I had to really think to figure out why there were such problems between Aziz and his English friend Fielding. I finished this book last night, and it has helped me understand something, though I can't yet put my finger on what.	2001-11-29

The litmus test of this problem is identified by how even friendly people assume the worst about others, rather than keeping an open mind or assuming the best.<br />The book is less successful at providing a model of how to overcome those weaknesses.  Mrs. Moore, a visiting Englishwoman, in the book successfully establishes a friendship with Dr. Aziz, a Muslim physician in Chandrapore, India.  The connection is deeply embedded in her sincere interest in all other people and their feelings.  She arrives in the book with that empathy, and only one of her sons also seems to have the same fineness of emotional connection.  Another son clearly doesn't.  So, it's a rare trait, even in families.  There is no evidence of how to create that attitude which leads to such rapid and firm trust.<br />More typical is the friendship between Dr. Aziz and Cyril Fielding.  Both are committed to each other, but are quick to suspect each other's motives.  A continuing effort allows them to reconcile.  One has to suppose that their relationship is the model that E.M. Forester had in mind for most of us.  We can connect with others we respect and like, and with hard work can overcome miscommunications and suspicion.<br />Dr. Aziz is portrayed in a very thoughtful way.  He wants to have friends across the cultural divide, and makes enormous efforts in that respect.  However, his intentions often have unintended consequences.  He bears up and moves forward.  I was impressed from this character about the need to have many people who seek friendship in order to make connections possible.<br />The plot builds around the arrival of Mrs. Moore, the mother of a local English magistrate, with Miss Adela Quested, who is considering whether to marry Mrs. Moore's magistrate son.  Like many newcomers to colonial India, they are interested in meeting native people and seeing the local sites.  In attempting to respond to their interests, the various connections take place.  Both are initially appalled by the attitude of those English people who have long lived in India towards the Hindus and Muslims there.<br />The book raises important questions at several levels, such as:<br />(1)  Can people with very different religious beliefs live in peace with one another?<br />(2)  Can colonialism ever be anything other than bad for all involved?<br />(3)  How should one adapt to the local community in which one lives, if it is different from one's own background?<br />(4)  What should people be willing to do to help one another?<br />(5)  What should people not do to help one another?<br />(6)  How can mistrust be dispelled?<br />(7)  How does racism harm the person who is a racist?<br />A  major drawback of the book is that many of the characters are usually unappealing.  Even Mrs. Moore, who serves as the ideal in many ways, retreats into self-centered inaction as her health fails.  Miss Quested repays Dr. Aziz's hospitality with putting his life and finances in great peril.  Cyril Fielding seems to often do too little to bridge the cultural gaps.  Dr. Aziz often comes across as a toady.  The other English people have severe drawbacks.  The characters are often surmounted by their agendas.<br />One aspect of the book that I liked was the way it showed how those accused of crimes bring out the fundamental social flaws of the community.  This happens in fiction in Gone with the Wind in the sequence where Scarlett has some problems driving her carriage, and her complaints lead the white men to attack the African-Americans who live in the area where her problem occurred.  In France, the trial of the Jewish Captain Dreyfus created a similar split in the community and rise in racist feelings and actions.<br />The story also seems a little dated, so that the characters seem too extreme to us today to be credible.  They more often seem to be caricatures than characters.<br />After you read this story, think about whom you ignore.  Why do you do that?  What effect does it have on those you ignore?

The importance of this cross cultural novel is as relevant today as it was when first published in the 1920's.

He describes an incident concerning an English school teacher, a local Muslim doctor, and two English woman.  He tries, and the keyword here is &quot;tries&quot;, to show the racial and cultural tensions between the English rulers and the Indian locals.  <br />The way the people are presented in this book is a joke.  The main character, Aziz, is laughable.  He's unbelievably subservient.  Also, the portrayal of Hindus is almost clownlike, and the English are presented as extreme snobs.  Forester's India should not be taken as a true representation of India at all.<br />The first half is barely readable.  The language is not too fluid, and the action is slow.  One of my main gripes is that Forester interludes a lot dialog without referring to who is speaking.  It's quite disconcerting.  The second half is much better.  It concentrates on a trial, and the aftermath on friendship.  I was able to read this half in one sitting.<br />The story itself is enjoyable.  The aspects of justice, prejudice and friendship penetrates this novels story in every way.  If this book was about some anonymous countrymen in an anonymous country, this would be well worth the price.<br />I recommend this book, but as a story, and not as a cultural portrayal.	2001-09-19

Forster writes about the ruling British and their tentative relationship with India in the early part of the 20th Century.  While Kipling wrote of an India of intrigue and adventure, Forster's India is one of mistrust and racism between the British and the natives.<br />The main charcter is a Moslem Indian, Dr. Aziz,who is abused by his British superior and learns to mistrust all British. Aziz meets Mrs. Moore , a new arrival, by chance at a mosque. After first ridiculing her, Aziz develops a deep respect for Mrs. Moore who he believes possesses more Oriental qualities than European qualities. Through Mrs. Moore, Aziz develops a frienship with Fielding, an educator, very interested in discovering what India is all about.  <br />Mrs. Moore's is accompanied to India by her future daughter-in-law, Adela Quested. Although extremely naive, Adela has the same inquisitiveness as does Fielding. Aziz desperately wants to impress his new British friends and he invites Adela, Mrs. Moore, and Fielding to be his guest as he shows them the Marbar caves, a local landmark.<br />On the fateful day all parties realize that the tour is not a good idea but each is reluctant to cancel the event. The mystery of what occurred within the caves and the aftermath is the crux of the story.<br />The incident at the cave does irrevocable harm to each of the main characters but particularly Mrs. Moore whose spirit totally disintegrates and Adeala who is rediculed and villified by the British. <br />Finally at the end, Aziz and Fielding repair their friendship as best they can, each realizing that Indians and Brits will enjoy a suspicious friendship at best.	2001-07-23

The book was based off of the author's own experiences in India. Forster is able to tell the tale of an attempted friendship between a an Englishman and an Indian.   The Englishman (Fielding) and the Indian (Aziz) are constantly stuck with having problems trusting one another making the friendship a very difficult one to have.  The book shows us about the interactions between different cultures and it gives us a greater understanding of human feelings and emotions.      Forster is able to tell the reader a lot about India through this book.  The novel takes place primarily in Chandrapore. The main character of the novel is Aziz.  He is a Muslim doctor and a widow.  Aziz meets Mrs. Moore, (a British woman), at at a local Islamic temple.  Mrs. Moore is visiting her son, who is the City Magistrate. They find that they have much in common.  Aziz brings Mrs. Moore to find her friend Adela.  Mrs. Moore and Adela go to a bridge party.  For Adela and Mrs. Moore, the party is a failure because only a few of the English guests behave kindly towards the Indians. One of these guests is Fielding, who suggests that Adela meet Aziz. Mrs. Moore scolds her son because he is impolite to the Indians, but Ronny feels that he is not there to be kind because there are more important things to do.  Mrs Moore is offended by this.      Aziz has tea with Fielding, Adela, Mrs. Moore and Professor Narayan Godbole. During tea they discuss the Marabar Caves.  Aziz plans a picnic at the Marabar Caves for Miss Quested and Mrs. Moore. Adela tells Ronny that she will not marry him, but he nevertheless suggests that they take a car trip to see Chandrapore. During the trip, Adela speaks to Ronny, and tells him that she was foolish to say that they should not be married.      Both Aziz and Godbole fall sick after the party at Mr. Fielding's home, so Fielding visits Aziz and they discuss the state of politics in India. Aziz shows Fielding a picture of his wife, a significant event considering his Islamic background and an important demonstration of their friendship.  Again, we see the friendship developing between Fielding and Aziz, despite the forces that are against them at the time.  They are able to develop this friendship even though there are large differences in their cultures.      Aziz plans an expedition to the Marabar Caves.  During the day when they are to leave, a friend of Aziz's, bribes Adela's servant not to go on the expedition because he is a spy for Ronny. Although Aziz, Adela and Mrs. Moore arrive to the train station on time, Fielding and Godbole miss the train.  Adela and Aziz discuss Adela's marriage, and she fears she will become narrow-minded. When they reach the caves, an echo in one of them frightens Mrs. Moore, who decides she must leave immediately. The echo terrifies her.      Aziz and Adela continue to explore the caves, and Adela realizes that she does not love Ronny. However, she does not think that this is reason enough to break off her engagement.  When the group returns to Chandrapore, Aziz is arrested for assaulting Adela.      Fielding speaks about this charge, and says that Aziz is innocent. The Collector feels that this is true because disaster always happens when the English and Indians interact socially. Fielding requests that he see Adela, but he is denied this request. Aziz hires a Hindu as his lawyer who is notoriously anti-British. Godbole leaves Chandrapore to start a high school in Central India.      The Anglo-Indians are on Adela's side and call a meeting to discuss the trial. Fielding attends, and makes the mistake of actually referring to her by name. The Collector advises all to behave cautiously.  Adela wishes to see Mrs. Moore, who kept away. Ronny tells her that Fielding wrote her a letter to her pleading Aziz's case. Adela admits to Ronny that she has made a mistake and that Aziz is innocent.  Mrs. Moore wishes to leave India, and Ronny agrees, for she is doing no one any good by remaining. Lady Mellanby, the wife of the Lieutenant-Governor, secures Mrs. Moore quick passage out of India.      Adela admits that she made a mistake about Aziz.  The judge releases Aziz.  Adela is asked why she made this charge, but she cannot answer. Adela seems to believe that she had a hallucination because she thinks she hallucinated getting a marriage proposal when there was none.      Fielding asks Aziz not to sue Adela, for it will show that he is a gentleman, but Aziz claims that he is fully anti-British now. Fielding reminds Aziz what a momentous sacrifice Adela.  Adela decides to leave India and not marry Ronny.  Fielding gains new respect for Adela.  Adela leaves India.  Aziz thinks that Fielding and Adela had an affair and the friendship between Aziz and Fielding hits a rough spot. Forster presents us with the setting of the town of Mau.  Fielding visits Mau after he gets married. Aziz believes he married Adela. Fielding married Mrs. Moore's daughter.  They resolve their dispute, but they realize that because of their different cultures they cannot remain friends and leave each other cordially.     There is a question about what happened in the Marabar caves when Adela and Aziz are together.  Forster shows that it is not really an issue because it outcomes of what did or didn't happen that are important. The trip to the caves made the emotions that the characters had even stronger.  The proceding events following the trip to the cave are direct outcomes of this trip.       This book deals with the relations between the English and the native population of India during the colonial period in which Britain ruled India. The idea of friendship between the English and Indians was radical at Forster's time.  Forster is able to show just how radical this is by presenting the reader with the reactions of both the Indians and the English to the friendship between Fielding and Aziz. He does not pretend to understand India.  He believes that it is a 'muddle', which is a theme here, just as it is in Forster's A Room with A View.  With this book, however; Forster is able to bring some aspects of India to life to give us a greater understanding of the differences in culture.	2001-05-04

If you do not understand Hindi, then you may have learn a few words, but there aren't too many.  I do not think that the novel has a straight-forward moral that says, &quot;The English are bad.  Good bye.&quot;  Instead, the novel shows the ambiguity of human life and the fact that there is no column in which you can put all of the good guys and another in which you put all of the bad guys.  The characters in this novel are complex and show different weaknesses.  The book offers excellent insight into the world of colonial India and the many different social strata that existed.<br />This book is best read in long sections - don't read a few pages or one chapter at a time.  I hope you enjoy it.	2001-04-22

This was one of those books with which I could tell after a half hour that I would love it forever.  It is hard not to sympathize with the characters.  This is a story of humanity constrained by artificial barriers; of love, friendship, spirituality, truth, and the problems they face from hatred, jealousy, deception, and pride.  Forster is clearly a close observer of numan nature and his words resonate with our own lives and thoughts.  The caves made me think as much as anything I have encountered in literature.  This book has all the elements of a captivating novel - plot, imagery, narrative, characters.  Though there may appear to be some thin characters and a reductionist view of good and evil, it is all to an end.  And there is a very strong message - evil there may be, but there are stronger bonds it cannot break.  It is up to us to fight the forces acting to destroy those bonds, forces that are within us.	2001-03-20

A PASSAGE TO INDIA reminds me of an article by Gayatri Spivak, &quot;Can Subaltern Speak?&quot; If I am not mistaken, basically what Spivak says is that Subaltern cannot speak because the dominance will not listen whatever it says. Thus, subaltern's speech and voice lose their power as a method or medium to present themselves to a society governed by the dominance. Losing its voice, subaltern remains as a voiceless/ powerless existence. In this theory, certainly, subaltern is subject to the dominance, and the chain of subjectivity cannot be broken by subaltern.<br />The English people in the novel seem to present as the dominance A PASSAGE, and Indians as the subaltern. The English people's conception/ conceptualization of Indians -- Indians are so uncivilized and uncultivated that they must retain as inferior to English -- are so firm and stubborn that it cannot change. Even Dr. Aziz who on some level is educated and civilized in the English measure, whom Forster seems to present as a protagonist to find an intersection between Indians and English and to tries to offer a certain possibility of reconciliation between subaltern and the dominant, is a mere Indian who cannot/ shall not &quot;be a channel of communication between two English people&quot; (83).   <br />Like many (post-)colonial writers, Forster seems to present power (economical and political) as a capability to define the others' identity, culture, and social role. Indians are simply defined as &quot;savages&quot; by English. No matter how educated they are or no matter how civilized (in the English/ European measure) they are, Indians are still savages who cannot be equally compared to any other English (the dominance). Dr. Aziz would be a good example of this case. The English also has the power to evaluate/ judge or even devalue subaltern's culture. The English conception of Indians, which Forster partially present throughout the book, is that Indians live in an unclean atmosphere, they smell bad, they are irresponsible so that they don't keep promise (ex. Indian ladies promise to invite Mrs. Moore and Adela to their place but do not keep the promise). Indians always remain as servant in the Colonial society. Regardless of their willingness, they are always subject to the English and their judgment. For example, Dr. Aziz dresses a shirt with collar when he rides a bicycle so that he wouldn¡¯t be stopped by an English policeman.<br />What bothers me most in A PASSAGE was Indians' attitude toward the English colonization. Indians seem to me that they are pretty indoctrinated by the English colonial conceptualization/ ideology. Indians themselves often thinks in A PASSAGE like the English, such as these thoughts: they are incapable to do certain things, they are inferior to the English, or they should be happy as good servant to the English. They don't seem as challenging as many African American protagonists in African American (post) colonial writings. This bothersome brings me to think of Forster's intention of this novel as well. Does he insist a separation between two powers? Is he saying that subaltern and the dominance can never mingle together like oil and water? What does he want to say through this novel? What make this novel good literature? Is this because the novel accurately presents the inevitable reality?....<br />Over all, the book offers me an interesting experience about Indians who have been strangers to me. Although having a couple of Indian friends, I have not thought about their colonial history and culture at all. This book makes me think in different areas that I have never adventured.	2001-02-07

They have the best intentions and want to meet real Indians and see the real India.  When Dr. Aziz takes them to visit the Marabar Caves, they seem to be penetrating deep into the heart of India.  However, Miss Quested is overwhelmed by the caves &amp; accuses Aziz of attacking her &amp; for all their good intentions, they are shown to be just as incapable of understanding Indians as the worst of their fellow Brits.<br />This is certainly the best of Forster's novels.  The clash of cultures makes for interesting reading.  However, after a century of decolonization and independence, it's legitimate to ask whether places like India are better off today, as independent nations, than they were in 1900, as colonies.  Forster  makes the point that the English will never understand the Indians &amp; can never be friends with them, but will Hindus ever understand Moslems &amp; can they ever be friends?  More importantly, even if the English never could befriend the Indians, wasn't their governance, at least, enlightened &amp; constructive?  Whereas, the Hindus who feel actual hatred towards the Moslems (&amp; vice versa) have governed in a backward and destructive manner?  Should ethnicity be the deciding factor in who governs a country or are governing principles (democracy, capitalism, religious tolerance) more important to the welfare of the population?<br />It seems to me that Forster &amp; his ilk bet on ethnicity &amp; events have shown them to be catastrophically mistaken.<br />GRADE: B	2000-10-30

It was fascinating to see how various actions and situations were  interpreted by members of the two different civilisations.  When one reads  this book keeping in mind the period in which it appeared, it is amazing to  note just how ahead of its time it was.  Ideas presented, such as the  notion that India might one day be a nation instead of several very  different groups of people-Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, are really quite  revolutionary.  While events did not transpire quite as the book may have  alluded to (Colonial India was made of up the present-day nations of India  and Pakistan, which came about after a very bloody war- hence two nations  not one), they are nonetheless far ahead of their times.<br /><br />While I  encourage everyone to read this book for the very candid insights into the  mindsets of British Colonials and Indians of the time period, I did not  give this book a 5 for several reasons.  Firstly, the use of many foreign  words (of Urdu origin I presume), while adding flavour to the story also  made reading a bit difficult as I was unfamiliar with many of them, and  could not find them in any English dictionary.  It was a bit confusing as  many of the words were not explained.  Secondly, in my opinion there were large passages where nothing of import was said.  This, unfortunately, did  not add to the reading experience for me.  This aside, I do think it is a book worth reading, especially for its status as a modern classic and the unique point of view from which it is written.	2000-09-14

US	51170376	RHQV9HGF5LVTC	0156711427	842807821	A Passage to India	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Rebuttal	I first read this book about 20 years ago and it blew me.  At the risk of  sounding culture-vulturish, I would say that it is not only a novel, it is  music with its leitmotifs, it is architectural in its structure and it is a  book with a profoundly (sorry about this overused word)humanistic point of  view.<br />I disagree, strongly with other reviewers who have reviewed this  book as a political manifesto.  Forster does not condemn the English in  India, but rather by allowing us to be flies on the wall to their behaviour  and attitudes he allows us to observe them.  The condemnation is ours.  I  don't feel that Forster wrote this novel in order to conform to today's  political correctness and to point out &quot;Gee, weren't the English  nasty&quot; or &quot;Aren't White Anglo-Saxons dreadful&quot;.  <br />The  English in India are a convenient metaphor for his themes of inclusion and  exclusion, acceptance and rejection, love that comes from knowledge and  acceptance or hate that arises through fear and ignorance.<br />Don't read  this book with a mindset of &quot;What is going to happen at the  trial&quot; or Whodunit.  Within the first few pages of the book, the  central question around which this novel revolves is posited - &quot;Can an  Englishman and an Indian become friends?&quot; and by extension can any two  people break down the barriers and come together in friendship.  Read the  book with this question in mind.	2000-08-20

I enjoyed &quot;A Passage to India&quot; because of its authentic historical flavor and largely accurate portrayal of the English colonial mindset. <br />&quot;A Passage to India&quot; is essentially a trial of attitudes. These include the prejudice and disdain of the British toward their Indian colonial subjects, the fear and confusion the British experience when confronted by a cultural and artistic sensuality that vastly contradicts their own, and the hatred a victim feels toward his antagonists' entire race. The British accord the Indians with an inferior status and consequently are unable to treat them in a just or fair fashion. As a result, the British legal process becomes more of a persecution pageant than an instrument of justice. Similarly, the British cannot accept or comprehend the sensual quality of Indian art and culture. The stiff, repressed Ms. Questead is overwhelmed by her exposure to the erotic paintings of the Mahabara caves. When she experiences a mental collapse, the British assume that her condition is the result of sexual molestation and falsely accuse Dr. Aziz of this crime. When Dr. Aziz is acquitted he develops an implacable hatred not only for the British but also for his own attorney. Dr. Aziz's attitude is a direct response to his persecution and in this sense is, itself, a product of English colonialism. <br />Eventually Dr. Aziz realizes that he must judge and accept English people on a personal and individual basis. To accomplish this, his attitude toward them must be based on his direct experience with individuals, not on either party's identity as a European or an Indian.	2000-07-31
US	52696744	RC69Q0728ONVL	0156711427	842807821	A Passage to India	Books	1	17	44	N	N	Colorful language does not a good story make	E.M. Forster paints an exquisite picture of India during the era of British Imperialism.  His language is beautiful with many stylized passages that create vivid mental pictures.  The pages are full of rich and detailed  images that I have found unparalleled in many cases.<br />But I do not  understand how this book can be praised as much as it is.  Beautiful prose  is like movie cinematography.  Great cinematography can make a good film  greater, but if the movie is bad to begin with, the cinematography, no  matter how excellent, cannot help the picture.  Forster seems intent on  portraying the conflict between the English culture and the Indian culture,  and while he does an excellent job, this is all he does for 362 pages.  The  brief extent of the plot is approxamately one-third of that and hardly  interesting.<br />The plot, to summarize, constitutes the assult of an English  woman in the Marabar Caves by an Indian.  The Indian is arrested and put on  trial.  The trial ends with the English woman saying that she was  hallucinating and the Indian is acquited.  The briefness of this whole  incident appeared to me as if Forster was scared of delving into a trial  and wanted a quick escape.<br />The most disappointing part about this is all  the preparations for the trial.  The English collect all these pieces of  evidence to use against the Indian, but nothing is ever used.  I, for one,  was hoping for a nice trial, where we could have a little interesting  action.  Nothing on the scale of Grisham, I don't expect Forster to have a  law degree, but let's actually PROVE this man's innocense instead of just  saying &quot;he didn't do it&quot;.<br />I can understand how some level of  praise can be given to this novel.  Forster does have good prose.  And  after having multiple years experience with English teachers and  professors, I know that they enjoy figurative language and it's  applications in a novel.  I enjoy it myself, too, but not to the same  extent.  A story with a good plot is much more valuable to me than a story  that is packed with figurative language and colorful prose.<br />I could not,  under good consciousness, recommend this book.  Despite the prose, this  novel is a tiresome read and focuses almost all of it's time on the clash  between the British and the Indian cultures, and while that does provide  for some well-rounded uses of irony in a novel (some of the best I have  seen) the whole premise gets boring and overused after the fourth chapter.   Forster could have been more successful with this novel had he expanded  more on the trial and used the culture difficulties to enhance that,  instead of the reverse.	2000-07-27

You know the ones on the &quot;Recommended&quot; book lists? We were wrong to have avoided this one so long. The novel takes  place during the colonial occupation of India. An Indian doctor is falsely  accused and imprisoned for the attack of an English women. It is a  multi-layered story about how cultures clash and predjudice repels and  destroys relationships. The author, weaves elements of Indian language,  religions, and customs into the story from his travels to India. <br />DO READ  this book if: -You like a story with a moral. -You enjoy exploring subtle  symbolism. -You like to read and ponder as you go.<br />Do NOT read this book  if: -You can't be bothered learning a few foreign words. -You like to read  with &quot;put your brain on hold&quot;.

The troubles Mr Fielding (an anglo) undergoes in making friends with the indians are very  real. It is very moving to read of these problems, as they represent the  many racial/economic  bridges between people which, sadly, don't seem to  close up.  I can identify with Miss Quested's feelings of not knowing the  real India.(I've never been to india, but i've read many books about it)   So, while this book is very thought provoking and describes many situations  that are easy to identify with, it is often extremely slow reading.  I  confess to skimming through many parts of the book, and I could not keep my  mind focused throughout the whole thing.  There are exciting points, such  as the events following the mystery of what really happened in the Marabar  Caves, but the plot is too extended and the book would have been much  better if it were more compressed.	2000-06-15

Forster  emerges from the book as open-minded and progressive as anyone could have  been in the 1920s.<br />In some ways similiar, yet vastly different, Forser  explores the truth of India in many of the same ways as Africa was  &quot;opened&quot; up to English readers in Heart of Darkness.  However, A  Passage to India is much deeper than I can express.<br />If you want a look  into a beautiful novel about friendships and relationships (loving and  intimate).  Then buy this book because I promise it will touch your heart  and remind you of the sanctity of the human spirit.	2000-05-03

For a good half of the book I was fully expecting a nicely written standard story of colonial  injustice. Thankfully, the story turns a different way and is thus saved  from what at the time might have been controversial, but now is merely  banal commentary. Forster's writing is decent, and he did a really good job  of conveying the psychologically confusing aura of the place. However, the  ending is very weak and oddly done compared to the rest of the book. I'm  glad I read it, but I don't foresee reading much else by Forster.	2000-04-11

Just because I find  something dry and boring doesn't mean it isn't great literature, but this  does not apply to Forster, who is dry, boring, shows no psychological  insight whatsoever, has wooden, unrealistic characters and dialogue and  very few redeeming features at all.

Jung said somewhere that a dream can be interpreted at many levels, and every interpretation is right. (If Jung didn't say it, I did, and he would have said it.)<br /> On the  surface, Passage informs contemporary England of the state of affairs in  India. At the same time, it shows how East and West differ. It also leaves  a record for later generations about English colonialism, the relations  between Hindus and Muslims in India, social practices, and speech, and the  historian may even infer quite a bit about the industrialization and  technology of the early twentieth century.<br /> In &quot;Homo  Aestheticus,&quot; Ellen Dissanayake says, &quot;Behavior is, essentially,  choice.&quot; To analyze Forster's book (or any work of art), we have to  ask, why did the author choose these particular elements to express  whatever was in his mind? (A novel is more than Stendhal's mirror; it  expresses what the author sees, and what the author sees is decided by what  the author is.) Here we slip into deeper strata.<br /> India, the dark,  amorphous, timeless, ancient land, represents the unconscious, peopled by  unknowable, unreachable, dark-skinned masses worshipping an accumulation of  gods in a number of tongues. The identity of India as the unattainable  contents of the unconscious is indicated by the very first conversation in  the book, in which two Indians tell the third that they are dead, in  &quot;another and a happier world.&quot;<br /> Adele Quested, the noble  quest, is an intrusion from the known, civilized conscious. This female  character goes past the outposts of light into the darkness of India,  where, because she is introduced by aged Mrs Moore (more), she is escorted  into the womb of the rock at the Malabar caves by Dr Aziz (A through Z is  everything). Dr Aziz may escort her because he is not a true denizen of the  inner world (he is the third Indian, not &quot;dead&quot;), he is a modern  healer who originated in Muslim Afghanistan: a bridge.<br /> When Quested  enters the cave, she is, or is not confronted by a shadow which may have  been guiding her. In her struggle to avoid the union of male and female,  conscious and unconscious, she loses her vision (her field glasses) and,  because she rejects the shadow, the injuries she suffers (earns) are only  skin-deep; her compatriots do not permit the cactus spines to enter her  blood.<br /> Since Mrs Moore, the prescient old woman, does not assert Dr  Aziz's innocence, she dies as soon as she reaches the sea, the eternal,  unfathomable depths of life and psyche.<br /> Fielding, the educator, ego,  wishes to befriend Aziz, but Aziz, wounded, enters deeper into polytheistic  India, the unconscious which he hopes to unite, but the horses, the earth,  the temples don't want it. Fielding never marries Quested. Although the  book is titled A PASSAGE to India, practically the whole book takes place  *in* India, and yet, passage is never realized.<br /> Now it would be  absurd to suggest that Forster sat chewing his pencil thinking, &quot;What  symbol am I to use to show the quest had only superficial results? Cactus,  that's it!&quot; The book succeeds because his mind was ordered and open  enough to dredge up the effective symbol: effective for him, effective for  us.<br /> What I propose is that work which delves deep into the  unconscious cultivates psychological growth and, by inspiring internal  harmony, alleviates problems, if only by facing them. This is the standard  I would raise to distinguish good (successful) art (art which succeeds in  promoting psychological growth) and mediocre art, the product of shallow  minds.ted in Muslim Afghanistan: a bridge.<br /> When Quested  enters the cave, she is, or is not confronted by a shadow which may have  been guiding her.

Nevertheless, some of the prose is absolutely stunning, and the end of the  book (in my opinion) is one of the most beautiful achievements in any  novel. A book I would highly recommend.	2000-01-24
US	51122794	R1YHWMVWIN1LEQ	0156711427	842807821	A Passage to India	Books	5	65	66	N	N	A masterpiece.	This is book is incredible, and one of my personal favorites.  Its beauty is too easily overlooked, because it is so elegantly subtle. Every aspect of the storytelling is masterful: the prose is lush and nuanced, and every  character is exquisitely drawn.  Drawing from the slimmest of plots,  Forster weaves what seems to be an isolated incident into a complex  tapestry of emotion.  The central focus are the characters, who are sharply  realistic and utterly, utterly human.  Another aspect that I liked very  much is that it takes an era, the British Raj in India, which is otherwise  interpreted only with the most hotly colored emotions, and presents it with  a marked neutrality, presenting it only through the eyes of the characters.  A marvelous read.	1999-12-23

I have just finished reading this book in my Indian Lit class, and although it was a challenging read, it was satisfying, and well worth the effort. Forster gives us unbiased, amazing descriptions, as well as  mystical and mysterious adventures in ancient caves.

British rule in India and its consequences constitute one of the most interesting and important aspects  of world history. It is strange, therefore, that British novelists have  rarely tackled the subject. But if this is the best they can manage, then  it's probably no bad thing. Forster has no insight to offer on the nature  of colonialism; how it affects the characters of the exploiter and the  exploited; on the nature of racism; on conflicts of culture; or, indeed,  any of the major themes suggested by a subject such as this. None of the  characters seem fully realized, and the Hindu festival in the final part of  the novel seems to me particularly embarrassing. Perhaps it's time that  novels written in Indian languages were translated into English: they are  bound to offer more insights than this hugely disappointing book.	1999-08-09

Along with the intricate themes and messages of the book, I was intrigued by the character of Mrs Moore.  Can she legitimately be called an individual on the verge of an existential crisis?  She starts out as such an understanding, loving, religious figure, but progresses toward an apathetic one.  The Caves obviously affect Mrs. Moore to the very depths of her soul and being.  She wonders if there is anything in life that really means anything at all.  She feels physically sick.  She is emotionally withdrawn from the rest of the characters in the novel. She believes Aziz to be innoncent but does not speak out or make her opinion known; as if she feels, &quot;what difference would it make?&quot;  So, although Mrs. Moore realizes that there is no inherent meaning to life itself! , she never gets the chance to create her own meaning after her existential crisis.  I'm not sure if this is a correct analysis, but it intrigues me.  Maybe other readers have been curious about the same thing.	1998-08-07

How I saw the world and other people.  It also made me rethink God.  I liked the controling figure of the perfect specimen condemed to the lowest caste.  How people were calling God to come when he was already there.  How the God they knew was not the true God and the name they gave him was not his true name.  How the English were superfical yet mighty and the Indians were thourgh and considered a lesser being.  Forester wove these themes into an intricate thread of a story.	1998-07-11

Forster's lucid style and unsurpassed technical ability comes together in a carefully crafted and delicately balanced work. With great sensivity and sincere love of the country, he conveys to the reader the full emotional spectrum of the cultural mosaic of India, from the most deeply felt pious devotion to various religious duties, to the unfathomable chasm of misunderstanding between natives and colonial rulers. On an higher impersonal level, Forster weaves an exact and finely constructed plot with almost supernatural undertones, as if the characters are drawn imperceptibly and unknowingly towards their fates by forces within the land itself	1997-04-01

But though the main character, Aziz, lives through the ordeal, he is forever haunted and disillusioned by the experience of being falsely accused based on race. This novel is as relevant today as ever, both in America and in India. The scars of the past may never be erased, as Aziz  seems to have concluded. It is the conqueror, personified by the English character, Fielding, who seems oblivious to the harm done, and who wishes to make right a wrong that he fails to fully admit to in the first place. This is the conundrum faced by both England and America today.	2015-01-05

The story and writing is very good. The book ending is much more layered and complex than the movie ending but essentially the same.

I also like how he writes about how each is persieving the same conversation or events differently through their own class/cultural lens. My only complaint...not about the book, but about the 2.99 download to my kindle, I think that is what I paid...or it might have been free, it that the e-text copy was horrible.

This is hoping to not scare people away from this great book….<br />A Passage to India<br /><br />YES, this book has significant problems in it’s digitalized form, but if it is the ONLY way you can read it….skip the intro and read the story in a spirit of forgiveness for the poor format.<br />By all means if you can find a better copy, do so;<br /><br />But do not miss Forster’s insightful story-telling that gives so much understanding to the human experience of colonialism (both from the English side and the Indian side).<br /><br />Fascinating insight into colonialism and English-Indian relationships through very personal encounters.  The microcosm of the story will give you layer after layer of understanding into this period in history.  If you watched the movie Ghandi and think you ‘know’ enough about colonial India, you have cheated yourself.  Getting to know the characters Dr Aziz, Cyril Fielding, Mrs. Moore, Ronny Heaslop and Narayan Godbole gives clarity to the “muddle” that is colonialism.<br />And BTW, if you have seen the movie you have not experienced ‘A Passage to India’.  Yes, the events follow very closely the book, but it is missing the soul of the STORY.	2014-09-20
