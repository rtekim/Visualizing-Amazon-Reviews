It's not that Rushdie isn't a brilliant writer, but his generation-sweeping narrative felt like a long exercise in allegory and self-referentialness without characters or a plot that I managed to find involving.<br /><br />You'll find that the usual checkmarks of \\""magic realism\\"" apply here. The writing has a fanciful storybook quality, as does the plot logic. The author blends real-world history with myth and pseudo-myth. Characters have exaggerated personality and physical traits, and strange ailments, some of which seem to grant them extraordinary powers of telepathy and foresight. Don't get me wrong -- I appreciate symbolism and thematic depth, but there was a bit too much literary flash at the expense of characters or a story arc I could relate to. Maybe it's just me -- I was also left cold by Mark Helprin's much-loved Winter's Tale, for similar reasons.<br /><br />Too bad, because Rushdie really can write colorful descriptive passages that sing in audiobook form, combining poetry, satire, Bollywood imagery, and bits of the real world in a rollicking series of well-crafted scenes. But it's also one of those books where the author is constantly and consciously being \\""clever\\"", mainly through manipulative foreshadowing and an air of ah-but-you-don't-see-where-I'm-going-with-this. To me, that sort of thing gets annoying, as though Rushdie wants to bait critics into being impressed with his novel through structural trickery (\\""this a novel for *smart* readers -- like us!\\"").

For what it's worth, here is my attempt to characterize the style. The book is written as a \\""stream of consciousness\\"", long long long sentences, side-by-side repetition of adjectives for emphasis (hint hint hint!), use of synonyms similes parellels without punctuation or separators (again for emphasis), revealing the plot's end-game in advance yet (or thus) engaging the reader in the path to getting there, repeated summaries each to make an overarching point than to simply recollect the story so far, admitted insecurity and intermittent defense of the story's believability, and did I mention rechristening of events and characters with metaphoric names. If you could read and follow the last sentence in one shot, you are ready to read and enjoy Midnight's Children. The story-telling is hallucinatory on the surface, but enlightened underneath; deliriously exaggerated on the surface, but scrupulously balanced underneath; grossly fatalistic on the surface, but hopelessly optimistic underneath; carelessly raw on the surface, but meticulous genius underneath.<br /><br />Never judge a book by its cover, judge it by its metaphors.

Every event and character is first rechristened with its metaphoric name. In the process of writing the book, Rushdie has created a new vocabulary of words that become the best way (if not the only way) to describe those characters and events.<br /><br />Spoiler alert: To pick from this new vocabulary, one way of characterizing the life of Saleem Sinai, and therefore the book, is Sperectomy: the draining-out of hope.

This novel is one of the most interesting and memorable of the 20th century, and one of the best novels by a living writer, at least that I have read.  Rushdie weaves a semi-historical, semi-mythical portrayal of the newly formed nation-state of India.  Throughout the book, I kept thinking that the protagonist was actually Rushdie himself; or, perhaps the protagonist represents Rushdie's generation, since he was born in Bombay in 1947.  The plot is interesting indeed, which I won't get into because I don't want to spoil it for anyone.

This novel is often put next to \\""One Hundred Years of Solitude\\"" because of its style.  I might agree to that to some extent, primarily because each of these two novels have a different purpose.  They are both written in the style of magical realism, but again, each novel has it's own purpose.  If Rushdie had kept his writing focused on India in his subsequent novels, I believe that he would be to India what J.M. Coetzee is to South Africa.

So much is made of the mystical connections relating to the main character (Saleem Sinai), so much promise is set up in the story, that it's surprising when the abuse starts being heaped on Saleem with almost sadistic relentlessness. By the end of the story Rushdie has portrayed a startlingly pessimistic view of the \\""potential\\"" of the innocent.

The magical realism style Rushdie employs is far less confusing than that of Gabriel Garcia Marquez: where Marquez's rambling, stream of consciousness writing serves largely to (intentionally) disorient the reader, Rushdie (through a liberal use of semi-colons) gently guides the reader through narrative leaps spanning both time and distance. Astonishingly descriptive, Rushdie is almost more a painter than a writer in this book: the near 550 pages pass by with a very economical use of dialogue, and it is the scenes and descriptions that provide the meat and memories of the novel.<br /><br />Those who are fans of Tolkein and other authors who write lavishly detailed stories simply cannot miss this novel.  \\""Midnight's Children\\"" plays out like an Oscar-winning film or a very vivid, elaborate dream.",2007-06-14

But he is not his father's son. Switched at birth with another baby, Saleem is a Hindu child raised by wealthy Muslims.

The other pleasure is Rushdie's language, which is rich and complex (however there were times when I found his rhetorical style almost tedious). Fortunately, this is a very funny book, taking many of its cues from Bollywood cinema, and it's also quite acidic: part comedy, part angry polemic, it's a an odd combination but the result is a wonderful piece of literature.

I have never been very interested in Indian history, and knew close to nothing about it. But upon reading this novel, I found myself drawn into the rich fictional history of the Aziz family, as well as the equally rich history of India. Rushdie may have ruined reading for me, as every book I read will now have much higher standards! Not for light reading, though. I imagine this is a book that you could read over and over and still find something new each time. This is a tough novel, and it takes a lot of work to truly \\""get it\\"". The only reason I stuck with it is because I had to for class. But it was very rewarding in the end. The novel reveals itself in layers, with recurring themes and motifs that grow in extremely deep and powerful meanings. The character of Saleem, self-described savior of India, is one of the most memorable characters to have graced the pages of a novel. I have heard some people say that this book is a let down in the end, as though it never comes to a full climax. In answer to that: I felt that was the whole point. Saleems dreams are always dreams, they are never completely realized. The language is beautiful and lyrical, and the plot is highly detailed, as though each sentence was carefully planned. Rushdie may be the ultimate architect of this century when it comes to plot building. As a writer myself, I was both green with envy and speechless with awe over this novel. I have never read anything else by Rushdie, but now I definitly plan to!  <br /> <br />A couple of tips:  <br />1. There are many different characters, so you may want to make a family tree to keep track.   <br /> <br />2. Pay close attention to Rushdie's use of color in the novel, particularly green, saffron and blue, as well as numbers.  <br /> <br />3. The narrator, Saleem, breaks away from linear storytelling ina big way. Often, the story jumps around and he gives a lot of foreshadowing. It helps to let go of our western idea of time (i.e. events happening in a timeline) and just let the story unfold. Trust me, once you can let go of your confusion and just let it be, the reading becomes much easier! Also, it's interesting to consider what he chooses to tell us ahead of time, and what he doesn't.  <br /> <br />And finally, you will definitly want to brush up on your Indian history! I'm not talking a whole lot, just an Encarta article or something so you know what's going on. Also, when historical figures are mentioned in the book, you should do a little research and find out more about them.

I wasn't bothered by this because I found it entertaining, but some people might be. Saleem was born on the stroke of midnight on the day of the birth of the nation of India, so his story is also the story of India as it transforms from a tender and weak country into an adult and dangerous one. The best part of the story is Salman Rushdie's writing, in my opinion. He tends to use what I call adjective or noun or verb strings - putting words together like in this one: \\""driven on by the imperatives of rip tear crack, I abandon reflections.\\"" Salman Rushdie has such a unique style of writing, one that forces the reader to completely focus on what is being said or else he/she will miss something vital.

Some have extra special sensitivity, others super strength.  Some of the superpowers are funny, some quite poignant.

The story is what is really worth getting into here, but the main problem is with its style, and that is what makes it not great literature. Quite frankly, Rushdie just doesn't seem as talented at getting his story into written form as he is at having the story itself.

While noble in intention, the style that Rushdie uses simply proves to not be as conducive to this type of story-telling as the folkloric style of Marquez and various others. My other problems with the prose are most likely personal preferences, but there are many gimmicks that are used that I found to fall flat or to kill narrative tension (especially how the majority of the events are told many times before they happen so that by the time the book ends, I felt like I had read an additional 100 page epilogue summarizing what I'd read before). All of this can be tied the fact that prose seemed unduly messy. Not in a get-inside-the-narrating-character's-style messy, but a messy that cries out for a better editor. However, these complaints are easily overshadowed by the greatness of the story itself and in the compelling characters, as well as Rushdie's skill in weaving the story into the greater story of the book, that of Postcolonial India. Looking back over this, I think that three stars might be a tad too harsh, but I feel that the complaints about the proseand its inflated status as in the last twenty-four years warrant it as a warning of sorts.

Midnight's Children, the fictional autobiography of Saleem Sinai, is the best novelistic testament to memory--both personal and national--that I have ever read.

Because his birth links him so intimately to his country, Saleem believes that he is the center of every historical event of note, causing wars, international incidents, and interpersonal fiascos by what he calls his \\""rearranging of history.\\"" To the reader, of course, his influence is absurd, as is the idea that one relatively insignificant person could have so much effect on so large a scale.

It is a highly post modern novel that frequently stalls while the narrator forgets (dates such as the assasination of Ghandi and the 1957 elections) summarizes what has gone before and fortells what is yet to come. Why such a curious, strange style? Because Saleem is a character who, in his words is 'the sum total of everything that went before me, of all that I have seen done, of everything done-to-me...To understand me, you'll have to swallow the world'. Yes, Saleem is, in a sense, India itself, coming into being at exactly the same moment - 15th August 1947 and blessed with magical powers that allow him to see into the minds of other people and hear their voices in his head.

Mr. Rushdie is able to relate the complex story of twentieth century India through a personal narrative that is entertaining, magical and beautiful. The novel is presented as the autobiography of Saleem Sinai, who was born at the exact moment of India's independence. This gives him supernatural powers, namely the ability to communicate telepathically with 420 other \\""midnight children.\\"" These children, all born in the first hour of India's independence, all have some supernatural ability. Saleem's account goes beyond his own experience, including stories from the lives of his grandparents, parents, neighbors, and many others. Using him as a symbol, Rushdie explains the multifaceted and somewhat confused identity of India as a whole, a theme that surfaces in many ways throughout the novel. Rushdie's story combines fact and fantasy to create a magnificent picture of the modern history of India. <br /> <br />From his birth, Saleem's life is tied to his country. Due to the incredible situation of his birth, Prime Minister Nehru writes to him, \\""We shall be watching over your life with the closest attention; it will be, in a sense, the mirror of our own\\"" (139). Parallels between Saleem's life and the life of India are found throughout the novel. In addition to his mother and father, he names many people as \\""parents,\\"" including his nurse, a neighbor, his friend, and a number of others. This parallels the numerous \\""parents\\"" of India's culture, including British, Hindu, Muslim, and other influences. Saleem's childhood sees issues with identity and purpose. Similarly, he witnesses many events that show identity issues for the new nation, including language marches and the Indo-Pakistan war. Additionally, Saleem is fragmented and falling apart. He describes a physical ailment that he has, \\""I have begun to crack all over like an old jug ...I am literally disintegrating\\"" (36). This resembles the fragmented cultureof India. In numerous ways, the history of modern India is echoed in Saleem's life. <br /> <br />Rushdie's unique style is as magical as the story itself. The novel constantly uses vivid images to convey meaning. Saleem states that he is able to smell history, referring to \\""the vinegary force of Adam Aziz's determination\\"" (14) and \\""the acrid stench of his mother's embarrassment\\"" (14). Rushdie combines symbols, rich images, and expressive prose in a way that adds to the dream-like aspect of the novel. When writing about a moment of insecurity, Saleem says, \\""green shards lacerated my hands as I entered that swirling universe in which I was doomed, until it was far too late, to be plagued by constant doubts about what I was for\\"" (187). This picturesque style greatly contributes to the surreal character of the story.  <br /> <br />If one goal of Midnight's Children was to convey the history and culture of twentieth century India, this novel is very effective. Rushdie covers the wide range of people that make up this nation by including countless diverse individuals and scenes. Saleem writes, \\""I have been a shallower of lives; and to know me, just the one of me, you'll have to swallow the lot as well\\"" (4) symbolically saying that to understand India, one must understand all of these stories. Considering the sheer amount of characters and plot developments, the book is amazingly smooth and easy to read. The author is able to tie the whole range of these varied accounts into one coherent picture. Yet this novel goes far beyond that goal. It historically documents a culture and simultaneously composes a magical personal story. Rushdie does all of this with a brilliant, unique style that makes the entire novel a remarkable work of art. <br /> <br />Salman Rushdie's Midnight Children conveys the multifaceted history of India with the incredible story of one person's life using symbolism and metaphor. The dream-like quality of Rushdie's style adds greatly to the magical aspects of the story. The novel effectively achieves its goal, and is both fascinating and beautiful.",2005-03-18

The narrator, Saleem Sinai, in some very cleverly-turned phrases, immediately puts us on notice that he was born at the exact moment that India gained its independence from Britain and that as he writes this memoir he expects to die at any time.  That in itself is enough to make you sit up and beg for more; a profoundly significant nativity, coupled with the urgency of impending doom?  What could possibly happen next?<br /><br />Well, I'll tell you what happens next; Saleem Sinai informs us that the powers which devolved upon him due to the time of his birth had no impact whatsoever on anyone, and he confidently expects that his death will be no more notable.  In other words, this is the story of a man who might as well never have lived at all.  God knows what kept me reading after that.<br /><br />Okay, it was Rushdie's undeniable gift of words that kept me reading after that, but the whole book is the same game; Saleem Sinai, in the middle of his narrative, drops a dark hint or two about future events like hidden murder suspects, devastating fire and bomb attacks, wives and sons who aren't truly wives and sons, fascinatingly various magical powers leading to vicious magical wars, and some cruel and dangerous figure called the Widow.  Eventually, all of these oracular utterances come true, you find out what really happened, and because the narrative has built them up to such a pitch the events themselves seem trite and you're left wondering what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />In a way, Rushdie got himself into a real bind here.  If he'd told the story of Saleem Sinai, all the magical ties surrounding his life, his and India's parallel courses, \\""Midnight's Children\\"" would have been a much better story, but he would have lost the chance to weave the opulence of his prose and that would have been a serious loss.  On the other hand, by giving his language all this room to stretch and bend into all these mystical hints about what's to come, he robs his plot of its power when the events he's foreshadowed come to pass.  Like the old saying goes, it's always something.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my sympathy for Rushdie in his literary difficulties does not extend to excusing his book for its flaws.  If he couldn't find a way to balance the beauty of his language, the weight of his themes and the power of his story, that's his problem, frankly.  It doesn't change the fact that he shot himself in the foot.  (I know, there are a lot of bloodthirsty hooligans and brain-dead sheep out there who'd like to shoot him in a more damaging spot because some group of thin-skinned busybodies told them to, but you know what I mean.)  For all his ambition, admirable as it is, the fact remains that with \\""Midnight's Children\\"" Rushdie messed up a perfectly good story by calling too much attention to himself.<br /><br />These \\""slice of life\\"" sorts of books - the type that go from miscellaneous Point A to random Point B rather than from beginning to end - have their advantages at times.  They are certainly more prevalent now than in ages past; they're probably easier to write, and authors can throw into these books anything they like without regard for how well those details fit the story, since there is no story as such.  However, as with most modern practices that disregard old traditions, the practitioners of \\""slice of life\\"" stories have to be careful; the abandonment of the old rules does not mean that there are no rules, it just means that the new rules have not been discovered yet.  Even players of modern free jazz can make mistakes.

I am very well versed in Islamic culture and religion, but I know next to nothing of Indian culture, so I was very confused by his profusion of culturally-rich references and descriptions of Indian mindset and history.   <br /> <br />I am only giving it two stars because he does have a very lyrical and descriptive writing style; I saw another writer compare it to  Nabakov's style of writing, and that seems pretty apt.

C'est manifique!\\"" and multitudes of roses gloriously wafting down from the expensive seats in the balcony are justified. This book made Rushdie a star. Rushdie who? Isn't he the guy who wrote that bizarre quasi-sci-fi novel about some birdguy? Yes, he is. And five years following that dabble (entitled \\""Grimus\\"" which, to steal Hume's thunder, \\""fell deadborn from the press\\"") Rushdie sprung some new fantastic oil reserve of novel writing and produced this utter gem. What a difference a mere five years can make!<br />This is a thick book. It's a very thick book. Thick with meaning. Thick with stories. Is it about time? Sure. Is it about family? Yup. Is it a political book? Well, sorta. Is it about the vicissitudes of memory and history? Probably, yes, that sounds good. Is it about India? Oh, yup. A lot of India in it, sure sure. Its bulk is impossible to summarize to any degree of fairness. Its bulk in meaning is nearly incomprehensible. Still, it all comes down to the narrator: Saleem Sinai, who, equipped with numerous nicknames and adoptive parents, is pummelled and dragged and drained through India's independence. Having been born at the very stroke of midnight (or was that his rival, born in the same room, who was the real son of Saleem's unsuspecting first set of \\""parents\\"") on the cusp and lip of India's independence, Saleem later finds himself, and 1001 other children (you guessed it, the \\""Children of Midnight\\""), imbued with magical powers beyond belief. The magic of India's independence from Britain shoots forth wonders. Of course the government under Indira Gandhi isn't too happy about this, and Saleem finds himself in a very bad sort of pickle later on. These scenes make up some of the more disturbing and violent chapters (and Rushdie was accused by some of being too hard on the Indira r&eacute;gime). Cover your eyes! Plug your ears!<br />This is historical fiction at its best. There's much to learn about the history of India in these pages of pulp. Some familiar names will pounce out from the ink: Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi (no blood relation to the Mahatma; she was assassinated in 1984, four years after this book was published), Morarji Desai, Lord Viceroy Mountbatten, etc., etc., the names and history they encompass pile up page after page. Saleem and his family are also victims (very unfortunate ones) of the partition of India (into India, Pakistan, and soon after Bangladesh). This event still holds the record for most people moved from one place to another at one time: 14 million people (with about 1 million dead). Then war war war, more war war, and a state of Emergency, war war. Saleem is buffetted through it all, as countless millions were. The novel brings out the complexity and bulk of modern independent India through the voice of Saleem. Make some room in your brain for Rushdie's \\""many headed monsters\\"".<br />One of the best scenes is \\""the perforated sheet\\"" in which a doctor, Saleem's Grandfather, is only allowed to examine a Muslim woman through a hole in a large sheet. One part at a time, no more, no less. One day he looks through the hole and sees a...<br />Book three is a wild ride which will likely evoke the response \\""how did Saleem get here?\\"" This book is Saleem's \\""rebirth\\"" ending with the \\""Abracadabra\\"" that changes everything; as book two is about Saleem's birth and childhood, and book one attempts to sum up the events leading up to Saleem's birth (the perforated sheet will haunt).<br />Is Saleem an honest narrator, though? Or does he lie through his big teeth (and much bigger and talented nose)? This is one of the many tensions that rips through the novel, and questions and examines biography as well as history. Saleem only admits to lying once.<br />The novel has some debts also. It owes a big one to \\""Tristram Shandy\\"" written by Lawrence Sterne in the 18th century, in which an autobiographer attempts to write his life and keeps getting mired in digressions. Rushdie takes the best elements of this brilliantly bizarre book and meshes it into his own story of Saleem. Rushdie himself has acknowledged the influence of Sterne.

In addition to this, Rushdie's reputation is not built upon his literary merits so much as the surrounding controversy of another book, The Satanic Verses, which all but condemned him to years of hiding and constant moving about in an effort to escape fundamentalist Muslim assassination-attempts. <br />The premise for this novel is amazing.  At the stroke of midnight on August 15th, 1947, India achieved independence and became a valid country, free from the shackles of Britain.  One thousand and one children were born in the hour from midnight to 1am, one thousand and one children with magical powers, the potency of which increases the closer the child was born to midnight.  <br />The narrator, Saleem Sinai, was one of two children born on the exact stroke of midnight, and throughout the novel various allusions to yin and yang, good and evil, up and down, et cetera are made between Saleem and Shiva, the other child, but unfortunately nothing really comes from this.  Although mentioned often and with great vehemence on the part of the narrator, Shiva never really came across as a 'bad guy', or even someone that should be worried about at all.<br />The story meanders through thirty odd years of life before Saleem's birth, detailing the lives and idiosyncracies of his parent's and grandparent's adventures, which, admittedly, are described with great sweeping motions and tantalizing literary strokes.  Sentences marvel, paragraphs sing with wit or beauty, but...what was the point?  After Saleem is born, events take an incredibly epic turn, as the implications of the children of midnight are revealed, but then, the narrator just sort of forgets about it and rambles on about things that, given the immensely intruiging concept of the children, just doesn'tspark any interest.  <br />The narrator is an interesting writer.  He repeats reiterates recapitulates words in threes, often, and that works.  He used parentheses artfully, and well.  But the narrator foreshadows everything and anything, so that we are always reading about events that will come to pass, soon or otherwise, and in cryptic ways, 'He kept himself in the background of our lives, always, except twice...once when he left us; once when he returned to destroy the world by accident'.  It is an exceptionally annoying literary technique, serving only to make the reader wish that events would hurry up so that the portentous-sounding episodes will occur, but...even they are marred by fore-shadowing and never really live up to the promises, anyway.<br />The last one hundred and fifty pages drag, seemingly without cohesion, in an effort to combine the plot-threads, to actually make the children a part of the story - and, disappointingly, they really aren't very predominant - but it doesn't work.  Then, in a whirlwind twenty pages, everything is tied up neatly, the children are dealt with, and the book ends.  The fantastic premise never really lived up to its promise, and the book suffers.<br />Is Midnight's Children a failure?  No.  As a story, it is enjoyable, written well, and at times, beautiful.  Certain passages are crafted with amazing skill, and the narrator is a pleasant enough fellow.  But the concept of the midnight's children should have been ditched - the story would have worked well enough without them because they never really played a part - and the book would have been greater as the spectre of great things to come would not have existed.",2004-04-14

As those two novels reflect the history of their own respective nations, so does \\""Midnight's Children.\\""  It is the story of one family, and one person in particular, Saleem, who is born on the stroke of midnight on the exact day and time India achieved its independence from Britain.  From that propitious birth onward, Saleem's life becomes a reflection and representation of the young Indian nation itself.  <br />The title refers to the 400 odd children who were born at or near this same midnight.  Each one of them have magical skills which vary in strength and importance in direct relation to their birth's proximity to midnight.  Since Saleem was born exactly at midnight, he has the most valuable skill, the skill to look into people's hearts, minds, and souls, and to commune with the other midnight children mentally.  In this vein, he forms the Midnight Children's Conference, a meeting of these 400+ children who communicate through Saleem's telepathic mind and have the stated goal of reforming India.  If this sounds unbelievable, it is not.  It is the same sort of magical realism fans of Latin American authors will be familiar with, and adds to the strength, beauty, and ultimate brutality of the story without making the reader roll his eyes in incredulity.  <br />As is India, so is Saleem.  He hears the multitudinous voices of India in his head, a mess of contradictions:  peace and violence, forgiveness and revenge, progress and tradition.  His family also reflects the indefinable character of India.  They are by turns real and fantastical, living and dying, perservering and escaping.  The amalgam of these voices and Saleem's family is an India that Rushdie seems to understand no better than anyone else, but his affection for and frustration with India could only come from a native.  <br />The reader also follows Saleem's physical life.  His face mirrors a map of India, and his enormous nose is gifted at sensing emotions.  From the life of a rich boy in Bombay, to a fighter in the India-Pakistan War, to a broken carnival traveller, and finally to an owner of a pickle company, Saleem's journey through life is expansive, human, and always entertaining.  The side characters are just as engrossing, and all have a part to play in the tumolt of Indian history. <br />To keep the earlier analogy going, I found this to be a slightly more difficult read than \\""One Hundred Years of Solitude\\"" but just as entertaining as \\""Middlesex\\"".  Rushdie writes with wit, style, anger, and absolute brilliance.  He is generous with allusions, but I felt they were also extremely accessible.

One important note: Rushdie PURPOSELY inserts historical innacuracies, so don't think you're getting an accurate historical account - that's done on purpose. Indeed, from a post-structuralist theoretical standpoint, Rushdie's project is clearly to deconstruct. But, he goes nowhere with it. His whole novel can be summed up in a few lines: The popular version of history is inherently corrupted by social mediating forces; so, in order to combat that force, I'm going to offer MY version of history to show that there is no ONE history. It's a pretty standard argument, but he doesn't develop it beyond that. I would suggest that you look to Faulkner (who focuses on history's lingering qualities) or Ellison's Invisible Man (in which he focuses on how to break through cycles of historical oppression). They handle the effects of history in a much more engaging and profound way.",2003-04-29

Winning first the Booker Prize, and later the \\""Booker of Bookers\\"" (that is, the best of all novels to win that British prize), MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN is a tale of India from the beginning of the 20th century to 1977 that holds a mirror up to history.<br />Narrated by Saleem Sinai, born on the stroke of midnight on the August night in 1947 when India officially became independent, MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN begins with the history of his grandparents in Kashmir and then alludes to the killings of practioners of Gandhi's civil disobedience by British occupiers. Rushdie builds up considerable suspense as the timeline of his narrative approaches Sinai's birth. Afterwards, the novel deals with Saleem's upbringing, his coming of age, and a stint in Pakistan's army before returing to the heart of India. While the book could have used a more energetic editor and some parts drag, the final 200 pages of MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN make it entirely deserving of the heaps of praise showered on it so far.<br />There are elements of magical realism in MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN, but often with a characteristically Indian twist. All of the surviving members of the 1001 children born at midnight of August 15, 1947 have special powers, in Saleem's case it is a form of telepathy that allows his to bring together telepathically the children of midnight in a conclave each evening. Towards the end of the novel Saleem encounters practioners of magic influenced by Hindu mysticism that impacts the plot immensely. But alongside the magical elements is astute commentary on the reality of modern India. Rushdie's tendency to always look at Pakistan (and Bangladesh) and India together, in spite of lines on a map, gives an interesting perspective to the culture and politics of the region.<br />While Rushdie is always an entertaining author, his tendency to take an absurd amount of elements from other works of literature sometimes dilutes his originality. Much of MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN is taken from Gunter Grass' novel THE TIN DRUM, a book with which Rushdie claims inspired his to begin writing. Like Oskar Mazerath, Saleem Sinai is a young man of questionable paternity who has special powers and remains aloof from the madness of his age as he reports it. Saleem, just like the narrator of THE TIN DRUM, follows his mother to a cafe to watch an adulterous meeting, and instead of a tin drum Saleem refuses to be parted from a silver spitoon. While all authors are influenced by their predecessors, I found MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN to be far too unoriginal at times. Rushdie's later work is much better in this respect.<br />I find THE SATANIC VERSES to be Rushdie's finest novel, and would recommend that to anyone who has not read his work before. It's a brilliant and excellently constructed roller-coaster (and I say that with no hyperbole) of a novel that is all the more important because of its impact on East-West relations of the late 80's and early 90's.

But I found it much too slow, repetitive, and obtuse. Perhaps I needed an annotated version, so that I could appreciate it more?<br />This is indeed very disappointing to me, as I think Rushdie's style of mixing the highbrow literary art with pop culture references and scatalogical content a refreshing change. I like it a lot more than literary pretension like that of New Yorker darlings Matt Klam. The problem really came down to the way that the style came together in that, while I found the story and the theme elements fascinating, I thought the sentences way too bloated, where entire sentences and paragraphs could easily have been cut.

It deserves a lot of accolades, and I share many kudos from some previous reviewers. However, the work falls short of a masterpiece, for the following reasons.<br />1. It's too long. At a skilled and parsimonious hand, the novel could be half the length to tell the same story. <br />2. Mr. Rushdie has a tendency to flaunt the same (admittedly) good ideas or puns over and over again. Example: the perforated sheet, when first introduced, is ingenious, and the initial narration quite funny and touching. But it gets too many repeated airings later, as if Mr. Rushdie believes that the reader is too dumb to get the symbolism.<br />3. The work lacks subtlety. Mr. Rushdie writes exuberantly, which is a good thing. However, he often overdid it, making no room for personal discovery of hidden treasures. In other words, the feeling one has out of second and (rarely) third reading is the same-ol and not infrequently, a mild revulsion at literary exhibitionism. Mr. Rushdie's eagerness, in my opinion, has resulted in several shortcomings in the plot. For instance, revealing Mary's \\""crime\\"" immediately after it was committed is not as good a strategy as delayed climax.<br />4. Some sybolism is confusing. Saleem is obviously portrayed as a symbol, witness, living (and then dying) embodiment of India with a Muslim heritage. But him being the bastard son of an Englishman and an accordianist's wife seems to confuse that. I can appreciate the implication that India is held up as a bastard of Britain by this parentage, but how that gets into the Muslim aspect is something I cannot sort out clearly (despite Saleem's upbringing by Amina, with a Christian twist through Mary). This lack of clarity, maybe intentional, is nonetheless a detraction from the novel, in my opinion. <br />In totality, M/C is a very good novel, and its Booker of Bookers, in my opinion, is deserved, in the sense that other Bookers are mostly mediocre to goodofferings.

Even then, cast a credulous cynicism that its author had only been a poor puppet, and who could impossibly be a writer of a book that is like a dream or an ineffable fable. I had imagined Midnight's Children this way and with Salman Rushdie drudging on this writing - it is quite sacrilegious to think , but pardon me, because indeed &quot;to understand just one life, I cant easily swallow the world&quot;. No, not this one so effortlessly because the reality/history that Rushdie had created is full of flamboyant Indianess, paradox, anachronism, fibs, magic, metaphor, humor, bawdy language, and imagination that are orchestrated in such a lavish way. Rushdie who has proven himself to be a master had so far successfully transmogrified himself to be invisible as the writer (at least for me).<br /> Most of the moments that I had spent with this novel were teeming with unsatisfaction with what I really seemed to comprehend, and while I was hovering above an &quot;illusion of understanding&quot;, the story is unheeding and unstoppable in its power to surprise me one instant, then to taunt me at another time and often really makes me laugh in its ludicrous lucidity. <br /> In the story, imagine a certain Saleem Sinai living with his life as a microcosm of the history of India. With his birth heralded by prime ministers and prophesied by wizards, and his life to be made as a template for a new beginning of an emerging nation, his life has become a fulcrum of contemplation of why what who how of a nation and its people. Saleems's life is told as a fictional autobiography with its armory of leitmotifs such as perforated sheets, silver spittoons, noses and knees, and pointing fingers. The outrageous and often fecund foreshadowing of paradoxes gyrate around the story's inevitabilities so that the whole work still maintains its serious appeal. A reader has to think beyond Saleem'slife, or so to speak, has to go beyond being just kicked out of the story in order to appreciate this work or else this outrageous fiction would just amount to any ordinary melodramatic tale. Any one might be impressed about how the life-story of Saleem is being narrated in front of an ever solicitous Padma- a character-audience who goads and pulls the writery-leash that Saleem inextricably pinioned on himself and who inevitably flavors the story by her moods, and unknowingly also instills suspense and gaping interest to the story. So that what lies between fiction and history? Further, I see a lot of its parallelism to other novels such as 100 Years of Solitude, but its similarity is being put in an elegant copy. I would  mostly hail this book among the other of Rushdie's works which I deem too ambitious to be true. <br /> And what about this chutnification of history? I really like this idea, and it reminds me of the &quot;gedanken&quot; or thought experiments that scientists use to explain a phenomenon that cant be proven by experiment, and yet can always be arrayed as truth.

One boy can jump through time at will.  Another can change sex.  The narrator can peer into others' thoughts, or at other times (surrounding an interesting plot device) can smell trouble through a remarkably sensitive nose.<br />The book's style is addictive.  The narrator liberally jumps into and out of his own story; he's reading it to his lover (Padma, a reference to Rushdie's own companion) as he rushes to tell the story before he disintegrates into 600 million pieces, as he foresees happening shortly.<br />Since the entire basis of the story are these magical children, the book is necessarily part fantasy.  (I've heard it compared to Garcia Marquez's ``magical realism&quot;, but I wouldn't know.)  As a result, Rushdie can take frequent flights of fancy into events that wouldn't make sense anywhere outside of Midnight's Children.  But it's all totally believable, because these children are all magical in their own way.<br />Midnight's Children is Rushdie's way of describing India as he sees it.  To him, the nation is part fantasy, part reality, part horror story.  Some of the horrific events in India's postcolonial past come off sounding unbelievable, which is why they fit into the fantasy-fiction construct so well.  One wonders throughout, ``Is this real, or is this India?&quot;  In this way, Rushdie's postmodern flights of fancy aren't just stylistic wankery; they serve a meaningful purpose in the plot.<br />This is certainly one of the most beautiful books I've ever read.  I went immediately from Midnight's Children into One Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich by Alexandr Solzhenitsyn, which is something like moving from six years of filet mignon into a day of cold gruel.

Many times, authors fail to live up to their fans' praises or their enemy's condemnations.  But Rushdie resists my attempts to dismiss him as an author whose success hinges solely on inflated emotions.<br /> Midnight's Children deals with some time shortly before and after India obtained its independence from England.  The novel leads slowly to the birth of its narrator, Saleem Sinai, who, incidentally, is born at midnight on the first day of an independent India.  After an incident in a hamper, Saleem's nose bestows him with a magical ability to communicate with all other Indian children born in the first hour of India's independent birth.  Hence, \\""Midnight's Children.\\""<br /> Rushdie's characters parody those found in certain sacred texts, so the derision he draws form religious figures is no surprise.  Mary and Joseph appear in the story.  But Joseph is a terrorist, and Mary, well, I do not want to give away that surprise.  She makes excellent chutney.<br /> The novel repeats frequently, for a purpose.  In order to produce a magical-realist allegory, Rushdie must iterate things over and over again until he has persuaded the reader of the correspondences between the quotidian and the privileged narrative of history.  Saleem's frequent interruptions in the narrative serve both implicitly and explicitly as moments of self-reflection.  A text that is self-aware and admits to its own faults is one that allows space for criticism and even invites it.  It is a sophisticated and mature authorship to deny one's own authorial power.<br /> Midnight's Children is especially useful for literature students looking for a fictional narrative of India's independence and struggle for self-identity.  He presents Saleem Sinai's India, and consequently, calls into question the privilege of so-called \\""objective histories.\\""  Might the truest histories, in fact, be the \\""subjective\\"" stories ofthe common people?

Granted, Rushdie's method with language doesn't make for easy or casual reading. Words meticulously chosen, assembled and invested with meaning tumble helter skelter onto the pages in dazzling and colourful rapid fire prose - &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; style - you really need to concentrate to understand and savour its riches.

Rushdie presents this novel as the autobiography of Saleem Sinai, writing from his current residence at a Bombay pickle factory under the critical eye of his frequently interruptive lover/fiance Padma.  <br />Saleem was born on the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the precise moment of India's independence from Great Britain and Pakistan's formation.  He and one thousand other babies (the Midnight's Children) born in India throughout the hour each has some supernatural power such as witchcraft, time travel, gender alteration, etc., or otherwise is simply a mutant.  Kind of like the X-Men, except they're too self-serving to band together and fight crime (and too bad, as there is a lot of narrative potential in this idea).    <br />Saleem routinely hides in a washing-chest in his house to find inner peace away from neighborhood kids who taunt him for his large misshapen nose and other odd facial features.  One day in the chest, he has a strange accident -- he sniffs a pajama cord up his nose, triggering an effect which causes him to hear voices in his head and realize he has telepathic powers.  By telepathy, he establishes communication with the (heretofore unknown to him) other Midnight's Children, but they prove unwilling to unite.  An operation performed on his nose to stop his severe dripping snot problem clears his nasal passages to reveal an uncanny olfactory ability, enabling him to sniff out emotions and ideas as well as smells.  <br />Saleem also gives an extensive background on his family, beginning with how his maternal grandparents met, up to his pyromaniac-turned-singing-star younger sister.  After his (Muslim) family relocates to Pakistan, almost all of them are killed in the 1965 India-Pakistan war, and in the 1971 war for the independence of Bangladesh, Saleem is conscripted in the Pakistani Army as a human bloodhound.<br />Eventually, Saleem marries Parvati, one of the Midnight's Children, the witch, who bears a child fathered by his arch enemy Shiva, another of the Midnight's Children, whose special attribute is his ability to crush people with his overdeveloped knees.  Shiva works as an agent for the government of India, who demand to know the indentities and whereabouts of all the Midnight's Children, and Saleem is the only one who can tell them...<br />Like E.L. Doctorow's &quot;Ragtime,&quot; &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; blurs the line between historical fact and fiction, weaving fantastic events against a realistic backdrop of a land in turmoil.  Saleem is an extraordinary character, not a hero in the traditional sense but a deformed symbol, a vessel for carrying and displaying the problems and hopes of the people of India.",2000-12-21

Rushdi's book is long and complex, and sometimes it is tough to get through.  However, it is not one of Penguin's Great Books of the 20th Century without reason.

Whether this is a reflection of the author in general or this book in particular I cannot say (for admittedly, this is the only book by Rushdie I have read to-date), but this book smacks of Grass' The Tin Drum in more than mere coincidental measures. While I am not the first to make this comparison between these two authors; I found the similarities between Midnight's Children and The Tin Drum to walk a dubious line (perhaps out of my own ignorance). The resemblances don't end in style alone but spill over into the story and the characters as well. There are even parts of the book (particularly some of the more poetic passages) which seemed to be &quot;lifted&quot; from the Tin Drum and reworked for Midnight's Children. Suffice it to say that I am not accusing Rushdie of plagiarism here, only suggesting, perhaps, an overlty ardent fawning over the great Mr. Grass. Likewise, I am not proposing that this is not a good book in it's own right or that it should not be read. It is and it should. I am merely recommending for those interested in reading this book (or the author) to read The Tin Drum first so that it may lend new perspective to Midnight's Children. These two works do make for an interesting comparison. Again a very good book, well-written, and definately worth the read, but for this reader it pales in comparison to its predecessor.",2000-10-28

It  is one of the greatest novels written in a long, long time.<br />The Booker  Prize, whether it be enough to justify the novel or not, is almost an  adequate judgement of the book.  Fifty years from now, when students of  Indian history and politics look back on the late 1900s, they might not  think much of &quot;Midnight's Children.&quot;  Fifty years from now, when  students of literature look back on the late 1900s, they will inevitably  think of Salman Rushdie and the achievement of &quot;Midnight's  Children.&quot;",1998-11-25

I can follow the story; it just isn't pleasant to read a novel written that way.<br /><br />The realization that Rushdie's writing was unbearable hit me when I read a chapter of his book, and then I picked up a copy of Death Comes for the Archbishop by Willa Cather. The difference between the two novels was so striking. Cather's prose is so beautiful, while you have Rushdie who is trying to see how many voices he can fit into one paragraph.<br /><br />I thought maybe there was something wrong with me, due to the fact the book has won so many awards. However, I think my sister hit it right on the nose, when she compared Rushdie's novel to the Emperor's New Clothes. Everyone wants to think there's something great contained in the pages, but the only thing there is a unique way of writing a story that leaves readers feeling like they've just been through the mental equivalent of the rack.<br /><br />My sister recommended The Jaguar by Salman Rushdie as an alternative to this novel. She said it proves he is capable of writing something a little more coherent.",2014-05-23

To get the mechanisms out of the way, I've started to read this novel more than once, and given up after 50 pages or so, confirmed in my belief that I don't like magic realism.  When I started listening to the novel in audio book form on a cross country road trip, however, I was immediately drawn in, and stayed that way from Savannah to southern California.  (Note: I only found one audio edition, narrated by Lyndam Gregory.  If you find another, go for Gregory).  Why it was so much more compelling in audio than on the page probably has more to do with me than with Rushdie, but if you are having trouble getting into this book, try listening to it.<br /><br />That said, I am so glad that I read this book, want to read it again, and want to read more by Rushdie.  What's so terrific about it?  First off, it is a great story.  The past, present and future of Saleem Sinai is a gripping family saga, a story of self discovery, and an endlessly entertaining parade of people and events.  I always wanted to know what would happen next, and the author is brilliant at keeping curiosity alive, telling us that something is going to happen, and then telling us what it is.  In this sense, and in the &#34;family saga&#34; aspect, it reminded me of the great Victorian British novelists -- I haven't read enough Dickens to know if Rushdie is Dickensian, but he certainly keeps the generations moving.<br /><br />Secondly, the political and social context -- or subtext -- is fascinating.  This is &#34;about&#34; the birth of modern India, the terrible Muslim/Hindu divide and the division of the state, the hangovers of British rule, the movement towards -- and away from -- democracy, a thousand and one things.  There was a lot of history that was new to me, and as another reviewer noted, it is helpful to check out characters and events on Wikipedia.<br /><br />Finally, the structure and the language are inspired, if at times overwhelming.  I recently attended an exhibition of Indian sculpture, and was amazed by the intensity of detail, details upon details upon details.  Rushdie does this, sometimes I felt that he was throwing the whole of India at me, and it was too much.  He also engages in constant word play, literary reference, internal jokes -- it goes on and on.  This is dangerous prose, but Rushdie pulls it off.<br /><br />Again, a great novel.rs and events on Wikipedia.<br /><br />Finally, the structure and the language are inspired, if at times overwhelming.
