A big book requires big time, and it's not always easy to remember at the end what happened at the beginning.  Then, too, especially in recent years, the author of a big book sometimes includes a lot of complicated tricks and confusing references and such, just to make it big.  And all too often you get to the end of a big book and realize that with all the stylistic experiments and linguistic games and such, the author sort of forgot to tie up all the loose ends, leaving you with more questions than you began with.  Who needs it?<br /><br />Well, of course, most big books don't have those problems, even the recent ones.  If you're considering \\"The Recognitions\\" and worrying about those issues, you can relax and go ahead.<br /><br />To be sure, there is a certain amount of literary trickery, and the sheer number of characters makes it hard to keep track of what's happening to who.  Nevertheless, it's fairly easy to keep the various plotlines straight.  Most of the characters have something to render them recognizable, too, and if you don't understand the obscure references, you don't really need them to understand what's going on.  So while it's not easy to read, it's not impossible, either.  A better question is, why read it at all?<br /><br />That's a question to be asked of any book, of course.  The difference is that \\"The Recognitions\\" seems to ask that question of itself.  That's the major theme, in fact - what's the good of any work of art, any system of belief, any life, when sooner or later you always, always find that it's inauthentic?<br /><br />The central plot, for instance,  concerns a young man named Wyatt Gwyon, descendant of generations of Massachusetts clergymen and an artist of talent, who finds himself making a living as an art forger for an unscrupulous dealer.  Is this a sin or a way of honoring the masters of the past?<br /><br />His acquaintances also seek some meaning in life for themselves, and like Wyatt, they generally find it through some pretence.  This bothers some of them - others couldn't care less.  Either way, whether they try to reconcile their inner and outer lives or just ignore the whole process, they all find themselves surrounded by falsehood.<br /><br />As for the literary tricks, one of the best things about \\"The Recognitions\\" is the way William Gaddis uses them to give us some insight into his characters and themes - they're not just there to show off.  My personal favorite joke is the fact that Wyatt is never called by name after the first couple of hundred pages.  Like I said, though, that's more than just a joke.  Considering that Wyatt spends a good part of his time trying to figure out who he is, the namelessness actually makes sense, and it's more effective to take away his name than it would be if the text just came right out and said \\"He didn't know who he was anymore\\" or something obvious like that.<br /><br />William Gaddis has drawn comparison to certain other writers, like James Joyce and Thomas Pynchon, who have used games and tricks to make serious points.  The comparison is fair, as far as it goes.  Gaddis had a different group of interests, though - you might say that while Joyce and Pynchon and some others look down through an oppressive world at the individual characters they create, Gaddis looks up from the point of view of his characters and their internal labyrinths toward the world at large.  Since most of these characters in their self-delusion are trying to impose their wills on that world, that bottom-up approach tells us a great deal.<br /><br />This is the first Gaddis novel I've read - I'm told that in some of his later work, the individual characters manage to put one over on the system, but that certainly isn't the case here.  To the extent that any of these people find any meaning for themselves in life, it's by inventing individual ways of living, pretty much ignoring all other considerations  - incidentally confusing the living daylights out of those around them, who try to fit into the manner of life imposed on them from elsewhere.<br /><br />So do any of these characters find a genuine way of life in a world full of counterfeits?  That, as they say, would be telling.  Suffice to say that, since pretty nearly everyone and everything in the world of \\"The Recognitions\\" is something other than what they seem, and since what you find under the surface also isn't what it seems ad infinitum, the only way anyone here can find anything genuine is not by avoiding the fakes, but by going through them.<br /><br />That sounds like the way things go in real life, too - you have to deal with the fakes to get to the real stuff, if there is any such thing.  It's a tough road, and as we all know, some people never recognize it, never mind taking it.  I'll bet it's easier to recognize that path once you've been through a book like this one, which may indeed make it worth reading close to a thousand pages.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, Believe it or not, reading good books is good practice for life.round them, who try to fit into the manner of life imposed on them from elsewhere.

The gist of the book emerges here and there, just like \\"recognitions,\\" not all at once, in sequence, or in bulk, but every now and then, not well-formed or even coherent.  That we live in a miasma of forgery is clear to few.  Most of us are so imbedded in myth and its rote that we cannot percieve, much less understand, our lot.  Gaddis pokes at our fraudulent lives.    The book is a satire on a mythological scale.  The bishops wear skirts to appear feminine and demure, but with a \\"thousand yards of material up their sleeves in South America.\\"  Aunt May is done in by technology in a single beautiful sentence.  Homosexuality threads throughout the book and is as fundamental to religion as it is to art.  (One would benefit by reading \\"The Lives of the Saints\\" along-side this work.)      Gaddis exposes the inauthentic on every page, and there are a thousand of them.  His skill with words is exceptional: alliterations, allusions, metaphor, rhythms, melody, all music.      In Gaddis, the consequences of forgery are revealed over generations.  They are cataclysmic.  But forgery is the inevitable side effect of eating of the tree of knowledge and building the tower of Babel, as mankind, in its terror, is driven to know, speak -- continually giving new names to old values -- and dissemble; anything to avoid the ultimate recognition.  Thus, the birth and renewal of religion.     I advocate, in the name of Gaddis, who would certainly appreciate it, that sweatshirts, hats, bumber stickers, tatoos, and other paraphernalia, be printed up and marketed commemorating this book.  We live in the world of marketing as surely as we believe we understand ourselves.  Read the book and live it out!	2007-08-30

Witness the first reactions to Joyce, Lawrence or even Beethoven. Gaddis' big novel is a homage to Joyce's 'Ulysses' and shows why all great art is a form of imitation, for how more differently can you portray truth? The book itself rises to bring down the walls of the fakes all around whose 'originality' never surpasses banality.	1998-05-17
