US,41647362,RXN62SZ9U3L95,0060153679,535077019,"Under the Volcano",Books,5,4,4,N,N,"Epitaph of 20th century","If you could pick one book for the summer, what book would that be? Guessing none of you would say Lowry’s “Under the Volcano”, or Dante’s trilogy, or Ulysses or anything that even remotely resembles mid-century modernism. There’s something odd in that picture in which you’re sipping your Mai-Tai’s, half-staring at half-naked people on the beach while reading some edition of French nouveau roman. James Bond would cringe. So would the editors of Cosmopolitan. I’m no different, books like Lowry’s “Under the volcano” need a different type of time to “properly” enjoy them. With kids screaming around, sun block smearing your body and wet splotches coming out of nowhere it just isn’t done.<br /><br /> Still, this summer was different. For some reason I can’t quite recall, Lowry’s book was the only book I managed to pack (no Kindle yet, unfortunately). Suffice it to say, it was a challenge. Delving into a mind of an alcoholic, bent on self-destruction, getting pulled into sinister circle of impending doom all the while trying to relax and dissociate oneself from the “burdens of civilization” left at the workplace. I’m quite sure I missed half of the references and ignored other half of symbolic cyphering crammed up in this text. Whatever the context was though, I didn’t spend years studying literature for nothing (well…if you ask my mother about that…), some skill still remained. It usually kicks in automatically whenever a spider-sense says it should take notice.<br /><br /> Readers familiar with modernism should know what to expect though I’m not sure that Lowry is the best place to start for others. Then again, no modernist book is “good to start with” in a same manner in which, I don’t know, Tolkien is a good place to start if you want to familiarize yourself with epic fantasy. Lowry requires effort, and it isn’t shy in asking for it. There are more demanding books (of the same…let’s call it a genre just for the hell of it) out there - “Under the Volcano” almost comes off as simple compared to some – though if you’ve never seen something like this it will be…well, difficult. Long paragraphs without break, winding thought and constant shifting of focus, unstable perception, disintegration of narrative combined with “unlikable characters” and quite elliptic structure, no humor or any sort of “relaxing mechanism”, despair, delirium, dread, self-destruction – you get the picture. “Under the Volcano” doesn’t like shiny, happy people.<br /><br /> If you manage to plow your way through the text though, it will come off as rewarding (and you’ll just have to take my word for it). There’s beauty in a way Lowry construct his text. There’s beauty in a destruction even. If you stretch your imagination for just a bit, you can even see glimpses of the world that had come, that inevitably had to come, after the text and the author had long been gone. In a way, “Under the Volcano” can be seen as a love story. Much truer than any love story featuring pink covers with sequin dresses and finely trimmed, powerful men. Lowry wrote a biographical fantasy. Fantasy so dark that no sane mind wants to dream the dreams it is consisted of. In a way it’s an epitaph of 20th century. It’s been fifteen years since we embarked on a new and wondrous journey towards a space age that is yet to come, but epitaph is still standing and will continue to stand. As a memory, as a warning, as an unwanted dream that came true for quite a few.hell of it) out there - “Under the Volcano” almost comes off as simple compared to some – though if you’ve never seen something like this it will be…well, difficult.

However, if someone told me they'd tossed it after five pages, I'd understand totally. Not that there is an intellectual baseline for enjoying it; rather, it's a question of the style of book one enjoys. This book is an elegy, a tone poem, prose for the sake of prose. Where one word suffices, Lowry inserts two. Where one metaphor is appropriate, Lowry inserts three. The stylization and the facility with words are the genius of the book, not the plot.

I do still maintain that it is not the equal of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre in the &quot;great American novel of Mexico&quot; category.<br />The Consul, Geoffrey Firmin, is an alcoholic living in Mexico.  He has divorced his wife, Yvonne, who had an affair with his half-brother Hugh, a journalist &amp; supporter of the Communists in the Spanish Civil War.  Now Hugh &amp; Yvonne have returned, separately, to visit him on the Day of the Dead.  By the end of the day, the Consul has been murdered by Mexican security forces who think he's a  spy.<br />I'm still not sure I understand what Lowry's trying to say, but I'll take a stab at it.  It seems that the Consul represents the West, paralyzed by neuroses and unable or unwilling to come to the aid of those in need.  The volcano of the title would seem to represent the specter of Fascism that looms on the horizon.  This image of impending doom recurs in the movie at the local theater, Los Manos De Orlac or The Hands of Orlac--the classic film about a pianist who receives a murderers hands in a transplant.  Orlac would be Germany, a great culture turned murderous.<br />Lowry does a great job of rendering this sense of doom and, in the Consul, gives us one of the great fictional portraits of a drunk in all of literature. However, the book ultimately adds up to less than the sum of it's parts.<br />GRADE: C- (or B+)",2000-10-30

At least it shows my own prejudice in favour of a novel which is probably out of favour today, and not sufficiently read by a new generation in search of, or besieged by, a devil within. A novel that can be read on many levels, it also contains pungent writing that carries the odours of a world that has been all but banished from North America today. It is, if you like, an unclean world, in which much is to be expected, little obtained. Whether from the religious rites, with all their devotions and ecstasies, or the characters who are more familiar to us (and who are sometimes smiling shyly to us from the edges of other novels by Graham Greene or Gabriel Garcia Marquez), much is promised, little given. But, as for the characters themselves, the disappointment that may greet us is only transitory, leaving us to march the march of faith on our own terms, and carry whatever remnant of the garment of civilisation we have managed to save to the last, on our voyage into the heart of this epic novel. And there lies its great strength; it is a novel with a beating, living, enervating heart and those who remain for the journey will surely be marked by it, as by all literature of this calibre.",2000-04-09

Is it more than the best account of dipsomania in         literature? Or is it a somewhat timed portrayal of  sick 1920's and 30's Mexico and Europe, a modern anti-hero and the  breakdown of values akin        to &quot;Ulysses&quot; and  &quot;Wasteland&quot;? I read it as a tragedy of disintegration and despair  with some very lucid brilliance shining through. The scholars have a good  reason to call &quot;Ulysses&quot; the greatest novel of the twentieth  century. I didn't get past page 200 and Molly's soliloquy on first attempt  either despite good guides. With material like this there's probably no  harm in seeing a serious film adaptation to get at least at the plot  surface.  A university professor once invited her Joyce seminar class to  her house in Berkeley to show us a very old black and white  &quot;Ulyssses&quot; film. It was terrific. We all enjoyed it.

Readers of this review may feel that I'm too  negative, too critical, or just trying to &quot;look smart&quot;, but what  to say when you really don't like a book ?  I think I could write two  reviews of UNDER THE VOLCANO.  The first would be for people under 30 who  haven't read a lot of &quot;great&quot; literature.  For such readers,  especially if they are interested in the wandering thought swirls of people  under the influence of great amounts of alcohol, this could be a decent  novel of the 4 star variety.  There are certainly some brilliant passages.  The concept is unusual, the small-town Mexican setting vividly portrayed.  These readers can pick up (or get impressed by) large numbers of extremely  rare words in the English language--reboant, tabid, winze, floriferous,  plangently, crepuscular, imbricated, lithurge, syncope, etc.---as well as  numerous passages which will test their knowledge of Spanish, French, or  German.  When you are just setting sail on the great ocean of literature, a  book like this might prove a thrilling ride, so maybe you should give it a  try.  Read another review or two.<br />If you are over 30 or have read a good  amount of &quot;classical&quot; literature, then I have to warn you,  Lowry's novel reads like F. Scott Fitzgerald or Hemingway in writing  school---before they learned how to cut things down.  Joyce and Faulkner  got away with run-on sentences containing clauses that had absolutely  nothing to do with the original topic, and that can be effective in  anyone's work, but Lowry ain't no Joyce or Faulkner.  It's a very youthful  book, despairing youth perhaps, youth overshadowed by a coming war, by the  futility of action at such a time, but youth nonetheless.  Though adults,  the characters resemble youth too much.  They lack a certain resigned  cynicism or sense of irony, they are still sincere, ill-focussed, and  petulant about the past.  Finally, this book lacks much of a plot.  The  &quot;action&quot; takes place in the last third of the book only.  I grew  tired of messing about in the minds of Hugh and Geoffrey.  It may be, as  people say, a novel about the breakdown of values in the 1930s and '40s,  but it is most of all a work that needed refining, a work that attempted to  be too much, that lost its way in the flood of words.the characters resemble youth too much.
