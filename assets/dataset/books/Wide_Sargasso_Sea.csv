She enjoyed moderate success as a writer during the 1920s and 1930s, when her works were compared to those of Katherine Mansfield and Elizabeth Bowen, two other female writers who, like her, made their homes in England but were not actually born there. (Mansfield was a New Zealander, Bowen Irish and Rhys was from the Caribbean island of Dominica). After her fourth book “Good Morning, Midnight” was published in 1939, however, she became a recluse, ceased publishing her work and lived in obscurity. She was widely assumed to have died and one magazine article even referred to her as “the late Jean Rhys”. Then, in 1966, great excitement was caused in the literary world by her emergence from obscurity and the publication of her novel “Wide Sargasso Sea”.<br /><br />Most of the great nineteenth century novelists rather inconsiderately failed to provide us with sequels to their works, so creating an obvious gap in the market for those readers who want to know, for example, “What happened to Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy after their marriage?” In recent years, however, this gap has been filled by modern writers anxious to pen sequels to the classics; the question posed in my previous sentence has, I understand, been answered several times. Jean Rhys was doing the same sort of thing in the sixties, except that “Wide Sargasso Sea” is not a sequel to “Jane Eyre” but a prequel.<br /><br /> Rhys imagines the question “What happened to Mr Rochester’s first wife Bertha before, and immediately after, their marriage?” She does so by making a few changes to the plot of “Jane Eyre”.  Charlotte Bronte never precisely dated her novel, but the mainaction seems to be taking place during the 1800s and 1810s; Rhys moves it forward in time and her novel takes place in the late 1830s, a few years after the 1833 emancipation of the slaves in the British-ruled West Indies. She renames her heroine Antoinette Cosway and makes her the daughter of an English Creole father from Jamaica and a French Creole mother from Martinique. The word “Creole” later came to mean a person of mixed race, but its original meaning (from the Spanish “criollo”) was a white person born in the Americas of pure European descent, and it is in this sense that both Bronte and Rhys use the word. (Rhys herself was a Creole in this sense).<br /><br />In “Jane Eyre” Bertha Mason was described as a wealthy heiress, but here the Cosway family, despite being plantation owners, are not well off, and their financial difficulties are made worse by the abolition of slavery. Antoinette’s wealth (and her use of the surname “Mason”) derives from her mother’s second marriage to a Mr Mason after the death of her father; Richard Mason in this version is therefore Antoinette’s stepbrother rather than a blood relation. The name “Bertha” is one given to Antoinette by her husband, for unknown reasons. The novel tells Antoinette’s story from her youth to her unhappy marriage to an English gentleman who is never actually named but who is clearly modelled upon Edward Rochester in “Jane Eyre”. Although Antoinette (as in “Jane Eyre”) is originally from Jamaica, an island Rhys had never actually visited, most of the story takes place in her native Dominica.<br /><br />Rhys clearly did not consider herself bound to follow Bronte’s plot slavishly, but offers us a new twist on the familiar story, a twist in which Antoinette/Bertha is the heroine rather than a foul-tempered and unchaste fury and Rochester is an unsympathetic character, more a villain than Bronte’s flawed hero. Of course, this twist can only be achieved by some substantial rewriting. In this version it is implied that Rochester has Antoinette declared mad because that is the most convenient way to dispose of a wife who has become a burden to him; in the original novel it would have been in his interests for Bertha to have been declared sane, because he could then have divorced her for adultery.<br /><br />Rhys was obviously aiming at something more ambitious than a mere prequel to a literary classic. “Wide Sargasso Sea” is often described as a “postcolonial” novel and as an exploration of oppression on the grounds of race, class and sex. That is, however, an interpretation which I find problematic. The problem is that this is a “postcolonial” novel told from the viewpoint of a member of a ruling caste. Antoinette may be disadvantaged by reason of her sex, but no more so than any other woman in early Victorian Britain or the British colonies. By reason of race and class, the white Creoles of the Caribbean formed a privileged elite. There may have been certain cultural differences between the established Creole families and more recent British arrivals, and tensions arising from economic rivalry, but this does not qualify the Creoles as victims of imperialism. Indeed, in this book their main complaint seems to be that those interfering politicians in London had firstly abolished slavery and secondly failed to pay enough compensation to the former slave owners. (It should be noted that no compensation was actually offered to the slaves themselves).<br /><br />I felt that “Wide Sargasso Sea” does not really work as a self-contained novel rather than as a riposte to “Jane Eyre”. Too much is either left unstated or left to the reader’s knowledge of Bronte’s book. Rhys uses multiple-narrator technique, and although Antoinette is the protagonist more of the story is told (oddly) from Rochester’s viewpoint than from hers. (Another, very brief, section is narrated by Grace Poole). Some important developments, such as the descent of Antoinette’s mother into madness are treated in insufficient detail and, even more crucially, it is never really made clear exactly why the marriage of Antoinette and Rochester, initially seemingly a loving one, should so quickly have ended in bitterness and mutual animosity. The novel’s best feature is Rhys’s ability to conjure up the sultry, tropical atmosphere of her homeland, but I could not really recommend this book to those who are not already familiar with “Jane Eyre”. Even those who are may think that it does not add much to their appreciation of Bronte’s classic.",2014-01-22

The wages of sin, the sin of slavery, are literally death in some cases, but the core theme that Rhys examines is the insanity of both the mother and the daughter. She also explores the inevitable interracial sexual relations, and the children of such relationships. Also there are the terribly distorted economic and social relations, post-slavery, between the races. Can whites ever feel safe in their own beds without barring the bedroom door, given the legacy of injustice?

We had been discussing Jane Eyre and Bertha - the mad woman in the attic, and batting around various theories.  One of the theories that caught my interest was how Bertha was the parts of Jane that she had suppressed through years of practice.  This was brought to mind especially with the similarities between the two characters.  But then, once again, the title of Wide Sargasso Sea was put onto the board and I remembered that this was one I wanted to read.<br /><br />Then, fairly recently, an article was posted to Twitter of \\""modern literary adaptations\\"" of classics that should be read.

The Masculine<br /> The historical criticism of Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea has focused largely on either postcolonial or feminist readings of the text.  The dialogue has been so focused on claiming the text, the author, or the protagonist that it has become known as \\""the Helen of our wars\\"" by the Barbadian critic Kamau Braithwaite (qtd in Su 388).  There is, I feel a critical approach missing from the debate.  Carine Mardorossian states, \\""[Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea] constantly thwarts an easy identification with the white Creole protagonist\\"" (1071).  As a male reader, I can understand this lack of identification with Antoinette.  From this standpoint, I propose a masculinist reading of Wide Sargasso Sea.  The critical debate over the text has washed over the main male character and has made him represent many different things to many different people.  Usually his appearance is structured as representing the dominate ruling class ideology, oppressing the minority group that the particular reading is trying to claim the text for, either as masculine power or the empirical dominance.  However, I argue otherwise.  The character is not powerful as representative of anything within the text.  Caroline Rody notes, \\""Rhys rewrites him as an anonymous, lost voice in a place where the very existence of his fatherland is questioned\\"" (219).  Antoinette's husband has no home that he is able to move comfortably within the text.  A sympathetic reading towards the main male character is possible in a masculinist reading of Wide Sargasso Sea: this will be done by examining the Rhys's work in context with Jane Eyre, and then the focus of the paper will be an examination of Antoinette's madness and the possible actions available to her husband.<br /> A sense of trepidation creeps over the soul of the critic who might want to wave a flag and claim a masculine reading of any text, as any reading issuing forth might easily be construed as latently masculine.  An acknowledgement of power structures is in no way inherently misogynistic.  Noted feminist critic Nina Baym repudiated the entire formulation of feminist theory, noting that it \\""addresses an audience of prestigious male academics and attempts to win its respect\\"" (45). At the time of her writing, even having to identify as feminist created acknowledgement of the power structure.  Feminist theorist claimed status as outsiders, but still recreate the structure found within the dominant taxonomy: \\""This repetition of authoritarian structures betrays an infatuation with male forms and deconstructs the feminist project\\"" (Baym 45).  As Baym was writing in the in the 1980's, it is evident from this defense that much has changed in the criticism since that time, as an openly masculine take needs its own justification.<br /><br />II. The Wide Sargasso Sea Stands Alone.<br />Many commentators on Wide Sargasso Sea have debated on the role that the novel plays when considered in context with Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre.  The main question being: Are Bertha and Edward Rochester were indeed the same characters as Antoinette and her husband from the text of Wide Sargasso Sea?  To determine this, one of the easiest ways to disconnect the two sets would be to demonstrate a temporal discontinuity between the texts, a task easy to do.  In Wide Sargasso Sea, there is only place where the time is tied down concretely, \\""I will write my name in fire red, Antoinette Mason, n&eacute;e Cosway, Mount Cavalry Convent, Spanish Town, Jamaica, 1839\\"" (31).  It is at this point the reader knows the date and can place the text within its historical context.<br />This historical context, however, is not quite the one present in Bronte's work, \\""When she set out to rewrite Jane Eyre, Rhys deliberately shifted dates to write about post-emancipation times; indeed, Jane Eyre's acquisition of the recently published Marmion locates the events occurring in Bronte's novel around 1808 and not after 1833\\"" (Mardorossian 1086).  From this information, it is easy to separate the two texts.  If the events of Jane Eyre were happening in 1808, it would be impossible for Antoinette Cosway Mason to be even alive when Thornfield estate was burning and Bertha Mason Jumped from the roof, since \\""[Antoinette] would have been born in 1822 or 1823, well before the emancipation act, which did not go into effect for another year after its enactment in 1833\\"" (Erwin 209).<br />  The fact that this is even a question within the scholarship on Wide Sargasso Sea implies that there is a familiarity with Bronte's text even before approaching Rhys's work.  Michael Thorpe argues in part, that if there was a connection, \\""[Rhys] did not assume that her readers' remembrance would be anything but dim, and perhaps composed of stereotypes\\"" (173).  This knowledge allows the reader to approach the text with little, if any, bias, as Thorpe reads the connections as tenuous. This can be important for any reading of the text.  Within a masculinist reading though, this lack of bias is extremely important as Rhys crafted the character of the husband to be a black slate, an enigma that can receive many of the masculinist reader's projections.  The disconnection also frees him from the sins and transgressions of Edward Rochester and allows him to be answerable only to his own actions.  For this matter to be settled, it can be illuminating to go back to authorial intent.  Over the course of the decades Rhys worked on this slim novel, she had many different names intended for the text, including The First Mrs. Rochester.  In her mind there was a connection, but in a letter to her editor, Francis Wyndham, as the novel as nearing completion in 1964, \\""I think there were several Antoinettes and Mr. Rochesters. Indeed, I am sure.  Mine is not Miss Bronte's, though much suggested by `Jane Eyre'\\"" (Letters 140 emphasis mine).  From the words of Miss Rhys, it is finally possible to separate the two texts, and declaim along with Sandra Drake, \\""the novel stands on its own\\"" (149).<br /><br />III. Its Madness<br /> The character of Antoinette's husband has no champion easily seen in the history of the criticism, even though he can be read sympathetically in the text of Wide Sargasso Sea.  The readerly projection available for the masculine reader of the text allows the reader to become the character.  He has no name, no history.  Whatever the masculine reader wants him to be, he can become.  Although there are points in the text where a readerly identification with the character can cause discomfort, by and large he is a sympathetic character, a victim both of the system of primogeniture that sends him out to the West Indies to seek his fortune and of a wife suffering from mental illness.<br /> Yes, mental illness.  Although modern systems of psychiatric categorization were not available in the time period in which Antoinette lives, the systems were around when Rhys was writing Wide Sargasso Sea.  It can be too facile to construct Antoinette as \\""crazy,\\"" but there seems, in the historical imagination, a binary between sane/not sane.  Humanity has a tradition of fascination with mental illness, in part because it is possible to define what you are by what you are not. Michel Foucault notes that \\""[Western Culture] maintained a profound, passionate relationship with mental illness, perhaps difficult to formulate for ourselves, but impenetrable to anyone else, in which we confronted dangers most vivid to us as well as what was perhaps the truth closest to us\\"" (292).  On the edge of the binary every person walks, and with every passing decade, the named pathways for slippage increase.  Crazy, insane, and mad have blossomed out and diversified into many well-defined categories and sub-categories of mental impairment.  With this knowledge, it becomes possible to recast the historical imagination and address the accusation of John J. Su in his discussion of the text, namely:<br /> The absence of any medical basis for his accusation, not to mention his curious unwillingness to seek out a `cure' for her, reminds readers that applying the category of insanity to women has historically been a means of enforcing cultural and religious values on them as much as a diagnosis of physiological or psychic pathology (391).<br /> While it can be argued that the classical first step in subjugating a class, gender, or race is to remove their humanity, this is not entirely at issue here.  Instead, in this context, there is a definable medical basis, and through a historical lens, the curiously unwilling search for a cure is not so \\""curious.\\""<br /><br />IV. More Precisely, Its Schizophrenia<br />Elizabeth Abel, in her article, \\""Women and Schizophrenia: The Fiction of Jean Rhys,\\"" identifies a thread running through the entire fiction corpus of Rhys in which all of her significant heroines are afflicted with madness that can be constructed by modern standards and defined as schizophrenia.  She speaks generally about her texts, but Abel is still able to determine that madness is the central issue in Wide Sargasso Sea (172), and that more specifically her heroines:<br />Manifest several specific symptoms of schizophrenia: impoverished affect, apathy, obsessive thought and behavior coupled with the inability to take real initiative, a sense of the unreality of both the world and self, and a feeling of detachment from the body (156).<br />Abel begins her examination by looking at the degeneration of Rhys's characters: \\""Although Rhys describes her heroines' progressive degeneration, often in excruciating detail, she fails to provide an adequate explanation for this process\\"" (156).  It is through this thought process that Abel conveys realization that her heroines are schizophrenic; they \\""experience the world as a hostile environment and lead lives of isolation, detached from family and friends, unable to establish real contact with others\\"" (156).  This isolation is important for the development of Wide Sargasso Sea...  Antoinette is seen early in part one, after the incident where Tia steals her three pennies and her dress, exclaiming, \\""Visitors! I dragged up the steps unwillingly -- I had longed for visitors once, but that was years ago\\"" (Rhys 14).  The reader is able to see that she is directed inward, at an early point in her life, before she encounters her future husband or even her stepfather.  Her young psyche is still under construction and this divide between her self and other has been so internalized that she can recognize a point when she wanted human contact, but in a distant past. This sentiment is echoed by Carine Mardorossian, noting, \\""The first section of the novel abounds in scenes that show Antoinette's inability to comprehend the relationships between the few individuals that people her world\\"" (1072).  Not only is Antoinette isolated, she would not know how to identify relational structures if she wanted to.<br /> The discussion of the disease in Abel's article continues on issues of causation, where \\""schizophrenia is a legitimate and not uncommon response to certain interpersonal interactions\\"" (157).  These are often traumatic events to the subject, Abel explains, \\""Because the real self attempts to remain unembodied in order to escape the threats to its identity, it tends to grow increasingly detached from concrete things\\"" (158).  Antoinette's sense of identity is at issue in part one of Wide Sargasso Sea.  The best illustration of this identity crisis is her relationship with Tia.  Even after being called \\""white cockroach\\"" by Tia, young Antoinette continues to identify with the native child. But the act of violence in the scene at Coulibri between the two physically separates the two:  \\""I saw the jagged stone in her hand but I did not see her throw it. ...We stared at each other, blood on my face, tears on hers.  It was as if I saw myself.  Like in a looking-glass\\"" (Rhys 27).  Even with this act of violence, Antoinette identifies with Tia more than any other character in the book.  An important note is this is the last place the reader sees Tia as a concrete defined character and not as part of Antoinette's constructed world within the text.  This identification puts Antoinette into this vague middle ground where \\""she is not b&eacute;k&eacute; like you but she is b&eacute;k&eacute; and not like us either\\"" (93) in the words of Christophine.  Antoinette is left in the lurch, and had no real reference point from which to begin constructing a `real' self.<br />This scene is the defining point in the text, as Antoinette wakes up from her fever brought on by the incident with Tia, and her biggest concern is the mark on her head: \\""`My head is bandaged up.  It's so hot,' I said. `Will I have a mark on my forehead?'  `No, no.' [Aunt Cora] smiled for the first time. `That is healing very nicely.  It won't spoil you on your wedding day'\\"" (Rhys 28).  Besides foreshadowing Antoinette's upcoming wedding, the concern for the mark on her head allows for an amazing moment of clarity from Antoinette later in part two, \\""But I think it did spoil me for my wedding day and all the other days and nights\\"" (Rhys 80).  Rhys shows that Antoinette is still capable of self-knowledge, humanizing her somewhat, but that knowledge is that she has been allowed to spoil.  Important again is all of these events happened prior to the arrival of the unnamed husband into the text.<br />This humanizing self-knowledge sets Antoinette up in opposition of the construct that society structures around her.  \\""Antoinette, like Rhys's other heroines, is necessarily split between the image thrust on her and her own knowledge of herself.\\"" (Abel 172).  Antoinette is identified as unbalanced in the later section of part one by a menacing child in the street: \\""`Look the crazy girl, you crazy like your mother .  Your aunt frightened to have you in the house.  She send you for the nuns to lock up'\\"" (Rhys 29).  This construct is self-fulfilling.  The more Antoinette is isolated, the more she internalizes the mental divide, and the more reason there is keep her separate from larger society.  Antoinette searches for identity throughout the text: \\""I have been too unhappy, I thought, it cannot last, being so unhappy, and different things will happen to me.... In that bed I will dream the end of my dream\\"" (Rhys 66-7).  Sadly, she knows that her own trauma is an exponential function, and that the dream must end.<br />Like most exponential functions, the logical conclusion is infinity, or the highest point possible.  It is at this high point, England at the top the world that Antoinette is sequestered at the close of Rhys's novel.  At this point of her self- deterioration, can the reader find the most outward manifestations of her disease: \\""Antoinette's schizophrenic symptoms are quite identifiable: she ultimately loses all sense of time and comes to gauge reality by private criteria.\\"" (Abel 173). In conversation with Grace Poole, Antoinette says, \\""Only I know how long I have been here.  Nights and days and days and nights, hundreds of them slipping through my fingers.  But that does not matter time has no meaning\\"" (Rhys 109).  She has totally turned inward.  The outside world has very little meaning anymore, and the chronology the rest of society has fallen apart for Antoinette.  So has her vague sense of place: \\""That afternoon we went to England.  There was grass and olive-green water and tall trees looking into the water.  This, I though, is England. If I could be here I'd get well again and the sound in my head would stop\\"" (Rhys 109).  The world is cracking around her; there is no identification.  Judith Raiskin identifies that \\""Antoinette continues to split the idea of England in two, maintaining an idea of an idyllic England separate from the reality of the England that has denied her freedom and civil rights\\"" (256).  Antoinette has entered the looking glass.<br />And from the looking glass, she turns around and sees herself, not as she has constructed in her mind, but as others see her. \\""It was then that I saw her - the ghost.  The woman with streaming hair.  She was surrounded by a gilt frame but I knew her\\"" (Rhys 111-2).  In the mirror Antoinette can see the ghost of the woman she once was, but not the idea of the self she has constructed in her own mind.  Remember, this is in her dream; this is in a world she once called \\""Hell\\"" (RHYS 36) in a more cogent time.  In this, the end of her dream, she sees Tia, and the old way of life, and wants to escape, to return to an idyllic place that never existed except in her own mind.  In this sense, \\""Antoinette's `real' death is not a demented suicide in the flames of Thornfield hall.  That projected death is really only the one `everyone knows about'\\"" (Drake 200).  Antoinette has long been dead to the world.  What began with Tia, was compounded with her husband, and has reached what can be constructed in the schizophrenic mind as the logical end, where \\""I know why I was brought here and what I have to do\\"" (Rhys 112).<br />The novel closes with Antoinette walking away, certain of herself for the first time in the text of Wide Sargasso Sea.  The decontextualization of the novel with Bronte's text creates an ambiguous place, where the reader cannot be certain why she was brought there or what she has to do.  Antoinette has always calmly accepted her dreams, even if frightening.  The dreams have served as prophecy to her, beyond her control.  However, after awakening from such dreams, she has a new sense of agency, knowledge of self stronger than previously seen in the text.  She may fulfill the prophetic dreams and alight to the spire, but she could also walk out the front door, to the England she always wanted to see.<br /><br />V. What is to be Done?<br /> Rhys allows the reader close contact with Antoinette's husband.  Michael Thorpe says. \\""Part Two, which takes us at once into his consciousness, makes possible a sympathetic insight into him also\\"" (178).  This part, in fact includes most of the book, so much so that the reader is able to see many sides of the character, even if he remains this nameless cipher.  Two points in the text illustrate the character's moral fiber in which he will do nice things for those less fortunate than him.<br /> The first illustration in the text is a conversation between the character and Richard Mason prior to the wedding of Antoinette and her husband.  \\""`She won't marry you.' ... I said, `If she won't, she won't.  She can't be dragged to the altar.  Let me get dressed.  I must hear what she has to say'\\"" (Rhys 46).  At this point, right as the reader is getting to know the character, he allows himself the possibility of doing something selfless in the name of her happiness and desires.  This selfless act might free Antoinette from herself, but that speculation goes beyond this examination.<br />This same man is gentle and caring with even the smallest, most helpless creatures.  When a moth falls into a candle flame: \\""I took the beautiful creature up in my handkerchief and put it on the railing.  For a moment it was still and by the dim candlelight I could see the soft brilliant colors, the intricate pattern on the wings.  I shook the handkerchief gently and it flew away\\"" (Rhys 48).  He is able to admire beauty and treat with kindness even the smallest animals.  One could consider the actions to foreshadow the plot, where Antoinette is a small moth, wanting to be set free.<br />When these aspects of the character are taken into account, his plans to \\""go back to Jamaica to consult the Spanish Town doctors and her brother,\\"" (Rhys 96) should be given the full benefit of the doubt.  He states later that he will follow that advice (ibid).  Wide Sargasso Sea's chronology is hard to locate, as discussed earlier, the time jump between the last two parts could reasonably have months or years.  One can assume there was the consultation of the doctors on the best care that could be given to Antoinette at the time, and part three represents the given advice.  To examine this idea, it would be illuminating to look at a possible alternative to the comparatively humane treatment she receives at the hands of husband: incarceration in London's famed Bethlem hospital perhaps as representative of care Antoinette would receive elsewhere.<br />Since the period of the novel cannot be firmly placed generalizations will have to suffice on this point, but should be illuminating as there is a sense of glacial change in the way the mad were treated until the rise of modern psychotherapy and the rise of pharmacology.  Schizophrenia had not been formally identified as a disorder, so a broadening of the boundaries will open the gates to the point where Antoinette is \\""mad\\"" once more.<br />In this history of Bethlem hospital, Roy Porter notes, \\""Between 1728 and 1852, Bethlem's physician's all came from the Monro family ... Continuity was the keynote.  They brought in a few therapeutic innovations - cold and hot baths for instance - but Bethlem's mainstays were the familiar purgatives and emetics, with a routine spring bloodletting, and manacles for the troublesome\\"" (42).  This shows that hospitals, even London's Royal Hospital, were using medieval devices for treatment.  Not medieval in a hyperbolic sense, but in a literal sense.  To think that madness could be treated with such methods strikes the contemporary reader as disturbing at the least.<br /> Porter describes that there have been constant scandals at the treatment of the inmates and the conduct of the supervisors at Bethlem for almost as long as it has been in existence.  After one of these minor outrages, a parliamentary committee toured the facility in 1815, and took notes on the sights seen within:<br />`We first proceeded to visit the women's galleries,' testified Wakefield, `One side of the rooms contained about ten patients, each chained by one arm or leg to the wall.  The chain allowing them merely to stand up by the bench or form fixed to the wall, or to sit down on it.  The nakedness of each patient was covered by a blanket-gown only.' (Edward Wakefield qtd in Porter 43).<br />Compared to the contemporary measures taken for those identified as mad, Antoinette's confinement is seen in rather comfortable terms.  She is free to move about her room, and possess clothing.  There are no chains or manacles, only locks.  Her keeper is sympathetic to her plight, knowing the \\""world outside can be a black and cruel world to a woman\\"" (Rhys 106).<br /> Antoinette's keeper, Grace Poole, brings the discussion back to the husband's magnanimous nature.  His concern to keep his wife in the best possible situation makes him pay Poole \\""double, treble the money\\"" (Rhys 105) if she is good enough and maintains consistency in her care.  His situation is not one to be envied, and he knows it.  Ultimately, he is a victim, lamenting, \\""And do you think I wanted all this? I would give my life to undo it.  I would give my eyes never to have seen this abominable place\\"" (Rhys 96).<br />VI. But...<br /> This point is by no means the end of inquiry into a masculinist reading of Wide Sargasso Sea.  There are many points an observant critic could identify within the text to counter that Antoinette's husband is not the most sympathetic character.  He is by no means an exemplar of the human race, he is just one man adrift in a swirl of the culture, which subsumes his life and colors his perceptions of the world.  A masculinist reading only allows for the viewing of more viewpoints.<br /><br />Works Cited<br />Abel, Elizabeth. \\""Women and Schizophrenia: The Fiction of Jean Rhys.\\"" Contemporary Literature. 20.2 (1979): 155-177.

Wide Sargasso Sea takes that theme and flat out runs with it, making itself out to be a post-modernist novel that is entirely too self aware of its post-modernism.

The story is told from several different persons' perspectives -- the young Antoinette, Mr. Rochester (although his name is never mentioned), the grown-up Antoinette, Grace Poole, and finally the imprisoned \\""Bertha Mason\\"". The language has a fine textual to it, the social and racial background of the West Indies is depicted vividly.<br /><br />In Jane Eyre, \\""Bertha Mason\\"" is but a symbol, a mad woman, a monster in the attic. But here, in Wide Sargasso Sea, we see a beautiful and sad little girl, isolated from society because of the social situations surrounding her. Jean Rhys really wrote life into this woman. Remarkably also that Rochester is totally believable and consistent with the same character in Jane Eyre -- on that note, I never liked Rochester in Jane Eyre anyhow, he was rude, jealous, ruthless and above all selfish. Here in Wide Sargasso Sea, he is all that and also a hypocrite -- he talks about his Christian beliefs all the time but sleeps with his wife's servant, he marries for money but does not give her any freedom. We see how step by step he has driven Antoinette into Bertha Mason.<br /><br />There is richness and life in this book. Now you look back at Jane Eyre you see how pale that is (both the book and the girl). Jane Eyre's happiness hinges on the demise of Bertha Mason, and it is only convenient to reduce her to a symbol, to a monster. Jane Eyre -- both the book and the girl -- sees everything from the white Anglo-Saxon's perspective and does not even realize there are the other side of the story (quote from the book \\""there is always the other side\\""). But Jean Rhys gave \\""Bertha Mason\\"" the life and \\""the other side\\""  of the story that she deserves.de\\""  of the story that she deserves.",2011-09-01

The first one is the childhood of future Mad Wife in the Attic from her perspective, the second is from the perspective of a newly-wed Edward Rochester and, in a short and confusing part, by Bertha, and the third one is by Bertha at Thornfield. Why is part two confusing? Because it's all told by Rochester, and then it jumps and you don't immediately realise that the perspective has shifted, and once you're used to it, it switches back to Rochester.<br /><br />The first time I read this book, I hated it, and was left with a feeling of being annoyed that the author had completely failed to understand Rochester. I even said (aloud!) \\""Well, I disagree\\"" after I closed it. On a second read, I still can't agree with Jean Rhys, but I enjoyed the book more. Having read a bunch of books about writing now, I can appreciate the book in a sort of aesthetical way. It's well-written, the characters have very distinct voices and the use of senses drags you in and gives such a rich colour and flavour that you partially forget that you're reading a book. Jean Rhys was born in Dominica in 1894 and was half-Welsh and half-Creole, so she knows what she's talking about with regards to the Caribbean, and you can tell. It can only have been written by someone who knows what it's like there. Now, if only the characters weren't supposed to be Charlotte Brontë's ...<br /><br />That's the biggest problem. She's referred to as Antoinette, not Bertha; even though she's \\""Bertha Antoinetta Mason\\"" in Charlotte Brontë's original. In the UK, your first name, your given name, is the one that goes first. Hence why \\""Bertha Antoinetta Mason\\"" logically should be \\""Bertha Mason\\"", not \\""Antoinetta Mason\\"". In the book, she's Antoinetta but calls herself Antoinette, because that's what her mother was called. Bertha is a name she doesn't like and that Rochester insists on calling her because umm, IT'S HER NAME?<br /><br />Richard Mason is only her stepbrother. Her mother was married to a guy called Cosway, who apparently went crazy and died. The mother then remarried Mr. Mason, father of Richard, and she started losing her mind after her son (the \\""complete dumb idiot\\"" Rochester refers to in the original) died. I think part two even mentions old Mr. Mason having died before the marriage or at least close to it - there is some way that he seems to be removed from the whole set-up. And who did the original say arranged the wedding? Mr. Mason and Richard with old Mr. Rochester and Rowland. The Masons were as in on it as the Rochesters, eager to be rid of her before the Rochesters would realise the mistake they had made.<br /><br />Then there's a point where young Antoinette is at school, and she is going to embroider \\""1839\\"" on something. I thought \\""Jane Eyre\\"" was set around 1838? I'm also left with the impression that she's taken out of school at the age of 17 in order to get married off. Rochester is around 21 or 22 at the time, and Bertha is a good five years his senior (her age being something the Masons had lied to him about before the wedding). Rhys claims Antoinette's mother died the year before the marriage - the original says Rochester first thought the woman was dead but he came to find out that she wasn't, \\""she was only mad, and shut up in a lunatic asylum.\\""<br /><br />Also, Brontë is clear to point out that he wasn't allowed to be alone with her before the marriage and they hardly spoke two words to each other. That way, Edward never had a chance to get to know her beforehand, because if he had, he would never have married her. They had nothing in common and he found her a woman with infantile intellect and he couldn't keep a conversation with her even if he tried.<br /><br />If you're going to write a spin-off of something, at least have the decency to stick to the facts as they've been laid out in the original. Make up things that aren't in the original as much as you want, but the bits that are in the original, please get themright. From what I've gathered, Jean Rhys had a fixation on Mrs. Rochester so trying to apologise for her behaviour by giving her a backstory that doesn't quite add up to Brontë's original is understandable. If the characters hadn't been from \\""Jane Eyre\\"", the book would've been excellent. As for now, I think it's okay. It's a good book, but she's got the events and main characters wrong.<br /><br />It's my firm belief that Bertha Mason wasn't half as interesting a person as Jean Rhys makes her out to be. Yes, Bertha is a victim of sorts - being married off to someone who doesn't know the true you just so that your family can breathe a sigh of relief and hope it'll be too late to do anything about it by the time the groom notices something's wrong - but she's not a victim in the way that Rhys wants her to be. Bertha was mentally ill, not just some spirited girl who didn't like the husband she'd been married off to. I don't think she was ever really fully aware of what happened, and while that is sad in itself, I think Rhys just tried a bit too hard to make her sympathetic when she quite clearly never meant to be anything other than a woman whose mental illness was bad to begin with but quickly got worse.",2011-06-01

But was she a madwoman? Where did she come from? How did she come to such an end?<br /><br />Thoughts: Somehow I thought this was part of my FITG challenge which is why I picked it up.  But apparently my memory fails because it is not.  Still I wanted to read this response to Jane Eyre; I'm not a big fan of the Brontës as I think I've made clear but I still keep trying to force myself to like them.<br /><br />I really liked it.  I wasn't sure what to expect and it was confusing at first as I tried to understand the social position of the Cosways.  They are a former slave owning family, surrounded by former slaves who loathe them.  Yet they are not rich and are not fully European.  They are caught between two worlds and this is particularly important to understanding Antoinette (Bertha).<br /><br />It alternates between Antoinette and Rochester's point of view (although I'm not sure he was ever named).  She narrates her childhood.  Then he comes.  He is slime; sent there by his family to marry wealth, he grows to despise her.  He takes her money, has a sexual encounter with a servant right next to her room, and hates her.  She wants his love desperately and he refuses.  In the end, he takes her to England where she eventually starts the fire that takes her own life.  She feels it's better that way...and I don't think she's wrong.<br /><br />The importance of names and their power is seen here.  Originally she is born Antoinette Cosway; then her mother remarries and her last name becomes Mason; then she marries and is known as Antoinette Rochester; then he renames her Bertha.  He ******* RENAMES her because he doesn't like her original name! I'm so angry about that.<br /><br />As a next step, I would like to read literary criticism of it because I think that will help me get more out of it.

She is a white child living in Jamaica when the slaves are freed.  Her family is ostracized and in danger.  Her mother eventually remarries and they leave their family home in flames, burned by the angry and vengeful people of the village.    Years later, Antoinette is married to a man she's never met.  On their honeymoon to Dominica, her husband starts to feel uneasy about their marriage.  He doesn't like the overgrown environment of Dominica, and he really doesn't like the black servants working for them, especially Christophine, who was a slave of Antoinette's family when Antoinette was a child.  He finds out distressing information about his wife's family and blames her for the position in which he feels stuck.  As revenge, he withholds all love and affection from his wife, and calls her crazy until she becomes so.    Antoinette is moved into the attic of her husband's home in England, where she lives out her days under guard and slips through the sleeping house at night, thinking of revenge.    This is a devastating story of a woman trapped in her life.  Throughout her life she doesn't have any choices, and her attempt to make things better between herself and her husband backfires on her.

It's not at all an easy story to grab on to, yet it contains passages of undeniable evocative power, ranging from the Dionysian seductiveness of the tropics to the hysteria of a land in oppression and revolt.<br /><br />The reader who stays with the story--not once but two or three times--will be amply rewarded by an author capable of suggesting so much more than what appears on the surface.  Rhys conveys the island culture, exposes its people and classes, but she also penetrates the psyche of a proud and brutal British colonist as well as the inner realm of fear and desire belonging to his prey: a woman and a culture in flux, both more wronged against than the other way around.<br /><br />The reader looking for a sequel to \\""Jane Eyre\\"" is bound to be initially disappointed.  Bronte establishes a style that, among its excellences, comes to represent an authoritative narrator and a decidedly confident Western point of view (albeit from a woman's angle of vision rather than a man's).  By contrast, Rhys' style is so different as to strike the first-time reader as that of someone speaking, writing, and thinking in a language other than English--a language that the reader only gradually recognizes as his own.<br /><br />But that's much the novel's point--the strangeness and disorientation resulting from the invasion of a defenseless island by a stable, civilized, patriarchal society frustrated by its inability to assert its customary order and, above all, control.  The Bertha Mason the reader meets in this story may be disappointing, unrecognizable, a construction as far removed from Bronte's and the reader's experience as a character from a completely different world.  But that's who Bertha Mason is, the \\""real\\"" Bertha Mason--and her difference should in no way exclude her from the reader's sympathy, curiosity, and desire to know more about her.

I wish I had seen him in greater depth.<br /><br />I wanted to learn more of the first Mrs. Rochester, Antoinette Mason, who later became the mad woman in Mr. Rochester's garret. Somehow, I just never got to know her well enough from the pages of Ms Rhys's novel. Pity.<br /><br />When someone writes a novel based upon the story and characters of another novel, especially one of such wide acclaim as Jane Eyre, that someone should be as adept as the original author at handling and developing those characters.

Although a prequel to 'Jane Eyre', it can be read on its own merit.  The story is about a rather disturbed young woman in the West Indies and her husband who both tries to understand and escape from her.  The author captures the time period (1830s) perfectly and has obviously researched the lifestyle and the language of the local people.  She is also a brilliant writer; her prose and characterizations are of a high caliber.  Yet since much of the book is written in the first person of a stressed, emotionally unstable woman, I found it sometimes difficult to catch all the subtle nuances.  Thankfully there are appendices in the back of the book which proved most helpful.      Bottom line: a very different, at times difficult, but very remarkable piece of literature.",2008-10-04

Even at this point, I can only say that WIDE SARGASSO SEA is an ingenious work of poignant contradictions.<br />I actually first heard of this book a few years ago, when I rented a movie by the same name.  I watched that movie and, despite a few minute clues, did not until the very end recognize it as being prequel to one of my all-time most beloved novels: Charlotte Bronte's JANE EYRE. This story chronicles the untold tale in Bronte's novel - the history and mystery behind Mr. Rochester's secret in the attic unveiled, the madwoman in the attic endowed with a soul.  \\""Bertha\\"" Antoinette Cosway-Mason is a Creole heiress living in Jamaica and Dominica in the 1830's whose isolated and tragic upbringing is augmented by the cultural chaos of that place and that time.  Shunned by both the English and white population and the recently freed slaves, then further burdened by her manipulative relatives and insane mother, Antoinette's childhood and early adulthood was as intensely oppressive as was the beauty of her surroundings.  The first chapters of this novel are told in her voice - and what a marvelous voice it is - such richness, such poetry - \\""Great splashes of sunlight as we ran up the wooden steps of the refectory. Hot coffee and rolls and melting butter. But after the meal, now and at the hour of our death, and at midday and at six in the evening, now and at the hour of our death. Let perpetual light shine on them.\\""  The tempo simply flows right through you; it is beautiful.<br />Rhys's lyrical prose is beyond doubt a manner of genius; and I do believe this book is worthy of a classic.  It really could have been brilliant, but it is riddled with flaws.  First of all, the language is so exquisitely overflowing that it's almost a distraction.  Yet within the context of the first section of the story - Antoinette's voice, encompassing her life before her marriage - I suppose may be overlooked and given up to the whims of the narrator.<br />The second section, however, is from Mr. Rochester's point of view - from his first acquaintance with his bride and to their home in the West Indies, nearly through the balance of their time together on the islands.  Rochester, who at the time is a very young English gentleman: a second son raised within the stringent confines of British landed gentry - arrives in a place totally alien to anything he has ever known, completely wide-eyed and ignorant of everything, from the temperamental weather patterns to the quirks of the denizens of that place.  Yet Rhys gives him a lush, worldly and poetic voice, not at all unlike that of Antoinette's.  In fact, when the narration switches briefly back to her, it's only distinguishable by studying closely the sway of the narration and pronoun use.  Antoinette, incidentally, never refers to Rochester by name at any time during the entire book.  Truly, though the author had essentially free reign with the character of \\""Bertha,\\"" as that entity was only faintly drawn out in JANE EYRE, she was considerably restricted when it came to Rochester.  In drawing him out, Rhys has failed on two counts:  the first in that his language sounds too embedded within the lyrical rhythms of the alien landscape he supposedly fears and does not understand, to ever ring true for a young man of his circumstances; the second in that, notwithstanding the anger and bitterness felt toward his father and elder brother, Mr. Rochester's actions in this story do not in any way ring true to the man as Bronte wrote him.  He's barely recognizable.<br />The third, and final, portion of the story reverts back to Antoinette's point of view - this time from the garret room of Thornfield Hall.  Though the writing here remains quite pretty, the narration completely loses its coherence.  This loss may be construed as understandable - as the narrator would by now be quite mad - but it just doesn't strike true.  The language is inconsistent - smooth and flowing in places, choppy in others.  The tragic consequences of a bitter young man's revenge and a damaged young woman's confusion gets entirely lost here in the author's imposingly scattered prose.<br />I am sure that, judged in its own right, this novel can quite easily be classified as a work of art.  But loving JANE EYRE as I do, I am sorely unqualified to make the distinction.  Yet I cannot deny that I was mesmerized by the overwhelmingly lush impact of the writing in WIDE SARGASSO SEA.  Sick with a lingering fever and lamenting his fate, the young bridegroom makes the trudging maiden journey with his new bride to their honeymoon house in an island place called Massacre ~ \\""Everything is too much, I felt as I rode wearily after her.

I'm glad I discovered WSS much later.  It's an intriguing, fascinating study of Mr. Rochester and his first wife, Antoinette Mason, the prototype of the 'mad wife in the attic' who played a minor but vital part in 'Jane Eyre'.<br /><br />Antoinette's mother descends into madness following the loss of the family  estate to a slave rebellion.  To shore up the family fortune and save her from becoming an old maid, and thus a burden, she is married off to Mr. Rochester, newly arrived from England, who knows nothing about her mother's insanity.  WSS shows us the other side of Mr. Rochester that Jane Eyre couldn't or wouldn't see: his coldness, his selfishness, and his opportunism.  We can understand how, as he did in 'Jane Eyre', such a man would lie to an innocent young woman about his marital status and nearly trap her into unwittingly participating in a sham marriage.  Rochester is attracted to Antoinette at first; he is dazzled by her beauty as well as her money and eager to marry her.  Once the honeymoon phase is over, he is unable to adjust to his surroundings.  Jamaica is antipathetic to everything he grew up with, it's wild, untamed, a study in extremes, anathema to a tidy, organized, narrow-minded European, and Rochester is the typical insular-minded Englishman who despises what he is unable to  understand.<br /><br />Antoinette is totally a product of her surroundings and completely at home where she is, and as Rochester feels alienated from Jamaica, so he feels alientated from his wife, and the discovery of her mother's insanity is justification enough for his deepening antipathy for her.  He can't accept who or what she is; he can't even accept her name, he  insists on calling her 'Bertha', never mind that it's a name she hates,  it's what he wants, so it's who she will be.  In 'Jane Eyre', Rochester  blames his wife's alcoholism for the failure of the marriage; in WSS, it's his brutally cold and insensitive treatment of her that finally drives her to drink.  When he takes her away from Jamaica and everything she knows and loves, she retreats into a madness even deeper than her mother's; she can't live in his world, any more than he can live in hers.<br /><br />In 'Jane Eyre' Rochester is the romantic hero and in WSS he is a monster of selfishness; when both are put together, the real complexity of the character finally emerges.<br /><br />Judy Linde will be.
