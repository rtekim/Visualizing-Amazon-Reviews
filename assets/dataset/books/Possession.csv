In POSSESSION (Random House, 1990), with several volumes of fiction and criticism behind her, A. S. Byatt hit form--but what a form!  It's subtitled \\""A Romance,\\"" which  sets you up for a heightening of emotion as well as a certain latitude about probability, but POSSESSION is one of those wonderful books that flies all over the place--mystery, historical novel, love story (doubled--cubed, actually), a whopping satire of academic life--and yet it remains serenely under command.  The protagonists are each expert in  nineteenth century poetry; a letter surfaces suggesting an unsuspected connection between their two favorite poets; and you're off, the letter triggering a series of parallel pursuits, like the pirated cassette in \\""Diva\\"".  The grandstanding is in Byatt's invention not just of the two poets but of their poems and stories, each a clue to the plot; but the richness is in the bug-eyed energy with which Byatt's characters hit you--poets, professors, pedants and all, ringing as many changes on that one-word title as you can imagine.

Because of this book, A. S. Byatt became one of my favorite authors, and I sought her works out.<br /><br />I adore the descriptions of every character.  From mild Roland Mitchell to his girlfriend, Val, who is resigned to do &#34;menial&#34; work until she has an affair.  They are both miserable, but their disappointment resides in their lives and not each other.  I love how Byatt emphasizes Maude Bailey's sharp clear beauty through other people's reaction, and Maude Bailey’s instinctive armor, and how quick, sharp and clever she really is.  Even Beatrice Nest is not just a caricature.  She was not befuddled, merely indecisive as her subject is, and she cleverly senses that her heroine is only pretending to be demure.  Also amazing, how beautiful is the character of Christabel LaMotte?<br /><br />Story of Roland Mitchell, who is suspended in an academic wasteland, and residing without much happiness with Val.  They do not loathe each other, but both are disappointed in their lives.

Byatt gives us a smorgasbord of writing styles - correspondence, journals, notebooks, academic criticism, legal papers, fairy tales, poetry, narrative, flashback.<br /><br />The framework of the novel is set in the modern day, with characters whose lives are urban, edgy, and a little bit grungy,  and narrative writing to match, full of irony and satire.  There are some wonderful academic rivalries, with the characters  jockeying for position and defending their academic  territories while wielding words as weapons.  And there is a hidden treasure, and a mystery, and a nice slow-blooming romance.<br /><br />And within this frame, Byatt has created a parallel story about the lives, poetry, and passions of two  mid-Victorian literary figures, Randolph Ash and Christabel LaMotte.  These two fictional characters are portrayed with such detail and authenticity that I was tempted to Google both of them to find out more.  Byatt gives us  poetry ascribed to  Randolph Ash and Christabel LaMotte which evokes Tennyson, or Wordsworth, or Emily Dickinson.  The style of the fairy tales echoes Sir Thomas Malory.  The correspondence has echoes of Carlyle.  You have to be a tenacious reader to keep track of the cast of characters, their various backgrounds and motivations, while working your way through a great many words.<br /><br />But there is so much to harvested from this labor!  In many ways this is a novel about words and their power, about literature and its effects, about reading. It is a book to be taken slowly and savored, like a banquet of gourmet dishes served in course after course - a Victorian-style banquet, if you will, but surrounded by twentieth-century comforts.

This was one of those dystopian novels that I thought from the lovely synopsis. The government has taken over pretty much every aspect of life. The two main characters in the beginning, Violet and Zenn have been in love for years. While the government says they aren't supposed to see each other, they manage to sneak . However one night they are caught, simple.<br /><br />  I wanted this book to be good, and while I enjoyed parts of it. The world building in this book is just not there. World building is key and while there was a lot of scenarios and different settings, it seemed to be rushed into the next one. The world never really seemed to settle, it was a constant journey, and the whole book focused on the characters more so than the world and the environment around. It was just so glaring, I couldn't look past it. I wanted more than anything to know more about the governing body.<br /><br />  Now to Violet, and the most confusing character above all. I couldn't understand her at all. Yeah I understand that the position she is in is rough, and while she is thought to be a traitor of some sort. She is believed to be a Thinker, people who can control the thoughts and actions (nearly) of those around them. Most of the government is composed of Thinkers, because how else can you govern the masses. However, she doesn't want want that life or can't live with herself is she is moving the people she loves.<br /><br />  Zenn is her love in the beginning and while there isn't much to him, I found him to take her for granted. &#34;I love you and we're destined to be together.&#34; I'm sorry that doesn't work in dystopian fiction anymore. What may have worked in this book is someone who wants to show her why they need to be together, why she is special. I didn't buy his feelings at all, and thought he was more of an annoyance to the story than the effort it probably took to write himinto the book.<br /><br />  Jag is the next character, while isn't in a main character until later in the book. He's the character that I fell in love with this book. He kept me on my toes, and made a genuinely confusing and almost boring book slightly entertaining. The relationship he took with Violet was unique and refreshing to this story. Jag singlehandedly saved this book I feel from being a complete failure. While he was confident and exuded arrogance and charm, he was the breath of life in this book.<br /><br />  The rest of the book was messy and confusing. To be honest even after having read it, I am not sure what the book was overall trying to get across. The ending has caught a bit of grieve, in how it isn't a happy ending, and it is a bit realistic. I enjoyed how Elana didn't write the story that everyone as expecting to see, and twisted it into a near cliffhanger for the second book. It was probably the best part here, and that's just not great.<br /><br />  If you are thinking about picking up this book, I have to warn you: This book is for a select few. I wanted this book to be good, and while I enjoyed it, the rating I felt it deserved just wouldn't match. It's disappointing but I can't and won't go higher. It had promise and while the workings are all there, the writing style is great. The book tried to tackle too much and the world building wasn't there.

We have the dystopian society, for one. Then there's the fact that Vi, like Condie's Cassia's whole really likes the match that society has chosen for her: he's her best friend. But she can't help being overwhelmingly attracted to someone else- and falling in love with him.    But after reading the book, that's pretty much where the similarities end.    I really enjoyed the circumstances of Johnson's unique dystopian protagonist. Vi has never really been content with her ruling government. She breaks the laws- all the time. In fact the book opens on her eighth offense (seventh time they catch her).    Not like Cassia who was happy until she discovers that she could have had another match (Condie's Matched). Not like Tally, who wanted nothing more than to join Pretty society until the Specials sent her after a friend (Westerfeld's Uglies). Not even like Katniss, who while not really happy with her circumstances, never thought things would change until she was forced to fight for her life (Collins's The Hunger Games).    There were also several twists that threw me for a loop, but for the sake of avoiding spoilers, I won't say exactly what they are. One was hinted at enough that I sort of saw it coming, but was right there with Vi when the information was revealed and she tries to reconcile what she remembers with what she's learned. I sort of wish the second twist had been explored a bit more because I felt like Vi should have been thrown more than she was.    However, the pacing for a large majority, was stilted. Things moved quickly, almost too quickly. Readers barely have time to process everything that happens before they were thrown into something else.    The bigger problems I had with this novel were largely with the characters themselves: Vi seems to have two modes: pissed off or confused. She is so angry. All. The. Time. I couldn't begin to count the amount of timesthat she \\""growled.\\"" It made her difficult to connect with.    Jag never does what he says he'll do. He's smug and self-righteous and never keeps his word to Vi, constantly abandoning her. I just didn't understand his appeal.    I didn't get how a relationship blossomed from that.

The book, an old paperback of Possession, was billed as &#34;New.&#34; It was described as &#34;still in shrink wrap.&#34; I really expected a NEW book. But I got a book that had breaks in the edge where the covers and spine meet, strongly suggesting that it had been used and read. &#34;Still in shrink wrap&#34; seems strange since when it was newly published and on bookstore shelves it was never shrink wrapped to start with. AND if it has been shrink wrapped then why all the pages browned for an inch into the book from oxidation. How does it get oxidized in the absence of air in shrink wrap. I must say that my old copy (which I am replacing because of a flood at home and water damage) still had very white pages in spite of it sitting on my library shelves all these years. I have been quite mystified by the gradations of books on Amazon. How can so many copies of this and other books be sold as &#34;New&#34;  with a description of various degrees of use. I have also received a valuable book described as Near Fine that was stained and bore what I interpreted as mold damage on the cover. Another marked as Very Good came all battered, but that could have been the terribly inadequate packaging. I have also received truly New, unused, unread, mint copied of books with older publication dates. I don't wish to belabor the point, but I do want to ask, What does &#34;new&#34; really mean as applied to old books with yellowed pages with or without shrink wrap.",2013-09-07

Byatt, and winner of the 1990 Booker Prize. Roland Michell is a literary scholar whose special interest is 19th century poet, Randolph Henry Ash. When he happens upon drafts of letters written by Ash to an unnamed woman, his investigations lead him to another 19th century poet, Christabel LaMotte, and the expert on that poet's works, Professor Maud Bailey. Using a fascinating combination of folk tales, myths, sagas, memoirs, journals, letters, fairy tales, biographies and many poems, Byatt tells the stories of the romance of Randolph Ash and Christabel LaMotte, and, eventually, Roland Michell and Maud Bailey. As she slowly builds up this romance, Byatt also comments on faith and religion, the dissection of literary works, lesbianism and feminism, writing, reading and the ownership of literary treasures. Parallels abound between the two romances, although the action doesn't really hot up until the final 80 pages, with an exciting graveyard climax and a lump-in-the-throat epilogue. While there is an abundance of verbose old letters, virtually impenetrable text about poets' works and long tracts of 19th century poetry, these do give the work authenticity and some readers may enjoy these even if others find them tedious.

So when Candace at CBB Book Promotions asked me if I would be interested in participating in Elana Johnson's blog tour for the first two books in the series, Possession and Surrender,  in preparation for next year's release of Abandon, the final book in the series, I was very excited.<br /><br />The protagonist of Possession is Violet (Vi) a self professed rule breaker living in the Goodgrounds, a dystopian futuristic world where everyone dresses the same and must follow strict  codes regarding personal contact. Most distressing is that everyone in Violet's area is forced to \\""plug in\\"" at night and listen to a government broadcast personalized for each citizen. Basically the government is brainwashing and controlling it's citzens.  Most of the population of the Goodgrounds shuffle along, living their preplanned, controlled lives without questioning anything. But Vi is different. After both her father and her sister mysteriously disappear, Vi takes the extreme measure of \\""unplugging,\\"" refusing to listen to the government broadcasting. And she is not alone. Zenn, her best friend (and recently MORE) also unplugs, and together the two of them formed a pact to always stay together and not fall victim to the government's control. That all changes when Zenn is recruited into Special Forces Training.  Vi will do anything to see Zenn, and breaking rules, like being out of her sector after hours and walking alone with a boy, is something she doesn't even think twice about. But this time things do not go as planned. Vi is caught and thrown in jail to await trial for committing this, her seventh offense.<br /><br />If you read this blog than you know that I have a definite soft spot for \\""bad girl\\"" protagonists. (Check out my discussion post on \\""Why I love the Bad Girl in YA\\"" to see what I mean.) I love their attitude, I love their sense of humor and I love their indpendent and rebellious nature. Vi is definitely rebellious, but what earns her a label of 'bad girl' in this book is actually not your typical bad girl behavior. Physical contact with boys, breaking curfew,  thinking for yourself?  Those aren't \\""bad\\"" things in our world, but they are in Vi's. So along with her rebellious streak and rule breaking ways, it is easy to sympathize with Vi, who is trying to survive this crazy world she lives in.<br /><br />With this in mind, it is easy to understand why Vi might gravitate towards other lawless, rule beakers. Enter Jag Barque, another prisoner awaiting trial. Oddly enough, this society that doesn't allow close contact between people, especially people of the opposite sex, decides to make Vi and Jag cellmates. Jag hails from the Badlands, a region where people are basically allowed to live as they want, but are closely monitored by the government  officials. Now I know what you are thinking. What? They are letting Vi bunk up with a boy? And a \\""baddie\\"" boy at that? I felt the same way. But let me say right now that all is not what it seems in Possession. This is just the first of many things I scratched my head over while reading. But trust me when I say just \\""soldier on.\\""  It may not make perfect sense now but it will later on.<br />Once Vi and Jag meet, and eventually escape the prison, the action picks up dramatically. And so do the revelations. Vi  learns from Jag about a rebellion to overthrow the government and put an end to it's oppression.<br /><br />But what about Zenn, you ask? Where does he fit into the picture? Well Zenn is not gone. And he hasn't been forgotten by Vi either. Yes, there is a bit of a love triangle at play in Possession. BUT, it is definitely one of the more interesting love triangles that I've read. As the story progresses Vi knows who she want to be with, and that could be  the end of it right there. But it's not. Both Zenn and Jag are FAR from perfect. There were times that I loved them, times that I felt sorry for them,  and other times that I was downright  furious with them both. Both have good and bad sides to their personalities, and both have their own agenda. And you are just going to have to read the book to discover what I am talking about because I'm not saying one thing more:)<br /><br />In fact, I'm going to have to remain vague about what goes down in the rest of Possession, but I will say that it is a book that will keep you guessing right up until the end. No one is what they seem. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, lies, deceives, omits and manipulates. There are secrets and cases of false identity and enough instances of mind control to make your head spin. Possession is a complicated web and although I was confused at times, I was also riveted and dying to figure what was really going on beneath the surface.<br /><br />In fact,  I don't mind some confusion when reading so long as everything is explained later on in the book.  This world that author Elana Johnson presents is a complicated one. There is a lot of strange terminology used: techtricity and mechs;  and a lot of unusual people introduced:  Thinkers, Rangers and Greens.  It's a lot to absorb but really creative and well crafted.<br /><br />And I love science fiction and futuristic settings although I will admit that reading it can be TRICKY, at least for me. Technologically advanced worlds that feature computer simulations, teleportation and other instances of virtual reality can sometimes make my eyes glaze over (books with extensive battle scenes; overly detailed steampunk contraptions; lengthy discussions on time travel; and complex court politics  elicit a similar response from me as well.) And I will admit that there were times while reading Possession that I felt things veering off and my brain feeling a little foggy. But again, I kept reading and am so happy that I did. Because the second half of Possession is where things began to gel more, and while I still had a lot of questions, many of the things that confused me suddenly clicked and became very clear.<br /><br />I think Johnson's writing is amazing. Her imagination and this society and characters that she has created is both unique and addicting.  By the last chapters of the book I was fully invested in Vi, Jag, Zenn and the rest, anxious to figure out who was playing who, who could be trusted and what was going to happen next.<br /><br />So, the not-so-happy news is that Possession does in fact end on quite the cliffhanger. A BIG, shocking one. That epilogue! It KILLED ME. But after reading it, I took a deep breath and RELAXED. Why? Because the sequel, Surrender, is already out!  Yay! There's no need to hyperventilate!  But, the best news of all? EVERY review that I have read of Surrender says that it is AWESOME. And most agree that it is even stronger than it's predecessor, which REALLY excites me. No sophomore slump in sight:) Surrender is a companion novel told from the POV of both  Raine, the daughter of the Director of  the city of Freedom, and also Gunnar, the boy she shouldn't love, but does.

It was great at first, but it quickly went down hill. There were too many unanswered questions (such as why do some humans have powers? It's never explained), too much uninteresting character development, and far too fast love development (really? Together after the span of two weeks?) A big confusion was our main girl. Everyone is saying she has strong mind powers, but she doesn't seem that strong to me, not when every person in the book can manipulate her. I did like the futuristic technology in the book, but most of the time each piece of technology appears right when a character needs it. It almost seemed to serve more as a deus ex machina more then a natural part of this futuristic world.<br /><br />The setting first takes place in the Goodgrounds, where people are controlled. They are told what to think and do, and they follow all rules. They dress head to toe in clothes that cover everything from the sun. This is totally different lifestyle from the Badlands, where people could do what they wish to do. They can wear what they want and do as they please. The other major setting is an oceanic area where our main characters visit for only a brief time before they are taken away. So not much is said about that place, other then it's a place that people can ask for asylum.<br /><br />In this dystopian novel, the Thinkers (or \\""Greens\\"" as some people call them) are a group of people that do the thinking for the population, controlling every thought and action. That fact alone was what I thought was interesting about this book. In this world, Violet (Vi for short) lives. She breaks the rules and doesn't let the Thinkers control her. It's her character that made me think I would enjoy this book. As Violet sneaks out of her town to secretly meet with her boyfriend, she notices that something is wrong. She's quickly arrested and brought to a prison center where she meets a boy named Jag. When theThinkers decide to do something to both her and Jag, she knows that they have to escape now. Surprisingly they do escape and they run off together. As they travel together, she learns that she has powers of her own that she needs to try and control. They get captured again and escape, which seems to be a theme in this book. She falls in love with Jag, and I'm not really sure if Jag loves her back, because he seems to enjoy ditching her and using his mind powers on her. As I mention at first no one can control Vi, but then suddenly everyone is controlling her. Even Jag, her new lover, is using his powers multiple times on her. The ending of the book seems to be a cliffhanger, but a very poor type of cliffhanger. Usually cliffhangers make you want to read the next book, but really I don't want to or need to. I didn't fall in love with the characters and the plot was just too confusing and bland.<br /><br />Violet is our main female character of this book. She learns about her mind powers later in the book and starts to right away to try to learn to control them. She is also told how powerful she can be with her powers and how she can control anything. The Thinkers want her for her power, but she doesn't want to work for the Thinkers. How and why she has her powers aren't explained. Her relationship with Jag can best described as a puppy following her owner around. No matter what Jag does to her, she still loves him. She may act strong at first, but she is really weak if she can't help but love a person who loves toying with her. Jag controls her, the Thinkers control her, even her father controls her. For someone who can't be controlled, she's controlled far too much.<br /><br />Jag really has no good quality in him, despite him working for the resistance. There is absolutely nothing to like about the guy. He loves to get mad at Vi over and over again. Even though he does apologize, he just goes and gets mad at something else. He loves to ditch Vi and go off alone, leaving her wondering around alone. He did that multiple times. Of course, he says he loves her and says sorry, but goes and does it again! But that's okay, because Vi loves him no matter what. I don't even know if he really loves her, or just using her and keeping her under his mind control to keep her close.<br /><br />Zenn was someone who Vi was originally promised to, but after she got arrested that all changed.

Ever since I first heard about it I wanted to read it but for some reason I kept putting it off.  When I was asked to be part of the Possession blog tour I jumped at the chance.  I'm so glad I finally got the chance to read Possession because it's one fabulous dystopian that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />Possession is unlike other dystopians in that it doesn't focus nearly as much on the world as it does on the characters and in this case I really liked that.  There is enough detail about the world that I can picture it and I really felt that that was all I needed.  The story focuses more on Vi, Jag, Zenn, the Resistance, and the government.  It's a very character oriented story and luckily the characters are pretty awesome.  Vi is independent, strong-willed, smart, and, my favorite thing about her, sarcastic.  She stands out in the Goodgrounds because of all these qualities.  She doesn't follow rules and she just doesn't care.  She cracked me up with her attitude yet she still managed to have a very sensitive side that made me sympathize with her. Jag seemed to pop up out of nowhere but I quickly came to love him.  He shared many qualities with Vi such as his sense of independence and his sarcasm.  He was definitely a bad boy but he also had a very sensitive side that he wasn't afraid to show.  It made me love him all the more.  Zenn was more of a mystery to me and I still don't quite know how I feel about him.  I want a deeper look at him and his motives before I truly decide whether I'm Team Jag or Team Zenn.<br /><br />While I loved all the characters in Possession, the thing that truly kept me reading was the mystery.  There were so many things I didn't know and I couldn't stop reading until I figured them all out.  It was one mystery after another and while a few of them were a little predictable most of them I never saw coming.  I love a book that can surprise and Possession not only did that once but many times.  I was on the edge of my seat through the whole book.  This is definitely a book that you will want to set aside time to read because you won't be able to stop once you get started.<br /><br />Really I don't have much bad to say about this book.  I would have liked a bit more information about the Greenies (as Vi calls them), the government and all the crazy people in charge of it, and maybe a little more history about how the Goodgrounds and Badlands came to be.  However, while I would have liked these things I don't feel that they were necessary for the story and they are more just things I was curious about.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend Possession for dystopian fans.

She doesn't know who she is, but what she does know is that she doesn't want to be controlled. Little does she know that her life is about to change.

She cut her hair and dyed it, is a thief, ignores the rules, and does pretty much anything she wants. She is the furthest thing from controlled. Then there is her true math, Zenn. He was chosen to join the Special Forces. Now he has little control over his life.<br /><br />Wow. I have never been thrown by more than one twist in any story. Possession made my jaw drop four times. Completely blindsided. I loved it. This story really made me think about how much control is too much. I felt like \\""Big Brother\\"" had a big hand in every little movement anyone made and an even bigger role in Vi's life. In the end, it really came down to being selfish or selfless. Vi had a big decision she had to battle throughout the story and it was between what she wanted and what was best.<br /><br />Overall, Possession was expertly crafted and had me on the edge of my seat.

The novel follows Violet as she breaks the Rules by taking a walk with her match and best friend, Zenn. Only this time, she's broken too many Rules - and now she has to pay for it. Vi is taken to a hearing in front of the Greenies and is soon banished to the Badlands. Vi knows that the Thinkers have been brainwashing people for years and she's determined not to let them take over her mind, even though They are trying their hardest to convince her to become one of Them. Soon Vi learns that the Thinkers have brainwashed Zenn and Vi can't join the rebellion knowing he's alone. On top of things, Vi has been forced to team up with Jag - a guy who instantly gets underneath her skin but also has the uncanny ability to intrigue her.<br /><br />With dystopian novels being a big trend in YA literature right now, this series fits right into the genre. It's set apart from others in the category by the great writing and the detailed world building. I was immediately intrigued by the society that the author has created for the series, and the history and backstory surrounding it was phenomenal. The characters were all unique and likable - especially Vi. I liked that the story had a strong female lead that was also witty and doesn't back down. The romance in the novel is the right mix of sweet and sizzling, but it didn't detract from the main story line of the book. There is the whole love triangle starting to happen, but it didn't really bother me - although I don't know what will happen with it in the next installment. The plot was fast paced and full of action and adventure. There was a bit of mystery involved as to the identity of certain characters, the fate of others, and the general question of what the Thinkers really want.

No matter how much Jag hurt her, Vi always went back for more. And she bounced between Zenn and Jag too much for my taste. And Jag was very...annoying. He seemed to just USE Vi and I felt partial to Vi. Let's just say, she reminds me of a friend. Without the romance of course. Also, why did these characters had these powers? It gave no history, no background. And the characters couldn't feign ignorance either. I mean, they seemed to know most anything, and the characters didn't even stop to ponder where these special genes came from.<br /><br />What did I love? The plot, the twists, the way that you never knew if someone was a baddie or a Goodie. It was one of those books where there were so many secrets. Everyone had a secret and with all the name changing, you never knew when what would happen and who was who. It was...shocking to say the least when the last possible thing suddenly became possible.

I love the crazy worlds, the creepy governments, and just figuring everything out and how everything works in these new worlds. And Possession was such a world building treat! It was the perfect mix of mystery and detail.<br /><br />Vi is so spunky. I loved her, she has a lot of spirit. They called her a \\""free thinker\\"" and they said it like such a bad thing.

Vi gets sent to the badlands and even though she is very scared about it so knows that she isn't going to back down about anything. That was what I loved about her- she never gave up. I would hate to see that spirit of hers broken.<br /><br />Jag is just as adorable as Vi. I was pretty much always on team Jag. Even when Vi talks about all the great things about Zenn, who she has known her whole life, I just kept thinking that he was boring. I never really liked him, even as a friend. Jag was like an onion. Everytime he was alone with Vi he would share something new about himself. I found myself looking forward to those scenes in the book.<br /><br />Possession is a whirlwind on the run adventure that kept me turning pages until the very end. I loved Elana Johnson's writing style. It was very swift and poetic in a way.

After the near destruction of the Earth, humans couldn't be trusted to continue to live on their own unless something drastic was done.  So all the power and choices were taken away.  Humans became conformed citizens - plugging in nightly for mind control sessions, everyone had food, medical attention and top of the line technology to live their lives.  Your mate was chosen for you, your job chosen for you, you were living the Good life in the Goodgrounds.  The only thing missing was free choice...and ultimately your freedom!  When you break the rules you are punished.  You are retrained.  You are sent away.  You are bad and no one wants to be bad.<br /><br />The characters in this story are mostly young adults possessing mind or voice powers that they have no idea they possess until they are selected by the Director to join his Thinkers or Rangers.  But what happens when you fight against the control and stand up to the Dystopian rule?  You get sent to Freedom and reprogrammed into a conforming citizen working for the good of all.  Violet, Vi for short, finds this out the hard way when she breaks the rules one too many times.  With a mother who could care less about her, a father who disappeared, and a sister who died, Vi has nothing else to live for except her best friend, her chosen one, Zenn.  But the Directors think they can control Vi by taking the one thing away that means the most to her.  They instill fear in her and lock her up trying to get her to conform.  That is when she meets Jag who is bad and they have to run for their lives.  Step into a futuristic world where the person you trust could be your downfall or your savior.  The problem is Vi never knows who she can trust ever in the whole entire book. Vi continues to get sucked in deeper and deeper into a game that has no rules and no clear boundaries or players.  Just when you think you know where the story is going, the Author twists the story in a whole new direction, and then back again.  She does this over and over again, until nothing is finished and you are left with a lot of unanswered questions, loose ends and then the book ends.  It is very anti-climatic.<br /><br />I am a fast reader and if I am having a problem getting through a story I know it didn't immerse me into the pages and flow the way I like.  It becomes a chore to finish.  Not that this is a bad story at all.  I think it has a lot of potential to continue into a great series and I would look forward to reading the next book.  It has a bit of action, a lot of high-tech gizmos, and just a bit of romance too.  I just feel the Author could have spent a bit more time tying up loose ends so the reader could still follow the story without having to stop and analyze what point is trying to be made or what is really going on.  I found myself re-reading some sections thinking I missed something only to find out we were never told a critical piece of information so the story would flow better.  You continue thinking we are going to be told later on in the story but mostly that doesn't happen and the story ends in a way that defeats the whole purpose of the story.  I am sure it is intentional to leave an opening for Book 2 but I almost feel like well if this is how it was going to end, why did I read the middle?  That being said, I hope I am never faced living in this world unless I possess a gift like Vi has and maybe one of those teleporter rings too!",2012-10-21

They control just about every aspect of your life, from your job to even who you are matched with. In the goodgrounds territory human contact is forbidden. Your mind is brainwashed by personalized recordings that you listen to while you sleep. But ever since Violet's father visited the Badlands and never returned, Vi has had a hard time following the rules. She soon finds herself in prison after getting caught touching her approved match in a park after hours.<br /><br />Violet meets Jag Barque in prison and is immediately drawn to him. Jag cannot be controlled by the thought transmissions and is a baddie through and through. Vi and Jag make an escape from prison and find themselves on the run in the Badlands from the Thinkers. Being with Jag is an eye opening experience for Violet. The more she learns about her controlling society, the more she questions her role in it. Is everything Black and White? Goodies and Baddie? Does she belong to a side? Or does her reality blur the lines?<br /><br />I absolutely love the dystopian genre and immediately sought out Possession. The whole concept of the Thinkers really drew me in. It had a modern day 1984 vibe. Violet's voice felt like a genuine teenager which gave it that realism. I do wish the world building had been more developed throughout the novel. Not having a clear picture of it did distract me a little while reading.<br /><br />There's a love triangle but the relationships feel more natural than most contrived love triangles. Zenn is Violet's best friend. Someone who has always been there and when they get matched, their relationship only becomes more comfortable. Jag is the new and exciting. It's not as easy with him. Violet doesn't know everything about him and can't always predict his actions. The choice between familiar and the unexpected isn't an easy one for Violet to make.<br /><br />Full of twists and turns, Possession will keep you guessing until the very end. Once you get there, it will rip your heart out and serve it to you on a platter. Where you can watch it bleed out with no way to stop it. You are no longer in control.<br /><br />It's a game you see.

One word spirngs to mind when thinking about Jag: nice. Which you'd have to read the novel to understand, because Jag is actually bad!<br /><br />You see, in the world of Possession the population is controlled by Thinkers. People are literally brain washed into behaving perfectly. Anyone who doesn't comply is \\""bad,\\"" and Jag is one of them. The only problem? Violet simply can't resist him (and neither could I!).<br /><br />The beginning of this novel sucked me in, particularly the budding relationship between Violet and Jag which was both romantic and humorous. Great characters. Excellent dialogue. And Elana has an especially entertaining voice. The premise behind Possession is captivating and the unique dystopian world intriguing. Although I couldn't understand some of Violet's mood swings, I fell in love with main characters Violet and Jag. Overall, Possession took me on an exciting journey that I really enjoyed.

There is NO backstory and it feels a little contrived. Irritating things like calling people Goodies and Baddies and from the Goodlands and Badlands. I am a reasonably intelligent individual and this is actually insulting to me that the author can rely on this barely there world to launch a story that will be interesting for the long haul. At the moment I am going to push a bit further and I will review again later.<br /><br />UPDATE: 50 pages to go and I am stopping now. This book is like reading someone's fluid thought process. Example: I think I will go to the store for some milk- wow those cookies were good yesterday-I should have gotten the dry-cleaning-I wonder if the janitor will fix my chair- I think I need a pedicure. WTF? Everything jumps from scene to scene each one more loosely related to the last thought than the previous. When the author started wondering where to take it BAM- the story turns from a Dystopian to Science Fiction and the main characters have supernatural powers. OMG- really? The two main characters are (Of course) love interests and no surprise there is an obligatory dystopian love triangle. This love triangle is stupider than most because she falls in love with the new fella in her life after about a day- I am not joking. She was in love with someone for years and meets someone new and then loves him more. And how ridiculous- we are in a alternate reality and they keep calling each other \\""babe\\"". I wanted to reach through the book and choke them both. There could have been four DECENT books had the author had a great editor and developed the characters and the plot more carefully.

But just because everyone else in the Goodgrounds is doesn't mean that Vi has to be. But Vi breaking minor rules that other people wouldn't even think of is the least of Vi's worries when she's arrested and held in a cell with the criminal Jag Barque. From the very start, Vi finds her world spiraling out of control. She discovers a rebellion, a love-hate romance, and a few secrets that may turn her allegiance -- and what's scary is that her choice matters. Fighting to stay with what she just obtained and reaching for something she always had, Vi has to choose -- Good or Bad? Right or wrong? Jag or Zenn?<br /><br />This dystopian society is separated into two main groups: the Good and the Bad. In the Goodgrounds everyone wears the same clothes, obeys every law, and listens to a recording every night that brain washes the citizens into lawful Goodies taught that Baddies are the worst people in the world. But in the Badlands people are free -- freer than the Good but still not all the way. People have choices -- what to wear, how to cut their hair, who they hang out with -- but in the end they still have to obey what the Greenies (mind controlling leaders of the society) say.<br /><br />This book had me confused. Now mind you, it had a great plot with lots of twists. It also had a lot of scenes that weren't explained all the way and a very...weird romance.<br /><br />There was a love triangle but that isn't what had me yelling at Vi throughout the book. It's the relationship with Jag that had me screaming, \\""WHY IN THE WORLD ARE YOU WITH HIM??\\"" Sure, the character himself is absolutely fine; he's a broken and rebellious hero (I totally don't blame Vi for falling for him after a life of constant goodness). But after he left her for the FIFTH time, I was getting a little tired of the love hate relationship between the two. Every single time she refused to take him back for like five minutes and then all of a sudden she's kissing him, sins forgiven. EVERY STINKING TIME. Yes, Jag does have a very persuasive voice, but that doesn't mean she shouldn't still be mad at him for leaving her alone to cross the border of the Badlands by herself while the Greenies are on her tail. Just saying.<br /><br />Overall this is an alright book. There were hardly any transitions in between scenes, making the reading a whole lot more complicated.

Vi is a girl that is both supposed to be strong and vulnerable, to maker her a well-rounded character.  She is strong in the sense that she goes against mindless control of her society and those around her, yet on the flip side, she is pretty driven by teenage angst.  Most of that angst is centered around Zenn and Jag, the two boys who make her head spin and her heart flutter.  On both counts, I struggled a bit.  I didn't always get it and wondered what I was missing.<br /><br />There is a lot of story going on in Possession that I think teen readers might really like.  I'm not sure that I was the right audience though, especially when it came to the teen romance, which I'm usually fine with.  In this case, some of the interactions between the characters felt creepy and like the couple that you see all over one another and wonder if they even really like one another or are just going with what's available.  It just all felt off to me, with all the constant touching and romantic lingo.<br /><br />Beyond my own adult response (which isn't normally so jaded-sounding), I do think there is a lot of great action and suspense to grab readers.  Some of the action is thrown at us a bit quickly, without explaining it all, but if you enjoy dystopian novels and understand these story lines, this really might fit the bill.  Follow up novels are out and hopefully answer the cliffhanger that this book ended on.",2012-07-30
US,48144215,R2C8IU4XMW5Q2F,1442421266,943483536,"Possession",Books,1,0,2,N,Y,"Disappointing to say the least","As of late, novels about an over controlling government have drawn me in. When I decided to read Possession, I did so with the same hopes and expectations as the other books I've read and love. The difference between this book and the ones I have loved is huge, much to my disappointment. For starters, when you read the cover, you learn this about the book: the government has picked which boy a girl will be with; the girl is really happy with the decision but then meets another boy who she shouldn't be with; girl has to choose between guy one and guy two, as well as whether to rebel against the government or not. It took me until I said it out loud to realize that this plot scheme is an EXACT copy of Matched by Alice Condie. I realized this before I read the book but figured I'd still give it a try, regardless of the similarities.<br /><br />As I started to read the book, I found myself CONSTANTLY thinking, \\""that doesn't make sense or connect. Perhaps it will later.\\"" To my dismay, it never did. Most parts of the book seemed as if they were just put together without the thought process that should go with it. One minute Vi is going to a certain location, the next (for no reason whatsoever), she's going somewhere completely different. I feel like the author just wrote and never actually stopped and asked, \\""Will my readers understand this?\\"" It made the book so disorienting, and frankly annoying, that it was an utter struggle to keep reading. Had I known that the dots would never connect, I wouldn't have kept reading after chapter one.<br /><br />Vi is 15 which is a bit young for most heroes in today's literature. I had issues connecting with that. Putting the age difference aside, I really most things related to Jag. First, his fashion sense seems to be an over dramatization of typical stupid teenage boys fashion. That's not attractive, by many peoples' standards. However, I tried to relate to why the author would design him that way. Perhaps SHE finds boys that dress like that to be attractive. That idea is gross seeing as how only gang members and the low end of the young teenage boy spectrum would wear what she describes. She seems to be of higher quality than that. My conclusion was that she was trying to relate to teenagers and make him seem attractive to the average teenage girl, which I find to be insulting (I think I've made it evident as to how I would find it insulting). PS, I don't mean to offend anyone who does find that style attractive, I'm just going off of what I know and what I know most others opinions are. Anyways, Vi's relationship with Jag is so evidently constructed by an outside power that it's ridiculous Johnson published the book this way. Vi immediately develops a crush on Jag (that part could really happen) but then she jumps ahead in the relationship. There's no buildup. Not too far in, she's making out with the guy. Again, my conclusion was that she was trying to make it relate-able to teens, and again, I find it insulting. Yeah, there are many people who meet and start making out, but those are typically the relationships that don't last. It seems to be that Johnson's opinion of the average teen is a low class girl with no sense of personal morals or real pride. That's REALLY hard to relate to.<br /><br />The ending has a twist. It could even have been a good one if it was done right,  but it wasn't. When I put the book down I was still curious about how it goes on, but the torture of getting through the book was so painful that I decided not to even consider bothering with the sequel.<br /><br />In the end, the book absolutely sucked. I know it's Johnson's first novel but it feels like she didn't even try. I've read many other first books that were done well. This isn't one of them. I highly recommend, instead, that any potential reader go pick up Matched by Allie Condie. Matched doesn't end up following the same story, but the basic story line is there and the execution was flawless in my opinion. Iam highly disappointed with the way this book turned out. I honestly wanted it to be another good read, but we can't always get what we want.am highly disappointed with the way this book turned out.

I have seen this book in many other blogs before, but because of its simple cover, I didn't know what to think of it. I never gave it much thought, which led to never picking it up either. This was like a message from heavan. How can I have not picked up this book earlier? Because I loved it more than I expected it to be. Vi, the main protagonist, is my favorite female lead till now. I just loved her so much! Her characteristic was so strong and powerful, and oh the sarcasim. I loved it all. The book starts off in a very creative dystopian world, the \\""goodlands\\"", where girls are not allowed to touch boys. Vi does the following rebellious act with her future match, Zenn. While the Thinkers think they have brainwashed everyone, Vi does not seem to agree.<br />Vi was all about doing what her heart tells her to do. I loved her strong will, and her determination to let no Thinkers brainwash her. When Vi is taken away for the 7th rebellious act she has done, she is sent to \\""prison\\"".

It was thoroughly planned, and it was all filled with excitement as well. I loved the characters, and let me tell you, this book shocked me till the end! Even the last page had my mouth gaping. I should really say how much I loved the dystopian world Elana created. It really made me think that it might actually happen later on. It felt realistic to me as well. That it was actually possible.

Good dialogue, good but concise descriptions, catchy interior monologue.<br />3. Good characters.<br />4.

They are freaking bi-polar. One minute they're having a decent conversation, the next someone jumps to a conclusion and gets emotionally hurt and storms off, twenty-four hours and a hot shower later, they're sorry and cuddling and making out. THIS IS NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A RELATIONSHIP. Oh my word.<br />2. I got lost around Chapter 30.

They are a group of people called the Special Forces and Association of Directors who are from Freedom.

It's almost a game and to play it, Vi (the protagonist reader's are introduced to), has to make the choice to become like the Thinker's in a way to keep from being controlled by them herself. She finds herself living in this dystopian society of sorts, where it's essentially good vs bad, and the Thinker's are the one's holding all of the cards and making the decsions. The bad, well those are the free thinkers, the one's who refuse to be manipulated and controlled. Vi, is well on her way to becoming one of the Goodies who wishes to be controlled no longer.<br /><br />Possession is quite a captivating story told, at times, confusing for the reader to follow along with what Johnson is trying to convey. It is my personal opinion that the author gets a little too caught up in knowing what's happening all of the time in the story, that she sometimes forgets to include little tidbits that would be helpful to the reader in explaining things further. In theory, the premise is fantastic and the story is quite captivating and enough to keep the reader turning the pages.<br /><br />The draw back is the lack of history established in the novel, itself. There could have easily been a little more world-building included towards the beginning of the story, to help the reader better understand the motives of the character's and the society itself.<br /><br />Johnson does well in providing the reader with well written solid character's that are relatable, a well developed plot with a bit of a unique twist to it, and wonderful imagery. Possession is a fast-paced interesting read, that provides some twists and turns towards the end, that the reader will not be expecting. It can be quite surprising and suspensful.",2011-10-18

I particularly hate to give a Young Adult dystopian novel a bad review because 1.  That is my favorite (sub?) genre and 2. I don't ask much from books like these.  If my attention is sustained, I am forced to think a bit about the nature of humanity, and I like the characters--I like the book.  Possession did not meet the first or the last requirement.<br /><br />My attention was not sustained, and not because the book didn't have an interesting premise--it certainly did.  The problem was (and I'm so sorry to have to say this) the writing was so poor it was actually difficult to follow.  It seems like the author struggles with the ability to describe movement through place and time.  For example, Violet is walking alone towards the Badlands.  One second she is in what I'm envisioning as an empty, scorched field, and then in the next line she is (maybe?) in a city, passing by many people.  I literally had to page back several times--or, worse, check to see if I'd missed a section.  I don't know about you, but when I read a novel, I see the story in my head.  Reading this book was like watching a film that randomly stopped and skipped forward in a sort of shaky, awkward way.  The main reason I read YA fiction (as an adult) is because I taught middle school for many years.  Honestly, this novel reads like a story written by an 8th grade (I actually Googled the author to see if, perhaps, she was in high school when she wrote this.) Again, I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just being honest--and I've never written a novel and can only imagine how difficult it must be.<br /><br />Yet I continue, because there is one more issue that needs to be mentioned:  I hate the main character of this book--and not in a good way.  To hate a character in a good way they have to be a well-written bad-guy.  Like President Snow in The Hunger Games, or (leaving the YA genre) William Hamleigh or Waleren in Pillars of the Earth.  Violet was just bad in a 'what exactly IS her personality, anyway?' sort of fashion.  Is she the tough-guy-girl?  Is she a girly-girl in love?  Is she a rebel?  Is she a rule-follower?  Is she scared, brave, or crazy?  This only adds to the confusion brought on by the other narrative issues mentioned above.<br /><br />So what did Possession have going for it?  The second criteria I mentioned--you are forced to think about some basic moral/human/technological issues when reading this book. For that, I gave it the second star.  But there are other books that do this same thing in a much more readable fashion.  It pains me to say this (being the type of teacher who prefers to give kids contemporary YA lit than the 'old standards) but I'd be more apt to suggest 1984 or Brave New World to one of my students than I would be to suggest Possession.ust bad in a 'what exactly IS her personality, anyway?' sort of fashion.

I have to admit though, this book is relatively slow to start, but after about page 100, I was absolutely captivated. Also, be warned, we have another love triangle on our hands. I'm getting exhausted of love triangles... Regardless, I really enjoyed this book. By the end I wanted to read it again.<br /><br />The plot becomes a quick, fast paced adventure for the characters- packed full of mind control and little twists that kept me flipping the pages. The mind control did help the characters get out of most situations, but it is still thrilling. The characters are frustrating but likeable and it is hard to say what their motives may be and who is good and who is bad... Love this. I don't want to be able to predict the side a character has ultimately chosen.<br /><br />Since I mentioned the characters- I liked them. I didn't find myself falling in love with any of them, but they were intriguing. Vi's decisions and snark were sometimes amusing and sometimes too much. Jag, Vi's love interest, is mysterious, easy going and completely entertaining. I loved his wits and his interactions with Vi. They're perfect for each other. I really can't wait to see what Elana has in store for us in Possession #2.<br /><br />Those that are obsessing over the dystopian novels this year (like myself!) will probably really get into this one. I suggest those that feel they're getting tired of the trite mind-numbed societies and love triangles may want to move on to the next one.

I don't know if it is the fact that the hype built up my expectations, or the fact that the book was long and fast paced.  I just don't know what it was exactly that burst my bubble for this book.<br /><br />I wasn't a fan of the characters.  How many more angry and angst filled heroines do we really need in a book? Fighting for what you want is one thing, but angry at everything is just overload for the reader.  I wished Vi would bring out her smile more often so we could see an emotion run through her besides anger.  I was also confused through much of the book.  It had me rereading more paragraphs than normal and made this book longer than what it needed to be.  It actually took about half of the book before I could get into a good reading pace for this story.  The set up for the world in which Vi lives in is also confusing due to the fact of not much of a history being told.  I wasn't sure what their world involved and how it was established.  I just was left with that question mark above my head wondering why the beginning of the book couldn't have explained things better for the reader.<br /><br />I will admit to loving the ending.  It was on that left me excited for the next book in the series.  I just hope that the author can make the second book as great as the ending in the first.  This is one book that didn't live up to the hype I had heard. I wanted more and didn't get it until the end when it was too late. I also felt that too many things were left unanswered and that a few of them could have been wrapped up in this book to help satisfy the reader.",2011-09-29

When I think of the main idea of the story, I liked it.  But it was the writing that made me question whether I enjoyed the book.       I was confused for a lot of the story.  I would go back and re-read paragraphs, thinking I had skipped over something, but no.  There was a lot that seemed to be jumped over.  Small little parts that you wonder just what happened.  I want to say the book was jumpy, but its not like it jumped from scene to scene or character to character.  It was almost like watching a movie and falling asleep for a minute and missing just that one little detail.  And Goodies versus Baddies.  And who was what and who was a spy for whom.  Huh?  I got confused on that too.       But then I was also hooked into the story.  I wanted to know what was going to happen to Vi and Jag.  And the ending definitely leaves you wondering just what's going to happen next.  I'm not sure I'll read the next book, but I think I'll wait to read reviews before I decide.

Even if they're good boys--and Zenn is the best.<br /><br />I know right? It's intruiging... I was suddenly captivated just reading those first two lines of the book!

I bet you'll love him too!<br /><br />Vi, Jag, and Zenn are the three main characters in the story. Vi has always loved Zenn, her bestfriend, her protector, her partner in every rule breaking she does in Goodgrounds--her perfect match. And there's Jag, the boy with the wicked hair (just like her), the boy from the Badlands, one who has always been bad (though not really), the boy she truly love and the only person who can fill the hole in her life. The boy she called Perfect. For Vi life has always been full of choices. Good or bad? Zenn or Jag? Duty or Death?<br /><br />I've read a lot of Dystopian Novels and they never fail to captivate me. Maybe that's the reason why I picked this book, and I wasn't wrong. Elana Johnson knows how to engross a reader from beginning to end.<br /><br />You can easily picture the world which the author created. It was too futuristic, and frightening as well. There are lots of high technology emphasis: from the Mechanic Robots (which acts like human), the high-end transmissions which the Thinkers used to brainwash and manipulate people, to the chips being inserted on your skin, the teleport rings (which I find interesting), the talking walls, the silencer (the one they used to silence people), the taser, and a lot more... But the most interesting to me are the characters who possess special talents, those who are able to control people using their minds and voices. Something I wasn't expecting at all.<br /><br />Well, there are actually lots of things I didn't anticipated. Some surprised me and some annoyed me, but that didn't stop me from reading it. Most of the times, I needed to re-read some parts of the book just to catch up and understand why the characters suddenly act this way, or act that way. Sometimes it's weird and I couldn't grasp the idea. There are still lots of questions in my mind right now that are left unanswered even after finishing the book (which I better not mention to avoid spoilers). Sometimes the events are little confusing, but nevertheless, I still enjoyed it. This book is thrilling and engrossing, it's easy to ignore those flaws and continue reading until I feel satisfied (which is hard because I can't get enough of this book either!). I so love the twists in the story which makes it more enjoyable.<br /><br />From the time I started reading Possession, I couldn't put it down. I was so into it and the love triangle of Vi, Jag and Zenn is quite entertaining to me. I was so eager to know what would happen to them especially to Vi and Jag (and YES, I'm definitely Team Jag here!).<br /><br />Though I love Jag and Vi together, I hate it when Vi sometimes becomes bossy and I hate it more when she calls Jag stupid (because he's not!). She's so upset all the time that I find her annoying. Thanks to Jag, he keeps me entertained! I bet you'll gonna love him and you'll miss him every minute he's away. I can't seem to get enough of those two... their conversations made my grin wider... and their arguments and teasing are always a hit to me. Blockbuster I might say.<br /><br />I knew from the start that I'm off to a huge cliffhanger ending... but still, I didn't expected this one. I am way too anxious to learn about the next book, which is some kind of torture, knowing you have to wait for months or a year to read it.

I must admit, the cover art is what enticed me to flip the book over and read the synopsis and the synopsis was enough to coax me to read. Though, I'm still having doubts about what the title represents.<br /><br />  In this dystopian world, society is separated into black and white categories. Good versus bad, freedom versus control, and thinking as opposed to following. The reader is thrown into the story immediately, no slow progression or lengthy character development, which in the end led to why I didn't feel as strong of a connection to the protagonist as I should have. The story follows Vi (Violet) as her good world starts to unravel around her and she gets caught up with a bad boy.<br /><br />  Vi is caught in between her \\""good\\"" boy Zenn and \\""bad\\"" boy Jag. Elena Johnson really takes the reader on an emotional ride as Jag is super sexy, enticing, and yet despicable all at once. I felt the romantic storyline was pure and believable in that way a teenager can become enraptured so quickly. This is definitely one of those reads that will leave you longing for more, romantically. Though Johnson's restraint in when it comes to intimacy is both commendable and appropriate for a young adult novel.<br /><br />  Unlike so many dystopian youth novels in this genre we do not see Vi's journey from blindness to sight. The story takes off immediately with Vi already being a free thinker, a troubled teen who is bucking the system at every turn in a society where control is everything. When Vi meets up with Jag, a boy from the Badlands, her world takes an even sharper turn for Bad. Vi struggles with the definitions of \\""good\\"" and \\""bad\\"" and her own place in this constricting society.<br /><br />  I flip flip on Johnson's writing. There is something in the way she writes about an arm slipping around a waist or fingers running through hair, that just sent a billion butterflies fluttering through my insides, and yet at the same time the immature writing was sometimes distracting. We see the world from Vi's perspective, first person narratives are my personal favorite, but sometimes the speakers voice is distracting from the story. I found phrases like \\""-yeah, that didn't happen\\"" distracting, removing me from the story and reminding me that I was reading a book.<br /><br />  It's a good thing this story was written in first person narrative because it was hard to connect with Vi, though I'm not certain why. One person it was not hard to connect with was Jag, and I found myself more concerned with Jag then Vi. A little more character development with Vi would have gone a long way. I also found it sort of irritatingly ironic that Vi's \\""goodie\\"" boyfriend was named Zenn and her \\""baddie\\"" boyfriend, Jag. Not to mention, Violet, the girl who is blossoming, coming into her own.

I always thought that every Dystopian novel was the 'end of the world', 'post-apocalyptic' mystery.  Elana Johnson's Possession is NOT that - while there is plenty of thrills and mystery.  This is a fantastic novel for those like myself who were afraid of reading Dystopian novels.  As Possession is told from Vi's point of view, you learn the many truths of Vi's past, present and future with her, and you get confused and angry with her.  This in particular really made this novel enjoyable.<br /><br />Then of course you have the love triangle: Zenn-Vi-Jag.  I will have to say I loved Jag and Vi together, even though sometimes I was right next to Vi when it came to wanting the 'ring' his neck.  But at the same time you cannot help but feel for Zenn.  While at times it was frustrating to not know what was going on, pretty much all the time, this confusion was one of the best things about this novel - the suspense really keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Elana Johnson has created very delicate and intricate relationships, tied together in ways you will never see coming.  For those already fans of Dystopians or for those who are timid to read them, this is the perfect novel to add to your reading list.",2011-08-31

There are the Good and the Bad.  The Good are the controlled, and they follow every rule and obey mindlessly.  The Bad are the rulebreakers, the free thinkers, the uncontrollable.  There is no human contact after age 8, and Good girls don't kiss boys.  They wear hats at all times, and long-sleeves to cover their skin from the sun- or maybe from temptation.  Here's the thing- I wasn't honestly sure why the rules on the Good side even existed.  Some were explained; the Thinkers sought to control every aspect of the citizens lives to ensure order.  But the human contact thing was never explained, and even though she's a rule-breaker, Vi was able to shake that particular brainwashing off pretty quick with Jag.  If the people were truly being brainwashed, then she would have exhibited at least more than just the token resistance she shows.<br />  There were many things about this book that confused me.  The author jumps from place to place, mood to mood, person to person sometimes in mid page.  I didn't understand her fascination with Jag all that much, or even her feelings for Zenn, to tell the truth.  Vi's emotions never make any real sense to me, all the way through the book.  My largest complaint is that the idea was a very good one, but like another reviewer said, it is better than the execution.<br />  That being said, I enjoyed it anyway.  I liked Vi, regardless of how many times she said \\""yeah\\"" and \\""like\\"".  The dialog is written in a teenage vernacular, and I think we need to make allowances for how the author presumably wanted to relate to the book's intended audience.  Further, while I have no idea what really happened near the end or how, I was affected enough by the story that I was disturbed by the ending and want the author to tell me what happens to them in the future.

Whenever that happens, you know that things are bad. I didn't understand why Violet had such a big attitude or chip on her shoulder and while Elana tried to make Jag seem super sexy and mysterious, I only found it strange that Violet would suddenly give up 5 years of loving Zenn after a week with Jag.

Which is horrible news for young rebel Violet, who has been breaking rules repeatedly since first her father and then her older sister disappeared. The one constant in her life is Zenn, the boy she has been matched with for five years, but since he has become a member of the Forces, their time together has been short. So when Violet once again breaks the rules in order to go see him, it's not surprising that she is caught; but this time she is imprisoned with a boy named Jag who seems to be just as determined as she is to not give in to the Thinkers who control their lives. Like I said, great premise...but the execution is so poor, it was almost a struggle to finish the book.<br /><br />This book started off strong and I was captured at first by Violet's rebellious spirit and the mystery of her disappearing family. I liked that she was devoted to Zenn, but intrigued with her growing relationship with Jag. Once the two escape the Greenies and go on the run, however, things begin to fall apart. Neither Violet nor Jag are very likable at this point, with each abandoning the other and secrets withheld at every turn. It's a lot of \\""I've got a secret; I hate you; no, I adore you; no, we're fighting again; wait, I've got a superpower!\\"" sort of thing. I'm still puzzling over where the \\""powers\\"" came from; if they were that strong, wouldn't Violet have had some sense of them before suddenly realizing she can control everyone? Both Jag and Violet just aren't very empathetic creatures. Jag betrays Violet so often that I truly wanted to smack him...and Violet kept falling for it. Ugh. And while I sort of liked Zenn, considering he was controlled and unable to fight against the Association, he was pretty much worthless as a boyfriend.<br /><br />Once again, I'm wondering where the editors are.

The Thinkers have been monitoring Vi's behavior for a long time--ever since her sister Ty's death when Violet unplugged herself from the transmissions that tells the Goodies how they are to think and act. While imprisoned, Vi meets Jag Barque, a young man who is a Baddie. Vi knows she no longer has a future with Zenn, who is now working for the Forces. She is drawn into Jag's world--one where he can think and act on his own desires.   But the Thinkers have other plans for Vi; they want her to become one of them. A high ranking official has a very special interest in Violet, and the things that she is capable of doing. Joining their cause means she will get Zenn back, but Violet is certain that it is Jag she loves, even if she doesn't trust him. Who will Violet choose?  I'd heard a lot of excited buzz about Elana Johnson's debut novel, so I bumped it up on my TBR--only to end up super disappointed. I consider myself to be pretty familiar with dystopian novels, especially ones written for the YA crowd. Immediately I disliked Violet's voice, and Johnson's writing style. Certainly she writes with simple sentences that take very little brain power to decipher, but it's the plot development and the structure that ruin what could have otherwise been a more than acceptable addition to dystopian fiction.  I re-read the front flap after finishing POSSESSION, and found myself wondering if the person who wrote it read POSSESSION, or if they were just as confused as I was while reading this trippy novel. The front flap leads you to believe that Violet's match, Zenn, is an important character in the novel, and that Violet must go through some trials to save him. The majority of the novel is interactions between Violet and Jag, and we only meet Zenn through flashbacks and memories until he finally makes a few appearances later on.   I haven't had a chance yet to see what others have thought of this book, but I imagine there is probably a whole Team Zenn vs. Team Jag. Well, I'm for neither. Zenn felt very...hollow. I didn't think that he had much personality, and couldn't figure out what he had that made Violet so gaga for him. Jag has more personality, but I didn't trust him at all. I didn't in the least feel myself attracted to him. Violet would be better off without both of them.  POSSESSION confused and irritated me to no end when it randomly started switching scenes and also narrative voices. We would sometimes end up in Jag's head, where he would be narrating for a page or two, but there was no lead up to this happening; the transition was poorly made. If I'm figuring correctly, Violet, Jag, and Lyle are the 3 different voices we hear, but it all sounds the same. Johnson does absolutely nothing to make them sound different from each other, and if this was intentional, I really didn't like it.  I think the ending, however, is actually pretty decent. For a certain type of reader, the ending will be very disappointing. But it worked for me, even if the rest of the book was a catastrophic failure on so many levels.  Apparently a companion novel is in the works, but I will be passing on it to seek out better written and structured dystopian novels.",2011-08-16

There's Vi, a rebellious teen who questions her world and what she learnt growing up. Jag is the sexy, layered bad boy, literally. He's a Baddie who teaches Vi that the badlands aren't all that bad and there's more to life than transmissions and e-comms. Of course, there's Zenn, Vi's perfect match, or so they think. He's brainwashed by a higher figure of authority that's after Vi and Jag.    This book has a very interesting plot and so many twists it'll leave you breathless trying to catch up. It is written eloquently and hauntingly. Jag's words will pull you in just as much as Vi's internal struggle will. Trust me when I say that Thane's creepiness will cause shivers to dance up your spine, and tears will drip from your eyes when you read the last chapters.     The ending was so shocking, I had to re-read it a few times to truly understand what was happening. I enjoyed every moment while reading this lovely and haunting story. It took me 4 hours and a half to finish, and now that it is daylight again, I believe I shall get off the laptop and take a shower.    But seriuosly though, read this. You will not be disappointed. I can do nothing but wait for the sequel now.",2011-08-16

I was engaged with the characters both from the past and the present and I often felt as if I was on the edge of my seat from the suspense of the literary discovery and who may ultimately benefit from it.

It's not just that this is about the Goodies vs. the Baddies - that can actually work (see the series by Scott Westerfield that starts with Uglies for a great example) - it's just that the characters are one-dimensional and the plot lines simplistic and unchallenging.  Given the terrific choices in Dystopian Lit out there, this may be good Starter Dystopia for insulated youth, but anyone who has read anything from Hunger Games to Enclave, Wither to Divergent, is going to be a bit bored and left disappointed.<br /><br />I found it a chore to finish the book and won't be rereading or looking for a sequel.

Expecting an amazing love triangle in a dystopian world, I found myself disappointed with the weak characterisation and relationships. While I did enjoy the restrictiveness of the society and futuristic possibilities, it wasn't enough to make me love this book.    In a place where the Listeners aim to control, everyone is brainwashed to be Goodies in order to have a cohesive and fully cooperative city. The main character, Vi, is matched with Zenn, a Thinker-in-training who is willing to bend the rules. On a forbidden stroll in the dark, the two are apprehended and Vi is taken away to Green where she will be punished for her long list of rule-breaking. There, she meets Jag Barque, a Baddie who is well acquainted with the jail there. When forced to share a cell, the two make a plan to escape before embarking on a dangerously ambitious mission.    This novel was really good in terms of keeping the reader in suspense and confusion. Everything is possible in Possession so there's no real way to predict what is going to happen. Vi is a very sarcastic narrator and was very likeable in the beginning, as she was forthright and entertaining with her sass. It's very unfortunate that her lack of decision between Zenn and Jag made her quite unlikeable later on. She switched positions very rapidly, would get too angry at people for the slightest things before forgiving them with a simple hug after a short bout of silence. It was like a game of Olympic ping pong, it happened so quickly and often! I also had trouble understanding why making decisions was so difficult for her - 90% of the time, the answer was obvious.    I never felt a connection with any of the characters but I'm really hoping that this is improved on in the sequel. The novel ended on a gasp-worthy cliffhanger that actually makes me want to give this series another go! While Possession does have its negatives, I think there are quite a few positives too.

Actually,  the only scenes in the book were a bit raw and gut-wrenching. There weren't any real sex scenes (although there is a scene I wished I could've read regarding 2 particular characters), which is a rarity in today's literary world.  Don't get me wrong, I love a great sex scene...it does a reader good, but Hale didn't need that in this title. Surprisingly,  Hale penned such an excellent piece of work, without great sex scenes.

[...] [S]o much so that you almost feel you have to genuflect before it every time you pick it up.\\"" I don't remotely agree.<br /><br />While `Possession' is certainly impressive in some respects, it is clearly deficient in others. Let me start with the glaring insult to Americans. The ridiculously obvious villain in this book is Mortimer Cropper. Take a good look at his name. `Mort' is death (mortician, mortuary) and `crop' as a verb means to cut; in short he's the Grim Reaper. Let's look at Byatt's lack of subtlety in the first scene in which Cropper appears: he is wearing a \\""Black silk dressing gown,\\"" over \\""Black silk pyjamas,\\"" \\""mole-Black slippers,\\"" and he \\""pushed down on a switch on his Black box.\\"" (Capital \\""Bs\\"" mine.) He had \\""American hips, ready for ... the faraway ghost of a gunbelt.\\"" (American hips? There's her minor, separate, pot-shot at American gun laws.) Morty drinks Black coffee, and in case you are a dense American reader and still don't get it, \\""His car was a long black Mercedes ... a swift funereal car.\\"" So there's Cropper, death driving a hearse.<br /><br />That's not the insult. The insult is that Cropper, backed by tons of American money, is busy buying up all the \\""relics\\"" of fictitious Victorian poet Randolph Ash as though the material items that belonged to Ash were more important than the poetry he wrote. This is Byatt's way of saying Americans are not very bright (Cropper is a scholar don't forget) and easily mistake the image for the thing itself, are so dazzled by gold foil wrapping they forget to analyze the contents of the box. It's a clumsy perpetuation of a stereotype--one that Kazuo Ishiguro brilliantly annihilated in THE REMAINS OF THE DAY. Byatt's hero, lowly Roland Mitchell, says at least twice how he's not interested in Ash's personal belongings, just in what Ash wrote. One just wants to reach into the book and pat him on the head.<br /><br />To be sure, Cropper's Scottish counterpart, James Blackadder (a double-sided name I'll let you ponder for yourselves) doesn't come off particularly favorably, but he's the under-funded underdog against the rich American. And while both men have subsumed their identities under Ash's, have devoted their lives to someone else's work rather than producing original work of their own, Cropper is clearly the more reprehensible of the two: \\""Maud decided she intuited ...\\"" notice the clunkiness of the phrase by the way ... does Maud really need to decide to intuit? How about: Maud intuited \\""something terrible about Cropper's imagination .... He had a peculiarly vicious version of reverse hagiography\\"" [note the cheap repetition of the letter V]:\\""the desire to cut his subject down to size.\\"" Precisely what `crop' means, of course.<br /><br />Do I want to \\""genuflect\\"" in front of this text? Hardly. While Byatt does an admirable job with recreating Victorian letters and Victorian poems--really first rate--the actual story suffers. There are so many poems, so many letters the narrative never gains much momentum. Every time you think the story is going to go somewhere, she throws a 10-page poem at you or 20 pages of letters. They bog the story down interminably.<br /><br />As for the \\""spectacular writing,\\"" it's all reserved for the Victorian recreations. There's nothing particularly impressive about the sentences that convey the contemporary story; there's a lot to be desired in fact. Here's an example: \\""A very small woman appeared .... She wore a large apron covered with purple and grey florets, over a skinny black jumper. She had a small hard, brown-skinned face under white hair drawn into a bun.\\"" A very unimaginative piling up of 5th-grade adjectives: colors, small (twice!), large, and that's about it. The writing is workmanlike, competent, but hardly better.<br /><br />Or \\""The librarian fetched a checkedduster, and wiped away the dust, a black, thick, tenacious Victorian dust, a dust composed of smoke and fog particles accumulated before the Clean Air Acts.\\"" [p. 5] Do we really need this repetition of dust?

Nothing uninteresting (Johnson is creating a new world from scratch), but also not anything that makes it stand out as unique -- *at first*.     Once Johnson gets going with the action, there's literally no break. The desire to turn the page and find out what happens next is equivalent to that of Hunger Games. Every event builds on the last and the number of safe places for the characters slowly diminishes. About the time Vi might be thinking 'it can't get any worse than this', it gets much, much worse.    There are also so many twists and turns, the reader has no clue who to trust and who has what agenda. Even by the end of the book, there are many open ended questions that are still left hanging. And the ending is so unexpected from what Johnson builds in the beginning, there's no way the reader can guess what's going to happen.    Vi and Jag are both enjoyable, though at times can be annoying. The constant 'come here, come here, come here - go away, go away, go away' recurs frequently and even starts to detract from the story a bit. Fortunately by the time the reader really gets annoyed, Johnson has both characters grow up a little. There is also a constant theme that Jag can abandoned Vi but come back and be forgiven if he only says he loves her. This seems very disingenuous, especially since the reader doesn't know Jag's real motives and makes Vi look overly naive. As for Zenn, he is hard to grasp. Perhaps it's because he's being brainwashed through the majority of the book so his personality doesn't come out, but he appears flat and one-dimensional.    Overall, the mind bending plot and unexpected events Johnson creates is enough to overlook the flaws in the character personalities and anxiously anticipate next summer's companion piece Fugitive.",2011-07-15

I can't really decide if I liked this one or not since I still have Legend and Divergent on my mind and I don't know if anything will ever measure up to those 2 books. That being said I did enjoy Possession on some level but it just wasn't strong enough in my opinion to stand out in a crowd of books.<br />The story centers around Violet, a baddie criminal who just wants freedom. She lives in a place where everything is controlled including who you talk to, what you wear, your job, and even interaction between parents and their children. Every person must log into a transmission at night where they are taught the \\""proper\\"" ways to live. Violet learns how to get around this and thus begins her criminal career. When the court decides that she is just not able to follow rules any longer they decide to throw her and Jag a fellow rule breaker in a cell to be transferred later to the Badlands (a place of banishment). Things start unraveling from there and Violet discovers that in order to survive she must find her Father who left her when she was 7. Does she find him, you will have to read to find out but the adventure there is a long one so be prepared.<br />So the story sounds good, well probably not my retelling but you get the drift. I think I would have liked this one better if the main characters would have been more likable. I started out loving Violet, she is a strong girl who isn't afraid to break the rules, but my goodness this child is whiny. I got so tired of reading her inner monologues because they were always about the same things and sometimes it seemed like the whole paragraph was just copied and pasted. Jag wasn't much better either. I read a lot of YA and I know that instalove is a big thing but these two really broke the record with falling in love after 2 days. I had to read that part twice to make sure that I read it right and yup it took them two days to fall in love and Violet had a boyfriend, who was her match and she loved, at the time. I guess out of sight out of mind worked for her? The whole triangle felt weird, I never believed that anybody loved anybody and it didn't help that with every page there was a new lie that was uncovered to show that all they cared about was themselves. So yeah the romance fell really flat with me.<br />I think that the concept of the book needed more structure also. After finishing the book I am still confused about so many things. I would list them but I don't want to type out that much, I will just say that the whole tech world that Johnson has created needs to be explained more. I was so shocked about all the special abilities also. Mind control and voice control are a huge part of the story and while I think they fit the author tended to turn them off when she wanted. I just don't understand why Violet didn't use her talents at the end with the final showdown.

Right this minute.<br /><br />Possession opens to a world where nearly everyone is contained, suppressed, and void of freedom.  In this world tech has become even more superior, where a simple looking phone is now a weapon, walls talk, people can teleport, and tiny cubes magically manifest any food you could wish for (hello chocolate cake!), but that is just scraping the surface.  Because behind the ordinary people's subdued state is a greater threat.  Thinkers.  These people are nearly supernatural in their abilities, and the biggest, baddest power of them all?  Possession.  Thinkers control people with just their minds.  And while many people are going about their daily lives in naivet&eacute;, there is a small group of people who realize the truth.  That plugging into the transmissions every night is sure fire way to become brainwashed into being a perfect model citizen, exactly what the Thinkers want.  But who better to break these rules than Vi, a supposed to be Goodie, which is a person living in the Goodgrounds who wears their straw hat all the time, including indoors, jeans, and required long sleeve shirt, and doesn't shirk the rules.  But poor Vi is having a hard time being good.  Not only does she not plug in every night for her daily dose of brainwashing, like a good girl should, but she constantly finds ways to buck the system with small offenses.  But one walk in the park with her match, Zenn, and it all goes downhill from there.  She's taken prisoner and forced to stand before a council of people along with a black, spiky haired boy with a killer grin, and tanned skin named Jag.  Vi realizes pretty quickly that people are keeping secrets from her, and nobody is forthcoming with answers.  But Vi isn't a shrinking lily...she is more than a match for any Thinker.  Escaping with Jag at her side Vi continues on a perilous journey, fleeing Greenies and Thinkers alike, trekking across scorching wastelands, while trying to find answers to a multitude of questions.

Good people do it all the time. But walking through the park with a boy could get me in trouble.\\""<br /><br />Violet Schoenfeld is a Good girl - which simply menas she lives in the goodgrounds. Goodies live without fear or hunger or pollution, but they also live without any control over their own lives. In fact, they hardly have any control over their own thoughts. Thinkers make all the decisions for the Goodies: who to love, how to live, what to care about; and these decisions are passed on to the Goodies through mandatory mental transmissions while they sleep. Violet though, well Violet doesn't like being controlled, so she rebels in small ways. Oh, she's not a Baddie (a free thinker, living in the much less prosperous badlands), far from it, but she does enjoy breaking the occasional rule. Now, apparently, Violet has broken one rule too many.<br /><br />Even though she was only walking in the park with her Thinker-approved match, Zenn, this latest infraction lands Violet in prison. That's where she meets bad boy Jag Barque and learns things about her life and her world that change everything. After a daring escape, Vi and Jag are on the run from the Thinkers, trying desperately to avoid recapture. And while Vi has developed strong feelings for Jag, she can't help worrying about Zenn. Sweet, wonderful Zenn who is clearly being brainwashed and mind-controlled. Can Violet escape the Thinkers and still help Zenn?<br /><br />If it were possible to give half-stars, I would have rated this book 2 1/2 as opposed to 3. My feelings about it lay somewhere between 'I didn't like it' and 'it was okay.' So it's not that I hated it, I didn't, but based on the description, I expected to like it a whole lot more than I did. In fact, I wanted to love it, but too many niggling problems kept getting in my way. So in the end, I liked the idea of Possession, but not the execution.<br /><br />I'll start with a quick rundown of what I did like. The dystopian society Ms. Johnson has created was interesting. The Goodies think they have the best of everything, but what really makes the Baddies bad  is that they aren't under government control. They may not have all the technology that the Goodies enjoy, but they clearly have more freedom. I also liked the idea of Violet being a free-thinker, despite (or maybe because of) her upbringing. I wanted her to escape and help others resist. And I should point out that I plan to read the sequel to this book, even though I wasn't that fond of it. So obviously, Possession made me care enough about Violet to wonder what comes next.<br /><br />For the things I didn't like about this book, I'm going to use a list. I won't elaborate where doing so will reveal too much of the story, but I can't give this novel a poor rating without at least telling you why.<br /><br />1. This is a little thing, but it bugged me. The reasons for most of the goodgrounds strict rules are revealed as the book goes along, but there is never a reason given for forbidding human contact after age 8 (unless a couple is married). It doesn't play a major role in the story, but it is something that Violet has done wrong. It's against the rules for no reason, as far as I could see. And even though the other rules are crazy, the Thinkers do have a reason.<br /><br />2. This leads me to another thing that bugged me. When Violet is put in prison, she shares a cell with Jag. Even she thinks it's crazy that she was jailed for walking in the park with a boy and then thrown in a cell with another boy. The Thinkers clearly have a reason for doing it, but we never find out what it was. So in the end, it seems like a plot contrivance to allow Vi and Jag to meet.<br /><br />3. I can think of no situation in which Violet and Jag's romance is realistic. She's madly in love with Zenn, the first chapter or so makes it clear that she's felt that way for a while. No actual romancing goes on, as far as I can tell, but Vi and Jag are obviously a couple almost from the first time they meet. It just never feels real. And while we're on the subject of Zenn and Jag, I didn't feel like either one of them was a real prize. Both of them were jerks at one point or another. For most of the book, I actually liked Zenn more. If he's being controlled, it's not his fault if he's a jerk. By the end, though, I didn't care much for either one of them.<br /><br />4. I can't explain this one without giving too much of the story away, but if you read it you'll know what I'm talking about. Who dreams in complete, linear memories? Seriously, no one that I know of.<br /><br />5. The story makes a few jumps and leaps that are hard for the reader to follow. I'm sure the author knew what was going on at all times, but she might have known it so well that she forgot to fill in some of the details. (Why the test - the one Jake gives Vi?) Those uneven patches made the plot hard to follow and by the end, I wasn't really sure what was going on and I didn't care enough to try and reason it out.<br /><br />6. This is another bit of nitpicking, but Vi's inner snarky comments really started to irritate me about a quarter of the way though the book. (Example: \\""Yeah, the biting-my-tongue-thing only happens once in a lifetime, and I'd just used my quota.\\"" She has little mental asides like this all through the book.)<br /><br />So yes, I thought the book had problems, but this is Ms. Johnson's first published novel, so it's likely her next novel will be smoother.

The Goods are separate from each other. They do as they are told, do not ask questions. This allows them to live comfortably in a society full of technological advances. The Bads live in a society which almost mirrors our current society. They live for the here and now. Vi stands at the divide. She is neither a Good or Bad. Basically, all she wants is freedom. To do what she wants, with whom ever she wants.<br /><br />As a whole, I liked Vi. She was sassy with a little innocence thrown in. She can take the lead or just stand in the background. But I hated her insecurities. One second she is strong and the next, completely unsure of herself. And the sad part is, this goes on for the whole novel. Towards the middle of the book, I found myself yelling at her to just pick a personality already.<br /><br />Just when I thought Vi's personality was a problem, the romance got thrown in. Zenn or Jag. Possession tended to revolve around this whole idea. Who is the right \\""man\\"" for Vi? If I had to pick right now, my vote is for Zenn. Although, there is a lot I do not know yet about him. There is something about him that has my interest piqued.<br /><br />It is clear from reading Possession that Johnson had a vision for Vi's society when she wrote it. As I read it, I got the feeling that she attempted to put this vision in the novel, but hit a snag somewhere in the process. It is almost like looking at something far away that looks one way, then getting up close and the image changes. This is how the society felt. At a distance, the society made sense. I understood who stood for what. How x and y worked. As the novel progressed, everything almost became blurred.

Those sorts of stories always intrigued me. Possession is a bit different. It's a post-apocalyptic dystopian heavy on the science fiction. The world-building in the novel is really well done. The world is full of super technology. Non-Thinkers receive controlling transmissions, but rather than being your normal brainwashing program, the transmissions are delivered by mind rangers, Thinkers with the ability to control others with their voice or mind. The Thinkers justify their controlling actions by reasoning that the non-Thinkers won't be able to care for themselves or what is left of the world if they aren't controlled.<br /><br />Vi is raised as a Goodie, one of the many citizens in Goodgrounds who is forced to plug in to the Thinker transmissions, forced to wear full-body clothing and wide-brimmed hats in order to protect them from the sun. Goodies can't mingle with the opposite sex, can't be out after dark, must lock their windows at night, can't cross borders... can't do much of anything really. But Vi stops plugging in. She breaks rules. She isn't controlled. She's what the Greenies, the higher-ups, consider a Free Thinker, and they want to recruit her. She's strong-willed, and she won't allow herself to be controlled by others, forcing her to control them.<br /><br />On the run, she meets Jag, a criminal from the Badlands, a place that doesn't have rules like the Goodgrounds, but is still monitored by the Greenies. Together, they seek out a safe place where they won't be controlled or have to control others. That's the plot, basically.<br /><br />While the world-building was excellent, I had several problems with the book. Vi seemed to be the only character fully-developed. Jag just sort of existed as Vi's guide and romantic interest, and Zenn was practically faceless to me. The setting gave me a lot of problems too. I had a hard time following where everything was in this world, and it seemed that suddenly buildings would pop out of nowhere when I thought they were walking somewhere completely different. I had a hard time picturing everything.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the novel was the ending. I'll explain as best I can without giving away what actually happens. Throughout the story, Vi is a very strong character. She doesn't give in to control, and she fights for what she thinks is right. The battle between what is right and what is wrong is what drives her inner struggle throughout the course of the story. She doesn't step aside and let others tell her what to think. She figures it out for herself. And then, at the very end of the novel, she suddenly loses that strength. She becomes weak-minded, allowing her to be controlled at the most critical point in the novel.

Vi doesn't care much about the rules since her father visited the Badlands and never came home, and especially not since her sister went off to work for the government and was killed. She'll do whatever she wants, thankyouverymuch, and soon gets hauled into prison for walking through the park, after dark, holding hands with Zenn, her best friend and match.<br /><br />That's where she gets sentenced to deportation to the Badlands, and meets Jag, who grew up there. A destroyed future with Zenn nearly tears her apart, but that's only the beginning. As Vi learns more about Jag, his past, and the realities of their world, she is forced to come to terms with the real reason she was captured. Now she is faced with a series of choices that will mean either accepting or railing against what everyone else has always planned for her. What she learns about love, betrayal, and herself along the way doesn't make the choices any easier.<br /><br />This is not your typical dystopian YA novel for two main reasons:<br />  1. Even though Vi is dealing with some stuff of epic proportions, she speaks in the most authentic teenage voice I've EVER read. Her feelings and perceptions can turn on a dime, and she feels everything passionately.<br />  2. The controlling class is a totally three-dimensional and sympathetic entity. It is the only dystopian novel I've ever read that makes you understand and even agree with the reasons things have become the way they are.<br /><br />Ms. Johnson writes in a very close first person, so the reader learns everything at the exact moment and with the same intensity that Vi does.

I knew while reading this that it would be a book that wouldn't really leave an impression.  I spent too much time trying to decipher how this world functioned and the various terms and ideas presented and not nearly enough time getting to know the characters.<br /><br />I wanted to like Vi.  At first she seems like the bright spot in a dismal world.  Everything is so tightly controlled and monitored and she refuses to comply.  Of course she's arrested and imprisoned not long after the book begins.  This is when the story goes down hill.  She's imprisoned with Jag, and I mean in his cell with him.  The rest of the prison is empty.  Both are then sentenced to be tagged and banished to Freedom.  Freedom is under complete control of the Thinkers and there they will be basically reprogrammed.  For Jag, this seemed an appropriate sentence but really extreme for Vi.  Which led me to believe that there was more to Vi than we know.  Jag and Vi escape (of course they do) and head to the only place that offers asylum to people like them.  Turns out Jag and Vi do have something in common.<br /><br />When Vi discovers what she can really do and why they want her, I begin to wonder how she never figured out this before.  Things fall into place way to easily for her, almost at her will.  At the same time, it like her moves are known to well.  The Thinkers always seem to be one step ahead of her.  There are too many unknowns to factor into the story.  Things that Vi doesn't know, but everyone else seems to be aware of.<br /><br />I also didn't really feel the love triangle in the story.  Jag seemed placed in front of her.  He's the image of everything she's every been told is wrong and bad in this world.  But, yet he's nothing like what she thinks he should be.  I could never figure out Zen and what side he was really on.  It confused the hell out of me.<br /><br />In the end, I didn't dislike the book enough not to finish it.

But Violet unplugged from the Thinkers' brainwashing transmissions years ago. A rebellious and snarky heroine, Violet is caught in a rebellion movement she's not sure she wants to partake in. But what choice does she have? The Thinkers brainwashed Zenn, her love and approved future match. The mysterious deaths of her father and sister seem to be tied with the Thinkers' plans. Plus, there's Jag--the charismatic second love interest giving bad a whole new meaning.<br /><br />I wanted to like Possession: the cover is beautiful, the concept is interesting, and I love that the theme centers on choice and free will. But I couldn't get into the story. Whether I was in the silence and privacy of my own apartment or in the rushing noise of public transportation, I had to sort out all the confusion out loud.<br /><br />Where am I? I asked. Why is `Green' a fancy name for Thinkers? Why did they lock up two criminals--a male and female--in one cell, when the prison seemed empty? Wait, why is Violet so rebellious anyway? If Zenn \\""makes her want to break the rules\\"" more than anyone else...then why did he want to be a Thinker in the first place?<br /><br />I also couldn't picture Possession`s society as well as I wanted.

And then there is Freedom, a separate province that trains the Thinkers of the Good society.<br />That's where this book is interesting; the government is so completely in control, they do your thinking for you.  Thinkers are powerful and control everything. They can even intrude upon your thoughts and wishes, communicate with you and erase your memories.  And that's where and why I think this book is interesting.  That you aren't safe even in your thoughts, in your own head, is scary and sad, especially when citizens don't question it.<br />The characters were a bit weak.  There is a lot of back-and-forth between Jag (a Baddie), Vi (the protagonist) and Zenn (Vi's Goodie boyfriend who works in Special Forces).  The name Zenn for a Goodie character isn't lost on me either...I found the irony in his name pretty witty.

Well, I had a hard time making up my mind about how to review this book. That's because there are so many aspects of the story to love, and so many aspects to hate.    Let's start with the bad:  - Mind-control abilities. This was a major one for me. It took away the realism and the fear factor from the story. If this couldn't actually happen in the future, where's the fun in reading about it? There was also a lack of explanation. How did these powers come about? We never know.  - Vi's dad. Is he kind and loving or evil and traitorous? I understand that no one is all good or all bad, but I don't see how there can be such a drastic change in his character from beginning to end. It's like he's two different people. Furthermore, the twist on him was very predictable. I figured it out pretty early on.  - The whole hair deal. Yes, we understand Vi has short \\""wicked\\"" hair, like Jag. First of all, what's so appealing about having the same exact hair as your boyfriend? Isn't that just weird? Second of all, it was mentioned OVER and OVER again. I get that she has short hair already!  - The ending. Ok, so this is partly opinion. I tend to favor happy endings. But the real problem with this ending is that it made the whole book feel like such a waste. Like Vi and Jag went through all of that for NOTHING. I also couldn't find a deeper meaning or reason behind that ending. I just feel like it was completely pointless, sad, and numbing. There isn't even a sequel! That makes it ten times worse.    The good:  - Jag. Anyone who likes \\""bad boys\\"" will love him. Many people were bothered by him lying all the time, but I think it showed how everyone is a mix of good and bad; the world isn't black and white. He was kind and self-sacrificing with a bad vibe. I liked him.  - Vi. Ignoring the whole hair thing, I loved her. She was rebellious, but with good reason. She's a nice change from all the wimpy female protagonists we've seen lately.  - The action. This book was un-put-downable. If you're looking for a nice escape, Possession will definitely do the trick. It will keep you guessing and thinking about it even when you're not reading it.  - The twists. With the exception of the twist on Vi's father, all the twists were unpredictable and added to the reading experience.    Would I recommend it? Yes, it was well worth the time to read it. But if you're looking for something as deep and realistic as the Hunger Games, well... you're not gonna find it in this book.",2011-06-18

Unfortunately, instead of making the book something more, it often just provides the characters an easy way out of situations.<br /><br />In Possession, people are brainwashed into thinking a certain way by plugging into transmissions every night. Vi, our heroine, predictably stops plugging in, causing her to not follow the rules and ultimately rebel against the system. As these things often go, she's been pledged to a boy, Zenn, for a while now and continues to love him even though she was obviously brainwashed into doing so. Or at least until another boy came around and showed her some interest. Jag, a rebel from the Badlands, is imprisoned with her and she's drawn to him. She kind of fights it for a little while, but eventually can't resist his bad boy ways.<br /><br />The appeal of dystopian novels is that our world could eventually become the horrific world in these books. Our world cannot become the world in Possession. While theoretically the government could begin forcing people to listen to brainwashing transmissions in order to make us all fall in line, to my knowledge we don't have people with mind control abilities.

Possession is an amazing debut that will take readers into a unique world and introduce you to some amazing characters. This is one book I could not put down and it had me thinking about it long after I finished it.<br /><br />I adored Violet, the story's strong, snarky, independent thinking heroine. In a world controlled by the Thinkers and technology, she's someone who thinks for herself, and because of that is deemed a baddie. Not that I blamed her for breaking so many rules. I wouldn't want to live in a brainwashed community either. Torn between the baddie Jag, and the goodie Zenn, Violet discovers she's a key player in plot full of twists and deception.<br /><br />I thought Elana did a great job with her love triangle between Jag, Violet and Zenn. It's one that really fit well with the story and made a lot of sense. I'd elaborate more, but than I'd be spoiling it. As side from Violet, my other favorite character is Jag. There's a lot to his character and I loved getting to know him, and watch the romance between he and Violet grow.<br /><br />Much of the story is centered on Jag and Violet's escape to get to the Badlands and then on to the Seashore to seek freedom. Both characters have a lot in common. They're broken, strong, independent and find a source of inner strength in each other. They are also wanted by the director for their special abilities, so he can use them to help control the people. Had I been in their shoes, I would have ran too, who wants to help a corrupt director brain wash people. Their journey on the run is full of deception, action, near death experiences and mixed with a bit of romance. I loved every moment of it.<br /><br />This is one dystopian debut I couldn't get enough of. I was literally glued to the pages, and I feared if I put the book down I might miss something.

Possession is a brilliant first novel from Elana Johnson. The dystopian world presents little that will be new to readers (even the cover seems to have been designed to entice Matched fans to give it a try), but this is almost to the story's credit. Conscious that readers are probably very familiar with worlds where free choice is quashed by a disturbing ruling force, the novel avoids lingering in descriptions of its society and skips the heroine's slow realization that things are not as they should be. Vi begins the novel as a rebel, and the result is a story that is gripping and suspenseful from the very first page. The plot makes many unpredictable and satisfying twists, and the novel's shock ending will make your jaw drop and leave you desperate for more. I finished the book four days ago, and I still can't stop thinking about it and wishing I could know more.    Vi is a feisty, strong-willed heroine, but in a way that makes her likeable and realistic, rather than appearing as the Strong Heroine TM. Jaq is similarly compelling as a love interest. He manages to be both charming and occasionally bratty, generous and sensitive (in both senses of the word), loveable and confusing. Finally, a romantic hero who actually acts like a real guy! He's not perfect and not creepy, and I love him for it. Although the novel has a love triangle, as Vi begins the novel in love with her childhood friend Zenn, the particulars of Johnson's dystopia add a compelling twist to this old trope, and the dynamic between Vi, Jaq and Zenn quickly becomes tangled up in mystery, uncertainty and delicious intrigue. The only disappointing part was that Vi and Jaq fall in \\""love\\"" far too quickly (over a week at most), but I suppose as they're teenagers in a high pressure environment (and, as far as I know, there won't be a sequel), it can be forgiven as part of the genre. Besides, I couldn't help falling in love with the pairing either, and it's the first novel ina while that has made me want to either read another story about the pair right now.    Occasionally, the narration becomes a little heavy-handed, particularly over the idea that Vi must make a choice in each of the many dilemmas in her life, but this is a small eye-roll in an otherwise excellent and absorbing read.    If you like dystopia, adventure or just a good story, this is definitely a novel to check out. Combining believable characters with the thrill of life and romance on the run, it is unputdownable.",2011-06-12

Amongst the many releases, this novel sustains a uniquely based approach to a controlled society whose main domination lies within the human mind. Free thinking is frowned upon, thanks to the Thinkers and mechs running around alerting people with lawful accusations and brainwashing mind tricks. The story opens up with Vi and Zenn secretly meeting each other, based on the Thinker's match between the two, they saw no wrong in breaking a few rules. Which unfortunately ended with Vi taken away for her continuous rebellion and jailed in a cell with the adorable Jag. Vi, comes across as a strong individual who will fight tooth and nail to keep her thoughts to herself. I admired that trait in her, but the constant whining quality behind her loss of Zenn was quite annoying.<br /><br />Another aspect that turned me off was how quickly she started establishing feelings towards Jag. However in defense to Elana's structure, everything in the end started making sense as to why these emotions took on an earlier start. Throughout, the journey with Jag and Vi's escape to the Badlands, the story took on a confusing world-wind of events. But, the excitement quality was still present even though I had to read carefully to keep up. Once they reached the Badlands, where people had the ability to live normally, secrets and betrayals started to surfacing, making it that much more juicy. All in all, the potential was striking enough to keep you interested from start to finish. I'm looking forward to see Elana grow this series into something special with a better execution.",2011-06-11

The world is divided into two groups: The Goodies and the Baddies.  The Goodies are those who obey the rules, create all the groundbreaking technology, submit to nightly brainwashing transmissions, and dedicate their lives to duty.  The Baddies are the ones who live free and make their own rules.  There are subdivisions in each group, but again, they were never adequately defined.  The first half of the book I didn't mind the confusion because I expected that eventually everything would be explained.  Sadly, that is not the case.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that in addition to being some kind of tech Messiah, Violet is bipolar.  She goes from pissy and screaming one second to self-pitying and crying the next.  I empathized with her frustration when no one would explain to her what her abilities were and the abilities and motivations of those around her, but her whiplash mood swings got old real quick.  I was less than thrilled with the two love interests as well, specifically Jag who was almost more emotional than Violet.<br /><br />There are a couple twists that are no doubt supposed to be shocking but were actually extremely predictable or just not really a big deal.  There was, of course, a ideological subtext criticizing totalitarian governments and Big Brother type demagogues, but I had very little energy to find it provocative or even interesting in the face of the worldbuilding and character failings.<br /><br />Overall, an interesting premise in what had the potential to be an interesting dystopian setting fails to explain itself or portray a likeable protagonist.  I should be thankful that I never became invested in this book, because if I had, the ending would have been untenable.

I adored the the plot twist that were in the book. While some were predictable others were not. The way the storyline flowed was awesome. I like the build up of the plot and how it lead to many different happenings!<br /><br />I know this may sounds masochistic, but I like it when a relationship drives me crazy in a book. I guess, to me, it feels real. You can see the flaws in the relationship. It's not some prince charming, fall in love forever. I do like those too, but relationships that have fights, a love that drives you crazy, makes me happy. The relationship with Vi and Jag made me want to pull my hair out. I was so frustrated with them! I mean, really c'mon! Throw me a freaking bone here! Vi, I understood, but Jag dude, you have some serious issues!<br /><br />I think what made this book irresistible was the storyline of the whole book. It not only grip you from the start, but had you all the way and would not let you go.  The way it unfolded before your eyes was amazing. I love how well Ms. Johnson wrote the book. It was written very well and easy to read. The futuristic part you can relate to and understand.<br /><br />Now, the ending. As I said before, I have seen this trend come into lots of books I have been reading lately and you know what, it works. Yes, there was a cliffhanger, but nothing that you ever expect.

They just appeared out of nowhere and made very little sense in the context on things.    There were two potential love interests in this book, and I didn't really get a feel for either of them. One especially felt rushed. One page you're introduced to him, and on the next page it is true love forever and ever. It just kind of left me scratching my head.

While capturing a very modern and fresh spin on YA Dystopian fiction, this story still had that eerie feel that L'Engle was so good at creating.<br /><br />Vi, the snarky and fiercely independent lead character in this stunning work, is tossed around in a sea of lies and control freaks.  Rebelling against the control and trying to see through the lies, she wants to find a way to live outside what society has planned for her.  Teenage girls, so easily pressured by what the world expects of them and what the media determines to be correct behavior/dress, will hopefully be inspired by this headstrong heroine.<br /><br />To balance out Vi's fears and desire to break from her predetermined mold, Johnson created a hero who was equally willing to challenge the expectations put upon their people.  I won't give any spoilers but I will say he was the kind of hero that made you want them to work it out while he appalled you by his occasional flipping of sides and abandonment of Vi.<br /><br />All in all, the characters worked well together.  The world building was exquisite and detailed making it very believable.  I couldn't put it down and was actually irritated when my real life got in the way of me finding out what would happen next.

Vi has been making a lot of trouble [for example she's been throwing rocks into a pond, and the ultimate crime: she walks with her boyfriend in the park! Le Gasp!] I had some serious trouble getting into it. The first ten chapters or so really dragged along and I kept thinking: You'll stop soon! Just one chapter! Which is of course a bad thing.<br /><br />Still, the chapters that followed were really good! Surprisingly enough, I like every character except for Vi but that is mostly because she was too perfect for my liking. Yes, she's easily angered. But other than that there too many good qualities in my opinion. Can I express some bad boy love? Jag is just plain awesome. Probably a big piece of work, too, but still very likeable. Not like Zenn, who to me felt forced (okay, well, he was) and not real. No idea whether that was intended or maybe it's just some weird quirk of mine.<br /><br />Sadly, I expected some things. But what Johnson really excelled at where the action scenes in the later part of the novel. For me - an action novice - they were very believable! And boy, those people have to calibrate their tasers!<br />Some people have been comparing Possession to Matched. I can't really compare because I haven't read Matched yet but I think the reason for the comparison is mostly because of the similar cover. I don't think there are many other things except for the part where the Government pretty much controls every aspect of your life.<br /><br />That's probably what I found so shocking. Vi mentions that the transmission every citizen is required to hear are specialized. While her sister hears some stuff about the dangers of having a dog, Vi herself hears about helping those weaker than her etcetera.

And Jag is super super sexy... so yeah.<br /><br />Possession was kind of slow for me throughout the first half of the book, but when I hit page 200, I could NOT put it down!!!<br /><br />Some of the relationships in recent YA books have seemed so immediate and forced that I just want to throw something- but even though Vi and Jag were thrown together by fate and were complete strangers, they completely rocked my face off. I loved them together.<br /><br />There were so many details and people who were dead- no- alive! No- assuming new identities!

Not really, but I am often forced to treat whatever free reading time I have that way. I am either reading to improve my standing at work or to catch up on work. Reading for pleasure was lost to me for a long time. Possession reminded me that poetry brings life to life. Poetic and beautiful, Possession restarted my love of fiction.  I don't remember why I picked this book up; I don't recall why I would have wanted to try something so far from my general tastes, but I am glad I turned those pages. The experience for me was much like being in high school and reading A Tale of Two Cities or some other classic. Excitement! Words and thoughts have the power to make both your heart and soul fly. The experience of finding a novel in which an author says something that you wish you could have said is thrilling. Possession delivers that experience, but some of the critics on this page don't like the device the author uses to shade our sense of time, depth of the relationships, and feelings for the characters. They consider it a trick. No, there is only one literary trick here - the authors ability to lose the reader in lives of the characters. The writing is fluent and fluid; the relationships are clear and sound. In fact, this novel sounds all the right notes. I returned to a number of novels that I had attempted but was unable to complete after reading this book. I re-read Elisions'' Invisible Man and Toomers Cane with a new appreciation. Those volumes are not at all similar to Possession but I became excited about reading for pleasure and so I went over familiar ground. I am glad that I did; the books were better the second time around.

Another sort, though, is more like a faceted mirror-ball hanging above a dance floor, reflecting the light of its characters and language and plot in all directions, and constantly moving, constantly metamorphosing before the reader's eyes. This volume -- which won every award on offer and has become an undisputed modern classic -- is very much the latter sort of book. It's a \\""romance\\"" in the Arthurian sense. Also, tardis-like, it seems much larger once you're inside it than it appeared from the outside. It all starts with Dr. Roland Michell, a mostly impoverished literary scholar and apprentice expert on Randolph Henry Ash, the great fictitious Victorian poet, who stumbles across the drafts of some letters written a century and a half ago and tucked inside a book now in the possession of the London Library. The letters suggest a relationship between Ash and some unknown woman and, Roland understands instantly, would be of intense interest to Ash scholars everywhere. So, quite unable to help himself, he spirits them away, back to the basement flat, redolent of the landlady's cats, that he shares with the long-suffering Val. Roland is led into contact with Dr. Maud Bailey of Lincoln, specialist in women's studies, in whose possession are many of the original writings of her collateral ancestress, Cristabel LaMotte, a contemporary of Ash's -- and perhaps a good deal more. After a bit of Freudian negotiation, they go to visit Sir George Bailey, an estranged relation of Maud's and current resident of the house where Cristabel died, and there they make a second exciting literary discovery. And at that point the plot begins shifting into higher semiotic gear. What exactly was the relationship between Ash and LaMotte? What happened during the period in 1859 which coincides with a long-noticed gap in Ash's biography, and which goes unmentioned in Mrs. Ellen Ash's journal? What were the true circumstances of and motives for the suicide of Blanche Glover, who had shared Cristabel's home? There are a number of mysteries here, but the story isn't as bald as all that. Nor is the narrative ever dry. Byatt shares the Victorian habit of piling layers upon layers, providing the reader with multi-page selections of poetry and tales by both Ash and LaMotte, each in its own distinctive voice. She gives us a Breton cousin's writing journal which quotes LaMotte, who tells stories, which themselves retell local myth, which someone else ruminates on, and deeper and deeper we go. And, yes, this compulsively readable book requires that you pay attention, but that isn't a burden because you will become as anxious to know the details of the lives of Ash and LaMotte as Roland and Maud -- who, of course, become equally possessed of each other as they pursue their investigations, in London and Lincoln and Yorkshire and Brittany. And that's not even to mention Dr. Mortimer Cropper of New Mexico, possessed of a large checkbook and convinced that every item R.H. Ash every touched should be acquired by the academic archive he administers. Or Dr. Beatrice Nest, who has spent the many decades of her professional life attempting to edit Ellen Ash's papers and journals, and who may even finish them one day. Or Prof. Blackadder, Roland's employer and the leading explicator of Ash's work, who has his own hidden facets (hidden even from himself). Or the larger than life Dr. Leonora Stern of Tallahassee, semi-lesbian feminist and rival of Cropper's, and a much nicer and more supportive person than one might at first think. Byatt weaves time-traveling nets of metaphor-filled language as she gleefully parodies the world of post-modern literary deconstruction (of which she herself is a noted practitioner) and builds the professional and personal parallels between Ash/LaMotte and Roland/Maud. And perhaps even Blackadder/Stern. And minor comments early in the story will become major clues later on.

Kendra's father was a wealthy judge who died in a car accident eleven months ago.  Kendra was with him at the time and survived with scars on her face and body.  Shortly after that, her boyfriend Michael broke up with her, saying it was due to her looks.  She drank too much, had a nervous breakdown and a suicide attempt.  She was in a mental hospital for months.  She just got out and returns home to be with Gerald.  Gerald has been handling the trust funds set up by their father.

They fell back in love with overwrought Gothic architecture and the mythic tales of Celtic and druid tradition. They rejected the arid classical mannerisms that had come from the age of reason, the rigid society that disfavored the folk tales and fantasies of the village for pure science and observable facts. A.S. Byatt knows her subject, and she knows it like an academic. She no doubt, has read innumerable critics on the subject of Victorian authors and so she sets about making fun of them-- not Victorian writers, no-- she is laughing at the critics. She does this with lovely prose, and poetry.  She creates two characters, that I want to go back and figure out who they are modeled after Christabel LaMott, might be Christina Rossetti and who might R.F. Ash be? I haven't managed to look back in time and find him.  He certainly isn't one of the earlier romantics like Shelly, Keats or Byron.  They neither one exhibit the repressed Victorian sexuality that Ashe exhibits.   Who ever they were  modeled on,  Ashe and LaMott, Byatt creates an ingenious fictitious archive of their work and letters.  I find it all amazing the way she inhabits the age and recreates it's language. This in itself is something I haven't seen done often, and when it was attempted the results were often embarrassing. So while reading this book I am thinking A.S. Byatt is brave to make this attempt.  She is writing poems that are not her poems, she is writing poems that would be written by a Victorian Man, and they must seem to be the authentic thoughts of a real writer, and I do think she succeeds.  There are two stories in this novel, the Victorian and the modern story, that surrounds the Victorian tale.  I find it clever that Byatt turns the stories inside out. So often when there is a modern telling of an older story the older story is mythologized.  Who would think to mythologize the modern story, but thisis what Byatt decides to do.  She creates devilish characters that intend to rape England of it's treasures.  The characters evolve into the icons of all romances, where good triumphs over evil. I admit, I took my time reading this book, it isn't a page turner, but few good books are anymore.  Maybe its because I'm too old to fall for those old fables. Sometimes I think of music or art when I read a book, and I think if this were art, it would be figurative art.  Joyce's Ulysses would be abstract, or perhaps something of Charlie Parkers work. A.S Byatt isn't trying to do that to us.  She is writing an old fashioned story in an old fashioned narrative form, but she does it perfectly with a back twist added to the end, and she lands it sturdily.",2009-10-06

Though it's highly unlikely, it's almost as if A.S. Byatt telepathically peered into my mind, made a checklist of all the things I enjoy in a novel, and then wrote \\""Possession\\"" accordingly. An historical mystery, a bittersweet love story, an exploration of myths and fairytales, a tribute to the power of books, and a beautiful, delicate style of prose all makes for an intriguing, rewarding, immensely enjoyable read.<br /><br />Roland Michell is a research assistant for Professor Blackadder, the self-proclaimed expert on all matters concerning the Victorian poet: Randolph Henry Ash. Whilst thumbing through one of Ash's old books, Roland uncovers rough drafts of letters, which seem to hint at a secret friendship with an unidentified woman. Since Ash was considered to be a devoted husband who led an exemplary life, this discovery could change everything that's ever been written about the poet and his work.<br /><br />His investigation leads him to suspect that Christabel LaMotte (known as \\""the fairy poet\\"") is the mystery woman, which in turn guides him to a contemporary expert on the subject: Maud Bailey, the woman's great, great, great grand-niece. Together they take it upon themselves to secretly look into the matter further, both instinctively feeling that they're on the verge of an extraordinary discovery... In such a way, the lovers of the past are given another chance in the two people who uncover their story.<br /><br />To give away more would be to ruin the treasure hunt that follows; safe to say that it involves diary entries, love letters, old mansions, secret exertions to mystery locations, grave digging, a variety of secondary characters that provide help or hindrance, and finally a race to the finish line as competing scholars get wind of what the two are up to. Obviously, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that this unraveling of the past's passionate love story has quite an effect on the scholars, who gradually loose their inhibitions and begin to open up to one another as the story unfolds. Through Randolph and Christabel's example, the ordinary Maud and Roland are allowed to do something extraordinary and seize their chance at life.<br /><br />Any scholar or theorist knows the excitement that comes with the thought of a new discovery, point of view, or even idea on how to view their chosen field of study. In many ways Byatt relies on this to convey a somewhat satirical view on scholarship and how one can get so wrapped up in analysis that they loose the focus of why they're devoting hours of their life to another person's work, and how literature is often dissected and deconstructed to the point where it looses all meaning, or is simply whittled down to banalities such as gender wars or sexual frustration. As Maud says: \\""Do you never have the sense that our metaphors eat up our world? I mean of course that everything connects and connects...and it's all reduced like boiling jam to human sexuality.\\"" Likewise, Roland and Maud are so constrained by the ideologies of Freud that they're just as suppressed as anyone in the Victoria era, the two of them longing for \\""clean, white beds,\\"" free of any meaning or relationships.<br /><br />And yet it would be quite misleading to say that the story revolves around Roland and Maud, for \\""Possession\\"" is all about Randolph and Christabel. In her preface, as a way of explaining why the title is subtitled \\""A Romance,\\"" Byatt quotes a definition from Nathaniel Byatt: \\""The point of view in which this tale comes under the Romantic definition lies in the attempt to connect a bygone time with the very present that is flitting away from us.\\"" That sentiment is this book in a nutshell, for the lovers of the past are far more vivid and real than the contemporary investigators, who cannot help but seem bland in comparison (which is probably intentional, considering that Roland and Maud themselves comment on this). They are the tools and mediators through which the Victorian love affair is conveyed.<br /><br />It is in the portrayal of Randolph and Christabel that Byatt truly excels, mainly because she's written an entire secondary body of text for them: diary entries, letters, essays, poems, fairytales and other bits and pieces (even a suicide note!) penned not just by the two poets, but their contemporaries as well. The love letters themselves are beautiful: stiff and formal at first, but gradually unfolding to reveal the personalities of those that have written them: Christabel's secretive and humourous prose, Ash's sensitive but unmistakably masculine thoughts. It needs to be noted here that a large portion of \\""Possession\\"" is made up of these mementoes from the Victorian era, something that may test the casual reader's patience, but which are so poignantly and accurately written in regards to capturing the time and place from whence they come, that the line between fact and fiction is blurred considerably. I hate to admit it, but Randolph Ash in particular is inserted so seamlessly into the time period that I originally thought he was a real historical personage.<br /><br />The love story is heartbreaking and bittersweet, and even though it involves adultery (one of my pet peeves is glorified cheating on one's spouse) the significant others of both Randolph and Christabel are treated respectfully and not without mitigating factors of their own. Although there are three important segments of text which take us directly into the life and times of the Victorian characters, most of their story, in all its piecemeal chronology, is conveyed through the evidence that Roland and Maud uncover. There are some breathtaking conceits at work here, mainly concerning the fact that the poems of each lover take on a whole different meaning when one considers the romance between them; for example, when Maud and Roland discover that the exact same line exists in two of their poems as a hidden testament to their love, gone unnoticed by legions of scholars, hidden in plain sight for all to see - I have to say, my eyes pricked.<br /><br />Though I've always loved Byatt's delicate, beautiful prose, her complex syntax and heavily contextual style certainly won't be to everyone's taste. Though I've read \\""Possession\\"" three times in my life, I know I've only brushed the surface of meaning at work here, for this is a difficult, cerebral, challenging book and relies on a lot of patience (consider for example the fact that one chapter is made up entirely of Randolph's poetry). And don't even get me started on the themes that the surround the titular \\""possession\\"" - this review is long enough as it is!<br /><br />Although I concede that not everyone will enjoy this book, sometimes you just have to throw away objectivity and gush about the things you love. For me, \\""Possession\\"" is one of these things. What stayed with me the longest was Byatt's comparison of the bliss and simplicity that comes with seclusion, and the equal bliss but far more complex emotions that come with the passionate madness of love, which in an odd way reflects my own reading experience of this book.

I also didn't take the book all that seriously the first time--finding it fun but \\""unserious\\"". I obviously didn't notice that she prefaced it by those great lines about \\""romance\\"" from Hawthorne's introduction to The House of the Seven Gables: \\""When a writer calls his work a Romance, it need hardly be observed that he wishes to claim a certain latitude, both as to its fashion and material, which he would not have felt himself entitled to had he professed to be writing a novel.\\"" A distinction generally lost in our time, but an important one and one that fits this work perfectly; it does not aim at fidelity to the possible or to the probable, but it does aim at the \\""truth of the human heart\\"".<br /><br />I have always been fascinated by the author who builds a novel (or a romance) out of diverse documents which the characters come across, in this case not only the poems of the two poets, but their letters, a few stories retold from parents, journals of those closely involved--his wife and her lover, critical analysis and biography by scholars, etc. Even some fanciful sections where the author imagines events and feelings on the part of 19th century characters that could not have been known, even through the serendipity of finding the documents that were found.

More amusing is Professor Cropper, a gentleman researcher from the US. His texts contribute a lot to the story. He is amusingly dislikable, as are some other personalities of the literary scene.  Watching these professional literature analyzers at work, as they are shown by Byatt, I am so happy that I decided long ago not to choose this profession.    And a footnote to all Vikings around here: a part of the imaginary world of this complex text is set in Iceland! One of poet Ash's major works is a verse epos called Ragnaroek.

Byatt","Possession is a completely original story, subtitled \\""A Romance,\\"" about two scholars who pool their resources to uncover the secret romance between two fictional writers that happened a century before. It is fine drama and detective work, and as the clues accumulate and the pieces begin to fit together, we get a well-rounded sense of who these people were, as well as beautifully-written moments of perception that heighten the reader's awareness of the world around them. It is aided by some of the most gorgeous writing I have ever read, beautiful country settings, and a simple and sweet ending that ties everything together in a neat bow.    However, I would be remiss if I didn't grudgingly admit that this book is oftentimes an absolutely painful bore.     Byatt has a masterly control over the different devices used to tell the story, and as such each different form is unique and pitch-perfect (the fact that Byatt wrote the book straight through speaks of her incredible talents). However, Maud and Roland did not stand out as characters, and were difficult for me to relate to, or even care about. The narrative often halts for countless pages of poetry, or diary entries by peripheral characters, thus laming the story's momentum. Supporting characters like Cropper, Blackadder, and even Val were not very distinct, and tended to gel into eachother as the story progressed. Also, the story seemed ultimately very predictable, making the eleventh hour revelation lack a real punch for the reader.     Still though, I was constantly taken aback by the writing, and oftentimes asked myself \\""How did she think THAT up?\\"" Recommmended for readers up for a unique challenge.",2009-04-24

She gives dimension to heroes and villains, allowing you to identify with their triumphs and tragedies. Possession is a rich story with several interesting dimensions woven together, examining the idea of different kinds of possession in her characters interconnected stories.

Yaasa meets Chejuan not really looking for a relationship, but a couple of backhanded slaps later, she's in a deathtrap without an escape. Chee is reminiscent to Santa Claus, because he's everywhere, lurking in the background waiting to pounce on a battered Yaasa.

Ms. Hale presents the realistic and humbling tale of one young woman's terrifying experience in an abusive relationship. Possession entails the fear factor, the embarrassment, the uncertainty, and the surprising yet mysterious emotion of acceptance.

The poetry within the cover pages is by Byatt - and some chapters are pages upon pages of the fictional heroine Christabel LaMotte.  The letters between LaMotte and the other poet - whose poetry again is by Byatt - are all written in 19th century formality, and all by Byatt.  The modern day descriptions of the sleuths is by Byatt.  This is truly a cluster of different writing styles expertly processed by one author.

Author Da'Neen Hale does an astounding job with the storyline in Possession. She made the novel very believable because of the accuracy of emotions displayed by her characters. Readers will sympathize for Yaassa because she knows the relationship is over between her and Che, but he just does not take no for an answer. He takes a violent turn for the worst so the happy times are quickly out numbered by the sad times.        Readers will be captivated by the story because they will be able to relate to this woman because either they know someone just like the main character and or they have been in a similar situation. This novel will leave you educated on the ins and outs of domestic violence and who it all affects. You will feel such pain for the main character that you want to shed tears or at least stand up to Che for her.        Possession is a gut wrenching story of a young woman who loves a man but because of her own inner demons she doesn't really see that love is not supposed to hurt and almost learns that valuable lesson with her life. This novel has drama, action and suspense while sending a very apparent message that needs to be spoken about.        Author Da'Neen Hale does a fantastic job of keeping the reader glued to each page as with each turn there is more drama unfolding right before your eyes. This is one book readers will not want to put down just because of the truthfulness of heart riveting emotion carefully placed amongst the pages.        Kudos to the author for tackling on such a topic to clearly mark her name in the literary arena, this was indeed a great debut!    WWW. WRITERSVIBE. COM",2008-09-02

It's a long book (555 pages), but, in my opinion, it's totally worth it. If you are an English major, this book is a dream come true for you. Byatt writes a modern classic, complete with literary allusions, tons of symbolism, and a gripping storyline.<br /><br />Roland Michell is a lowly academic, studying the life and work of Randolph Ash, a major poet. But he's not a recognized expert on Ash, he's hardly making any money, and he spends his time applying for jobs that he never gets. His relationship with his live-in lover, Val, has soured, and he's desperately looking for a non-confrontational way out.<br /><br />One afternoon, Michell is at the English National Library, requesting an old and never-perused edition of one of Ash's own books. Within the pages, he finds undisturbed notes by the famous poet, in addition to two drafts of a very urgent, emotionally-charged letter to an unknown woman (not Ash's wife).<br /><br />Siezed by unbridled excitement and curiosity, Michell clandestinely pockets the letters, determined to find out who they were meant for. What begins then is a rousing tale of literary investigation, romance, and good-old mystery.<br /><br />In his search, Roland meets Maud Bailey. Maud is a descendent of Christabel Lamotte, a poetess of some small fame, but not nearly approaching the popularity of Ash. Bailey is a professor at a college, and she is an expert on her ancestral poetess. Her concentration on Lamotte has moved her in the circles of feminist/women's literature.<br /><br />Together, the two track the movements of Ash and Lamotte and slowly discover all of their secrets. In the process, Maud and Roland come to know one another in a unique way, changing their own personal and professional lives.<br /><br />It may sound like boring stuff, but I cannot praise this novel enough. The novel is rich with the symbolism that Byatt is so fond of, and she sets her work again in the Victorian period (as she did in Morpho Eugenia), which she obviously has a great knowledge of and affinity for. She deftly creates the poetic works of both of her Victorian writers and sprinkles them throughout the novel.<br /><br />Also, much of the novel is epistolary, using the letters between Ash and Lamotte to illuminate their relationship and explain their fascination with one another.<br /><br />This is a do-not-miss book.

Any work that forces you to consult a dictionary or encyclopedia as often as this one does, surely can't be praised for it's simplicity or lucidity. The narrative is dense with arcane words, figurative language, historical and literary allusions. Ms. Byatt's erudition can at times be overpowering. I suppose that density can in part be explained by the fact that this novel is as much about the power and joy (not to mention sensuousness) of language, as it is about a Victorian romance, paralleled by one in the 20th century under the guise of an intriguing mystery and detective story. The modern protagonists are literary scholars and their subjects are poets whose intellect and language skills act as a powerful aphrodisiac in their affair.    What totally blew me away about this novel was that Ms. Byatt was able to synthesize all the critical and sundry elements into a coherent whole that not only had my attention riveted throughout it's wild temporal transitions between the Victorian era (through the correspondence of the poets and journals of their intimates) and modern English society through the inquiries and travels of Roland Michell, Maud Bailey, and their contemporaries, but also contained insights into the psychology of male and female relationships as it pertains not only to physical, but to intellectual and emotional needs.    What is even more amazing, is that Ms. Byatt herself, in the creation of Ash and LaMott, has proven herself to be a poet of outstanding ability and sensibility. She has breathed life into these characters and their poems, so much so, that when consulting my encyclopedia on the likes of Vigo, Swedenborg, Swammerdam, Wordsworth, and Donne, I would almost have expected to find articles on Byatt's 2 fictional Victorian poets as well.",2008-05-01

And there is a reason for it. I find that \\""Possession\\"" really, really stalls when it comes to a repeat reading. My first reading of the book took almost a month - this has got to be one of the toughest books to get through (Ian McEwans' latest \\""Atonement\\"" is another of these types of books).<br /><br />Fond as I am of exceeding detail to plot and character development, there is a point at which the writer is too good for the story he is creating. I am not saying this happened here, but Byatt's stunning use of language sometimes undoes the original intent. Readers of straight-forward novels could not possibly find it in them to sustain interest in this.<br /><br />The primary problem is a very incoherent structure. Just when a plot is being developed or a discovery being made, Byatt kills the narrative by injecting ten pages of a poet's long lost work, or the maddeningly boring inclusion of a dead poets' diary. While everything IS pertinent and makes perfect sense considering the entire books' real heroes are the Victorian poets who are under scrutiny, I could not imagine anything possibly revelatory about the characters from these humdrum passages. Seriously, I found them tiresome and extremely non-essential, to say the least.<br /><br />If you've watched the cinematic endeavor that this book spawned, you would well do to remind yourself that this holds more detail than the movie did. In fact, the main character here, who was essayed by Gwyneth Paltrow in the film, seems so unlike Paltrow in every way. Also, the two scholars seemed almost bipolar in their mood-swings, which seemed to affect their decisions and words every thirty pages or so. This was not a concern for me, just an observation.<br /><br />The good part is that the entire novel is gorgeously written, and is a very symbol of the best we come to expect from the English language. Poetry and Prose combine beautifully and its no surprise this has become essential reading in some universities. And though I do love classics, I think I'm going to probably stick to my Whartons and Burneys for now, because either I do not 'get' Byatt, or her writing style is most definitely an acquired taste.<br /><br />I would suggest reading a few more reviews before making an informed decision.

I read it because it won the 1990 Booker Prize, and once under its spell, I've never wanted to let it go. A.S. Byatt -- sister of award winning novelist Margaret Drabble -- tells a complex story within a story, moving back and forth between modern-day scholars Roland Michell and Maud Bailey, and the fictional Victorian poets who are the subjects of their research.<br /><br />Victorian literature can seem like a dry and rocky road, but Byatt foreshadows and advances her story with the poetry, letters and journals of the Victorian pair, whose love affair is revealed as the research progresses. From simple lyric poems (\\""They say that women change: 'tis so: but you / Are ever-constant in your changefulness ...\\"") to complex narrative poems and stories, they are well integrated with the story, though sometimes lengthy. The Victorian scene comes to life most successfully, and it's astonishing how fluently Byatt moves not just from present to past, but among the many different literary forms of the two Victorians.<br /><br />The story within a story, or more specifically the unraveling of a mystery from the past, is a popular device. It's been used in Josephine Tey's DAUGHTER OF TIME, THE MOONSTONE by Wilkie Collins, THE NAME OF THE ROSE by Umberto Eco; and more recently, THE DANTE CLUB and THE POE SHADOW by Matthew Pearl, THE RULE OF FOUR by Caldwell and Thomason, even Dan Brown's blockbuster THE DA VINCI CODE. Byatt weaves her two stories together beautifully: POSSESSION may be the standard by which to judge this type of book, as both stories are richly developed and rooted in the idiom of their time. The Victorian imagery reveals the love affair between the poets, and eventually between Roland and Maud, with its typical mix of emotion and restraint. The modern story satirizes the British academic scene.<br /><br />POSSESSION: A ROMANCE may not be the easiest book I ever read, but it's among the most rewarding.

I wouldn't say it's the worst novel I've ever read but possibly the worst story I've read in a long time.<br /><br />The writing is quite intelligent, the prose lovely, The fairy tales are kind of fun- I started skipping over them to get back to the STORY, and the poetry is quite wonderful- though I started skipping over the poems, too- especially the two-pagers- to...get back to the STORY.<br /><br />And there's the rub: what should have been a fascinating story gets lost amongst all the fairy tales, poems, letters, asides, and the ongoing feminist theme. The four main characters are flat; the two living characters have no gumption and seem to be going through the motions, and the poets- the other two Victorian 'main characters'- never come alive -until Ms Byatt FINALLY writes them as living, breathing people by going back in time and SHOWING us actual scenes and dialogue. Otherwise, you'll only 'see' them through the eyes of the two modern-day protagonists, and through the Victorian poets' often tedious letters and journals.<br /><br />There's very little tension in the novel, in my humble opinion, except that created by the rival modern day researchers.

Byatt's performance is a lot like that. Indeed, there are so many spectacular accomplishments in Possession, that the book has broken five Guinness Book World Records. First, it is the only volume to successfully incorporate all one- hundred and twenty-seven literary forms currently cataloged in the OED. Second, the book contains the largest collection of rare sesquipedalians ever assembled. Third, Byatt is the very first novelist to apply the Charlie Chan movie technique of getting all the characters gathered together in one room for a climatic last scene. Forth, Possession is the first truly pedantic compilation of Baroque literary styles and structures to ever make it to the best seller list. Fifth, on Pages 291 to 295, Byatt, in perhaps her greatest achievement, becomes the first artist to paint a landscape without paints or inks. Her  composition is formed with monosyllabic dabs: brown, black, red, gold (not yellow), green, blue, pale, white, Rose and Blanche. For pure virtuosity, Byatt's new art form, dubbed pointless pointillism, rivals the best of Seurat, Monet, Renoir, Warhol, Zambini, and even the original Great Ventriloquist, Signor Wenchez.",2006-11-24

What many people won't understand is the density and depth of such a work.<br /><br />The story behind possession is a sort of \\""tresure hunting\\"", but this time the treasure is literary. In the novel, Roland Mitchell and Maud Bailey are two scholars, obsessed by their subjects of study, respectively the 19th century poets Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte. Roland is a low-profile, slow guy that suddenly and unwittingly discovers some ancient papers that hint a possible connection between Ash, the highly steemed poet and model-husband of the victorian-era and the lesser known poet LaMotte, a veiled lesbian, now a role-model and idol of the feminists.

Its most tangible passion is for the acquisition of knowledge rather than for the depths of the love stories it contains.  Roland Mitchell, a young and floundering scholar, uncovers two unsent letters written by the Victorian poet he is studying, Randolph Henry Ash.  Instead of declaring them to the staff of the London Library, he slips them undetected into his belongings - and sets in motion a literary detective story.  The letters suggest that Ash may not have been entirely faithful to his wife, and Roland's attempts to uncover the identity of the woman lead him to Maud Bailey, a feminist scholar and a descendent of, and expert on, the poet Christabel LaMotte, the probable woman in question.  As the two scholars work together to uncover the truth of the relationship through letters, journals, poetry, and retracing the movements of their respective poets, they find themselves unwilling to share their discoveries with the outside world.  As other, more powerful academics are alerted to their suspicious research, the two become even more insular, to the detriment of personal relationships and careers.  Everyone, it seems, wants sole possession of the information they have since it threatens to challenge everything previously written about the two poets.<br /><br />The \\""Romance\\"" part of the title is misleading, for Byatt uses the term in the Victorian, and not the Harlequin, sense.  Yes, the romance between Ash and LaMotte is uncovered, and yes, something simmers between Roland and Maud, but the overriding story involves intellectual sparring and academic adventure.  If you do not like formal poetry, don't even bother opening this book, as Byatt fills it with lengthy, Victorian-style poems that she expects the reader to interpret as artistic proof of the poets' relationship.  Large sections of the book are also filled with the correspondence between Ash and LaMotte, the intentionally bland journal of Ash's wife Ellen, the journal of LaMotte's live-in lover, and excerpts from a biography written by the archrival of Roland's advisor.  While the piecing together of this evidence is both ambitious and clever, the result is a diluted narrative drive.  Passion - and possessiveness - is never as strong when described to another as it is in action, and Byatt's approach leaves little room for lively interaction.  Instead, she relies on the reader's intellectual curiosity, hoping he cares about the fate of literary legacies as much as she does.  The strongest, most vivid passages are written in the more traditional storytelling technique of limited third-person, allowing the reader to see through the eyes of various characters, most notably, near the end, of Ellen Ash, who finally comes alive.  The closing pages, also written this way, are powerfully realized.<br /><br />I can understand why many readers cannot finish this novel, as the formal and often ornate prose feels cold even with Byatt's keen eye; however, readers who like their fiction on an intellectual plane will find much to admire.

However, it was for the work of director Neil Labute that I went to see the movie, &quot;Possession&quot;, and only then did I realize it was based on what is purported to be Byatt's most important work.  I wondered what could make LaBute leave his sardonic field of original screenwriting and adapt this book to a screenplay...and I must say, with some sadness, that his film was only adequate.  However, as he must have, I found the plot was truly unique and the concept of possession so interwoven in each character, amazing.  And then, the relationship between the two 19th century poets was so moving, I decided to tackle the novel.<br />It is exquisite.<br />First, Byatt, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, discards the concept of a &quot;novel&quot; and subtitles it, &quot;A Romance&quot;.  Whether she realized it or not, this would result in many &quot;romance novel&quot; readers trying to tackle her 1990 masterpiece, only to discard it as &quot;too long and boring&quot;.  But Byatt persisted in the classification of a &quot;romance&quot;  after taking the meaning of the prose of Nathaniel Hawthorne, who wrote:<br />&quot;When a writer calls his work a Romance....while as a work of art, it must rigidly subject itself to laws, and while it sins unpardonably so far as it may swerve aside from the truth of the human heart -- has fairly a right to present that under circumstances, to a great extent, of the writer's own choosing.&quot;<br />Here, Byatt boldly invents two 19th century writers. Stunningly, she juxtaposes their existence with real writers of the period...Lord Tennyson, Goethe, Wordsworth, Christina Rossetti, Crabb Robinson, etc.  She creates long passages of their work, both prose and poetry (some of it epic) and their letters to each other.  It is if she gets inside of their heads and has written, disembodied, as each in the language and the culture of the times.  Moreover, she instills their work with passages that clarify what was the mystery of their romance.  Passages that only become clear when modern day scholars discover the romance, and can attribute the commonality and beauty in each of their works to their love for one another.  Most readers will assume that Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte, really existed, and will only realize they are fictional after checking search engines carefully!<br />Many others have outlined the plotting here - the parallel story of two modern-day scholars following an inexact trail of evidence they unearth, to document a love story that takes the literary world by storm.  Both the modern day and the Victorian romance are between participants (Maud and Roland in this century, Ash and Christabel in the 19th) who are somewhat aloof from the world, imbued by their studies and crafts, and content with solitary existences...almost afraid to give themselves to another in a relationship.  Byatt skillfully uses dialogue, the content of letters and poems, and symbolism...the dissection of sea creatures by Ash on his journeys, the stark yearning for the &quot;solitary, empty white bed&quot; that Maud and Roland both desire.<br />The very creation of this work, which won the UK's Booker prize in 1990, and the lasting regard with which it is held, will make it a classic.  So, too, will the richness of Byatt's writing and research, and the thrill of the mystery that surrounds Ash and Christabel...and how it is finally solved by the modern day seekers.  It is compelling in its second half, beautiful, though somewhat difficult to read in its first.  If you must skim the letters and poems in your first read, be sure to read them carefully when you finally pick up the book again (and you will!) because elements of mystery, relationship, manners and morals will all reveal themselves to you, enhancing the story.  Think, too, on the layers and layers of &quot;possession&quot; or obsessiveness that are shown by both major and well-sketched minor characters in both time periods of the book.<br />A timeless book, with some sardonic wit that pokes fun at academic society, the somewhat boorish mannerisms of Americans abroad,  and the clash between the world and the feminist movement...this is a gem, to be treasured and kept on bookshelves forever.<br />Highly recommended for serious readers.nd well-sketched minor characters in both time periods of the book.  <br />A timeless book, with some sardonic wit that pokes fun at academic society, the somewhat boorish mannerisms of Americans abroad,  and the clash between the world and the feminist movement...this is a gem, to be treasured and kept on bookshelves forever.<br />Highly recommended for serious readers.",2004-06-13

While it does offer its fair share of relationship drama, Byatt's Booker-winning masterpiece makes clear in its epigraph that \\""romance\\"" is being used in a more arcane, literary sense here: it's an adventure, a hunt, a quest or chase, with elements of love, fantasy and improbability.  In that sense, \\""Possession\\"" doesn't disappoint.  Indeed, Byatt's tale about the quest of two frustrated young academics to find and prove the veracity of a set of love letters between Victorian poets becomes the locus around which she builds what is probably the most accomplished novel of the late twentieth century.  It's an exploration of Victorian poetry, contemporary criticism and the biography industry as well as a ripping yarn.  Byatt's range - in both style and theme - is immense, as is the scope of what she's attempted here, and she nails every bit of it.  My only criticism is that some readers will lose interest battling their way through the extended letters of Ash and LaMotte and the lengthy extracts from Sabine's diary.  These sections, though important and beautifully written, are longer than they need to be and a little frustrating, if only because the main plot is so exciting that we want to get back to it as soon as possible.  But, I suppose, what would a Victorian romance be without a little excess?  Readers who've studied literature at university level will probably enjoy this novel the most, not only because the poetry will pique their interest, but because the academic characters - with their vanity, arrogance, anxieties and obsessions - are so precisely observed.  For me, Byatt's central achievement in this novel is that she manages to poke serious fun at the literary-critical industry, cut the theoretical legs from under everything from the idea of metaphor to Freud and feminism, and yet she never loses sight of, and respect for, those spine-tingling, hackle-raising moments that make literature worth reading and writing.

She is definitely an author for literate people, although a book like Possession can be enjoyed by anyone. Anyone who loves literature can identify with the characters and their stories. <br />Roland Michel and Maud Bailey are both literary scholars and both have their &quot;pet authors&quot; whom they are studying and trying to fill in the blanks of the lives of. Roland is studying Randolph Ash, whose letters he has, while Mott has the diaries of Christabel LaMotte. Both are Victorian poet, and Byatt does a wonderful job creating their works in such a way, that you could swore you read their poems as part of your English survey classes. <br />The love story is the driving force of this book, yet the part of the story that hits home for me is the strange obsession with discovering the inner workings of poets and authors. I understand it, because when you really love a certain poem or other work, it is because it means something specific to you. But after you have derived your own satisfaction from your own meaning of the poem, it is suddenly replaced by a desire to know what the author REALLY MEANT when he or she wrote what they did. <br />The chance to delve into the author's life and find out their secrets, find out exactly what circumstances are behind what they have written is irresistable, but at the same time, once the knowledge is discovered, it comes with the realization that you have looked at parts of someone's life that they didn't want anyone to look at. <br />The very secretiveness and tragedy of the relationship between the two poets makes it vivid and interesting and some reviews point out that the relationship of Roland and Maud is stiff and dull by comparison. But I think that is purposeful. Roland and Maud are not poets, they are scholars. They are trapped in a world of repression and disappointment and dullness and because of that, even the smallest step toward passion means volumes more than it appears. <br />This book can be enjoyed on many levels and if you like it, I urge to read more of the author's work.",2004-04-18

Roland Michell, a young scholar, was reading a bristled volume belonged to the late poet Randolph Henry Ash from which all the papers sprang out. He found two drafts of the beginning of a letter to a woman whom Roland identified later as Christobel LaMotte. Together with Professor Maud Bailey, who turned out to be a descendant of LaMotte, Roland unveiled, through bundles of correspondence letters between Ash and LaMotte, Ellen Ash's journal, and Blanche Glover's (LaMotte's lesbian partner) letters and a suicide note, the shocking romantic relationship between Ash and LaMotte. <br />What followed upon discovery of letters in Seal Court (where in a room of which Christobel LaMotte once resided) was one of the most ferocious wrangle about a correspondence between dead Victorian poets that Roland had just discovered. An American professor had offered huge sums for the manuscripts but the British were trying to have all the letters declared of national importance and forbade the export. As a matter of fact, these letters, journal entries and poems are entwined apropos with the prose as Byatt unfolds the story. The literary insertion is meant to accentuate the lives of the poets and their relationship - and readers should take to serious perusal and pay attention to the clues from which the scholars resolve the clandestine affair.<br />As the title implies, the story revolves around the multiple meanings of possession. Roland must have felt possessed to take the letters from the book into his possession. He even felt irritation at the privacy Maud assumed in the affair that began with the discovery of his purloined letters. Little did Roland know that his indefatigable pursuit of the letters had distanced him from the poet as the letters edged closer to the essence of his unknown private life. His finding had, in a sense, turned out to be a loss for him as a reader.<br />The book is beautifully written, intertwined with vestiges of the Victorian poets' lives, their musings and poems. Progression of the relationship between Roland and Maud is relatively subdued and insipid when measured against the vividly limned love life of the poets. The young scholars' relationship is executed with such stoicism that one might not surmise the slightest of passion.

The characters are likeable and credible, with even the principal villain sympathetically drawn.<br />Unfortunately, out of the blue, the book simply ends after about 335 pp, with nothing resolved and the action in full swing, and not even a publisher's blurb like &quot;Watch for Part II Next Month!&quot;  There's an ad on the inside front cover for Morgan's Possession, but it doesn't indicate it as a sequel to the book the reader holds in his hands.<br />Possession, after Obsession's pretty rip-roaring and engaging start, is lame, tame, and terribly contrived.  Too many plot improbabilities are thrown at the reader, and in too short a time, to be believed.  The characters begin acting as inconsistently as those in soap-operas.  The ending is rushed into a mere handful of pages, after literally an entire novel's worth of severely padded chapters so redundant that they can be flipped through in minutes without missing anything of substance.<br />Ultimately, buying into either book is simply a waste of time, a marketing ploy intended to sell more copies, at the expense of any potential product of worth.  This &quot;serial novel&quot; game, an insulting trick from its inception  -  and continuation, involving many talented authors who should be ashamed of themselves, Stephen King, John Saul, Robert R. McCammon and Tamara Thorne among them  -  is trash at its worst, even when the finished product is worth the time and effort, which Obsession and Possession aren't.<br />I do have to say that Morgan does have a talent for establishing a plot and composing sympathetic characters, which I hope manifests itself in future in novels of greater note than this one  -  er, two  -  I mean...oh, forget it.",2003-12-09

A. S. Byatt stands out for her celebration of characters who face this emotional challenge with humanity and intelligence, and who in many cases make literature out of, and for, this confrontation.<br /><br />Possession is immersed in this endeavor. It is populated with a largish number of people who pair up into couples (about seven overlapping couples, depending on how one counts them) and who have the common trait of using literature to understand, express, expurgate, and even conduct their sentimental lives. Their relations with literature range from living out profound Breton myths, to vulgar (needless to say, American) mercenary aggression. Possession's portrayal of contemporary academia, especially of life in the stacks, is at least as compelling as its gothic passages, and indicates more accurately than the plot's romantic elements the audience that Byatt is implicitly writing for.<br /><br />Readers are mainly impressed with Possession's over-fullness, and yet Byatt chose restraint on some subjects that might easily have grown into novels of their own. The handling of the romantic poet's wife (Ellen), her rival's partner (Blanche), and her eventual biographer (Beatrice) is in each case discrete to a point that could be maddening for readers who think that the personage deserves a larger volume of sympathetic ink.<br /><br />I would speculate that this discretion is partly the result of Byatt's desire to let light have at least a moral victory over darkness in Possession's final balance. A consolatory ending seems meant to vindicate the principal couple's decision to accept the tragic outcomes that might be (and were) the cost of reaching for transcendent experiences.<br /><br />This optimism, along with the luminescent emotion of Ash's and LaMotte's moments alone in nature -- their meeting in Richmond Park and their afternoon at Boggle Hole -- are what may well propel Possession into the ranks of the works of high literature that are read decade after decade and that are considered the Great Books.<br /><br />Possibly Byatt felt this.

The novel opens with the introduction of the character Roland Mitchell, a young Brit graduate in mid-1980s London who works part-time at the British Museum assisting in research work on the famous (but fictional) Victorian poet, Randolph Henry Ash. Roland's a \\""penniless\\"" bloke, but he's nice looking, hardworking and kind. One day as he's researching his work at the library, he discovers between the leaves of a reference book (which had once belonged to Ash), 2 letters in Ash's handwriting. They appear to be draft correspondence to an unnamed woman. Excited and intrigued, Roland pockets the letters and decides to investigate this secret life of Ash's (this is because based on the biographies written on him, Ash was supposed to be a happily married man). The significance is that if it's discovered now that he had led a \\""second life\\"", the discovery would change the modern literary world's interpretation of Ash's poems.    Roland soon finds a vague link between Ash's letters and a 19th century reclusive poetess named Christabel La Motte. To find out more about La Motte, he enlists the help of Dr Maud Bailey (a La Motte scholar). Initially, Maud is reluctant to get involved in Roland's investigation as she doesn't believe there existed any romantic connection betweenthe 2 poets (what's more, La Motte was widely believed to be a lesbian). Roland finds it difficult to communicate with Maud because of her cold and distant behaviour towards him (like an \\""ice queen\\""). Maud is young, rich and beautiful with long blonde hair (which she hides under a scarf at all times - find out \\""why\\"" from the book).    Their investigation takes them to various parts of England including La Motte's ancestral home (now home to the cranky Sir George Bailey). I like the scene in La Motte's bedroom (in Sir George's house), where everything in her room is left \\""preserved\\"" and undisturbed after her death, including a series of dolls propped against a pillow. In this room, Maud and Roland ingeniously discover a bundle of love letters written by Ash and La Motte to each other. I think that the letters and excerpts from diaries should be read in full as they are important to the story. I also think it's alright to skip reading the longer and complex poems as it won't affect one's understanding of the story.    While intensely trailing the love affair of the 2 poets, Roland and Maud become \\""intoxicated\\"" and infected by the \\""air of romance\\"" in their investigation and start to draw close to each other. You must read how Roland finally melts and conquers the heart of the \\""ice queen\\"". It's very romantic.    So this novel gives us two romances (from 2 different centuries) and a gripping \\""detective\\"" story. What a treat! The Victorian love story is beautiful, passionate and has a compelling and unexpected ending. The contemporary romance is believable, moving and honest.

On the cover it is labelled \\""a romance.\\"" This is a possibly  ironic simplification of all this epic novel encompasses. It is actually about the confrontation of two very different worlds: the romanticism of 19th Century poets and the postmodern detachment of late 20th Century scholars. On the other hand, A.S. Byatt also suggests that these two worlds may not be so far apart or irreconcilable as it first appears. Roland Mitchell is a graduate student doing research on a famous poet named Randolph Ash. Roland is an indecisive, introverted scholar whose future is uncertain. He is unsatisfied with his career; his own inertia keeps him in an apparently futile relationship; he feels his own identity is vague and somehow secondary to the poet he is studying. His life is suddenly infused with purpose when he finds an unfinished letter written by Ash to an unknown woman. He soon learns that this letter was intended for Christabel La Motte, a reclusive poet who had not previously been associated with Ash. Roland teams up with another scholar, Maud Bailey, who is an expert on La Motte (and a distant relation as well). They come upon a whole collection of letters between La Motte and Ash and find themselves in the middle of a fierce battle with fellow scholars who also want possession of these letters. The parallel between the two 19th Century poets and the two 20th Century scholars is the main theme, but it is really the letters, which include many poems and tales of faeries and magical worlds that are the heart of the novel. Modern notions of scholarship, literary criticism, feminism and sexuality are all thoroughly explored. Possession asks whether it is either moral or useful to \\""deconstruct\\"" literary works (and their authors' lives). Do the dead have a right to privacy? Does modern scholarship, as it dissects and analyzes, destroy rather than illuminate (an undoubtedly symbolic subplot has Ash dissecting insects and other living things)? I found these questions more interesting than the interaction between the two living scholars. Here we have the familiar (especially in English literature) situation of two people attracted to each other who find it almost impossible to reach beyond their own self-imposed solitude. Their inhibitions, reinforced by the stifling atmosphere of academia, is a significant part of the story, but it was sometimes a little exasperating all the same. The portrayal of intellectuals as envious and conniving competitors at times borders on parody. Byatt lampoons two American scholars with particular zeal. The modern characters' main function is to connect the many threads of this vast novel. What is perhaps most interesting is the way the process of literary deconstruction is turned in on itself. After observing 19th Century romantics through the lens of a contemporary mindset, these modern tools (and those who wield them) are themselves ruthlessly scrutinized.

The first tale revolves around two modern day literary scholars, the young struggling Roland Michell and the well established Maud Bailey, who discover an unbeforeknowst love affair between two Victorian Poets, the well known Mr. Randolph Henry Ash and the \\""on the periphery\\"" Ms. Christabel LaMotte.  The second tale takes us back in time and lets us relive portions of Ash's and LaMotte's romantic relationship.  Possession reads like a detective novel as Roland and Maud, looking for clues to the relationship, slowly reinterpret the poetry of Ash and LaMotte in a new context (were there entire periods of these two poets' prolific literary careers where their works were inspired by the other and even addressed the other unknown to the rest of the world?).  Roland and Maud even retrace many of poets' trips to the north of Great Britain and on the coast of Brittany.  Meanwhile the reader of the novel is slowly revealed other clues that Michell and Bailey can only guess at through the Byatt's flashback narratives.<br />Possession takes on a great number of themes and part of its success is in tying these many disparate themes together into a greater whole (i.e. in the business world we would call this synergies).  ..., part of Byatt's triumph is in creating Ash's and LaMotte's body of literature, their letters, poems and epics, that in and of themselves would represent literary triumphs compared to many pieces from Victorian literature  (and we're talking poetry here --- while this same reviewer has been unflattering towards previous British pieces due to their \\""warmed other milk\\"" atmosphere, there is something to be said for the life and passion of Victorian poetry.)  ...<br />Two thoughts on a more practical note.  First, Possession is extremely difficult to read in small smatterings.  The details are rich and the Victorian language is of course dense.  For slow, word-by-word readers such as myself the challenge of the actual reading can take away from the impact of the message.  Let's face it.

The details of their brief affair are discovered slowly and inexorably through a trace of documents and linguistic ties: they are academic detectives.<br />Byatt prose is laced with literary allusions that any lover of British history and fiction will appreciate.  Notice for example that Maude Bailey is often described with reference to Yeat's muse because of her golden hair, or that Christabel LaMotte, whose family name suggests &quot;moth.&quot; she says &quot;no mere human can stand in a fire and not be consumed.&quot;  In every sense, the plot of this novel is dense, its characters tightly-knit.  Discovering hidden meanings within the names and places of this novel was half the fun of reading it.<br />Possession is also a montage of the remaining documents of its characters' lives, which LaMotte says is the end motive of all writers--the longing to be preserved on the dusty shelf.  The contemporary storyline is juxtaposed with letters between the lovers, the diaries of Ash's wife and LaMotte's lover, Blanche, and the poetry itself, which reveals clues about the relationship invisible to the typcial, merely academic reading.  Some of these documents drag, but then again they create a type of tension.  The reader feels much like the scholars must have felt, looking for subtleties that may reveal an entire narrative.  <br />Running parallel to the nineteenth century narrative are the personal lives of the academics Maude Bailey and Roland Michell, who stand to turn the world of Ash and La Motte criticism on their head with their discovery.  I actually enjoyed their story even more than that of the poets.  They seemed more real,  more intimate, more subtle.  And like their objects of academic desire,they as well battle with the questions of possession, of possession of a person, an idea, or the possession associated with the brief insanity that overcomes the lover.<br />This novel is very time and emotion intensive, which makes the somewhat abrupt ending rather surprising.  After carefully weaving a narrative that spans over a century, Byatt wraps up her novel with what can be compared to a chase scene.  However satisfying it is to have the clues of this mystery all tied up, it left me wondering about the author's motives at the end.  But perhaps that is precisely the point of the romance: abruptly ended, fleetingly passionate, like a moth to the flame.<br />Possession was made recently into a more than adequate film, though some of the essentials have been changed, especially with regard to Roland Michell, who is portrayed in the film as a very charasmatic and inquisitive American.",2002-11-19

Yet, I also am urged to write this. The best writing--storytelling--does this to me. Even as I marvel at what I have just experienced, I also am goaded to try my hand at miracles as well, like the child who sees the magician at school and rushes home to ask the parents for a magic set.

First of all, this was not an easy book to read. As I commented to some people when I was only a hundred or so pages into it, the plot so far is the ultimate in boring, yet the writing is so good that I find myself continuing to read. Then I got stuck.<br />But I must stop and give a little summary of the actions in the book for those who haven't read it. There is a story within a story. The outer story is the discovery by Roland Mitchell of an instance in the great poet Randolph Henry Ash's life previously unaware to scholars, namely a connection with a little-known poet named Christabel LaMotte. The story of LaMotte and Ash forms the inner story. As a character says,<br />&quot;Literary critics make natural detectives...You know the theory that the classic detective story arose with the classic adultery novel--everyone wanted to know who was the Father, what was the origin, what is the secret?&quot;<br />What is the secret, indeed. The need to know the secret, to possess it, spurs Roland to track down the elusive link between Ash and LaMotte.<br />While the story of the two poets is beautiful and complex in its own right, the meta-story of Roland and the rest of the Ash/LaMotte scholars has a lot to commend it as well. Although the beginning seems to be about boring, dry academics, Byatt is actually setting up the characters in the best way, showing you what they are like, and when things start moving later, nothing seems unnatural.<br />The title says so much. This is a story of &quot;possession&quot; in all its myriad meanings, just as words so often do double and triple duty in the best poems. I am tempted to go through every definition of the word in the O.E.D. and then cite an example from the book, but instead I'll just do a sampling. When Roland discovers the letters that begins the search (and the novel), instead of presenting them to his supervisor, Prof. Blackadder, he keeps them in his possession. The possession of the letters and memorabilia from Ash's life is a consuming interest of the American counterpoint to Blackadder, Mortimer Cropper. Ash declares himself to be possessed by LaMotte; Roland and his partner, Maud Bailey, are possessed by the search. These are just a few of the many aspects of possession in the book.<br />I said before that I had gotten &quot;stuck&quot; in the book. About a hundred pages in, Roland and Maud discover a correspondence between Ash and LaMotte that fills about 35 pages. Byatt captures the Victorian letter style perfectly, almost too perfectly for this modern reader. Full of run-on sentences--often connection by dash after dash--the letters are of utmost importance to the plot, just as the Ash and LaMotte poems that grace the beginnings of each chapter. However, a modern reader understands how to read poems. The letters I tried to read as part of the novel rather than as letters, and immediately found myself frustrated and bored. I put the book down and read something else before returning to trudge my way through the letters. After that, the book was a joy to read.

This time I am happy to say I was successful.<br />Briefly and without disclosing the novel's ultimate secrets, the book tells the story of two parallel sets of lovers:  Contemporary Maud Bailey and Roland Mitchell and 19th century poet Randolph Henry Ash and poetess Christabel LaMotte.  As an academic researching Randolph Henry Ash, Roland discovers an unfinished love letter of the great poet. Upon further investigation, he finds he believes the letter to have been intended for Christabel LaMotte, another poet of the same time period. This discovery would discount many speculations regarding the poet and his muse and would change the recounting of literary history.  His findings lead him to seek out Maud Bailey, another academic who studies the poetry of LaMotte and has a vague family relation to the poetess.<br />The first half of the book is a little tedious, interspersed with short and epic poems by both fictional authors which unfortunately due to the unknowns not yet reconciled at this early part of the story seem overdone and trivial.  I would suggest rereading these with the help of a fable and phrase dictionary once the entire story is in place.  My own education although good simply falls through the cracks in this arena or I should say that my memory of once-learned folklore and mythology has been usurped sadly by more modern undertakings and could definitely stand a refresher course.  Be that as it may, as the two contemporary academics become 'possessed' by uncovering  the entire truth regarding Ash and LaMotte, the 19th century unfolds with readings of the lovers' letters, Ash's wife's diary, LaMotte's cousin's diary, the poems written during the times shared by the two lovers and a third person narrative supplied by Byatt to further titillate what is not spelled out by the manuscripts.  As the denouement draws closer, Roland and Maud find themselves possessed by each other as well as the past.  This heightening of emotion and awareness drives the reader deeper and deeper into the work devouring Byatt's clever use of different literary styles to delineate the characters from the past until they are full-blooded and breathing creatures rather than stuffy drawing room whose remains one glimpses of in museums. In addition to this is an amusing sub-story of the academic in-fighting between LaMotte and Ash constituents from America and Britain all straining to be the first to make inroads within literary history.  Pay close attention to the descriptive names Byatt gives her characters and relate them to their personality quarks.<br />I found myself reading aloud some of the letters and poems merely to hear the exquisite language aloud and to selfishly luxuriate in its meaning.

It is SERIOUS LITERATURE for SERIOUS READERS, so Movie Tie-In fans expecting a compactly written synopsis of the film are well advised to stay away. But if you're a literature aficionado, and wading knee deep in long flowery poems, obscure verses, beautifully but wordily written letters and journal entries isn't a problem or better still, your cup of tea, there's much in \\""Possession\\"" that will delight and enthrall you. <br />Subtitled \\""A Romance\\"", \\""Possession\\"" is more than the coupling of an ancient with a contemporary love story, though the movie adaptation may have you believe that. Victorian poet Randolph Ash didn't just have a dirty weekend with fairy poetess Christabel LaMotte. Their secret liason did however result in an awkward outcome that should not surprise readers. In Byatt's hands, their love affair is cloaked in mystery and cerebral splendour and though it may be hard to fathom the foundation of their mutual attraction, its credibility doesn't suffer because the affair isn't played out in real time but reconstructed and deduced from fragments of evidence from the past. It's like examining a black and white print through frosted glass. As for the coupling of modern day academics Maud Bailey and Roland Mitchell, those who have read the novel but not seen the film may be surprised that their relationship has been characterised as a romance. That to me is surely the crudest way of depicting Maud's and Roland's journey of self discovery as they collaborate in their research into the murky past of Ash & LaMotte and then join up in their undertaking to secure ownership of the invaluable evidence they have uncovered. <br />The flowing poems and verses may be the novel's styling, the romance its subject, but \\""Possession\\"" is above all a thriller and a breathtakingly exhilarating one at that. No violence, bloodletting or shootouts, onlytreachery of the kind practised by learned men of letters. They're all so civilised yet undeniably vicious in their scheming and stalking of one another, it's like having one's throat slit by paper. So fine and fatal. Byatt's enactment of the final scene at the graveyard, where she calls upon the elements to unleash their destructive power, is a dramatic coup de grace that would translate perfectly on screen. <br />A S Byatt is a difficult novelist. Not surprisingly, \\""Possession\\"" - her grand opus - doesn't make easy reading but a more finely crafted entity drawing upon a tapestry of subgenres you will not find. Truly a modern masterpiece. It'll be a tragedy if younger readers remember it as the book that inspired the film. Don't let that happen. Go read the real thing !",2002-09-05

Byatt's Romance (this is less of a novel than an imaginative fairy tale of people coming together) takes readers through a nearly detective like adventure featuring two young literary scholars unearthing a love affair in letters between a famous Victorian poet (very similar to Robert Browning) and a more obscure one that has been embraced by gender studies and feminist scholars (reminiscent of Christina Rossetti).<br />Possession is constructed of letters from the Victorian poets, their actual poetic work and stories, diary entries, and narrative featuring the modern scholars coming together and the poets coming together.  The Victorians begin to act as a mirror world for the modern lovers.  At times the narrative surprises you making you think it is describing the Victorian period when in reality it is modern London.  Byatt does an amazing job impersonating the form and style of the two Victorian poets, mimicking writers like Pater, Robert Browning, and Christian Rossetti with such accuracy that it is a brilliant achievement that she has invented the verse for her characters herself.<br />While the work is quite lengthy its pace is fast as the scholars (and you as the reader) discover more clues in the detective/mystery style adventure, and the length allows Byatt to throughly develop her themes.  Readers should watch out for the theme of possession and ownership itself.  In the novel words on a page become debated over who they belong to: a nation, the writer, the writer's descendants, the readers, or the world as a whole?  Also the various types of scholarship are mocked as well: silly and ridiculous Freudian and gender readings of sexual landscapes, professors more interested in collecting souveneirs than studying text, and fierce, reckless competition among people that at first glance may seem dull andstale.<br />For readers approaching the text after seeing the movie be advised- the novel features different characters and builds ideas and concepts more than the film does, and it is not just a straight objective narrative since it is filled with poems and letters and other discourse.  However, the read is exciting and lavish and presents you with ideas about our relationship to history and language that the film, because of its medium, was not able to put across as well.

All I know is that I've been chased by a compulsion to do just that. <br />The subtitle of the novel is `A Romance' and, in order to comply with this promise in the most literal way, the reader is presented with two couples, two loves. Byatt's notion of love is, though interesting in numerous ways, so different from mine that I often found myself unable to sympathize. The idea of two Victorian poets falling in love throughout the course of written correspondence is wonderfully romantic in a very traditional sense. So then why, as I read the letters, was I frowning? Why was I left cold? There was passion for sure, but it was an intellectual passion. A passion that did not seem to truly transcend the mind. And this isn't limited to the relationship between the Victorian lovers. The intimacy between Maud and Roland was tinged with frigidity--their relationship, however, has facets that saved it from being written off. I was hardly expecting, nor did I want, a historical romance novel. But one does not need to sacrifice heat to maintain respectability. I cannot, on some level, accept the relationship between Ash and La Motte, which, no doubt, altered my reaction to more than one aspect of the novel. <br />I wanted to be caught up, \\""possessed,\\"" by Ash's and La Motte's sentiments for each other as Roland and Maud were (though I can hardly reason why they were.) I wasn't. I wanted to be taken in by the lush prose I had read so much about before even attempting to read the novel. But for such an exquisite sense of detail, I was hardly moved by Byatt's descriptive passages. There was nothing particularly lyrical about the prose, not, I would say, when compared to some other writers who have the ability to fill pages with the most beautiful observations about something as mundane as sleep. Instead it seemed stilted. All those dashes and incomplete thoughts breaking up the narrative.And at times, though I hate to admit it, it was a guessing game as to which character was speaking. It was necessary to go back to the beginning of the exchange and trace the conversation all over again. <br />And I'll forever wonder why the instigator, Fergus Wolf, drops out of sight. That seems unreasonable.<br />I also don't think it's fair to suggest that Christabel La Motte was even \\""loosely\\""  based on Christina Rossetti. Similarities are sparse, limited, perhaps, to a strong religious devotion, an epic poem based on fairy tale like creatures, and that she remained unmarried. Rossetti, as far as I have found, was considered to be a meek woman with a somewhat weak constitution. It would be much more reasonable to speculate that La Motte was modeled after Dickinson. Whereas Rossetti was inclined to write religiously, Dickinson was more open with her ideas and metaphors. And La Motte's style of writing is more compatible with Dickinson as well. Plus, Dickinson's Master letters suggest a spark that Rossetti lacked but that La Motte was well aware of in herself. <br />What stuck most in my mind was the inability on the part of both couples to reconcile themselves to leading a life less solitary. Which is where the many layers of possession comes to the surface. I loved the image of the empty white bed that Roland and Maud needed to cling to. <br />Delving into the depths of this novel is not something that can be done over the period of a day nor, I doubt, even over a week. And it is certainly a novel that needs to be read more than once to appreciate. It isn't a particularly happy work. There's little enough hope for any of the characters. However, I'm happy that I read it because it does stay, it does compel you to think about it further. The more I think about it, the more it seems this novel is less \\""mystery,\\"" less \\""love story,\\"" and more the \\""lit theory\\"" that it also claims to be.",2002-07-30

Realizing their findings may overturn received wisdom on these poets and their work, Roland and Maud pull out all stops to figure out what went on between them, nasty academic rivals hot on their heels.

I say &quot;hate&quot; because I cannot stand to see a potentially great storyline overwhelmed by useless (and completely boring) details.  <br />The poetry is horrible.  The characters are flat.

I had to read it twice in order to get better all the references and magic of Byatt's work and I still have the feeling that I'm missing many things.<br />To put in a nutshell the novel is the story of two British academics, who study two late poets Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte. After finding some never seen letters of these writers, the scholars discover a secret love affair between the poets and start to investigate it and its consequence their lives and works. It is hard to classify this novel: it is part a drama, part a thriller and much of an analyze of the sexual behaviour of the Victorian Era and the `80s.<br />To begin with the title, the word `possesion' allows many interpretations related to the novel. One of the academics, Roland, who is the first to find and steal Ash's letters says he was possessed when he did it. Another good explanation is that he and the other academic. Maud, are so `possessed' by the late poets that they revive the love affair. Or the word `possession' refers to love itself: being in love is being possessed by some unknown entity. Ash says many times he was possessed by something he didn't know when in love with LaMotte. Possession may also be related to the obsession that all the academics can have to their object of study. All of them in the novel go deeper in the poets' lives than in their own, mainly Croppe. There are some other explanation that anyone can come up with after reading the novel. All of them can be right, all can be wrong.<br />As a modern work as it is, `Possession' allows many interpretations and conclusion. Byatt's wrtinting is very semitotic: everything is related to everything. Acts from the past still have effect in the present time. Things that the poets did in the XIX century, interferes in the life of people in the late XX.<br />Another effective technique used by the author is the interrelationship of verse and prose. More than creating two characters who are poets, Byatt created their work. One can read many verses and tales written by these poets through the novel, and their meaning and  importance are in a higher level. Their works are clues to understand their lives and their affair. And, yes, Byatt is this good. She can created verses as good as her prose and so different that one may doubt they were written by the same person. By the way, these kind of writing reads a bit hard at first, but once you get uesd to it, it is very pleasant to have many different sources as poems and letters than the plain narrative as usuall. The poets' letters are very vivid and beautiful, it is impossible not to be touched by their relationship and feel sorry for all the problems they have to face.<br />The comtemporany characters are very well developed also. Roland and Maud are the ones who face the most drastically change. Not only all the work they have developed about Ash and LaMotte have to change, but also their own private lives faces a challenge. The other three main academics, Croppe, Leonora and Blackadder, also see their working falling down. These characters are very realistic: it is not hard to find people who spent their whole lives devoted to study one single subject that they become obsessed to it.<br />Byatt's prose is insightfull and discriptive. Colours have an mayor role through the narrative. She uses many shades of colours just to give to the reader the right feeling of the moment, particularly  green, that seems to be associated to the female pole of the novel. The sexual tension between the characters is very subtle. The differences between the Victiorians and the XX Century people is very thin, although we think we can point it out easily. Byatt's shows we still share some of the same doubts and fears that were so common in the other century.<br />All in all, `Possession' is possessive. It is impossible not to fall for Byatt's writing and characters. After finishing the novel you got the actuall sense you've read a true story. It is impossible to believe that Ash and LaMotte have never been alive and lived that deep love affair.Possession' is possessive. It is impossible not to fall for Byatt's writing and characters.

It is also a satire, an exploration, a diary, a critical essay a heady plunge into Victoriana and even a detective story of sorts.<br />The characters are all gems.  Wonderful creations.  Roland Michell, one notes almost immediately, is an academic to the very core.  Although Roland may seem a bit of a bore in the very beginning of the story, once he steals the letters he so desperately wants, he becomes more of a flesh-and-blood character, more human, more fallible.  Just as boring (in the beginning) as is Roland, so is Maud.  These are two characters who are meant for each other, who only change when under each other's influence.  While academic rivalry may be what sets the plot of this book in motion, it is love that becomes its driving force.<br />Much of the book is spent in the company of the fictitious Victorian writers, Randolph Ash and Christabel LaMotte and they are fascinating characters, indeed.  Most of the chapters begin with a fictitious work by either Ash or LaMotte.  Byatt has caught the spirit of both of these characters so well, that one could almost swear that Ash and LaMotte were real...and that they really wrote.  Ash is the more open and terse writer; LaMotte the more given to patterns of rhythm and rhyme.  Yet both writers are truly Victorians.  Although many feel that Ash and LaMotte represented Robert Browning and Christina Rosetti, I felt that LaMotte was definitely Dickensian and Ash, very much Coleridge.<br />Byatt, one of the world's outstanding writers, has lavished such care and attention on &quot;Possession&quot; that each page, each paragraph, each poem, each letter, contains material that both soothes and stimulates the mind of the reader.  <br />Although Byatt's writing may seem simple and straightforward enough, it is really exceedingly rich in both detail and allusion.  In fact, there is so much literary detail and there are so many allusions in &quot;Possession&quot; that I think many readers might miss a few with a first reading.  The readers who skip the letters and the poems are definitely making a huge mistake, for they form an integral part of the story; the book could not exist without them.  The letters also give the reader (and Roland and Maud) a great deal of information about both Randolph and Christabel and allow the parallel relationships to come into being.  And, if the reader gives them only half a chance, he or she will come to see that the letters and poems and fairy tales are rich and rewarding in and of themselves.  It is no accident that both Christabel and Maud are identified with fairy tale characters who live in towers (Christabel with Melusina and Maud with Rapunzel).<br />Don't let the subject matter of the book put you off.  Yes, failed romantic love has been done many times before and so have parallel relationships, but never quite in this way.  Never so beautifully, never in such a way that touches the heart.<br />The only criticism I have of this book is that Byatt sometimes gave in to the lure of realism and let her characters speak in such a way as to almost tinge this book's exquisitely beautiful aura.  Sure, in real life, people throwing a tirade don't take care to keep their language beautiful, but &quot;Possession&quot; isn't real life and we know it.  That is a part of its lure and I only wish Byatt had felt the same.  Expletives, in this book at least, do detract from the overall romantic and beautiful tone and from the otherwise equisiteness of Byatt's writing.<br />When it comes down to the final analysis, however, the above is simpy a quibble and &quot;Possession&quot; is a tremendous achievement.  The characters are real and believable.  We love them, we (sometimes) hate them, we pity them, we root for them.  The 19th century seems as real asyesterday and Ash and LaMotte seem to have certainly existed, contrary to the very fact that we know they did not.  The parallel relationships are braided and intertwined so carefully and beautifully that they can't help but capture both our heart and our soul.<br />&quot;Possession&quot; is a poetic, beautiful, exquisite novel that intricately weaves both the light and the dark aspects of love.  It is a sumptuous feast of a book that is meant to be luxuriated in and ultimately, loved.",2002-03-04

Byatt","\\""The book was thick and black and covered with dust.\\"" It is not a coincidence that the first two words of this remarkable novel are, \\""the book.\\"" Possession is a book about books, about the study and love of literature and the intricate obsession with the lives of literary figures shared by academics, historians, and the randomly curious public. It tells the story of a quiet literary scholar, Roland Michell, who finds a lost letter from the great Victorian poet, R.H. Ash, to another famous poet of the day, Christabel LaMotte. As he is an Ash scholar, Roland takes the letter to a LaMotte scholar named Maude Bailey, and together they begin a search to uncover the relationship between the two. It is a discovery that will have repercussions in the academic world and in their own lives. If you tend to lose yourself in second-hand bookstores, are ravenously curious about the lives of the authors whose works you read, or simply love a great romantic mystery, you will love this book, which won the Booker prize, England's highest literary award.<br />  A.S. Byatt is herself a formidable scholar of literature who left a teaching career at London College in 1983 to write full-time. One day while in the British Museum Library, she spotted a well-known Coleridge scholar. It occurred to Byatt that much of what she knew about the Romantic poet had been filtered through the mind of that scholar. She mused about the effect that such a single-minded pursuit must have on a person. \\""I thought,\\"" she said, \\""it's almost like a case of demonic possession, and I wondered - has she eaten up his life or has he eaten up hers?\\"" She had an idea to write a book about two famous authors and two scholars who study their lives.<br />  Byatt created two fictional poets, loosely based on Robert Browning and Christina Rosetti, named Randolph Henry Ash, and Christabel LaMotte. The marvel of the novel is that Byatt creates not just the poets, but also their poetry. Calling on her extensive knowledge of Victorian literature, she intersperses the narrative with their poetry, prose, tales, and even literary criticism about the works of these fictional characters. It is, to use an over-taxed phrase, a tour de force. The poems are beautiful in their own right. I confess that my first time through this novel I went to my Norton Anthology of English Literature and looked for R.H. Ash. I was frankly amazed that the author could switch from style to style and write such beautiful verse. The third time through the book, I was struck by the way the poetry also illuminates the narrative.<br />  Roland Michell and Maude Bailey, our two protagonists, feel most uncomfortable in a modern setting and turn to the past for answers. As they connect to the lives of the poets through their letters, they find strength within themselves to live meaningful lives. Byatt's genius for metaphor connects the two couples over and over. Notice the use of color: greens for the feminine and grays and blacks for the masculine characters. Cropper wears Ash's watch, Maude wears LaMotte's brooch. Symbols of confinement and release are paired: the glass coffin and the library cubicle, the green Beetle and the serpent Melusine, the short-lived Eden of Yorkshire and Roland's forbidden garden. As the story builds toward its climax, the images pile up, as it were, until everything and everyone meets in one place, in one very cinematic scene, to uncover the truth. Yet, even with all the romantic drama, Byatt never loses contact with books, with the fact that it is through reading and writing that human beings make contact with their finer selves.<br /><br />  Those who write biography or study history know that every life has a story, but also that we can never tell the story exactly as it was. There is no final truth in history, but only interpretation and recreation. We read the journals of our ancestors and wonder what was not said that would have been most enlightening, as we try to extract a vision of their reality from the clues left to us. Roland and Maude, after years of studying these poets, have a deeply personal regard for them and a desire to protect their privacy. When Roland discovers a correspondence between the poets, he knows that a media sensation will ensue in which every personal detail of their lives will be open to exposure. He resents this, yet is drawn by curiosity about them to investigate further, which eventually causes everything to come to light. In a highly readable series of events, Byatt takes us deeper and deeper into these lives, switching from past to present and back to the past.

I guess by accepting one of the underlying themes of the novel: that the world we live and love in is a mysterious place and that for all the verbal magic of which we humans are capable (as evinced in this novel!) we fall short of being able to pin down Reality.  As Randolph Ash, one of the two Victorian era characters puts it on page 306, &quot;He thought of his hopes and expectations and the absence of language for most of them.&quot;<br />  What I find more than a tad disconcerting about almost all the other reviews (with a few greatly appreciated exceptions!) is that the readers want plot, characters, and page-turning reading.-That is, they want diversion and entertainment-Thus they are none-too-suprisingly less than filled with rapture over a book whose fundamental theme, it seems to me, is the nature of the love and language that makes us conscious, sentient human beings.<br />  Yes, there is a plot.  But the 20th century characters seem so thin, two-dimensional and untextured in comparison to the Nineteenth century artists on whom they are fixated that this hardly seems to be what this book is all about.  What it IS about is the love between Ash and LaMotte and the nature of love in general.  The tenuity of the 20th century characters and their relationships seems to be purposeful in order to contrast them with their Nineteenth Century subjects.<br />  &quot;...the life of the past persisting in us, is the business of every thinking man and woman.&quot;  This is a quote by Ash, in the Nineteenth Century.  The only two twentieth century characters who truly make internalizing the past their business are obviously Roland and Maud.<br />  OK. I won't go on to a long dissertation.  But I will say that I was amazed that none of the editorial or customer reviews (I read ALL of them) so much as mentioned Proust, the themes of whose work this work most closely parallels.

Byatt's &quot;Possession&quot; has been on my out-of-control to-read list for almost two years.  I was fortunate lately that &quot;Possession&quot;'s turn came up and I got the opportunity to read it.  &quot;Posession&quot; is a fabulous novel that takes place in two eras (19th and 20th centuries) and deals intensely with relationships - between individuals personally, professionally, romantically, and between cultures over time.  The primary storyline has Roland Michell and Maud Bailey, two relatively young Victorian scholars, investigating the possibility of a before-unknown relationship between the poets that they respectively specialize in, Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte.  The correspondence, diaries, and anecdotes they pore over develop into a second major storyline as Ash and LaMotte become as palpable characters as Michell and Bailey.<br />In the mid-1980's, Roland Michell is a dissatisfied literary scholar, struggling to find real employment, and wholly consumed by his study of R.H. Ash.  He happens upon a letter from Ash to a mysterious woman which could change the face of Ash research.  Intrigued by what this discovery could mean to his career, he enlists the help of Maud Bailey, for whom a relationship between LaMotte and Ash could be of similar importance.  They are forced by the hostility of the literature profession to keep their findings secret from their colleagues and superiors, and start an obsessive chase all over England and France to piece together the story of Ash and LaMotte.  Over time, life begins to imitate scholarship and art, as Roland and Maud find each other in their work.<br />Byatt does an Anthony Burgess-quality job appropriating the language of mid- to late-Victorian England in the Ash-LaMotte letters, journals, etc.  Creating an entire body of supposedly literary poetry (male and female) as well as correspondence and diaries is highly impressive and shows an extraordinary range of knowledge and skill.  She does excellent work in keeping the language of the two eras separate, and what is tougher, making the language of literary criticism for the most part accessible to a broad audience.  <br />Not to be gender biased, but it seems one part where Byatt takes a little too much license with the 19th century is in making all of her major Victorian women characters, LaMotte, Blanche Glover, and Sabine de Kercoz, all into hardcore Wollstonecraftian feminists. Especially considering their disparate backgrounds, minor aristocrat, would-be governess, and sheltered French girl, this is kind of hard to take.  Maybe this is an acknowledgment of LaMotte's influence on her immediate acquaintances, but it does seem a little farfetched even for the late 19th century.  <br />Overall, &quot;Possession&quot; is truly an enjoyable novel.  Byatt's command of styles, genres, languages, and most of all character combine to make a fine work.  Casual readers may be put off by the constant shift in time periods, the length of time spent away from the 'main' characters, Roland and Maud, and the constant poetical interruptions.  For the committed reader, these facets make the novel challenging and ultimately rewarding.",2001-07-10

But it is also much, much more.  The book is a tremendous undertaking of style and verve, a romance on two levels, and a bizarre detective story all rolled into  one.<br />The main characters of Possesion are Roland Michell, a true academic  and Maud Bailey, a researcher, but the stars of the book are really the  long-dead R.H. Ash and Christabel LaMotte.<br />In Possession, Byatt gives  much attention to minor detail.  In fact, her detailing is so subtle that  many nuances may be missed on a first reading.<br />Byatt's writing is  beautiful and filled with simple, descriptive language and gorgeous  imagery.  The majority of the story is rich in both metaphor and allusion,  with the following passage being a prime example:  &quot;One night they  fell asleep, side by side, on Maud's bed, where they had been sharing a  glass of Calvados.  He slept curled against her back, a dark comma against  her pale elegant phrase.&quot;<br />Most of the chapters in Possession begin  with a fictitious work by Ash or LaMotte, but Byatt has not only written  them well, she has fashioned each so that it is in keeping with the  character of its fictitious author.<br />Ash and LaMotte are both of the  Romantic period, yet Ash is more open and free than is LaMotte, who writes  with obvious rhyme and rhythm.  It is this--Byatt's ability to create so  many different writing styles for each of her characters and fit them to  the character so perfectly, that makes Possession come to life for the  reader.<br />Possession is not a straightforward narrative, however.  Much of  the story is told through the letters of Ash and LaMotte, again,  beautifully crafted by Byatt. It is through their letters that we really  get to know Ash and LaMotte as well as Roland and Maud.  The knowledge  gained in the past relationship between Ash and LaMotte allows the  present-day relationship between Roland and Maud to come to  life.<br />Possession is a storyof lost romantic love and, as such, it may  seem, at first glance, to be just another trite book on a trite and  overly-written subject.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Byatt  has conferred a freshness of outlook on Possession that makes it unlike any  other novel of failed romance and love gone wrong.<br />Roland and Maud are,  without a doubt, two quite ordinary people.  But Byatt has given them  something quite extraordinary to do.  These two would-be lovers are  actually on a quest, and their lives, as well as their love, seem to mirror  and parallel Ash and LaMotte's in more ways than one.<br />But all is  certainly not smooth sailing for Roland and Maud.  Roland has Val, his  live-in lover to deal with and Val, unlike many an &quot;unwanted&quot;  lover is not a woman to be summarily dismissed.<br />What really makes  Possession sparkle and sets it apart from any other typical romance is the  connection Roland and Maud have to the past and to Ash and LaMotte.  This  adds a mystical, almost surreal, quality to the story that could have so  easily turned maudlin in the hands of a writer less talented than Byatt.   Byatt, however, intertwines past and present with perfection and keeps the  reader spellbound with the suspension of disbelief.<br />A few passages  containing expletives seem out of place in this otherwise dazzling novel  and really seem beneath the obvious talent and ability of a first-class  writer like Byatt.<br />Byatt has titled her novel perfectly.  The word,  &quot;possession,&quot; crops out several times throughout the story:  the  possession of the stolen letters, the possession of the lovers to each  other, the possession of the past to the present.  Byatt obviously began  working with the motif of possession in mind.<br />While certainly not of the  romance genre, Possession contains enough romance to satisfy even the most  voracious.  The characters are creations of tremendous depth and we find it  easy to love them or hate them or pity them, but never dismiss them.<br />The  intertwining plots work on many levels and work so well that many readers  will often find themselves wondering if the story is purely fiction or  based in reality.<br />Finally, the beautiful writing captures and holds the  reader's attention and adds to the fantasy that is unfolding.  Although  some readers might find the many letters and poems contained in this book  distracting, they do enrich the story and lend a depth that would  definitely be lost had Byatt failed to included them.<br />A finely-crafted  novel of parallel lives and parallel loves, Possession is, for the most  part, a lyrical look, not at what really was, but what so easily could have  been.",2000-07-30

I told him the book was  &quot;nothing like&quot;.<br />Before mass-market paperbacks appeared ad  nauseum in supermarket carosels, there was an entire literary tradition  known as the &quot;Romantic.&quot; Into this literary tradition, A.S. Byatt  has created and inserted two fictitious poets, Randolph Henry Ash and  Christabel LaMotte.<br />Two present day scholars, Roland Mitchell and Maud  Bailey, uncover documents suggesting that the two poets knew each other.  Eventually drawn together by their individual research, Roland and Maud  trace the movements, uncover the correspondence and piece together the  relationship of Ash and LaMotte. During this time, their own love story  unfolds, offering an intriguing parallel to the love that now exists only  in relics from the past.<br />A word, if I may, about one of the supporting  characters, Val. Roland is not at first free to pursue a relationship with  Maud, because he is already romantically entangled with Val. For the sake  of the plot, it is obvious that he must, of course, become unentangled.<br />I have never understood the justification behind making the hero's  original romantic interest abominably loathsome for no other reason than to  manipulate readers/viewers into rejoicing when she is sent packing like the  literal and symbolic baggage she is. This always seemed to me, a very weak  form of plot.<br />I hope I do not give too much away when I say that I was  very pleased to see that Val is NOT treated in this cavilier way. Instead,  she is given a happiness that she is surprised to find but in fact richly  deserves. Everyone deserves to be happy, and the chance to make someone  else happy, right?<br />Byatt's book is not just the story of two love  affairs, but the story of a love affair with reading itself. If you have  any doubts, just peruse the following passage, taken from pages 510-512 of  the trade paperback edition:<br />&quot;It is possible for a writer to make,  or remake at least, for a reader, the primary pleasures of eating, or  drinking, or looking on, or sex. Novels have their obligatory  tour-de-force, the green-flecked gold omllette aux fines herbes, melting  into buttery formlessness and tasting of summer, or the creamy human  haunch, firm and warm, curved back to reveal a hot hollow, a crisping hair  or two, the glimpsed sex. They do not habitually elaborate on the equally  intense pleasure of reading ... Now and then there are readings that make  the hairs on the neck, the non-existant pelt, stand on end and tremble,  when every word burns and shines hard and clear and infinite and exact,  like stones of fire, like points of stars in the dark -- readings when the  knowledge that we shall know the writing differently or better or  satisfactorily, runs ahead of any capacity to say what we know, or how. In  these readings, a sense that the text has appeared to be wholly new, never  before seen, is followed, almost immediately, by the sense that it was  always there, that we the readers, knew it was always there, and have  always known it as it was, though we have now for the first time  recognized, become fully cognizant of, our knowledge.&quot;<br />At once  mystery and romance in both the common and literary senses, Byatt's  multi-faceted epic is full of breathtaking prose like the passage above.  The revelation at the end of the book is not unpredictable, but nonetheless  gives a nice feeling of closure to the relationship of Ash and LaMotte and  is a vivid reminder of how similar these long-dead poets are to the living,  breathing Roland and Maud.<br />For an engaging read that can be enjoyed on a  variety of levels, I strongly recommend &quot;Possession&quot; by A.S.  Byatt.A.S.  Byatt.",2000-07-04

Byatt uses poetry, letters and diaries to reveal the  story to the reader.  This is a bold move for any writer of serious  fiction, and Byatt pulls it off.  I'm no expert on Victorian poetry, but  Byatt seems to have a firm grasp of the conventions and language of the  genre.  She creates credible letters that invoke remarkably different  voices when she is representing different authors.  Byatt loads the book  with symbolism, particularly in regards to the names of each character.  I  found it interesting to try and puzzle out why she used certain names for  different characters.  Oddly enough, her main male character, Roland, was  inspired by the same poem that inspired Stephen King's series The Dark  Tower, &quot;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came,&quot; by Robert  Browning.  I just recently finished the fourth book in the Dark Tower  series, so it was quite a coincidence to discover this link.  <br />    One of  the many interesting themes in this book deals with how people can love one  another without possessing part of the other person.  How can we be  detached and still love?  Many types of possession are revealed in the  novel, most dealing with how we honor our great writers by trying to  possess some part of them or the lives that they led.  My only real  criticism has to do with Fergus, a character who shows up to start trouble  3/4ths of the way into the story and then all but disappears for the  finale.

The &quot;possession&quot;  referred to in the title could mean many things: the possession of love, of  work, of poetry and art, or a literal possession by the people and things  of the past. Like the title, this novel, set mostly in the present, works  on many levels. The main characters, Roland and Maud, are researching the  lives of two Victorian poets, R.H.Ash and Christobel LaMotte, respectively.  Roland and Maud find out that their poets were involved during their lives,  and the subsequent novel is part romance (in the old sense of the word),  part mystery, and part tragedy, all with a healthy dose of comedy.

Possession is indeed a romance novel, but not in the vein of Danielle  Steel.  Possession is much more than that.  Where Steel writes formula  romance, Byatt has perhaps created a sub-genre, and one that is far more  sophisticated than those romance novels that one finds in airport gift  shops.  Gorgeously written, it is the story of two academic types turned  sleuth, who themselves become romantically involved, and their efforts to  piece together the love affair between two poets from the nineteenth  century, largely from a number of letters they discover by chance.<br />The  prose at times can be difficult, but rewarding nevertheless.

I  have not read a book comparable to this one in regards to pure creativity  for quite some time.  I admired the ingenuity of Ms. Byatt with every turn  of the page.  She not only created believable characters, but she created a  literary history that spanned nearly two hundred years.  From nothing Ms.  Byatt created distinctively different poetry in the voice of two,  fictitious, Victorian poets.  She also created love letters between the  two.  She created fictitious literary analyses of the fictitious poetry.   For that feat alone, I admire her and this book.<br />And I would read it all  over again, twenty times, for the simple post script which, I feel, summed  up the book better than anything I could've ever imagined.",2000-03-14

There was a kind of cracking of cold in the woods all round, a  tightening of texture, a clamping together....The trees went up, solid.  A  kind of elemental clanging accompanied the disappearance of each into the  dark.  They were old, they were grey and green and stiff....A creature ran  out into her path; its eyes were half-spheres filled with dull red fire,  refracted, sparkling and then gone....Maud was inside, and the outside was  alive and separate.<br />Isn't that beautiful?  It's an exciting read, too.   It opens with a young grad student finding a mysterious letter from a  Victorian poet.  Who was the letter to? Did she write back?  What happened  next?

Set in the 1980s, the story is about two scholars who discover that the writers they are studying had secret liaisons. Their search for the details and answers to this mystery lead them through a series of intense intellectual and emotional adventures, always contrasting back and forth between their developing relationship and that of their scholarly prey. The balance of Byatt's character portrayals is especially gratifying; while the tone of the book is definitely feminist, there is no male/female typecasting. There are, in fact, no heroes or villains: only heroic and villainous acts, by fallible, inconsistent humans.  The fictitious writers, Randolph Ash and Christabel LaMotte, are incredibly romantic 19th century characters. Byatt creates for each of them a body of works; for Ash, genuine, complex poetry; for LaMotte, complex and pithy fairy tales. In fact, the poetry is so good that I suspected it was copied. I was wrong; Byatt is that good. And if I still haven't sold you, I will add that there are scenes here of breathtaking erotic sensuality.

The mystery of what Roland found in the vault at the Bristish Museum and what it would unfold intrigued me...the ghosts had come alive. The web so intricately spun between the characters served as a trap; I was caught in the lives of the poets and the academics, their loves and searchings.  But moreso than a trap, Possession was a refuge.     The voices of Byatt are myriad and incredibly believable.  She is a centuries-old male poet, a writer of fairy poems and stories, a literary telescope into the British countryside, a frustrated Post-Doc, and a woman professor that has never quite been understood.

Why does a victim choose to become 'friends' with their captor, even to the point of taking action to protect their potential killer from harm?

I understand Stockholm syndrome, the basis of it anyway, but this novel took it, ran with it, and ran a marathon ! That part of it just lost me, way too too much, and I cannot believe a woman would act like that, for so long, sorry, but it just made it feel like a bad novel.

I feel for Violet and the choices she is forced to make, but even more that the choices are actually forced upon her, in the end leaving her with the only choice she feels is pliable.<br />I certainly hope that things work out for Violet and she is able to over come the control over her, seek not only her true self, but the one she really loves.",2014-04-14

As an avid reader of these sorts of books I was not thrown off by that.  No, what made no sense was that our hero of this novel did not believe in her abilities even thou he was a GHOST!  (Don't worry not a spoiler you find this out in the prologue.)  He also has a variety of abilities as well that are a result of his condition.  The brother of course does know that Kiel is a Ghost and the blind psychic J can \\""see\\"" Kiel's aura and knows he is undead too.  So, NO secret there.  The rest of the story is a four day span of finding this killer who is apparently just like Kiel, (J reveals this in the beginning of the book).  The suspense is nonexistent in this book.  The love story is a dud.  They are in love from day one.  The drama is: What future can a ghost have? (Read spoiler for answer).<br />Like I said I did not hate this book it was just a dud.

I am a character lover first and foremost. If I can't get behind a character, well I'm probably not going to like the book. So this book presented a bit of a problem for me. The majority of the people we run across are villains, plain and simple. You know them, they always have the power. But Vi has some pretty natural power of her own that she never knew she had and from the very moment she was probably born, she's been manipulated. She gets arrested for taking a walk with her \\""match\\"" Zenn who is in Special Forces training. Does he come to her aid? No, he steps back from her as if he is trying to hide out. (Excuse me while I cross out some negatives in the books as I just put two pieces of the puzzle together). Vi is pretty straightforward. What you see is what you get. It's just that she has no idea that she has any kind of special talents so when she uses them, she doesn't realize she's used them.<br /><br />Anyway she gets locked up with-wait for it remembering she's been arrested for walking in the park with a boy, her government chosen \\""match\\""- again, she gets locked up with a BOY! And not just any boy, but a really bad boy. From the badlands. He's a baddy. (yes the book does use that word often). So there's a toilet in the corner and she's stuck with a boy. I found that part a bit hard to swallow when the government preaches no touching even between mother and child. But they don't mind her taking her clothes off and doing her business in front of a \\""baddy.\\"" As I'm reading my notes, and I had a copious amount of them, I'm finding they make sense now that I've read the complete novel. So I'll just say hang in there. I wondered why there are twice as many guards around Vi than Jag, just read further into the novel.<br /><br />Jag was okay, but only just. He kept ditching Vi at crucial moments. She saved his butt busted him out of jail only for him to get miffed that she called him different and he leaves her wandering around in the woods trying to make it out of the city into the badlands so she can be free. When she shows up two days later he's all excited to see her. He says he looked for her but I'm not buying it. Later he says he loves her, but when all things point to her betraying him, he quickly believes that's exactly what she's done. So quick to not trust her. And Jag cries. Sobs I believe the word was used. I cannot take my hero sobbing. I can take a tear or two, but not sobbing. Especially over something that happened a long time ago. So I'm not team Jag.<br /><br />Zenn, oh Zenn. You sound gorgeous you traitorous bastard. Giving gifts and kisses and all the time using  Vi for one purpose or another. And then not even going to her aid when they arrest her for walking with him when he made the date. Jerk! I cannot tell who's side he is on. First he seems to be on one side then the other. His eyes are glazed over and that means he's being controlled, then he'll break through and you see the guy you thought he was. But it's so hard to figure out.<br /><br /> With all the mind control and gifted and non gifted and more powerful and less powerful, it got confusing reading the story. I wrote on page 204 \\""I have no idea what's going on.\\"" But I never stopped reading. It's fascinating. Mind reading, manipulation, reading technology, wiping memories, that is all such fascinating territory to me so I absolutely loved it. I eventually found my way back.<br /><br />So, the novel is not without it's problems, lots of what? And overuse of words or phrases-baddies, perfect white teeth- but none of it was enough to make me not finish the novel. In fact it was a fast read.  And yes I would recommend it highly.

First, i was confused about the world they lived in. What's with all the \\""tech\\""? What caused the government to take control and give everyone such strict rules? What is a \\""greenie\\""??? The author never really clarified on any of these things. We were just thrown into a world without any background, trying to figure out what was going on. Also, i was irritated with how fast paced it was. Everything happened too quickly and i was constantly having to backtrack and reread things i may have missed. *mild spoiler* The relationship between Jag and Violet also happened too fast and it was very unreal.*end spoiler*. Also, i found myself constantly wanting to pull my hair out whenever Jag said \\""nice\\"" or Violet said \\""yeah.\\"" (Small things, but still irritating).

Something I've only ever done with a handful of books...I read it again. The paper in my hands and the awesome cover was too big a temptation to pass up. I loved Possession even more the second time around with it's layers of meaning and depth. Once you know what's going on with the main characters and reach the surprise ending, I'm sure you will want to do the same.   I felt an immediate draw to Possession's protagonist Vi with her sarcastic, fiery personality. She is one strong 15 year old who stands up for herself and isn't afraid to throw punches. Victoria Schoenfeld is a water worker living in the Goodlands with mom after her father went missing and sister died working in the hands of the government. Vi's a free thinker who's had more than one brush with the law. So when she's caught crossing borders to meet her match Zenn, a newly recruited special forces agent, the Greenies want consequences for Vi. They wish to rule a society where their model citizens, Goodies are \\""walking paper dolls\\"" devoid of personality. All must plug into transmissions including messages about not lying and sticking to the rules. But Vi has stopped plugging in and has a mind of her own. Those in charge have an upper hand with advanced technology capable of modifying memories, scanning fingerprints and tracking identities. Vi can feel the tech in her bones and though her father invented it, she's not convinced it's not all that it seems. In the end it's a choice for Vi between \\""control or don't control, alone or together, Zenn or Jag, duty or death.\\"" (p.366)  Jag...oh Jag. Bad boy who likes to read, leader of the Resistance, lover of wicked hair and distributor of hair gel & illegal tech. He stole my heart with his laughter, calmness, and laid back personality. He'll snag yours the first time he utters the words \\""nice\\"" and shrugs his shoulders. But readers beware that Jag is not alone in his efforts to win Vi and freedom, Zenn is fighting behind enemy lines.   Elana Johnson is genius. She's crafted characters that push and pull you in all directions. There is not a clear cut line between what is bad and what is good. The last 1/3 of the book feels like a choose your own adventure quest for the truth, full of action and suspense. Possession is an ingenious mix of dystopian, paranormal and science fiction that had me thinking long after I finished the book. If you're a fan of Scott Westerfeld's Uglies series, prepare yourself for something even more mind blowing. Control or be controlled? Join the Resistance.",2011-12-30

That was my life anticipating Possession. I heard about it several months before its release and did everything I could to get an ARC to no avail. I followed the authors blog and tweets and even went to a chat room interview (which was amazing!). Thankfully, I was not disappointed when I finally got my hands on the book!<br /><br />I was drawn right into the story from the very beginning. Vi is such a colorful and independant character, watching her lash out and proclaim her personal rebellion was fantastic right from the start. She isn't your typical damsel in distress and several times you find her being the hero in the situation. Jag is the perfect Baddie, though his hair is spiked, dyed and he oozes with rebellion, he also has a tender and vulnerable side.<br /><br />I loved the storyline and the mingling of characters through both Vi and Jag's past. The author was always a step ahead of me and easily swayed my opinions along the way. A lot of people thought this book would be just liked Matched, but it is 110% different, both wonderful in their own way. Possession really makes you think about the pros and cons that come with the release of personal freedoms. It's written in a practical and real world style which drips with personality and honesty. I really appreciated that love was represented in a way that wasn't all physical, but an emotional bond between two people. Soft, innocent affection between two individuals and a strong pull towards one another. This is one of those books that once you pick it up, you wont put it down until you've read it cover to cover. Its riveting, adventurous, mind boggling madness and I absolutely LOVED it.<br /><br />Overall, if you are into dystopia novels- this is a must read. I am SO glad that there are more books to follow in this series (otherwise I would be very angry right now). I will certainly be reading them all and reporting back here on the blog.

At moments, I struggled creating a mental picture of certain objects, but that only made my point of view more original. I really enjoyed Elana's take on the characters.<br /> Vi, the main character, was a rule-breaking rebel with a sweet side. I could not get enough of her character and the concept behind the novel made me want to learn more about her past and the Tech. Then, there was Zenn. The goody-two shoes boyfriend who always seemed to be there for Vi. Throughout the whole entire novel, I couldn't bring myself to decide whether I liked his character or not, simply because there were so many twists involved. It really pushed me, as a reader, to look into the situations of all of the characters and the Tech world as a whole. Finally, least but not least, Jag enters the story with a bang! His edgy personality was hard not to adore, and yet, the very thing I loved about him, made me want to jump in the story and hit him in the face. Regardless, he evidently had wicked hair. Haha! I recommend this for readers who are very open about detailing. It leaves alot of the mental imagery to the reader, and if you're the kind of person who enjoys small details, I'm afraid to say that this story would come across as confusing, if not vague.

I can thank 1984, BRAVE NEW WORLD, and THE GIVER for all jading me as a kid.  And yet, why is it I always end up reading more dystopian types?  I guess because every now and then you run into a good one.  And--when they're good, they're usually really good.  I loved HUNGER GAMES and the UGLIES series.  I'm happy to say that this one can added to the goodies list.  :  So on to my review already--<br /><br />The central theme to this novel is control or be controlled.  No surprise there; aren't all dystopians that central theme?  Where this one exceeded my expectations is Vi.  She's the strong, kick-butt female we all want in a novel, especially a novel where the main character has to take down 'the man'.  Right away she teams up with Jag--the badboy also in prison for breaking the rules--and the whole novel is kind of their escape/self-discovery kind of a thing along the way.  Then there's also Zenn--the goodboy--and Vi's 'match' she left at home.  It makes for an excellent plot.  And I thoroughly enjoyed it (and Vi's sarcastic personality) the whole way through; it didn't disappoint.  My favorite favorite part was the ending.  It was intense and I loved it.  A cliffhanger all the way, but such a perfectly fitting ending.  I can't wait to read book 2 (is there a book 2?).<br /><br />If anything was lacking it was that the romance wasn't 'knock-your-socks-off'.  More like sweet and tender.

While capturing a very modern and fresh spin on YA Dystopian fiction, this story still had that eerie feel that L'Engle was so good at creating.<br /><br />Vi, the snarky and fiercely independent lead character in this stunning work, is tossed around in a sea of lies and control freaks.  Rebelling against the control and trying to see through the lies, she wants to find a way to live outside what society has planned for her.  Teenage girls, so easily pressured by what the world expects of them and what the media determines to be correct behavior/dress, will hopefully be inspired by this headstrong heroine.<br /><br />To balance out Vi's fears and desire to break from her predetermined mold, Johnson created a hero who was equally willing to challenge the expectations put upon their people.  I won't give any spoilers but I will say he was the kind of hero that made you want them to work it out while he appalled you by his occasional flipping of sides and abandonment of Vi.<br /><br />All in all, the characters worked well together.

She had sworn her life to destroying all the creatures that went bump in the night after her parent's murder. So when she found herself forced into the arms of a vampire and unable to control her body's actions she though nothing could be worse.<br /><br />I found Kade's character very intriguing. I liked the subtle things the author did to let you know more about him, like the brief glimpses into his emotions when he let his guard down or the way he taunted Arianna because he knew that was what she expected from him. Whatever Arianna needed in that moment he was more than willing to give her, even one mind-blowing orgasm after another.<br /><br />For me the only conflict that seemed to work was Arianna's internal conflict. Although I enjoyed the effect of the Eros I would like to have seen more about how she destroyed them. Also the conflict between Kade and Arianna did not work for me. I couldn't believe Arianna didn't realize that Kade had deeper feelings for her, since it was obvious to me as a reader from the way he behaved. I think she should have recognized his feels as well as her own.<br /><br />This story was sexual from start to finish. The physical connection between these two almost never ended. Personally I would have liked to have seen more variations of the type of sex, maybe have the characters step out into something a bit more daring.
