There’s a 22 page preface featuring a Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling finding the novel not to be pornographic. In it, Allen Ginsburg claims that Naked Lunch’s author is “taking a very moral position, like defending the good here, I think.” Of next most interest is an appendix that Burroughs (a master drug addict) published in The British Journal of Addiction.<br />Come on now, you’re thinking, a novel tried as pornographic material and the most interesting parts are . . . Yeah, I’m afraid so. If you want pornography, go to Anne Rice’s soft-porn vampire novels or the stronger stuff in her Anne Rocqeulaire Beauty and the Beast series. Why doesn’t this novel qualify? One reason is that like his pal Jack Kerouac, Burroughs writes with an amphetamine speed that piles images so fast that sexual arousal becomes impossible. The other reason is that the act of sexual congress—just as the act of selling or taking drugs—blatantly becomes a political act of dominance or submission. More than that, all and any acts become societal attempts at dominance. For example, one psychiatrist, Dr. Fingers Shafer, the Lobotomy Kid, practices brain surgery on out-of-line humans who don’t conform. Another, Dr. Benway, drugs people into conformity. In one scene he gives a young man named Carl a “psychic fluoroscope,” a test for latent homosexuality. The test consists of pinups from which Carl is to choose a favorite. When he does, Dr. Benway comments, “You have good taste, my boy. I may tell you in strictest confidence that some of these girls . . . are really boys. In uh drag I believe is the word???” Poor Carl says with disgust, “The whole thing is unreal. I’m going now. You can’t force me to stay.” Dr. Benway’s response? “Where can you go?” Thus, the novel’s dark point: Where can you escape the addiction to power society imposes? The Massachusetts Supreme Court was certainly right in ruling that this novel isn’t pornography, that it has literary intents. The court didn’t have to rule how successful those intents were.ight in ruling that this novel isn’t pornography, that it has literary intents.

Whenever I read a list of the most difficult books in the English language I have a burning desire to conquer all of them. Sometimes that is a good impulse (like when I decided to read Gravity’s Rainbow) but sometimes it gets me in trouble (like when I inevitably give in and read Finnegans Wake). After seeing Naked Lunch touted multiple times as one of the most difficult works in the English language, I decided to finally give in and read it. After I finished the book I was baffled, disgusted and ultimately disappointed by this dense postmodern novel, and not because it was hard to understand.<br /><br />Really, a non-linear book does not bother me. In fact, I much prefer non-linear story lines. To me, it reminds me more of how we end up learning about events. Very rarely does somebody sit down and give us a clear “a to b” recounting of events, whether they be historical or personal. Rather, we learn the truth bits and pieces at a time, often out of order, and eventually are able to see the full picture in retrospect.<br /><br />So the structure of Naked Lunch did not really bother me. Naked Lunch is broken into individual vignettes that are unrelated but technically tied together by a thin plot. What really stopped me from enjoying the book is that everything seemed so disconnected that I could not see any real relevance between parts.  Individual parts were great, especially the hallucinatory cityscape scenes that reminded me a lot of the odder parts of Gravity’s Rainbow (especially the scenes in Peenemunde or the expanding city.) But unlike many other dense postmodern novels, the scenes never seemed to have any significance to the overall plot, they just were weird for the sake of being weird.<br /><br />naked-lunchThis problem becomes especially clear in the more graphic and disturbing scenes. I do not consider myself overly prudish when it comes to the darker side of life, but Naked Lunch is by far the most disgusting and disturbing book I have ever read. The point of all the terrible scenes is to evoke the feelings of terribleness and horror that are part of modern society, and more precisely the life of a heroin addict. However, they never seemed to have more going on than mere shock value and their effort to disturb the audience.<br /><br />I will compare Naked Lunch to Ulysses by James Joyce, because both books ended up being banned and required a trial to establish whether or not they were too obscene for the general public. Ulysses has its fair share of questionable scenes (especially Episode 13 with Leopold’s voyeuristic masturbation) but they serve a deeper purpose. In the episode mentioned earlier, the scene establishes the loneliness and isolation of Leopold Bloom. His voyeuristic tendencies are an outward expression of his inward feelings of impotence and loneliness. We learn a lot about Leopold as a person and we are given insight into a part of our own psyche that may be suppressed or hidden. We learn to relate to Leopold. The scenes in Naked Lunch, however, doing nothing more than disturb the audience and never really establish a deeper meaning beyond helping us feel disgusted by our society. This really bothered me. I can stomach disturbing or inappropriate images, but they have to have meaning. Otherwise they are just pornography.<br /><br />But Naked Lunch is not completely bad. There are some interesting ideas and the writing can be hilarious at times. Like I mentioned earlier, I enjoyed some of the parts, but not enough to enjoy the book as a whole. I will openly admit that I very possibly just “didn’t get it.” The best thing that I got from Naked Lunch is that I can see the influence of William Burroughs on my favorite authors and I was once again convinced that I never want to be a heroin addict (as if I needed more convincing). I cannot recommend this book to anybody. If you want to read it, fine. I may even go back sometime in the future to try towring a little bit of meaning out of it, but as it stands I was severely disappointed by Naked Lunch.",2014-09-08

Burroughs. Thanks a lot, guys…<br /><br />The book's willfully obscurantist approach is reminiscent of Kerouac's own Dr. Sax, which was coming out in the United States around the same time, something that is not surprising considering that Kerouac wrote Dr. Sax while living with Burroughs in Mexico over half a dozen years earlier (it finally saw the light of day because Kerouac was busy cleaning out his drawers looking for stuff to feed popular demand for his works following the success of On the Road).<br /><br />While Kerouac got to be published in the U.S. Burroughs wasn't because of U.S. obscenity laws and while I don't believe in censorship, I also find it hard to blame the authorities in this case because Naked Lunch includes some positively vile descriptions of rape, torture and murder fantasies amidst disjointed phantasmagoric visions with little seeming connection or coherence. Burroughs is supposed to have said that the book can be read in any order because the chapters are arbitrary. As if that were a virtue...<br /><br />The go-to excuse for all of this seems to be that Burroughs was a drug addict who was honestly trying to describe how it feels to be a junkie. As for that, I am reminded of an old joke told by Bill Cosby, who once said about marijuana, &#34;People say it's great because it intensifies your personality, and I say, 'Yeah, but what if you're an a---hole.&#34; Judging from Naked Lunch, Burroughs was a 24-carat a--hole and drugs only intensified that trait.<br /><br />Nor do I feel any sympathy for Burroughs because he was an addict. His own early book Junky, published a few years before Naked Lunch (in the U.S.), described how he started on drugs out of what was basically boredom. He was a privileged kid (Burroughs Computers) with plenty of opportunities to make whatever he wanted of himself. He chose to be a sordid mess. While I respect his right to do that, I don't have to respect him for it.<br /><br />Fortunately, it takes an intrepid reader to get to or understand Burroughs' fever dreams here because the style of Naked Lunch makes tremendous demands on a reader to make heads or tails of the narrative. I get it that this turns a certain type of reader on and if you're that type of reader your reaction (and Amazon rating) will differ greatly from mine.

I mentioned there, as well, and I think it helps to set the mood for commenting on Jack Kerouac's seminal `travelogue' \\""On The Road\\"", that it all started last summer when I happened to be in Lowell, Massachusetts on some personal business. Although I have more than a few old time connections with that now worn out mill town I had not been there for some time. While walking in the downtown area I found myself crossing a small park adjacent to the site of a well-known mill museum and restored textile factory space.     Needless to say, at least for any reader with a sense of literary history, at that park I found some very interesting memorial stones inscribed with excerpts from a number of his better known works dedicated to Lowell's \\""bad boy\\"", the \\""king of the 1950s beat writers, Jack Kerouac. And, just as naturally, when one thinks of Kerouac then Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Neal Cassady and a whole ragtag assortment of poets, hangers-on, groupies and genuine madmen and madwomen come to mind. They all showed up, one way or another (under fictional names of course- Burroughs as Bull Lee), in Kerouac's \\""On The Road\\"". So that is why we today, fifty years after its original publication (after much literary and governmental controversy), are under the sign of Burroughs' minor classic \\""Naked Lunch\\"".    Minor classic? Well, yes. The various sketches, pieces and partials that make up the commentary in this science fiction-like exposition is filled with \\""weird \\"" characters and likewise is filled with future prophecies that became, in some cases like AIDS-type diseases, realities at a later time. No question this is a difficult book to get through cold sober. In fact I put it down a few times before I completed it back in the day. But look at it this way, if Kerouac represented a different way of telling a story through his use of spontaneous writing Burroughs also showed innovation by taking the haphazard, the derelict and the off-beat and made literary music out of it.     Maybe not your music, or for that matter mine, but surely music nevertheless. This \\""novel\\"", moreover, extols thing that today are rather taken for granted like illegal(and in the book and in Burroughs personal life seemingly excessive) drug use, homosexuality, the use of `obscene language', the dehumanization of modern society. Sound familiar? Of course, but Burroughs said it when it was not fashionable to do so.

I also don't find pointless prose that appears to have no discernable thread of thought to have much value. Personally, I like to read good story tellers, authors like Tom Robbins or Salman Rushdie. Naked Lunch is about as opposed to them as you can reasonably get.<br /><br />This is one of those books that sounds a lot better when someone translates it for you. In reading the preface where Norman Mailer talks about it in the context of the court proceedings in the 1960s, the book sounds interesting and culturally pertinent. However, upon reading it the book falls far short of the lofty status we get from Mailer's answers on the stand. I understand how Alan Ginsberg, a proclaimed NAMBLA member, would find it's material suitable. I wonder about Mailer though. While I'll never take a stand against a person's writing what they want, I do take pause when someone recommends something like this.<br /><br />This is not literature so much as a heroin clouded view of the author's own serious problems and his interpretation of our culture's deficiencies. The notion that this is the \\""naked\\"" truth, or lunch as it is so called, is so absurd that the book should never have been accepted as remotely resembling cult literature, in the past, present, or future.

Many potential readers may be driven away by its total abscence of plot, its notorious obscenity, and its sporadic and impenetrable hallucinogenic passages. <br /> <br />The novel is not as inacessible as its reputation suggests; the first step towards a better understanding of this beat classic is researching its background, and its author.  William S. Burroughs was an eccentric who went through phases of obsession with various esoteric themes, and he wrote Naked Lunch during the height of his obsessions with control, dehumanization and addiction.  The novel itself is edited down from a thousand pages of 'notes' and is not meant to be ingested as a continuous whole - as Burroughs suggests in the introduction, you can jump in at any point. <br /> <br />Read some of Burroughs' essays, read about the Beat generation, and read Burroughs' more straightforward debut 'Junky,' and things will begin to come together in the surreal satire that is 'Naked Lunch.'

It's written in a style that's not easy reading and yet very descriptive with tangent laced directions taking you in many different places, all so with a lot of non-conformist sexuality (to say the least), drug addiction, and the life that devalues and demoralizes others, abuses others both mentally and physically, that finds pleasure in seeing other's pains and torture, and somehow through the thick of it all, seems to enjoy the intense emotional and mental suffering.

And it appears that the reason for this hard digestion of words is the style of Burroughs writing that Allen Ginsberg speaks about from a 1968 interview in the book, Spontaneous Mind, page 136, says on the writing method of Burroughs;     \\""Now Burroughs doesn't see words - words don't go through his head, pictures go through his head. So his method of composition is sitting before a typewriter sort of looking up in the middle distance at the wall, seeing pictures flash through head like . . . mugwumps seated on a barstool slurping up honey with a long reptilian tongue. And then he simply transcribes it into pictures - words, picture words.\\"" Burroughs also writes in letter to Ginsberg describing his cut-up style of writing, that is, to cut up the sentences and rearrange them in any order\\""    And from Yage Letters p.59, in a letter to Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs writes,    \\""Take the enclosed copy of the letter. Cut along the lines. Rearrange putting section one by section three and section two by section four. Now read aloud and you will hear My Voice. Whose voice? Listen. Cut and rearrange in any combination. Read aloud. I can not choose but hear. Don't think about it. Don't theorize. Try it. Do the same with your poems. With any poems any prose. Try it.

William S. Burroughs has managed to cheat the structure of the English language by flat-out denying the existence of orthodoxy, tradition, convention, rules, principles and standards to deliver a fresh 1950s account of what it is to be a free person, although albeit with the paradox of equally being hooked on every conceivable vice.<br />Burroughs treats character development, plot and structure as mere formalities that have no place on the page. To him the essence of writing is to convey an idea of an experience by any means necessary. This is inclusive of coining new words, new grammar and new syntax as long it gets the message across. In many ways Burroughs achieves the expression of his deranged take on the human condition, and the inhuman one, by simply never coming to terms with life as anything more than psychotic mayhem with the assumption that being \\""correct\\"" is with population numbers that concur with one another on the trivial points of livelihood. To him it is all pandemonium whatever way you try to cook it and since disorder and chaos are the meal of day why not just dine on it like a King's banquet.<br />The premise here is non-existent. It simply delves into some sort of a junkie come spy come homosexual cover operative who travels to a place called the Interzone to write daily reports of his experiences there. The narrative is fresh, bold, thoroughly unique and actually interesting. It is inspiring but any attempt at trying to do a genre like it can only be seen as plagiarism. Not only has Burroughs cornered his market here, but he owns it through and through. There is nothing else like Naked Lunch and there probably never will be.<br />This book was so shocking when first published that it was tried under obscenity laws.

Before I begin to do so I would like to make a comment about the newly released version (Naked Lunch: The Restored Text ISBN: 0802116396).  Although I have not had a chance to read through this edition first hand, I have been told that it leaves out essential elements included in the original.  If this be the case, I would highly recommend avoiding this edition and go with an early edition of Naked Lunch.  With that said let us begin....<br />First off I will start for those of you new to William Burroughs, if you have never read anything of Burroughs before approaching this book DO NOT expect to pick up Naked Lunch and understand it.  Although this is generally regarded as his greatest work, Burroughs' preceding books are fundamental to understanding much of what takes place in it.  This text is important for a variety of reasons, however, if you go into it blind you will probably find it so unpalatable you may not even finish the text.  It may be like nothing you've ever read before.  It is dark, mordant, overtly sexual, drug infested, and extremely autobiographical (which is why the books leading up to Naked Lunch are important to understanding this work).  I highly commend the list created by Steve Hancock (Map to Burrough's Interzone).  This is an excellent roadmap to Burroughs.  I advise any novice to begin here.  If nothing else, start with Junky (ISBN: 0140043519). This is the first novel by Burroughs and will give you much insight into the man.<br />Now for those of you that have read Naked Lunch, got it or didn't, the above advice may be helpful as well.  A book I would recommend as the perfect companion to Naked Lunch is Interzone (ISBN: 0140094512).  This is a collection of works between the transition of Junky to Naked Lunch (originally titled Interzone).  Sections of this book are letters/notes to Allen Ginsberg and Burroughs himself.  Other parts are short stories, diary entries, letters, and autobiographical sketches.  I cannot say enough good things about notes in this book describing Burroughs' intentions with Naked Lunch.  This would be an wonderful book to peruse for those unsure of the genius of Naked Lunch.<br />\\""What am I trying to do with writing?  This novel is about transitions, larval forms, emergent telepathic faculty, attempts to control and stifle new forms...Control, bureaucracy, regimentation, these are merely symptoms of a deeper sickness that no political or economic program can touch...The fragmentary quality of the work is inherent in the method and will resolve itself so far as necessary.  That is, I include the author, Lee, in the novel, and by so doing separate myself from him so that he becomes another character, central to be sure, occupying a special position, but not myself at all...I would always be the observer and not the participant by the very act of writing about a figure who represents myself...The novel is a dead from, rigid and arbitrary.  I can't use it.\\""   (selections from Interzone by William S. Burroughs edited by James Grauerholz)",2003-06-29

At the time my older sister had this book and wasn't very interested in it so being a curious 13 year old I picked it up wanting to find out what was so 'depraved' about it.<BR>From the first page I quickly found myself immersed in a very strange, paranoid world indeed and found it absolutely fascinating. The writing style is quite manic, jumping through different subject matter, sometimes incoherently. It took me a couple of chapters to realise that most of the prose is the hallucinogenic ramblings of a drug addict. When I realised this I stopped trying to read the book like a novel or look for any kind of storyline for that matter and just read excerpts, sometimes twice for good measure. Despite the constant drug references I feel there is a strong anti-narcotics (certainly heroin anyway) theme, Burroughs conveys the sense of helplessness he experiences at trying to kick his habit insightfully and deliriously. If there was an overall storyline to this book then it would be a tale of decline; from his sometimes charming descriptions and interludes with the junkies in his area of New York, over the course of a few years his deranged drug life and spirit of adventure takes him to Tangiers. During the course of these travels his desire to kick the habit becomes stronger, the naivety of his New York life is stripped away and his furtive hallucinations become darker and more schizophrenic as he searches for a place of refuge away from the 'normal' America he fears and dislikes. This book isn't so much a story as a visceral experience. It makes you curious about the drug induced beat culture he was at the centre of, though his disdain for the 'junk' which controls him is always apparent.

Right from the beginning the writing is brilliant and creative and the pacing is absolutely furious.<br />There is no simple way to convey the 'story' because indeed nothing like a linear plot line exists. Many people, my own brother included, hate this and simply will not read the whole way through it for this reason alone. The only way to attempt to summerise the book as a whole in a tidy fasion is to say that essintialy it chronicles a mans journey from the United States, the heat was closing in, to Mexico and later Tangiers and finally to the imaginary Interzone.<br />Along the way we meet many colorful charaters, the most memorable of which is the charming and diabolical Dr Benway, and visit many exotic dreamscapes like the Meet Cafe where patrons eat the black meat of the giant aquatic centerpede while mugwamps dispense addictive fluid from their heads. At first glace the reader may assume that this dark world with its evil political factions and infernal beaurocracies is a paranoid nightmare of the author, but when you look closer it is the dark side of same world that we live in everyday rendered down to its most extreme and 'naked' form.<br />While many would like to put William S Burroughs down as nothing more than a junkie who killed his own wife and whose writing is very overated, there is simply such power in his words that cannot be denied. The captivating writing style and the amazingly hilairious black humor that abounds throught out the book (and is probually some of the darkest humor ever, in any medium) come straight off every page. Likewise many people, insecure people I would assume, look down on this book for it's sections that are some what pornographic, not that they that far from your average 'rommance'novel, but because they consist of homosexual activities. Obviuosly Burroughs's unblinking brutal disection of our darkest desires and addictions, whether it be drugs, sex, money or power over the mind of others was too much for the general public to handle when it was first published and it is a shame to see that even in this day and age there are still some who express those same small minded attitudes when they are confronted by the intensity of this writing.<br />The best way I can think to express my opinion of Naked Lunch is to say that I feel it lives up to it's strange title completely, indeed contained within is the most 'naked' view, the most powerfull, raw, twisted and decidedly dark take on reality ever told. And when you read this book it's is as though you have sat down to 'lunch', the book is such a feast for the mind, evey page full of energy, heavy idea's and thick with creative genius.<br />Not a book for everyone, but those open minded will find reading this book to be a genuinly enriching experience, indeed there is no other book quite like it, but squares should stay away.",2002-08-18

I have read several books that deal with the same topics and are situated in similar eras and environments, and I must say that this is the worst one of them all (don't be confused here: I loved the other ones I have read, e.g. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas).<br />Its unclear what exactly Burroughs was trying to do here.  In the introduction he said that this book is a creation out of notes he took during his lengthy period of drug addiction--perhaps he should have reread them when the drugs lessened their toll on his mind.  (Note: things that seem 'cool' when you're high, seldom remain that way the next morning). If the point was to illustrate the disgusting world of addiction then in my opinion he utterly failed.<br />Furthermore, its not clear why so much of the book concerns itself with the detailed description of little boys mutilating each other and their tales of sickening fornication. If this is a book on drug addiction (though I'm told it has several 'levels' of meaning that deal with all types of addiction) then why so much talk about twisted Freudian psychoanalysis-gone-Nazi bad psychology and condition techniques? Usually I can take intense detail but this book was too much.  If you're interested in a good story about addication then rent the movie 'Requim for a dream'.  That deals with everything Burroughs tries to write about (i.e. drug addiction, sex addiction, media control) including all the graphic detail and \\""unusual\\"" storytelling, the only difference is that 'Requim' is done extremely well.<br />The most dissapointing part is that the book fails to be a story.

I have never been a heroin addict, but I have had the electricity turned off in my house for a month. First, there's a CRASH; then NOTHING; the TV, OFF, lights, OFF, clock, MOTIONLESS. You can't bath, you can't cook, you feel too oppressed to eat, and worst of all from about five o'clock on you can't see. You wait for the dark to fall, the house like a dimmed cafe, knowing that there are hours of blindness ahead. This is depression. When even the TV soap operas don't want you . Then well before you are ready for bed STASIS; utter SHUT DOWN; DARKNESS, SIMULATED DEATH; A COMPLETE FEELING OF EMOTIONAL ISOLATION.<br />    This is the nearest approximation in my memory with the experience that you go through with Naked Lunch.  The book is cold: ice cold: the frostiest literary experience I know of, a vision of the BIG SHUT DOWN. But after the SHUT DOWN the mind keeps going -- cause you ain't dead -- and, continuing the house analogy, as you lay in the darkness of AN UTTER LACK OF HEALTHY STIMULATION what tends to fill the void are images of sex and violence. Repetitive thinking, revenge fantasies, paranoia, mindlessly elaborate and vicious sexual combinations, warped logic and the twisted images of all the people you are going to get back when you get back on your feet again.  Degradation this extreme doesn't make you thoughtful. You lose after awhile the need or desire to justify yourself; your body stinks, your mind stinks, and you sink to juvenile,narcissistic level of existence. Junk does all your thinking for you.<br />   And therein lies the rub. For all its flash, dazzle, and pop relevance, Naked Lunch  has the emotional maturity of a fifties comic book. The style can't save the substance.The prose really does make sense, and follow a loose kind of narrative sequentiality. I thought of angular panels, big thought bubbles and exaggerated illustrations. It's beautifully effective: more like a comic than any other book: language in the pithy, violent and elliptical style that's usually associated with words accompanied by visuals. The visuals are absent. They are unnecessary. They are in our heads as a symptom of today's visual culture. Naked Lunch  is the finest example I know of a book that follows more a visual, or cinematic than a traditional literary logic.<br />    Now for the part that will likely anger some of Burroughs more dedicated believers. The flaws of Naked Lunch  are the same flaws of the hip culture that so admires it: a lack of seriousness, a superficialness. For all his interest in everything that influences junkies Burroughs doesn't know what self-reflection is. As he states in his previous novel Junkie, he \\""doesn't believe in psychotherapy.\\"" The question that ought to be at the center of his vision WHY SOMEONE BECOMES A JUNKIE? is shunted aside. Burroughs doesn't seem to really believe there is an emotional side to life.   Burroughs loves to smirk, smirk at everything, including groups he belongs to. He offers a positive alternative to nothing. I think his popularity with hipsters is due to this hardboiled attitude. Everything is a joke; nothing can hurt me; I'm so cold and hard inside that I'm safe. <br />    Naked Lunch  is hilarious but at its core it is a very defensive book, a flippant hard shell. Burroughs' cynicism and paranoia remain very much angry white male attitudes. He is too  flippant, and heartless to write otherwise....-- every cliche about black and Asian sexual organs  is pulled out at some point or another.  Naked Lunch  is particularly weak in its attempts at social commentary.   The great enemy is the STATE. The Forces of CONTROL, THE MAN. This is a cool attitude, but a too simplistic one. Naked Lunch  needs more sociology, more psychology, and more caring. More of the qualities that make 1984  and Animal Farm  so much superior analyses of the state, class, and the human condition. For Burroughs the BIG SOLUTION is to form our own communities and get the STATE off our back. Maybe, except the idea that such a community, populated by Burroughs clones,  would be happy place is a laughable one.  <br />     His admirers should seriously consider that in his addiction Burroughs shot and killed his own wife: was the state at fault for that? Naked Lunch needs less vitriol, and acuter self-examination. As it is, Burroughs tells us more about the paranoia and defensive attitudes of addicts than anything else. A greater degree of self analysis would build a firmer basis for his social analysis, but that would also wipe the smirk off Burroughs' face, and above all else he wants to keep the smirk. The smirk provides some wonderful entertainment; verbal fireworks; wild, enticing language acrobatics, sick humor. He was a great trickster, a language gypsy.

It can be extraordinarily difficult to follow and understand, even from one page to the next. The whole is composed of sketches, or episodes, some having no apparent connection to the others, except by associations of sexuality and rampant drug use/addiction/recovery. There are a couple of major structural elements that comprise the work: scenes and descriptions of the moment of 'need' for the addict (particularly of opiates) and of the social, economic, and political climate that perpetuates the problem; and the futuristic-Orwell-on-Heroin story of Interzone. <br />Interzone, located nebulously in North Africa, is the site of cultural crossings, and a corrupt and totalitarian government, that seeks to control the bodies and minds of its 'citizens'. Some of the horde of villainy amok in Interzone: the nefarious Dr. Benway, whose crass self-assurance underlies anxieties brought on by his insistent medical prosecution of homosexuality; A.J., an opportunist, whose maddening interests include abortion; and a host of Party Leaders whose distance from the 'ordinary people' they represent is a severe critique, particularly on American government. Written during the Cold War and the persecution of Americans for supposedly 'communist' activities, Burroughs' work offers admittedly Swiftian satiric glances at many aspects of 1950's culture in terms of gender, complacency, and isolationism. <br />For good and ill, the portrait of Interzone in \\""Naked Lunch\\"" is no less a prophetic vision of a dystopia, such as we see in George Orwell's \\""1984,\\"" published just 10 years before. Both works are concerned with the brute physicality of life, as it is and as it could be in the future if current trends are left without check or amendment. Like \\""1984,\\"" but surpassing it in some ways, \\""Naked Lunch\\"" addresses the dangers of government power over the human body, its reproductivity, and the unfortunate similarities apparently viewed by the state between its citizens and common herd animals. \\""Naked Lunch\\"" is pervaded by scenes of overt sexual practices and orgies that 'bugger' description and even more disturbing scenes in which people are depicted as beasts - baboons and insects abound in the work. These are mitigated by references the narrator makes to himself as similar in bearing to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \\""Ancient Mariner\\"" - Burroughs asks his audience to listen or read in silence - because these are stories and vignettes which he must tell, both for his sake and ours.<br />Scenes from real life, along with an introduction and appendix that deal with the experience of drug abuse provide an anchor (however tenuous) to the reader. If one reads the episodes that take place in Chicago, New York, Tangier, etc., as examples of the worst of humanity in our contemporary world - and sees this as the very foundation of the socio-political climate of Interzone, then the despair and challenge of the work become clear. Burroughs is reaching out to us to change our world fundamentally to be more tolerant and understanding, particularly in an era where, increasingly, strictly defined notions of nationality and national cultures are becoming ever more faint. This is a book, like Orwell's, which is more relevant than ever to readers in the early 21st century.

I am not an entertainer&quot;","If you are considering reading Naked Lunch, you should be warned that it is one of the most challenging classics of recent literary history. The infamous novel, scrawled down during the twilight of author, William S. Burroughs' fifteen-year addiction to opiates, has frustrated countless readers with its inability to fit into any type of classification; its vulgar, offensive nature and its shaky stream-of-conscious narration. To some, Naked Lunch may seem like tasteless gibberish (That is certainly how it seemed to the Massachusetts Attorney General who unsuccessfully tried the novel for obscenity charges in 1966). But by taking the right approach to this story of Bill Lee, a drug pusher and habitual user, and Interzone, the surrealist, netherworld in urban Mexico to which he flees, you may find it to be a spectacular writing.<br />Keep in mind that Burroughs is the definition of a beatnik, an author who forbids himself any scholarly instruction and simply wrote as he felt, scraping satire, fantasy and social realism together into one vessel. Understand that he lived much of his life as a drifter, pulled ever downward into society's grimier aspects. Vulgarity and mortification are simply results of the author writing what he knows. Remember that his psyche had been scrambled by opiates and that Naked Lunch's rickety form intriguingly mirrors Burroughs' sense of reality. Now you are ready for this bizarre, extraordinary book.<br />Although reading Naked Lunch is a thorny process, it offers numerable delights: Deep belly-laughter at Interzone's funhouse mirroring of American decadence, intense visualization of the area's vividly described, baroque spectacles, astonishment at its denizens' all-consuming greed, hypocrisy and sadism, speculation at how much of these strange observations were based on what Burroughs actually experienced and fascination at the way in which the narration breaks down as the speaker's mind erodes. I hope that you find that, despite its disregard for almost every rule taught in High School English; despite its rawness and vulgarity and despite being an exceptional challenge to follow, Naked Lunch is a mind-blowing book.",2001-12-19

Burroughs, is like inhaling a tornado of vision, of America, of the soul of humanity, and of the junkie from a heroine addict's hungry mind.  In Naked Lunch, Burroughs denounces the gray of mass conform-ism, which has settled like a sodden sponge over the square inhabitants of America.  He shows the American way of life, as being policed by mom and pop and their good ole' Christian values.  Burroughs relayed in the novel, that America is censored by the extreme fear of erotica, sexuality, drug use, and the queerness of the hip.  Also, Burroughs prose navigates its way through many layers of the human mind, exploring and allowing you to become the screwball, the sick, the perverse, the nymphomaniac, the junkie, the racist, the politician, the homophobic, or the square.  Burroughs also bluntly states that the junkie is the saddest form of life, fueled entirely by the utter need for junk.  Burroughs describes junk as an \\""evil virus\\"", decaying body and mind into slime pools of agony in a never ending lust for the pleasure of high.  In Naked Lunch, Burroughs writes in non-linear prose, in a confusing, at times plotless vision of himself and the world.  His words are a roller coaster of thought and reflection, vision and persecution, wake up call and warning, but his choppy whirlwind of words could be confused as a haze of junk crazed babble, which it is definetly not.  Naked Lunch, in the opinion of many, sits on a hairline between the art and rawness of the mind and how it interprets addiction, and something along the lines of extreme indulgence, and pornography.  I would recommend this book to the person who enjoys the obscure world of oddball beat poetry or stream of consciousness writing.  I would also recommend this book to someone itching to find a novel, which allows them to think and come upon their own realizations of life, or to someone who is simply looking for a twisted, thrilling novel.

Approach Naked Lunch as you would the account in Queer's foreword: An incredible account from a not-to-dependable source who has been to places and mindsets you will never experience and you will be strangely compelled to think how much of this savage book was based on an actual experiences or actual truths concerning cruelty Burroughs experienced. I think it was meant to be read as such considering the book of first released under the pseudonym of its main character. Of coarse being based in a fictional area of Mexico does not mean Naked Lunch has no parallel to life in the states. I can't help but see satire of America's social structure during the scenes portraying Interzone's political parties and scenes portraying its class stratification. Written superbly with beatnik-style lyricism, Naked Lunch presents wonderful satire and a confrontational nature destined to appeal to those of us with more extreme senses of humor.",2001-05-04

And don't forget that Steely Dan got their name from this novel but they claim they never read it.<br />That is the story of its life: few people have actually gotten through the whole book.  It reads in fragments with inconsistent characters morphing, changing and altering identities.  Dream, hallucination, reality and drug visions blend and merge and disperse.  Scatalogical routines take coherant form and read like vaudville humor from a bathroom wall, then deteriorate into filthy fragments and irreverant and often disgusting descriptions of sado-masochistic sex acts. Everyone is a junkie, everyone is gay, everyone screws teenaged North African boys, everyone is insane, psychotic or diseased.  Doctors kill their patients, police murder their suspects, drug addicts infect their marks with insect diseases and turn into centipedes during sex acts that threaten to nauseate the reader.<br />So what does it all mean?  What is the motivation or the reasoning behind it all.  Burroughs was no fool and he had a strong moral intent all the way.  He considered himself a reporter who has entered behind enemy lines, like a photojournalist who returns from Vietnam with pictures of napalmed babies.  The title Naked Lunch evokes an image of someone being wised up to what they are eating.  Burroughs is depicting the relationship between the junkie and the drug dealer to be a metaphor for all control systems, for all vampiric systems whether it be capital punishment, abuse of political power, police states, etc.  By the time Burroughs wrote this novel he had suffered through decades of abuse at the hands of federal agents, narcotics police and the customs officials of all the third world borderlines that he crossed as he moved from New York to Texas to New Orleans to New Mexico to Mexico City to Tangiers, all the time running from the police, none the least of reasons being that he shot his wife through the head during a drunken game of William Tell (she put a glass on her head and challenged him to shoot it off -- he lost the challenge).<br />Burroughs was a troubled junkie from a distinguished southern family, a Harvard student who studied archeology and linguistics, who studied medicine in Vienna, who went to New York to find work and wound up hooked on heroin.  He took part in the birth of the Beat Generation in 1944 before setting off on his long tortured odyssey that led to more drug addiction, the death of his wife, and the bottom that he hit in Tangiers.  He went there in the mid-50's to impress the exiled community of writers including Paul Bowels (who wrote the Shelting Sky) but who rejected him because he was just a filthy junky with a gun fetish.  Instead he wrote Naked Lunch.  It is a descent into Hell chronicled by a man who was to become one of the best writers of the 20th Century.<br />The events that led to the writing of Naked Lunch is chroniciled in the amazing documents known as the Letters of William Burroughs 1945-1959.  These letters were the source of Cronenberg's screenplay of Naked Lunch, more so than Naked Lunch itself.  Read the letters first, then read Naked Lunch. Then see the movie. In that order.

There is no plot, which gets a little confusing.  This book was really confusing to read because it seemed to jump around and not have a continue flow.  William Burroughs was very creative in coming up with this story though.  How many authors have the imagination and courage to write a story like this?  This book went through a lot of court cases because people were trying to get it banned.   But in the end it won the court cases and is permitted on the bookshelves.  Even though I found this interesting it took me a while to realize that the only way to understand it was to just read and not really understand it.  That made it a bit confusing, but it was actually pretty fast reading.  It's been a while since the last time I could say that I was able to read 90 pages in just one day.  I recommend anyone who is up for a good read where they do not want to have to really think when reading, to read this book.  I am not used to reading books and not thinking about them and just reading, so it was a little difficult to make myself do at first, but after not very long it was a lot easier and made the book much more enjoying not having to think about what I am actually reading.

Thus, as this book comes from many different angles, there are many different ways of interpreting the style, themes, and general content. Most of the scenes in &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; come off as cartoonish, however, this does not mean that the social commentary is weakened; nor does it mean that Burrough's vision of &quot;hell&quot; is somehow thinned out. Rather, only by writing in such a manner is Burroughs truly able to exploit those elements of humanity that he wishes to discuss and comment on. That is, he takes something (for example, addiction in general) and raises it to the highest power--exploiting the exploitation. On another level, &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; can be interpreted from an aesthetic viewpoint. Remember, it was Burroughs who saw that &quot;literature was about 50 years behind other forms of art&quot;. Thus, we get the cut-up method, which is roughly word-collaging. This method allows for Burroughs to present multiple layers and form various connections both within the text and to elements outside of the text that normally would not be made. This method allows for the writer to truly refute &quot;the man&quot; in the sense of all of those do's and do-not's that we have been taught about writing; it allows for one to enter the text at any point and form a maximum amount of relays both within itself and with the outside world. Thus, to call commentary that is carried out in such a manner &quot;juvenille&quot;, etc. seems to ignore exactly what Burroughs was attempting to accomplish (among other things) in &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. Granted, if one is expecting suspenseful plots, one will be dissappointed by this book, but to a degree, that is the point: that direct story-lines are the ideal creations of authors and fail to display, in thier very conception, the various layers at work in life.

Burroughs's flights of fancy are wildly imaginative and often repugnant; he displays an unusual mastery of language and an outrageous prose. With its highly volatile and pornographic content, sometimes homosexual in nature, it's somewhat hard to believe that &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;  was printed in 1959. (In fact, censorship proceedings are documented in the introduction to the paperback version. For this episode alone, the book is important.) <br />Whether you like this fiction is a serious matter of taste, but it IS vilely artistic and undeniably useful to the student of literature. What's ultimately the point of the novel? I can only offer a subjective opinion. But we are fed the notion that the novel condemns all forms of addiction -- addiction to drugs, power, subservience, sex, etc. -- though it's difficult to see this without prior guidance. I thought that I'd seen and heard everything, but my first encounter with Burroughs proved me wrong -- big time! <br />This kind of writing isn't for the faint of heart.

Unfortunately, howl that it is, it often falters and falls into the inarticulate. The reason being, what the cut-up method gains in striking imagery and jarring juxtaposition it sacrifices in meaning-it often tends toward nonsense. To see work that is stylistically as innovative, as evocative, that is far more haunting and adds up when the last page is turned, check out two underrated underground classics: Julio Cortazar's Hopscotch and Vincent Czyz's Adrift in a Vanishing City. Okay, Czyz's book is only two years old, it's not a classic yet, but like Hopscotch, it goes far beyond the simple stylistic power of Naked Lunch and both books mirror their lyrical prowess with structural genius (Hopscotch moreso than Adrift). These two are probably everything Burroughs wanted to accomplish, but didn't have the right drugs to pull off.  As for eroticism, Czyz and Cortazar have scenes unparalleled in the raw poetry of sex (wait till you get to the scene in ancient Sodom in Adrift).

The narrative is completely  non-linear and really only the beginning and end make much sense, whether  that was delibrate or not or whether it was just the way it all fell  together is beyond me.

A reader looking for a a more clear and simplistic Burroughs should try out his pulpish but entertaining _Junkie_  and _Queer_.  These books use an autobiographical format to show the author  falling into a life of drugs and homosexual dependence, which the author  clearly viewed as entrapping and morally wrong, even as he fell into them  and maintained a objective viewpoint.  <br />Naked Lunch takes these themes  and greatly improves them.  After starting with a scene of the protaganist  fleeing the law, it's broken into vaguely related scenes of several pages  each.  These scenes are often bizarre or disgusting, but are always  intriguing.  Taken together, they give an impressionistic look into the  life of an addict.  They are often extremely funny, and the writing is very  impressive.  I enjoy pulp fiction, and Burrough's take at pulp fiction at  the end, with Hauser &amp; O'Brien, is perhaps the strongest piece of  hard-boiled detective writing I've ever read.<br />Drugs are central to  Burrough's vision, but this isn't really a drug book, either, and is more  about Burrough's compelling if slightly twisted philosophies.  Heroin is  used as a central metaphor for systems of control that Burroughs sees  elsewhere - in domineering characters, in 50's politics, in modern science,  in patriarchies.

Burroughs the most fame(infamy?) and glory.  Most people interested in Beat Literature choose Kerouac for insight, but I feel that  Burroughs gets to the root of the Beatniks' most defining element:  Drug  use/abuse. His style is unrelenting.  His prose harsh and ragged, not  unlike himslef for some 15 odd years of his life in which he lived as a  junky.  I urge the reader to not read this book in sequence from beginning  to end as a traditional novel.  Instead, read a chapter or two at a time.   Then, set it down and leave it alone for a day.  The next day, return and  continue reading.  Each pargraph; each page is a message unto itself.   Burroughs uses a rehab center in a place called Interzone, the character  William Lee, and a sadistic orgy to help convey the over-all idea that the  junky is a sad and tragic individual.  But, what makes the junky so tragic  is not his position in life.  It is the sad fact that he put himself there  in the first place.  And, to spite himself, the junky's body must continue  this act even though his mind says no.  It is sad that this book has not  been given the credit that it is due.  Only at the end of his life did Mr.  Burroughs begin to reap the rewards of his, and his comrades' work.  As  though he couldn't stand another minute in the world of the straight and  narrow without a friend(Allen Ginsberg, the last Beat), he died after a  life of extreme hardships and bittersweet success. Needless to say, this  book sums up Burroughs' early life on the streets before any real  intimations of success.  It is not for the faint of heart, nor is it for  those of you who prefer &quot;popular&quot; literature.

This novel, Burroughs' greatest work was written in the late 1950's, a time when American pop culture reached  untold heights of banality. Enter Naked Lunch - a double-barreled assault  on truth, justice, and the American Way. No institution is safe, nothing is  sacred, and the taboo is made holy, as capitalists, racists, fascists,  homophobes, doctors, cops, Christians, and hypocrites of all sorts get  their just desserts. Burroughs, a fortunate son born into wealth and power,  dissects and destroys proper society in his prose, exploding mind bombs of  words throughout. Veering somewhere between a bad acid trip and exact  Swiftian satire, Naked Lunch remains the most original work of fiction ever  written. A must-read for all serious students of literature, this is one of  those books that you just can't &quot;like&quot; - you either love it, or  you hate it. I absolutely loved it! This book also begs for re-reads as new  insights are revealed with each reading. And please, PLEASE be sure to  listen to Burroughs read the abridged version on tape!

And they either love it or hate it.  Most people I talk to say they couldn't get through it, and this is reaction easy to understand. So what is it about this book that people keep talking about it?<br />NL was/is a revolutionary book, and reading it for the first time can be a  fireworks experience.  At the same time it must be admited that the writing is uneven - since everything was so new, he and his fellow editors could hardly tell what to keep and what to discard.  NL is like visiting a genetics lab before they've had a chance to throw out all the failures.<br />Naked Lunch is a record of Burroughs' writing break-through.  He started trying to write another Junky (see NL's first chapter) and ended up trying to destroy language (see the cut-ups he slipped in at the end of the  book - contrary to common belief, NL is not a \\""cut-up\\"" book in the sense of the technique Burroughs later employed).<br />My own advice to first-time readers is to skim or skip the first chapter, which drags and creates a wrong impression of the rest of the book.  Thereafter you should read as the mood takes you, receiving the writing as a series of darkly-humorous skits, lectures and moods.<br />It's perfectly valid to just dip into the book anywhere, and read for as long as the mood holds you.  The structure Burroughs originally planned for this book was disposed of in the final edit, and the published version is almost completely random.  The book may also be a little disconcerting because of its period - a lot of the satires and characters relate specifically to the repressive USA of the late 1950s, and many of these archetypes are now extinct.<br />Finally, it's important to remember what came after the revolution - Naked Lunch was only the beginning.  The 1960s saw his strangest period - the  \\""cut-ups\\"" - when he pursued his destructive/creative technique as  a philosophy, and pushed it beyond all rational limits.

The book is fantastic.  By far Burroughs best work and the best piece of non-linear writing to come from the beat generation.  I have to respond to morbeus' review below.  I agree with Burroughs trying to con us, in a way that's true, but the comment on not thinking Burroughs was a day to day junkie slumming it out in morocco in the late fifties is completely untrue.  It was the allowance from his parents that allowed him to get into the junk scene in the first place without much effort.  By the time he descended to where he was in Morocco he was a full-fledged addict, have no doubt, and I have it on a good source that when Ginsberg did find him in the single room apartment he was very close to gone.  Maybe its a misunderstanding of heroin's effects that leads to this belief but there are moments of clarity in between fixes, and there might be a couple of days inbetween fixes (usually when the addict decides he's quit) before resistance wears thin.  Burroughs thoroughly used these moments to type.  I think the biggest con to the reader, and the best, is how one's lead to believe the book was incedental to his experience when the experience was almost setup to produce the book.  In that regard he knew that something could come from this binge, something that would be extremely well suited to his style of cut and paste writing (which is by the way aa attempt to mimic a junkies thought patterns, but I think someone already said that.",1998-06-12

At the same time I find the &quot;over-analysis&quot; by others to be completely &quot;over-analizing&quot; in attempts to &quot;get it&quot;, much apologies for the expression of an opinion. Burroughs' Naked Lunch is one of the most misunderstood books ever written, second, I believe, only to the bible in misinterpretation. While Burroughs was a habitual drug user, he wasn't the crazed, strung-out heroin user with no mental functioning, if so how did he write it in the first place. Of course his pals Ginsberg and Keroac &quot;constructed&quot; the book for him or did they? This was a book intended to con people about what a book is, should be and what the writer is and should be. Naked Lunch can be looked at as a collection of scenerios describing both the non-afflicted mind and the afflicted mind of a drug user. To think that Burroughs would have been slumming the streets in ratty clothes is laughable at best. This is a writer who up until being published lived off an allowance from his parents. Naked Lunch is a part of Burroughs and the two are intertwined in that the presentation of image is based on the lanquage being used to present that image. Think of Burroughs' anti-establishment presentation of himself and the his Nike commercials...too hip. Then think of the image Naked Lunch presents to the reader. Naked Lunch is a book by not being a book, the non-linear construction was intentional not thrown together or was it? Naked Lunch can be understood by everyone, the need for a English degree is non-essential nor is the idea of analytical comparisons to other authors. Naked Lunch is and isn't. The con is what Naked Lunch is. Naked Lunch can be read in any fashion and the message is the same, you've been conned. Time stands still, moves, intertwines. Reality exists and doesn't exist, Bill Lee is William is Dr. Benway is the talk asshole. Naked Lunch allows the reader to experience their own conciousness in the fashion in which &quot;it&quot; operates. Naked Lunch is one of the finest examples of 20th century literature for what it accomplishes. Naked Lunch is everything and nothing to everyone who reads it. No one interpretation is right, but all interpretations are right. Everything you read in Naked Lunch is based on &quot;Solid Fact&quot;. Read the beginning of Naked Lunch and you are given the story of &quot;I wrote this while completely on drugs and I had no idea what I was writing&quot;, then read the end with the &quot;scientific&quot; disertation on drugs and what treatments are and what Burroughs is telling the readers, then...Think of the image being presented to you and then question everything being said on the page. What is the image? What is the story? What is the meaning? What is the message? Am I being conned? If you answer these questions and find answers question the answers, then again you could just read the book and enjoy the paragraphic &quot;scenerios&quot; and not think about the &quot;message&quot; or the &quot;big picture.&quot;",1998-04-26

While it would be tempting to assume Naked Lunch is a factual documentary of this state, such a conceit is futile and flippant.  What is apparent is that Naked Lunch is a very ugly book indeed - seemingly composed of the same madness which may have gripped its author in his darker moments of insanity. <br /> What becomes quite clear upon reading through the book is that its writer is a most extraordinary man, possessed either of a truly warped imagination, or at the very least subjected to extreme situations and still alive to write about them afterwards. Throughout the novel various characters are introduced, from the unforgettable Dr. Benway ('I deplore brutality. It is inefficient') to the 'nameless asshole' whose suffering seems to comprise much of the book. These characters, involved as they are with psychedelic dealings in nightmare landscapes, are etched in the memory as bloodthirsty, perverse, wicked...and also very, very amusing. <br /> Assuming the book survives a preliminary perusal (a task in itself), subsequent readings are less trying and Burrough's rough and ruthless sense of humor becomes identifiable. Having swallowed the initial nausea of the sheer unpleasantness of the book, the hopeless floundering of the addict takes on a gripping and desperate edge; the evil machinations of world leaders are breathtaking, and the depths of depravity to which they sink are laughable. <br /> Repellant, yes, but also entertaining, and it is in this manner that the novel is a success: It is impossible to throw up while you are laughing.  While it may not be everybody's cup of tea, pot of hash, or plate of stir-fried entrails, Naked Lunch makes a lasting impression on the reader. The more conventional reader will not enjoy its violence, prurient sex, and unselfconscious drug-addictions; those with a stronger stomach and more liberal imagination will appreciate its frank confessions, di! sjointed descriptions, and of course, its very dark sense of wit.",1998-04-03

I become increasingly intrigued by just how awful a book could make me feel, while at the same time challenging and expanding my mind.<br /><br />I felt myself becoming addicted to the filthy pages, needing to know what nightmarish vision was waiting around the corner. Despite, the obscene sex with hanging bodies, foul medical practices, and scat, I clawed and crawled through twisted, mangled sentence after sentence, regardless of how dirty and lost I felt with each passing page.  Upon reading the final word, I felt sick, spent, and in need of light, much like the junkies I had been following relentlessly over the last few days.  This is where the genius of Burroughs shines through.<br /><br />Many an author has taken me into their world and shown me new things; very, very few authors have been able to show me that world and raise such wretched and horrible emotions in me.  It is in this way, Burroughs grabs the reader by the throat and says, “You want to see my world? You want to experience it firsthand? Do you want to see why the “junk virus” is a number one concern? Fine!  Let’s go.”  He drags us kicking and screaming, sometimes vomiting, through a drug induced maze of distorted funhouse mirrors, forcing us to stare each vision in the face, to press our noses against each streaked, reflective mirror and take it all in.  Slowly and weakly, we each emerge from the maze, desperate for shower, having learned one important lesson:  Drugs Are Bad.e reader by the throat and says, “You want to see my world?

To give this book even ONE star is a stretch for me- but that's my opinion. I purchased this book on my tablet because its based on addiction; which is something I'm interested in reading about and always have been... and yes, there were lots of referrences to drugs and such in different cultures/countries, etc. BUT this book was very gruesome, vulgar, and downright disturbing.

Your thought is, &#34;Well, I guess I had to be there.&#34;  Burroughs' 'Naked Lunch' is a lot like that.  Reporting from the interior of the Interzone and various heroin-induced locales, William Burroughs and his alter-ego (variously named at various times) offers this 'live album' of what it's like to inject yourself with heroin and walk on that side of your consciousness.  A challenging read, it was pretty much banned in the US when first published in the 1950s.  At times, this pieced together reportage feels like Philip K Dick and at others it feels like de Sade.  The novel is filled with incidents and vignettes and most of them don't readily fit with one another.  This isn't so much narrative as it is experience.  Think of the last fifteen minutes of 2001: A Space Odyssey and you get the idea.  You don't have to 'get it' so much as simply experience it. -- Burroughs employed a technique whereby he would arrange vignettes and passages in any order (the book can be read from any place without thought of what came before or what follows).  All said, this is a rewarding and challenging novel.  A work that still has the power to shock today. -- That said, there comes a time during the reading where a little bit of tedium takes over (at any rate, it did for me).  The passages are so wrapped up in the world of drugs (primarily heroin) and what that's like (to Burroughs) that I found myself wishing for a few moments of straight narrative.  But that's not the point (nor should it be).  Naked Lunch stands as an important artifact from a corner of the imagination most of us don't travel into.

It is absolutely fantastic, in its own special way. It is one of the most important books ever written. It was the last work of literature to be banned in the US (state of Mass). The resulting lawsuit overturned the ban (Mass Supreme Court). The only other publisher willing to publish the book outside of New York was in France. Employees of this publisher were subject to death threats and other threats of violence for publishing it. This book can be credited with advancing the notion of free speech on both sides of the Atlantic.<br /><br />This is the first Burroughs book I have read. From the research I have done, no other books, including his, can be compared to this. Burroughs is truly a genius trapped in a drug addicts body. The reader will switch between the ramblings of a drug addict to some of the most beautiful writing I have ever encountered almost instantly. The descriptions of drug use and brutal sex and death are so explicit they are enough to make you turn your head away as if you were watching a video. Conversely, Burroughs' ability to describe beauty is unmatched.<br /><br />This book takes on the political/social subjects of its day and makes no apologies for doing so. These include homosexuality, Americans' obsession with reputation, British imperialism, etc. [Small spoiler alert] There is a scene where several Americans died of shame after engaging in an orgy. There is another scene where the president of a small nation had to crawl across a pile of garbage and grovel at the feet of a British general. Great Britain kept control of this country with a forced &#34;vote&#34;. The general asked who voted in favor of continued British rule while guns sweeped across the crowd, and also who was against. The title of &#34;President&#34; is the most reviled position in this nation because he is forced to submit to British demands.<br /><br />This is the most vile but also the most beautiful book I have ever read. I will most likely read it a second time before I move onto something else. With his writing style it is very easy to miss things, so I am sure I wont be disappointed. His dark humor also makes it one of the funniest books I have ever read.
