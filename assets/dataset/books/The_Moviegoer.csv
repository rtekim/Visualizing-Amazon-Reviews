Employed as a seller of investment services, Binx lives an exceedingly dull life: &#34;For years now I have had no friends. I spend my entire time working, making money, going to movies and seeking the company of women&#34;. The novel leads us through his affairs with his secretaries and his family's attempt to save mentally ill cousin Kate.<br /><br />THE MOVIEGOER is narrated in first person, and Binx Bolling stands aloof from the world around him, rather like other alienated protagonists of the 20th century (Camus' L'ETRANGER, etc). The rather mundane adulteries and family turmoil he deals in or with are combined with his &#34;search&#34; for something more out there. As the title suggests, Bolling enjoys going to the movies, but this plays much less a role in the book than one might expect.<br /><br />The book is really interesting only for its ethnographic colour: New Orleans at mid-century, complicated race relations, even a glimpse at Chicago. However, there is no consistency in the narration: Percy jarringly shifts from conventional narration (even making Bolling initially sound like a simpleton) to more complex, avant-garde effects. The local colour is at times too intense: a key part of the novel depends on a reference to an early 20th-century comic script that is nowadays utterly forgotten, and references to forgotten film stars of the era require so much Googling that it gets in the way of reading.<br /><br />I was attracted to this book becaue it won the National Book Award in 1961 and Terrence Malick considered a film adaption, but I was ultimately disappointed.

However I found the novel to be boring and the characters to lack anything that might make them interesting or admirable. The story centers around Binx Bolling (also referred to as Jack) who is living in Gentilly, a middle class suburb of New Orleans in the 1950’s. He is a stockbroker and about to turn 30. Bolling is irresponsible and immature preferring to chase women and go to movies rather than face the responsibilities of life. Much of the action involves his interactions with his relatives, particularly his Aunt Emily and cousin Kate. Two quotes from the novel give a good indication of the moral tone of the novel. The first is from Bolling:  “Money is a good counterpoise to beauty, Beauty, the quest for beauty alone is a whoredom. Ten years ago I pursued beauty and gave no thought to money. I listened to the lovey tones of Mahler and felt a sickness in my very soul. Now I pursue money and on the whole feel better.”  The second is from Aunt Emily: “I will also plead guilty to another charge. The charge is that people belong to my class think they’re better than other people. You’re damn right we’re better. We’re better because we do not shirk our obligations either to ourselves or to others. We do not whine. We do not organize a minority group and blackmail the government.”<br /><br />Walker is a good writer. But the people he writes about in this novel are not worth caring about.

These feelings happen periodically; other times, he feels normal or hits on ways to fasten himself to the time and place in which he lives. There are other themes and aspects of this novel: (1) the mental fragility to the point of insanity of the woman Kate, some kind of relation perhaps a stepsister, whom he eventually marries; (2)a habit of hiring as secretaries in his small brokerage office only women he finds attractive and eventually makes a play for (is this sexual harrassment? is he being unfair?); and (3) the Louisiana setting and its class and racial overtones.

As unattractive as Binx Bolling is to you, your search is that unattractive to others.<br /><br />Is Binx's search real or is it an excuse?  He could be tackling the hardest question or he could be using it as an excuse for his movie going and secretary chasing.  The existential crisis is a perfect trap.  The first step is the easiest - realizing many people are fooled into thinking their lives have meaning.  Binx is quick to rejects other's beliefs - southern aristocracy or religion.  Then the trap: He can deconstruct anything, but he has nothing to replace it with. If you can't find anything meaningful to do, you might as well enjoy a meaningless diversion.<br /><br />So what is the answer to the search? Frankl flips the question around.  \\""What can you expect from life?\\"" becomes \\""What does life expect from you?\\""  It is a clever way of saying quite the search; do work, help your fellow man.

I don't remember exactly why I liked it so much the first time, but this time around it felt very self-absorbed and simplistic (and I must say whiny).  I kept thinking I was missing something, but it never got any better.  There is a split in the novel and within the two main characters, Kate and Binx, between their \\""malaise\\"" and the \\""pretense of living\\"". At least, that's what I would call it.  And the characters can never move beyond either of those two positions. It's rather depressing really (and not surprisingly, they are rather depressed as well). Unlike a novel where you feel like the characters are really struggling, these characters seem more to be wallowing in their privilege, unable or unwilling to ever get out and do anything.    There are moments of interest when Binx explains that he is a wonderer with regards to religion and can't really adopt any position--but he never goes anywhere with that and I just felt like yeah, and now what?

Perhaps like other existential works of this era (the book was written in 1961 when there was quite a bit of that going around) Percy examines the meaninglessness of life, but the examination does not lead to any epiphanies (at least not for this reader).  It just wallows in itself, going nowhere.  I do wonder what made it win the national book award. Perhaps it is the weaving of the language (which has a peculiar southern sensibility that is almost Faulkneresque in its weighty solemnity) that makes the novel worthy of that award.    The title refers to the main characters fascination with movies, but the movies just seem to provide a place for him to go and wonder but again, nothing particularly interesting ever arises from these trips.

Binx has only a few memories of his father and of his brother Scott, who died when Binx was a small boy. After these two deaths, Binx's mother, a nurse with a common background, marries into the down-market Smith family and produces six children. Binx sees his mother and half-siblings irregularly. But he does go to the movies frequently, where he enjoys the romantic vision of life presented in Hollywood films. These also divert his attention from the angst in his life, where he feels conflict between high and low family styles and doctor/dollar career alternatives and is haunted by death.<br /><br />Meanwhile, tragedy seems to pursue Kate Cutrer, Binx's cousin, who is (apparently) an orphan. In her case, Kate survives an automobile accident that kills her fianc&eacute;. This releases feelings of both guilt and relief in Kate, who was not emotionally comfortable in the bourgeois world of her former fianc&eacute;.

It now seems that Percy is remembered more for midwifing \\""Confederacy\\"" than he is for his own fiction.  That's an unfortunate twist of fate, because Percy's own fiction is first-rate.  THE MOVIEGOER was his first novel, and to my mind it is a better and more-enduring novel than \\""Confederacy\\"".  (For what it's worth, it did win the National Book Award in 1962.)<br /><br />Binx Bollinger is from an upper-class Southern family.  He is thirty years old, a Korean War veteran, single but genteelly randy, and an unambitious stockbroker in a suburb of New Orleans.  He also is alienated.  Though not an obvious social misfit (like the 30-year-old Ignatius J. Reilly from \\""Confederacy\\""), Binx is possessed with an existential malaise.  Throughout the novel, he is engaged in \\""the search\\"" - the constant attempt to avoid being \\""sunk in the everydayness\\"" of life.  Oddly, that quest sometimes takes the form of submersing himself in the details of a place or encounter - to be Somewhere rather than Anywhere.  But Binx manages to cope.  He is not obviously unhinged or borderline suicidal, like Kate Cutrer, his cousin and occasional soulmate.<br /><br />Thus, THE MOVIEGOER is yet another exercise in the literary existentialism that marked the middle third of the Twentieth Century.  For an epigraph Percy quotes from Kierkegaard, and the novel might be thought of as Camus in the Deep South.  (Percy once said that he felt closer to Camus than to Faulkner, who lived only one hundred miles away and whom he and his friend Shelby Foote had occasionally visited in their youth.)  But THE MOVIEGOER does not wallow in despair or ennui.

As a whole, the novel also provides a rich and dead-on portrayal of upper-class New Orleans society of its time.

Do not read this review until after you have finished the book and considered it for yourself.    If fifteen people read and reviewed The Moviegoer, they could create fifteen different descriptions of it. If one person read it a year later, he could write a completely different review of it from the one he wrote the year before. It all depends on what is emphasized, the southernness, New Orleans, the story of ancestries, the blacks and whites or the relationship of the story to Kierkegard. There are so many aspects of the novel to consider.  This is a funny book, an endearing book. The writing is gasp inducing gorgeous.  This is a book of its time, post Becket, the existentialists, and the absurdists. It follows a half century of the realization of the great scale of the horror man is capable of perpetrating on his fellow men. Salinger has been writing about teenage angst. Yet, while it is so relevant to the late nineteen fifties, Binx's story finds resonance to this day.   It is  funny to read how Binx plots to make his secretary fall in love with him. The descriptions of movies and their use to him and how he makes a movie house more real are wonderful. Look on page 216 for a line that gives the reader pause on the subject of the title.   Binx's elaborate descriptions of the components of his search make up a good portion of the story. Yet every time he is with Aunt Emily, he either can't talk about it or it seems to be smaller in importance. And in the face of Aunt Emily's big rant at him in part five, he understands that he is finished with his search.   His search, he tells us, is to forestall the everydayness; in his head he criticizes other people who are satisfied with ordinary lives. All the while he is thinking and working out the details of his search, he is carrying out normal activity and conversation, and no one having discourse with him, knows about his interior life. The only one who knows it all is his fellow mentally discomfited, Kate. In the end, he will accept everydayness as he takes care of Kate.   It is a great theme in a lot of literature, the concept of coming home. Ulysses, The Wizard of Oz, Pippin, the musical, where he realizes he is not extraordinary and will settle as man, woman, child in an every day existence, and Candide, who after his upsetting adventures will join with his love and just make his garden grow. And so it is here. The epilogue may be one of the most gorgeous things I have ever read. Tender, quiet, accepting; Kate and Binx will make it, I believe.  The book is described as an existential novel. What kind of existential protagonist loves his job, loves making money, and goes to great lengths to protect his clients' accounts? What kind of existential character loves others, his half brother, Lonnie and Aunt Emily? He even has a kind of love for minor characters like Mr. Kinsella and the ladies in ticket booths. And Kate and Binx have a kind of love for each other.  This book doesn't seem to be an existential novel as much as a rebuke to the existentialists. Walker Percy seems to be saying to them, \\""Come off it. Get with the program. It's enough already.\\""  Aunt Emily as she scolds Binx in Part Five represents this.  To discuss this book and leave out Aunt Emily is to forget someone central to it all. For this reader she is most important of all for Binx. It is his love of her, he even enjoys it when she scolds him, that keeps him from going off the deep end. And her brilliantly written big rebuke at the end is what saves him from himself. One is reminded of the biblical verse that says now I am become a man and must put away childish things.  One is reminded of another biblical verse when the book is over. And now abideth faith, hope and charity (love) but the greatest of these is charity.  Lonnie's Faith is pure and perfect. The scenes between Lonnie and Binx are utterly exquisite. Binx couldn't care less about religion, yet his love of Lonnie makes him happy and interested as Lonnie describes his faith to him. And when Lonnie tells Binx he is taking his communion for Binx, that is a spectacular moment.  Hope? Is there hope for Binx? I think so and I think Walker Percy thinks so, too.  And, as has already been noted, love runs throughout the novel.  I don't think this is an existential novel. I think it is a Christian Morality Tale.",2010-09-25

Percy had reached the limits of where the elusive and technocratic language of philosophy could take him. In this way, [[ASIN:0375701966 The Moviegoer]] is a proclamation that it is the novel, art rather than science, which is immortal. Only art could take Percy's ideas to a place philosophy could not.<br /><br />And in [[ASIN:0375701966 The Moviegoer]], Percy makes his reader wonder why it took the author so long to adopt a form in which he displays the genius of a master craftsman. Like in the passage where Binx describes his insomniac father as, \\""blundering through the patio furniture, the Junior Jets and the Lone Ranger pup tents, dragging his Saskatchewan sleeping bag like the corpse of a dead hope.\\"" Or like when Percy evokes the sad majesty of a city evening: \\""Station wagons and Greyhounds and diesel rigs rumble toward the Gulf Coast, their fabulous tail-lights glowing like rubies in the darkening east.\\""<br /><br />Percy's evocation of the evening hour reminded me of walking the streets of Amsterdam, when the inhabitants of the tall apartments along the \\""Gentlemen's Canal\\"" have yet to draw their apartment's curtains, and light pours out of their apartment and reflects on the old streets and the dark surface of the canal. That brief moment of time when the day teeters on the edge of total darkness, and radiates with an autumnal brilliance.<br /><br />At its core, Percy's prose is also inescapably southern. Unlike William Faulkner's south, though, Percy's south is more localized. \\""Yet it was here in the Tivoli that I first discovered place and time, tasted it like okra.\\"" Here Percy serves up a characteristic synesthesia, blending in his own marvelous way- abstract philosophy with grimy, tasty, tangible Creole food. Faulkner's south is the mystical \\""Yoknapatawpha County\\"", which is southern, but non-specific; Percy presents a New Orleans we all know and can touch and taste.<br /><br />Binx Bolling is an existential wanderer, alienated from the herds. It is in the herds that Binx sees the manifestation of humanity's worst sins: boredom. For Binx, worse than death is a certain death-in-life, wherein people speak like mindless \\""automatons\\"", repeating rather than choosing their words. To the soul-searcher philosopher, such people locked in \\""everydayness\\"" are worse than dead, for it is \\""everydayness\\"" that mocks the moviegoer.<br /><br />Binx finds the world romantic, entrancing, teeming. But everydayness, repetition and routine, pull Binx down into a vortex of \\""malaise\\"". As a seer, though, Binx is able to intermittently jump out of the vortex to contemplate \\""the strange fact of one's own invincible apathy\\"". Binx despises the clueless and willfully blind, all of whom have succumbed to Binx's sworn enemy of everydayness. The death-in-life of the herd tortures Binx, but it is ultimately through this awareness- tortuous as it may be- that Binx finds his only chance at flight to a better, more complete place.<br /><br />Binx is the anti-hero Percy had previously tried to anoint indirectly through his philosophy's central ideas. That is- Binx is the moviegoer. A moviegoer is someone like Binx, who is apolitical, agnostic, despises everydayness, embraces pain and disaster as a way out of malaise, loves movies and art because they are unpredictable and new life forms.

Not to be onto something is to be in despair.\\"" The enigmatic quote becomes a bit clearer when illuminated by the novel's epigraph, courtesy of Christian philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard: \\""The specific character of despair is precisely this: it is unaware of being despair.\\""<br /><br />\\""The Moviegoer\\"" charts Binx's growing awareness of his own despair - a character arc mirroring that of Antoine Roquentin in Jean Paul Sartre's foundational work of Existentialism, \\""Nausea\\"". Percy, steeped in the particular language and atmosphere of Southern America, nonetheless owes an intellectual debt to Europe. In tone and action (or non-action), Binx Bolling's closest literary equivalent is Merseault, the anti-hero of Camus' \\""The Stranger.\\"" Both protagonists are sunk in unthinking ennui, experiencing life moment-to-moment, despairing of the Big Picture yet unable to pinpoint the exact nature of their despair. Binx watches his life drift by with the passivity of an inveterate moviegoer.<br /><br />Binx's detachment is given an appropriately distant treatment by Percy. His matter-of-fact prose style reads like a wry Hemingway. Percy had been a practicing physician when, at the age of forty-six, \\""The Moviegoer\\"" became his first published novel. His training as a physician at least partially explains his diagnostic approach to fiction. Percy's analysis of Binx is tantamount to an autopsy: a thorough dissection of something already dead. He has a doctor's professional distance and keen, unsentimental eye. His unblinking observations of human behavior border on the cruel in their calculating objectivity. How many books have you read in which the \\""hero,\\"" knowing that his landlady is out, proceeds to give her dog \\""a tremendous kick in the ribs and send him yowling\\""?<br /><br />Where Percy breaks from his existential European brethren is in his deep-seated Roman Catholicism. I reviewed this novel for [...] but that fact is somewhat misleading since the Catholic element is not overt in the novel--it is, in fact, almost subterranean--and I wouldn't want to deter anyone from reading the book out of fear that Percy wrote a theological tract. Nonetheless, the themes of sin, penance, and redemption thread through the narrative. The action of the novel culminates on Ash Wednesday, a holy day that marks the beginning of the Lenten season, a day when man is reminded \\""that thou art dust and unto dust thou shalt return.\\"" Perhaps this is the intersection of Percy's existentialism and his Catholicism. Both worldviews contend that man is dust, but Catholicism offers the promise of a life redeemed by Christ, thus becoming a gift from God of incalculable value. In those terms, the drama of life is the interior struggle between good and evil, between the desire to follow Christ and the desire to follow one's own ephemeral pleasures.<br /><br />Binx himself would probably object to that characterization. \\""I could never make head or tail of God,\\"" he confesses, almost as an afterthought. \\""The proofs of God's existence may have been true for all I know, but it didn't make the slightest difference. If God himself had appeared to me, it would have changed nothing.\\"" Binx finds his spirituality in cinema.  He observes another young man's chance encounter with William Holden, star of classics like \\""Sunset Boulevard\\"" and \\""Bridge on the River Kwai.\\"" When Holden pats the fellow's shoulder in a gesture of camaraderie, Bolling thinks, \\""the boy has done it! He has won title to his own existence...\\"" Binx has attributed to Holden what Christians attribute to God--the ability to affirm one's existence. Thus, for Binx, the movie theater has replaced the church as a place of worship.<br /><br />Just as movies are a twentieth century phenomenon, Percy's novel offers an apt metaphor for the twentieth century's spiritual malaise.

Nothing much happens in it, and the lead character is one of the most thoroughly unlikable people traipsing through modern fiction. And yet Walker Percy manages to make this novel compelling in practically every way it can be through the immense power of his writing. That this slim novel won the 1961 National Book Award was no accident, nor is the fact that it survives today as a modern classic.<br /><br />Binx Bolling is a New Orleans stockbroker in the late 1950s suffering an existential crisis. He spends his existence having loveless affairs with his string of secretaries and going to the movies, seeing the idealized version of life on screen and comparing it with his own relatively useless existence. He sees his family members through the most jaundiced of eyes, and never passes up an opportunity to belittle them in the internal monologue that comprises the text of this book. Binx is convinced that he can find the meaning his life is supposed to have, and starts off on a classic quest to find it. The problem is that he goes about it in the most wrongheaded of ways; the result is a classic tragedy laced with pointed black humor. The best part of the whole thing is that Binx himself doesn't see the tragedy inherent in his actions; he just tries to approach the quest the same way he approaches everything else, by muddling through.<br /><br />The book is slow, deliberate, giving us time to get to know Binx and the principal players in his family despite its brevity.

If that is what good character development is, Mr. (Dr.) Percy has done it well...can't say that this is a great book, can't say that is an easy read, kind of a cross between Faulkner and Wolfe, more to the Wolfe side, but a book worth reading. Lots of good dialogue and great, great discriptions of New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast of the fifties and sixties.  Ultimately this is a story of the struggle of a life facing change, of what to hold on to, of what to let go,told from the perspective of a 29-30 year old young man living in the changing South.

These all left a strong impression on me, and probably not always a healthy one, considering Gide especially.  Just the same I think they presented a well-rounded introduction to existentialism: Gide as the early precurser, \\""The Stranger\\"" as the eminent example, and Percy as the late American answer to this literature that mostly came from another continent.  And it is Percy that has stayed with me the most.     Percy was in touch with the strand of thought that more or less originated with existentialism; absurdism, and was profoundly aware of the contradictions and disjointed nature of modern life.  I believe through his life he sought a healing, or a unity in what seemed un-whole and unclear in our modern world.  His solutions to the problems of life in a universe of billions of vibrating and floating particles having nothing to do with each other except proximity, usually were something along the lines of compassion.  He was not a religious writer, but wrote on spiritual matters and had respect for religion.      I recently attended a lecture where the speaker, a prominent clergyman of the \\""intellectual\\"" sort, mentioned that getting on the train late at night and seeing a skinny, bedraggled college youth with a backpack reading \\""Either-Or\\"" like it was the most important thing in the world; the sight of that in the middle of the night on the train brought comfort to him, and he knew that all is still well in the world.  For my part, that brought considerably less comfort to me than it does to see a young person reading a copy of \\""The Moviegoer.\\"" (Although neither reassure me that all is still well, but anyway.)   Although if you are in the skinny-college-student-Kierkergard-reading days, I might recommend Percy's \\""The Last Gentleman\\"" instead. Perhapsless artful than \\""The Moviegoer,\\"" but makes its point more emphatically.      \\""The Moviegoer\\"" struck me harder back in my own college days than my other three writers from my dad's bookshelf.  And neither Camus, Sartre, Gide, certainly not Kierkergard, could put such a firm grip on my imagination.  There is more than one reason, but I think the metaphor of being a spectator in one's own life, a central theme in Percy's writing and especially in \\""The Moviegoer,\\"" is one that we can all identify with at some time.      I recommend this novel especially, where Percy's basic motif of the strangely detached first-person narrator first becomes the central voice in a book. (This book is mostly about why he is detached, and how he can re-attach, and why this is desirable -- I am sounding very Percy-like here, he he.) He perceived this strange detachment as a new, modern condition of human life and also a common one, and so this is a good novel to get a grasp on the \\""essential Walker Percy.\\"" The \\""Moviegoer\\"" theme is just a more explicit statement of the overall emotionally remote condition of the absurdist world, and Percy almost always addressed that state in every book.  His writing is a thoughtful, meditative answer to existentialism; life not as a man who turns into a cockroach (Kafka), or who kills a stranger in a fit of boredom (Camus); but rather as a man who can't break into his own life with a crowbar.  And I guess I want to emphasize that the theme shared with Camus, this estrangement from one's own life expressed in \\""The Stranger,\\"" is examined in \\""The Moviegoer.\\"" Although as with other Percy novels, this examination, or perhaps intellectualization, of one's own condition is possibly part of the condition(?).  Maybe the absurdist angle becomes pretty obvious here.      In a nutshell, Percy was not a philosopher like Camus, but a compassionate novelist who sometimes waxed philosophical, so to speak.  His novels were not so much expositions of ideas like \\""The Stranger,\\"" but he had some commanding ideas and explored them through several books, and was mostly concerned with right living, and with chivalry, manliness, compassion, and affairs of the heart.  He was also a novelist with respect for Anglo-American traditions and culture, and perhaps one of his stronger influences philosophically as a counterweight to the existential would be William James.      You want newer American writing in this vein (generally), try  Douglas Coupland or J. Robert Lennon, two younger authors and somewhat of the same absurdist roots, a la Talking Heads.  I just finished \\""Mailman\\"" by the latter, and it is very much like an existentialist novel set in the new century, but includes an afterlife (that's a no-no to existentialists!  Baaaaad!)     And for you college kids looking to write an essay by reading Amazon reviews, I congratulate you for being so clever and curse you for having this resource I never had, and if you feel the need, listen to \\""Passenger\\"" by Iggy Pop (or Siouxie and the Banshees, who made more money from it) or to \\""Quadrophenia\\"" by The Who, which will give you a \\""lite\\"" version of some of what Percy is putting forth here, just to give you a feel for it.

At a certain point I couldn't shake from myself a comparison between this novel and \\""On the Road\\"" but substitute movies for jazz.

I'm not sure, yet, whether that is a flaw in Percy's work or whether there is something telling and true about it.  There is a sense in which Percy is working on a bigger scale -- attempting to identify symptoms of the human condition that are only indirectly hit upon in On the Road.<br /><br />It is, as others have noted, an \\""existentialist\\"" novel to be compared with the works of Camus and Dostoevsky and other European writers -- but with an ease and simplicity that is distinctively American.

It is not that it is a bad or good book, simply one wouldn't remember within a few weeks of reading it.  Sure, it has its high points, but I think the main problem lies within the central core of the novel.  This is essentially a novel without a real story to anchor it down.  <br /> <br />The Movie-goer opens...well lets see, I'm having a hard time remember that as well.  I believe it opens with a description of our main character in the story, Binx Bolling.  Binx is the narrator of this tale and he starts of by telling us a bit about himself.   He is a former Korean War veteran and currently he is a prospering stock broker.  He is very ordinary, has a girlfriend once in a while, likes going to the movies, and thinks a great deal about the meaning of life and religion. <br /> <br />Binx also has an aunt in which he is quite close to.  His aunt shelters a depressed young stepdaughter named Katie.  Katie is a wreck suffering from mental instability.  Binx's aunt asks him to befriend her in an attempt to help her recover from her illness. <br /> <br />The novel spans the length of one week and it takes place during Carnival in New Orleans.  During this time we get a full share of Binx and his wandering mind that thinks up random, dreamlike thoughts.  During this time he will fall for his secretary Sharon and for the depressed Katie at the same time.  Binx has a tough time understanding himself and his existence during this period.  Binx is from an affluent family in Louisiana and a good portion of this Carnival week is spent interacting with them.  Eventually the novel will come to a climax of sorts, and Binx will be able to figure out which woman he truly loves, at the same time trying to resolve some of the turmoil within him.   <br /> <br />That is about all there is to it.  Percy does have an interesting writing style.  I enjoyed the originality of the four main characters in the novel: Binx, Sharon, Katie, and the aunt.  Each one has a different, unique, and for the most part unlikable personality, but for the most part they feel like real people.  The supporting cast, such as Binx's mother, brothers, uncle, etc. is completely cardboard and forgettable.  Percy does show signs of talent at times.  His description of places, times, and events can be told well and with clarity.  Yet, I didn't like the whole structure of the novel.  It ranged from straight forward story telling to stream of conscious.  It was a mix that didn't work for me.  It tended to wander and meander too much and I felt my mind often drifting along with it. <br /> <br />Also, don't be fooled by the title.  While Binx does enjoy movies, the novel is not really about them.  A few movies are described and on occasion Binx relates the dreamlike world of movies to his own confused, surreal world going on inside of him.  As a whole the book really isn't about anything though.  Sure you have some good characters and nice descriptive moments, but what is the point?  I thought about that often while reading The Movie-goer.  It didn't really seem to be about anything. <br /> <br />Because of that, I can't really recommend The Movie-goer.  It claims to be a philosophical novel, due to the impression that it gave me by reading some other reviews on it. It didn't stir any deep thoughts in my head though.  It wavers too much to have any real philosophical power.  As I said before there is no anchor to hold it down, it just keeps floating this way and that.  Occasionally it lands and then it sails off again.  It is hard to explain, but if you read it you will know what I am talking about.  The Movie-goer is a perfect example of one of those books that one neither likes nor dislikes, but instead enters into the forgettable realms of in-between. <br /> <br />Grade: C+",2005-06-14

To put it mildly, I was bored. But I persevered and finished it. This novel has minimal plot and characters that you do not come to love. Binx Bolling,age 29, is wandering though life in a pre-midlife crisis. He has a respectable job(a broker) with a reasonable income but he lacks a purpose. He goes to movies for pleasure and seduces his secretaries.  <br /> <br />The setting is interesting-New Orleans in the 1950s. The whole novel takes place over a few days around the Mardi Gras. Binx suffers from malaise. His cousin Kate exhibits bouts of mania and melancholy and would no doubt now be considered to be a manic-depressive. She is suicidal. She lost her financee in an automobile accident some time before the novel begins. She and Binx have a curious relationship which culminates in sex in the latter portion of the novel.  <br /> <br />Just as it seems that Binx is breaking out of malaise and his detached-observer status, Binx answers a summons by his patron, Aunt Emily, and returns hastily to New Orleans where he is given a good lecture by the aunt. He decided to marry Kate so as to help manage her moods and , after having resisted his aunt's entreaties for years to study for a profession, Binx yields and heads off to medical school. <br /> <br />The only characters who elicit some empathy are Binx's mother and his half-brother and-sisters. They live a lowerclass but seemingly more real life style.  <br /> <br />The driving force behind this book is existentialism. As one of my colleagues put it, it is Camus Lite. Walker Percy lost both his grandfather and father to suicide, and his mother in an automobile accident. He trained as a doctor, became ill with tuberculosis, did a pschyoanalytic residency and became enamoured with several existentialist philosophers.

He spends his days as a stock broker and his evenings going to the movies and pursuing one girl or another (usually his secretaries).  But since returning after an honorable discharge from the Korean War (he was shot in the shoulder), Binx feels disconnected from his world, confused by the New Orleans society that his Aunt wishes he would join.  Just before his thirtieth birthday, Binx's faith in life is rejuvenated by an epiphany that he calls the \\""search.\\""  What he is searching for Binx can not articulate, but it gives his life new purpose. <br />  <br />While Binx seems to move in his word without interacting, watching it as he watches his movies, it would be wrong to think of him merely as an existentialist.  In fact, he more closely resembles Jake Barnes, from Hemmingway's The Sun Also Rises--an injured soldier moving through life listlessly, having a close but not consummated relationship with an equally distraught woman.  For Binx, the woman is his cousin through marriage, Kate Cutrer, a suicidal disaffected young girl.  But unlike Barnes, Binx, living in the middle of the twentieth century, must suffer not just from his war memories, but from the constant reminder that the war is never ending--the threat of an atomic bomb.  And so, Binx has his movies. <br />  <br />Binx explains his moviegoing as such: \\""Nowadays when a person lives somewhere, in a neighborhood, the place is not certified for him.  More than likely he will live there sadly and the emptiness which is inside him will expand until it evacuates the entire neighborhood.  But if he sees a movie which shows his very neighborhood, it becomes possible for him to live, for a time at least, as a person who is Somewhere and not Anywhere.\\"" <br />  <br />Percy, like all good Southern writers, is a storyteller.  Or rather, he tells a story about a people who are storytellers, and all of the people who populate The Moviegoer certainly are storytellers of the first order.  They seem to spend all of their time talking of the past, or spinning webs of the possible future.  This gives the whole of the book a sepia tone of memory, which is softer than Binx's first person detachment. <br />  <br />Initially, the vast number of characters that are introduced, and all of them have names, and all of them have relatives, living or dead, who also have names, can be confusing and make the book difficult to get into.  But it is well worth sticking with it.  As the story progresses, the main characters become apparent, and any ancillary characters are introduced clearly as we see them. <br />  <br />Percy has a deft ability to distill deep thoughts--about the nature of life, about society, about people--into simple, exquisite truths that never feel hokey or forced.  And his people are vivid, their interactions complicated and real. <br />  <br />I highly recommend The Moviegoer.

So, obviously the literati consider this novel great, and this fact alone should motivate those interested in great literature to read this book.  However, in my case, the novel did not meet my expectations for one so honored.  I did find it entertaining and substantive in its observations and perspectives on life.  And the seeker who has not yet found his or her path will probably enjoy its philosophical aspects.  But, to me, the quality of the prose was uneven.  Sometimes the language and description was brilliant, and the observations on life profound; and at other times the language was unclear, perhaps even awkward, and the observations were trite.  The story line also was uneven; it sputtered and started and stopped and changed direction, making it somewhat disjointed; but that's a lot like life itself and I suppose it was by design.<br />Further, the novel often struck me as a little odd both in word choice and in the perspectives and opinions expressed through the characters.  This oddness was sometimes funny, sometimes piqued my reading interest, and other times was just plain odd.

I get to thinking about her and old Eddie re-examining their values.  Yes, true.  Values.  Very good.  And then I can't help wondering to myself:  why does she talk as if she were dead?

I'm sure there is much symbolism and meaning to be divined from this novel (as is true of most good literature); but that meaning is not unique.

This is evident not only in this bleak but beautiful novel, but also in his book, Lost in the Cosmos, and his other works of fiction, which mostly deal with modern man trying to live in an age of physical and psychological dislocation. The main character in Percy's first and perhaps greatest novel is Binx Bolling, a stock broker and deal maker who cruises through life on intellectual and spiritual automatic pilot.

A fiance of Kate dies in a car accident, which she survives. In the face of such loss, they are on emotional idle.

He indulges in the trappings of the silver screen because that's where &quot;happiness costs so little.&quot;  Our protagonist, Binx Bolling, often loses himself in the realm of life imitates art.  He likes to assume the screen personna of Gregory Peck and fantasizes actresses to become his secretary.  Most of all, he thinks there is nothing better than having the likes of William Holden in person lunching in town and looking for a match.  For that lucky person who offers the match to Holden, he would be &quot;certified&quot; as having being someone in the cosmos.  On the cusp of his thirtieth birthday, however, Binx Bolling realizes by relying on and acting out the cinematic reality is faith misplaced.  He decides to search out what's real and true to him (Kierkegaardian existentialism says the highest truth existing is the subjectivity truth).<br />Since it's first publication in 1961, &quot;The Moviegoer&quot; has become a standard reference in academia, philosophical commentaries, and Sunday sermons.  There are many ways to parse, dissect, and critique this classic Walker Percy's work. If the prospective reader can relate to this pivotal passage, he should read the book. Here in this excerpt,  Binx Bolling confides to the reader what he thinks about his search:<br />&quot;Until recent years, I read only fundamental' books, that is, key books on key subjects, such as War and Peace , the novel of novels ; A Study of History, the solution of the problem of time; Schroedinger's What is Life?, Einstein's The Universe as I see It , and such. During those years I stood outside the universe and sought to understand it. I lived in my room as an Anyone living Anywhere and read fundamental books and only for diversion took walks around the neighborhood and saw an occasional movie. Certainly it did not matter to me where I was when I read such a book as The Expanding Universe. The greatest success of this enterprise, which I call my vertical search, came one night when I sat in a hotel room in Birmingham and read a book called The Chemistry of Life . When I finished it, it seemed to me that the main goals of my search were reached or were in principle reachable, whereupon I went out and saw a movie called &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; which was itself very good. A memorable night. The only difficulty was that though the universe had been disposed of, I myself was left over. There I lay in my hotel room with my search over yet still obliged to draw one breath and then the next. But now I have undertaken a different kind of search, a horizontal search. As a consequence, what takes place in my room is less important. What is important is what I shall find when I leave my room and wander in the neighborhood. Before, I wandered as a diversion. Now I wander seriously and sit and read as a diversion.&quot;  <br />Certainly this multifaceted and edifying story is well worth the reading.  The fuel that propels this story is Percy's unique narrative style in using both present and past tenses.  Perhaps his medical training or his three years spent in psychoanalysis during his residency had had an influence.  At any rate, as the first-person narrator, Binx Bolling's present tense narration draws the reader close in &quot;real time&quot; and be intimate with the former in thought and action.  When Bolling finds it necessary to digress or to fill-in the reader on the particulars of the past, he tells it in past tense.  But Percy's writing is so good, the two tenses blurred as one.  Aspiring writers who struggle with writing in present or past tense should take note.  <br />Truth and great literature perhaps do exist.  If not, Walker Percy's &quot;The Moviegoer&quot; can point the way to those who seek one or the other. Or both.<br />I have one complaint about the book though.  Binx Bolling and his fiance, Kate Cutrer, had discussed the possibility of moving to my hometown, Modesto, California, after they married.

I had to attempt reading it twice.  The first time I think I came in with different expectations as to what the book was really about and had an adverse reaction to the main character, Binx.  I don't come from southern culture and have never been to New Orleans, and I found myself disliking just about every character I encountered.  Binx was creepy and disconnected and selfish, and seemed to have an opinion or social box for and abouy every person he came into contact with.

I had to stop reading.<br />I left it for a year, and determined not to be beaten and also convinced that I was not &quot;getting it&quot;, I gave it another try.  I made it through and found a whole new world of beauty in the words.  I was struck again and again by the unexpectedness of Percy's descriptions of places, thoughts, and emotions; meaning they were unusual and perfect and consistently made me think and smile.  I still found Binx to be creepy and selfish initially, but I hung in there to see his eventual transformation.  There is also a good deal of humor that I missed the first time around.  It also helped me tremendously to read with a &quot;southern accent&quot; going on in my head the whole time.<br />One other point that I find cool--about halfway through it hit me how difficult it must be to write an entire novel from the first person, from only one person's point of view, and keep it interesting and deep, which Percy does extraordinarily well.

So when he uses one of these symbols as a metaphor for an idea, I can't understand the metaphor because I have no idea what the symbol is.<br />Other than that minor quibble, though, the book is very thought-provoking, beautifully (and humorously) written, and it's got a beautiful depiction of the deep south (what can I say, I'm obsessed with New Orleans).",2001-04-17

You leave the theatre and are yanked back into ordinary life. It's almost like waking from an especially harrowing dream and finding yourself back in your own bed. The streets are all the same, but somehow you have temporarily been revived from the relentless predictability of your everyday life and everything looks a little more promising. For the time being life looks fresh. The same can be said of near disasters and other extraordinary events. Disruptions often jar things loose, cause us to reevaluate and at least temporarily reorder our values and priorities. Some cherish predictability while others are brought to despair by it.<br />Walker Percy's Binx Bolling is a moviegoer and a harmless womanizer. Binx is surrounded by Southern gentility and he himself, an accomplished gentleman, is comfortable in polite society. Yet Binx the moviegoer is a free agent...an independent observer. The absurdity of every day life is a curiosity to Bolling. Percy provides us with a thoroughly agreeable escapist, but not one who escapes out of weakness, but rather one whose intellectual detachment requires harmless distraction to remain engaged.<br />I cannot recommend this work to readers who enjoy books with intriguing plots and lively action and who are turned off by nuance and philosophical exploration. There is an elegant subtlety to this work that is both dry and fresh. The book contains many memorable scenes and is spare yet precise in its descriptive power.  There are few books that I have read that take be by surprise the way this one has, not by a trick ending, but by revealing a deeper measure of some aspect of character that I thought I had completely understood, but had not. It's hard for me to describe the acceleration of fascination I experienced towards the conclusion of The Movie-goer and I haven't seen it mentioned in other reviews. The power of this work blindsided me with bothsurprise and delight. The moviegoer left me remembering vaguely important and long ago forgotten ideas and left me hungry to read all of Mr. Percy's other novels. I highly recommend it.",2001-02-13

(Not being well-read or trained in such areas I found no such theme to comment on.) One Percy scholar even said that the philosophical foundations for this novel were laid in Percy's essay \\""The Man on the Train: Three Existential Modes\\"".  A train is obviously prominent in \\""The Moviegoer\\"".

Binx Bolling idles through life on some kind of search the target of which is never made clear.  As he happens along he notices malaise all about him and despair.  Binx himself is in a kind of funk and the character Kate suffers a more serious depression.  A quote from Kierkegaard  in the front of the book signals the importance of this theme: \\""...the specific character of despair is precisely this: it is unaware of being despair.\\""<br />When he is not selling stocks, Binx spends his time in pursuit of female company.  Binx says: \\""For some years now I have had no friends.  I spend my entire time working, making money, going to movies, and seeking the company of women.\\""<br />The most lyrical sections of the novel are where Percy describes the various targets of Binx Bolling's lust: \\""She is a strapping girl but by no means too big, done up head to toe in cellophane, the hood pushed back to show a helmet of glossy black hair.  She is magnificent with her split tooth and her Price Val bangs split on her forehead.\\""  One's heart flutters as the girl gets off the city bus and is forever gone out Bink Bolling's life.<br />Walker Percy's friend and mentor Shelby Foote (they went to school together at UNC) thought that \\""The Moviegoer\\"" had one fault and that \\""it's so big you can't do anything about it\\"".

What I would hope, one  day, to find in the customer reviews of those who have read The Moviegoer  is that it has changed their lives: motivated them to look at the entire  world around them -- and begin to change it for the better, even in little  steps, as Binx does in his movement away from superficiality and the  emptiness of acquiring &quot;things.&quot; He moves away from money and  commercialism to compassion and being able to take care of people.  He  moves from lust to love, from intellectualizing to a desire for genuine  spirituality.

Of course, that was 25+  years ago, but we were reading Updike, Bellow and Cheever, so why not  Percy, too?  It is an English major's dream, out of a certain time but  still so fresh, it's as if Percy's narrator was the first to sense a  malaise in his life and set off on a search for meaning.  The writing is  plummy, elegaic, yet accessible, so one needn't be an English major to  enjoy it.",1999-02-02

The details of its plot and characters aren't so important as the mood it evokes.  Its atmosphere literally seeps into your  pores.

We suffer from a constant need for &quot;newness&quot; to keep us from feeling our  lives are boring or meaningless.  I almost find myself looking for percy's  philosophy in his books rather than reading them carefully.  They are a  little tedious like Faulkner in that they do a lot of scenic description  without a very quick moving plot.  My only other complaint is that it  seemed like he was rewriting a nicer version of Camus' The Stranger.  I  definitely agree with Walker rather than Camus about our hope in this world  though.",1998-11-04
