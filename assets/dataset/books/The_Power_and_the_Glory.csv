The Power and the Glory is regarded as Graham Greene’s masterpiece. The story centers on a priest in 1930’s Mexico during a period of extreme persecution of Catholics. The unnamed priest is an alcoholic who is running from the Red Shirts, a paramilitary organization that is hunting down and killing clerics. As the story unfolds we catch a glimpse of the poverty and despair that was Mexico at that time.  The Whiskey Priest wanders the countryside trying to avoid capture and death. He interacts with a small girl who, innocently, says she will help him. He interacts with a man who he believes will turn him in to the police for the reward. He is captured and put in jail on a charge of smuggling liquor, but then released. He meets a woman with a dead child and goes with her for two days to find a cemetery.  In all of these actions, and others, he is neither hero nor villain. He simply tries to survive and stay true to his beliefs in the face of extreme hostility and danger. By contrast, another priest, Father Jose, renounces his vows in order to save his life. He is in a cemetery when a couple is burying their child and they ask him to say a prayer. Father Jose refuses because he is afraid they will tell and he will be killed.  The Whiskey Priest, by contrast, prays and helps people in spite of the danger. At the end he has the chance to escape to freedom but chooses to go back to try to hear the confession of an American who was also hunted by the police. The man refuses and dies and the priest is arrested. The book proceeds to its inevitable ending.<br /><br />The Power and the Glory raises important questions about humanity and how to live one’s live. The whiskey priest is far from a hero, yet he deals with the difficulties he faces with grace and dignity. This novel is clearly a five star book.	2015-08-30

First published in 1940, Graham Greene's novel pits the justice sought by the Mexican Revolution against the traditional teachings of the Catholic Church.<br /><br />The Church was and remains a conservative force in the Third World and elsewhere, it's typically unspoken alliances with the forces of reactionary repression and exploitation guarantee its continued existence and largely unchallenged influence regarding political issues that can be reckoned in religious terms.  Oft-made decisions to leave worldly matters of justice, fairness, and equity to the profane political realm defined by differences in material and social power serve the status quo well.  In the meantime, the Church nominally restricts itself to the search for eternal salvation through fostering adherence to narrowly construed religious strictures governing personal morality, and the Church is rewarded accordingly.  Who knows, perhaps the Iron Curtain would still be standing if the nations of the Soviet Union had sought an accommodation with the Church.  After all, there is nothing new about ideologically contradictory alliances in pursuit of mutual survival.<br /><br />The Power and the Glory is set in the 1930's, during the long-running Mexican Revolution.  Led by Madero, Villa, Zapata and other still-revered revolutionary heroes, this was an uprising of the Left.  Its proponents were irrepressibly hostile to the traditional paternalistic and grossly inequitable organization of Mexican society. They sought equity and self-determination in the material world, a place of unspeakable poverty and suffering for all but the privileged few, priests and higher Church officials among them.<br /><br />As a result, the revolutionaries sought to abolish religious teachings and practices.  Their efforts were sometimes clumsy and of dubious value, for example requiring that all who had been priests get married, and making wine and other alcoholic beverages illegal.  So much for communion wine.  In addition, however, the Revolution was seeking to eliminate the dissolution and chemically engendered escapism that made many Mexicans unreliable compatriots.<br /><br />As portrayed in The Power and the Glory, the material aims of the Revolution were not even crudely approximated.  Too many of those who ostensibly served the Revolution did so in a perfunctory and self-serving way.  High officials in the military and the national police  were ineffectual, indifferent, and simply corrupt.<br /><br />A conspicuous exception was the young Lieutenant in Las Casas whose spit-and-polish military demeanor betokened a powerful commitment to the Revolution and its aims.  The Lieutenant's hostility to the Church was as strong as one would expect of a politically astute indigenous Mexican of Indian heritage who came of age during a time when the social and cultural wherewithal of Catholicism were in the service of the wealthy elite, completely ignoring the plight of the poor.  The Lieutenant was also, however, a man of intelligence and good judgment who understood that even his nemesis, the so-called Whiskey Priest, was not without inoffensive qualities and posed no real threat to the Revolution.<br /><br />Greene's protagonist, the otherwise unnamed Whiskey Priest, personified the evils of a religious denomination that was protected by the state.  In a perhaps exaggerated form, the Whiskey Priest represented the Catholic Church as the revolutionaries understood it:  corrupt, exploitative, hypocritical, and an enemy of the Mexican people.  The most interesting and wonderfully insightful struggle in Greene's treatment of these revolutionary times occurs within the mind, heart, and soul of the Whiskey Priest.<br /><br />Yes, he is guilty of the sins attributed to him and still more.  As a priest he was no danger to the reactionary regime served by the Church, but he also failed to meet the modestly comforting, even if ultimately self-deceiving, spiritual needs of his parishioners.  He had no political agenda, but he had gluttony, drunkenness, and sloth, and he fathered a daughter in a brief, almost accidental and seemingly passionless departure from celibacy with a peasant woman.<br /><br />Ironically, however, it is the priest's encounters with ordinary people living in poverty and without prospects that manifests his destiny.  As a priest, he has an obligation to love all members of the human race deeply, spiritually, and uniformly in a contemporary emulation of Christ himself.  However, the Whiskey Priest, as he seeks to recover his lost decency and come to terms with his vocation, realizes that he can never love anyone as much as he loves his illegitimate daughter.  Though she despises him and taunts him mercilessly, the child's welfare and happiness are of greater concern to him than anyone or anything else.<br /><br />For most of us, this would be readily understandable:  we love our children above all others.  But for a man trying to return to priestly righteousness, this is selfish and worldly, cause for continuing anguish.<br /><br />Similarly, being hunted by the police for what he is and for minor offenses such as possession of brandy, he spends a night in a crowded and unimaginably filthy Mexican jail.  In spite of the filth, stench, and undisguised carnality of the place, he feels comradeship with the other prisoners, whether they be murderers, rapists, petty offenders, or prisoners-by-mistake.  They are genuine, needful, and hostile in honest ways.  A sharp contrast to the ostentatious piety, the sterile and indifferent sanctimoniousness of officials of the Church.<br /><br />That the Church is corrupt and corrupting becomes unmistakably clear when, after he is released and seeks refuge in the north, he is asked to briefly adopt the role of a priest once again.  Almost immediately the false piety and unquestionable sense of moral rectitude return.  He again, for a day, becomes a personification of the bastion of false conservatism and ally of political reaction that was his Catholic Church.<br /><br />The Power and the Glory is a brilliant novel that raises questions and offers insights not to be found elsewhere.  Whatever his failings, the struggle of the Whiskey Priest with himself is powerfully instructive, and he is one of the most interesting protagonists to be found in 20th Century literature.ilty of the sins attributed to him and still more.

These men are the height of DC society, rich, famous and the Marshall sons, not too hard on the eyes.  Nathan (The Privileged and the Damned), runs the financial side of the family's business.  Brady (The Power and the Glory) the political side of his father's campaign senatorial campaign.  And Finn, the youngest and a Hollywood playboy, (Redemption of a Hollywood Starlet), the spoiled baby brother.  All three are close and love to tease each other.

It especially hit home to me with all of the politics here in the USA plus all of the scandals.  I wondered what sort of a character the author would write and Aspyn Breedlove was perfect.  The daughter of \\"hippies\\" who demonstrated for world causes and Aspyn was following in her parents shoes; she was the spokesperson for The People's Imitative and now found herself handcuffed to the sexy and handsome Brady Marshall.  Like her parents, her dress was that of a \\"flower child\\".<br /><br />All of the Marshall Brother's adore their famous Grand and Grams Marshall.  Like their grandfather, their father is again, running for the US Senate.  They barely tolerate their father but adore their grandparents and each other.  However, it was Brady that interested me because I wondered how he was going to remedy the handcuff situation and when he offered Aspyn as job working on the campaign and listening to what the people wanted just to end the negative publicity, I knew it would blow up in his face.<br /><br />Brady and Aspyn's love story, like most couples had a rocky beginning but in the end, they were both good for each other.  However, to get that happy ending, they both had to go through some pain and suffering, because in the end the falseness and lies came to a roaring explosion.<br /><br />You will not just want to read The Power and the Glory; you will want to invest in all three books.icity, I knew it would blow up in his face.

US	50225927	R1ZX7AJGYCE64N	1441704108	512173793	The Power and the Glory	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	A classic in our times! It is very engaging!	Obviously, this is a classic in our times. It has been in print over 70 years now. There have been dozens of hardcover and paperback reprint editions since the author first wrote it. I just bought the third audiobook edition. No wonder that Graham Greene and others have held this to be his greatest work.<br /><br />Like we find in many classics, this is a book that causes us more than a bit of self-reflection. Maybe it reflects the meaning of C. S. Lewis' saying, \\"We read to know that we are not alone.\\" Is it the author's intention to make this known to us? It's quite possible, if you agree with my feeble attempt to summarize the main point is that it forces us to ask ourselves, \\"Do a few mistakes, or our faults, wipe out the good we have done in our lives and make us unworthy of a happy eternity we want others, especially our loved ones, to find and attain?\\" Also, \\"If so, how do we live out the remainder of our lives?\\" This is the struggle of the \\"whisky priest\\" being hunted as a wanted man as he searches for his own peace. This is an underlying concern that has to be resolved before he is caught and executed before a firing squad. In the intervening time, his goodness is seen to unfold and to be revealed to everyone but himself. It is filled with suspense that does more than keep our interest. It is very engaging. The ending is surprising.<br /><br />In the audiobook version, the superb narration by Bernard Mayes introduces an element of sluggishness to the telling of the story that seems to prevent the reader from moving too quickly through the book as the suspense builds. This infuses an aspect of dread that adds to the effectiveness of the telling of the story.	2011-07-07

His early writing was labored, he confesses in one of his autobiographies, \\"until I learned the trick;\\" but he never mentions what \\"the trick\\" is. You can find it here. Greene takes a familiar plot, puts it into an exotic setting, then infuses it with himself. In this case, it's the story of the Crucifixion. Like Kazantzakis's \\"The Last Temptation of Christ,\\" he uses realism to tell the story; unlike Kazantzakis, he sets the story, not in its original time and place, but in a Central American country at the beginning of the Twentieth Century. He isn't aiming to debunk Christianity; he's making the Grand Inquisitor's point that, if Christ were to return, he'd be crucified again. But he goes beyond this. Christ returns, over and over, as ordinary people. The more ironic his story becomes, the more it supports faith as a necessary, if irrational, condition. And despite such weighty subject matter, the story is light as a breeze and an easy read. What we have here is the paradox of faith depicted by a great story-teller in masterful prose through believable characters, fine writing at its best. He really is the greatest novelist to never win the Nobel Prize, and one of the world's great ironists.	2007-05-23

The author is an excellent philosophical detective, translating obscure language and garbled writing into a coherent picture of a philosopher's ideas.  But he does not ask us to take his translation on faith, he points to the exact text of the philosopher's writings.  I have tried to read numerous popular books on philosophy.  Most are just as difficult to read as the original text and provide the reader with no useful guidance.<br /><br />The book uses the reason vs. faith debate to introduce the reader to metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics in a coherent fashion.  It introduces the reader to the dual world ideology of Plato, where one cannot trust their senses to understand reality.  Christianity and pagan religions adopted variations on Plato's dual world ideology that are often so obscure, especially to a person of reason, as to be unintelligible; but they have been the source of bitter religious battles.  The author makes these debates understandable.  You will often hear the epistemological arguments elucidated in this book, by Christian debaters.<br /><br />This book should be used as an introductory text to metaphysics and epistemology in college.  It should also be best seller, but probably never will.<br /><br />If I have a criticism of this book, it is the elevation of Kant to the \\"third primary\\" philosopher and short shift this implies to John Locke.  Kant's main contribution, as far as I can tell, is the idea that \\"emotions\\" can be used as short cut to knowledge.  Otherwise, Kant's ideas seem a rehash of Plato's dual world.  Locke was a deist who elevated reason and science.  Faith was limited to the idea that God was the fundamental creator of the Universe, but has no effect except to define or create the laws of the Universe.  I think Locke has been smeared and distorted by Marxists, but, if read honestly, his ideas lead to the greatest country on Earth and the philosophical principals underlying our science and technology.Kant, on the other hand, might be credited with Nazi Germany, the USSR, Maoist China, and the ban of DDT.  Collectively, they killed 100s of millions of people.<br />Please consider writing a book on John Locke.	2013-03-07
