The book is about a man whose life falls apart. The hero of this novel is Tony Last who is a country gentleman, and things begin to go wrong for poor Tony when his wife decides that she really doesn't want live the life of a country gentleman's wife.<br /><br />Evelyn Waugh published the book in 1934, and it seems to have been inspired in some way by his own divorce which happened a few years before. When his marriage fell apart, Waugh was in the process of joining the Roman Catholic Church, and both of these events seem to haunt the book. Waugh skewers the upper crust of British society for the shallow and pointless way in which they live. Religious imagery sort of lingers in the background, but none of his characters seem aware of any transcendence. Even the hero, who is the only character to regularly attend church, can't understand why religion might be of any real use.<br /><br />The book takes an unexpected turn about halfway through, and many readers don't care for it. I think the first half of the book is far superior to the second half, but Waugh actually wrote the second half first. It was originally a short story, and then he wrote the rest of the novel in order to figure out how a man could fall into such a sad state of affairs. Understanding why he wrote the novel like he did helped me come to terms with the book's unexpected twist.<br /><br />Waugh's prose sparkles in its spare and witty perfection, but don't expect a happy ending in A Handful of Dust.",2015-07-04

Poor Tony Last's excellent life is ruined for no apparent reason other than his wife Brenda's  boredom with country life and his own inability to observe what is apparent to all of London society.

John Beaver, accompanied by a sharp-elbowed, mercantile mother represent if not the barbarians at the gate at least the arrivistes.  It's all very clever with a few smart, surprising twists (don't join an exploratory trip down the Amazon if you need to get away for awhile), but by all means strand your unfaithful, horrid wife with no visible means of support.

Such readers might have been perplexed, had they been informed that Mr. Waugh was widely perceived to be satirical.<br /><br />4) In fact, Evelyn Waugh was a fervent Catholic, a staunch conservative, and a man of retiring habits. Some scoffers have rudely attempted to paint him as a religious troglodyte, a hide-bound reactionary, an overt racist, and an abuser of chemical substances, but even those who disdained his notions relished his stylistic grace.

An undeniable similarity of literary manner might make such a supposition plausible, but note that the three-year lapse between Wilde's death and Waugh's birth would be inexplicable under any known rubric of the transmigration of souls. Besides, Oscar Wilde was a man of unpardonable skepticism and scorn for all things sacred.<br /><br />6) The adulteries portrayed in A Handful of Dust are in no way prurient or titillating.

Today, he is probably best known for his novel Brideshead Revisited, due to the popularity of a 1981 TV mini series adaptation.    His novel A Handful of Dust is a comedy of manners, even a farce, for the first four chapters.   Tony Last is devoted to his estate Hetton, with its Victorian Gothic monstrosity of a mansion.   His shallow wife Brenda has an affair with John Beaver, a cash-strapped momma's boy.  The cuckolded Tony becomes aware of the affair only after the death of their son in a riding accident, when he receives a message from Brenda that she's going to marry Beaver.     The main conflict is between Tony and his devotion to Hetton (three of the chapters are title English Gothic) on one hand and Brenda on the other.    Aside from being Brenda's paramour, Beaver's role is incidental.    Brenda makes demands in their divorce case that would compel Tony to sell Hetton.  Tony will not acquiesce to her demands, and goes on an expedition to Brazil.  He tells Brenda's brother that, upon his return to England, he will divorce Brenda without settlements.    A Handful of Dust takes a dramatic turn beginning with Chapter 5, In Search of a City, when Tony leaves England for Brazil.  The pace picks up rapidly, and there is menace and doom as Tony makes his way through the jungles of Brazil with his traveling companion Dr. Messinger.   The novel ends with startling turns in the fates of Brenda, Tony, and his beloved Hetton.    A Handful of Dust was slow going and didn't engage me until Chapter 5.  There were times I put it aside.

Eliot to symbolize social and moral decay and emotional despair.  What is sardonic in all of this is the degraded version of the Celtic King Arthur story-cycle. The rooms at Hetton are all named after the Tennyson Victorian version of the same story. Tony is Arthur, Brenda, Guinevere, and Beaver, a shabby version of Lancelot. So Waugh's novel ends with Tony, like a knight searching for the Holy Grail, vainly seeking his mythical city but finding nothing but his own special hell on earth.  It is hard not to sympathize with Tony, in spite of his veneration of a sterile heritage, his vast inheritance, and lofty place in society, all of which come to seem futile, irrelevant, and meaningless--once pared to the essentials--mere survival. Vanity, vanity, indeed. Loss of child, loss of love, loss of status, place and loss of liberty: the man is an upper crust Job!  Sad. Frightening. His cluelessness is without limit.  This is the first book I'd read by E. Waugh. I wasn't sure I could relate to the historical and social context--it is pretty alien to my own frame of reference. But Waugh is a fluid, coherent writer with a gift for character sketching--chiefly through dialogue, which always rings true. Even the most insignificant characters are revealed, sometimes with a single parenthetical comment. But his prose is also economical and tightly knitted. It has been a long while since I read a sentence like: 'Next morning.' Paragraph. Sometimes, his rapid style of unattributed dialogue necessitates rereading to be certain who is saying what--but generally it encourages a breakneck pace. It is such a dark frightening story that without the leavening of humorous flourishes I doubt it would be endurable.

Tony and Brenda Last (as in Last of the Old Gentry) would seem to have it all - wealth, position, and domestic bliss.  But trouble enters their idyll in the unassuming form of the parasitic Mr. Beaver, who visits their ancestral home of Hetton and winds up shattering their illusions of contentment.  Admirably paced and crushing in its honesty, Waugh shows us how easily this house of cards (and by extension the old social order) crumbles.<br /><br />As usual, Waugh's humor doesn't produce belly-laughs, but rather wry, knowing smiles of recognition.  Beaver's worthlessness, Brenda's duplicity, Tony's friends' complicit silence, the local gossip's fascination, Tony's obliviousness, the endless parties and lunches and drinking - all are targets for Waugh's unblinking satiric gaze.  And then tragedy strikes.<br /><br />After the dust settles, the story takes us into a remote jungle where Tony (who feels he has lost everything) tries to restore his self-worth by seeking the fabled city of El Dorado - the City of Gold.  While this may seem like an unnecessary digression for such a realistic novel, it works admirably well on a symbolic level.  Tony's horrifying fate at the conclusion of the book stands as a chilling metaphor for the ultimately loveless marriage that the protagonists had fallen into.  Apparently, Waugh felt that marriage was just one more fragile institution that had failed humankind.<br /><br />Brilliant though this novel is, it's difficult to say who it should be recommended to.  Students of literature will surely admire Waugh's exquisite style, and social critics may find it a fascinating novel of manners for the period, but overall the story is so dark that one wonders how many people will really enjoy it.

With the publication of this book, Waugh was already well known as a man whose themes could not hide a bitter sense of despair that all was not right with post war Edwardian England. In DECLINE AND FALL and VILE BODIES, Waugh showed himself full of despair that England had lost its moral way, if not its moral compass. But with A HANDFUL OF DUST, he adds to this an anger towards unfaithful wives that is disturbing to read. <br /> <br />The novel begins, as so many of Waugh's other works, with a feckless young man who seems content to drift in life. Here it is John Beaver, who begins a friendship with Tony Last, a man who seems mired in the roots of his Victorian forebears. Last has a mansion that he prizes above all else, even over his lovely, but bored wife, Brenda. When Last invites Beaver to stay for a visit at his house, Brenda sees in Beaver an opportunity to cure her boredom. She quickly seduces Last. For the first half of the book, Waugh is content to play out the seeming harmlessness of the affair. Waugh's wit and satire are strangely muted, only because he uses Last, Beaver, and Brenda as ready targets as symbols for all that he saw as wrong with a jaded and irrelevant British upper class. However, in the second half, with the death of Brenda's young son in a riding accident, Waugh sharpens his bite so that what he writes is less satire than a howl of existential bile both at a cuckold who refuses to see what is right in front of his nose and at a wife and mother who cares less about the fate of her dead son and more about continuing her affair. Such bitterness had been lacking in his earlier novels. By the end of the novel, Waugh returns to his previous level of acrimony with the weird fate of Tony Last who is doomed to recite the novels of Charles Dickens to a madman in a Brazilian jungle.<br /> <br />The reader feels a conflict with the inharmonious flow of satire and irony. Waugh lambasts an entire generation of Bright Young Things, none of whom are as bright as they imagine, but all are doomed to play out their lives in a universe devoid of meaning. A fitting end is the endless repetition of Dickens sounding and resounding in some tiny mudball of a hut for the gratification of a lunatic who may be more sane than most of the novel's other characters. This formless buzzing of noise is what is left after a handful of dust disappears in the breeze.",2006-08-12

His wife, Brenda, cares not for him and shacks up with Beaver -- something which she and her friends cannot quite understand.

She sets off, rather inexplicably, with a Mommy-coddled cheapskate named Beaver. For her, it's something to do. For her cosmopolitan circle, it's a cause not for concern but merry gossip. \\""You know, you're causing a great deal of trouble,\\"" her sister Marjorie confides. \\""You've taken London's only spare man.\\""<br /><br />If cruel social satire is your cup of tea, you won't go wrong with \\""A Handful Of Dust.\\"" Waugh is not working from the heart here, but from the spleen, but once you allow for the fact caring is out the window for the reader and the cast, what you get is a pretty thorough and, in its upside-down way, satisfying exposition on the petty viciousness of cheating hearts. If you've ever come across a real heartbreaker in life, and who hasn't, this book offers a perverse form of solace.<br /><br />While Brenda's heartlessness is milked in depth, it's really the enabling connivance of her kinfolk and friends that Waugh sends up so masterfully. It's what makes his novel a treat. Tony, we understand, is a stick and a bore, but he not only cares for his wife but trusts her blindly, which makes her adultery and her circle's abetting of it particularly cruel. No doubt to point up the amoral nature of secular London's high society, the Catholic Waugh gives us dialogue that ricochets back heavily on the speakers, as they wonder why Tony doesn't just accept his losses, sell his manor to satisfy Brenda's exorbitant alimony demands, and not be such a bore about it.<br /><br />The drawback in this book, as other reviewers here note, is in the ending, not because it is sour but so out of left field. Even though there's a nice juxtaposition of the Amazon and London, Tony's strange expedition, and its resolution, don't add to the proceedings so much as push them in another direction that seems to add Waugh himself to Last's already-thick stable of tormentors.

They are rather like actors in a Restoration play, whose moral compasses have become entirely skewed. Though not as moralistic as some of Waugh's late novels, A HANDFUL OF DUST definitely offers a portrait of a very decadent society, indeed. These are not sympathetic characters.

The plot of \\""A Handful of Dust\\"" goes in strange, unlikely directions for a comic novel -- the sad fate of its protagonist near the end fits the Aristotelian definition of tragedy -- but in Waugh's world, every misfortune is merely a setup for a new quirky development.<br />It is the story of the dissolution of the marriage of Lord Tony and Lady Brenda Last, but that's just what happens in the background.  The Lasts' house, an old country manor called Hetton with rooms named after characters from Arthurian legend, is Tony's pride and joy, even more so than their little son John Andrew.  One weekend they receive as an unwelcome guest an acquaintance of Tony's, an idle, insipid young Londoner named John Beaver who lives with his mother due to limited finances.

Some of it is so subtle it could easily be missed, such as Tony's consultations with the private detectives who are supposed to be catching him in the act of an infidelity for the divorce proceedings; some of it is outright hilarious, as displayed by a scene where a pickled Tony and his friend Jock patronize a den of iniquity called the Sixty-Four.

If you'll pardon my clumsy extending of the &quot;rapier wit&quot; metaphor here, this novel is more than scathing; it cuts to the quick.  For the first part of the book, I was, in equal measure, amused and repelled by the characters and plot.  Then came the first climax with the death of Tony and Brenda's son John.  Sad, and difficult to read, but more chilling was Brenda's &quot;Thank God&quot; when she realised it was John her son, not John Beaver her lover who had been killed.  From here on in the plot becomes darker and stickier.<br />With the account of the vicar and the church earlier on, it is already clear that religion is not going to be able to help Tony in this novel.  In the jungle, the manners and mores of society are redundant too.  This world is, like the characters (almost without exception, vicious, bleak and self-serving).  A wasteland truly like T. S. Eliots &quot;Wasteland&quot; from which the title of the novel comes.<br />Far from being disappointed by the ending as many of the reviewers, I found it to be a deeply haunting climax.  When the satire deepens and darkens and the nonsense bows out a bit at the death of little John, the transfer to the jungle is surprising, if a little jarring, but, all said, I think the novel and particularly the ending will stay with me for a long time to come.<br />There are a few reasons for my not giving this the full five stars though.  One is that in recalling the story I do think of it in two distinct halves rather than one whole but, depending on your point of view, this is not necessarily problematic.  There are some themes that bridge the two however.  For example, the bugs and parasites of the jungle parallel the socially parasitic Beaver; both start out as minor irritants to Tony but end up doing him real harm (the loss of Brenda and the delirium in the jungle).  The reader sees the pitfallsof both for Tony almost right away, but he seems unworried and even unaware of the dangers until they are right upon him. <br />The other reason for giving this four, not five, stars is that some characters seemed to just pop in and out and leave one feeling disappointed that their characters and story threads were not more fully developed.  The &quot;Shameless Blonde&quot; for one was one of the more likable characters in the novel and, given her role as Tony's only really useful comforter at his son's death, it is a bit irritating that she just flies off in her plane never to be seen again.  Similarly, Therese de Vitre on the boat to the West Indes, pops up, seems important and interesting for a bit, then disappears. Conversely, Jock Grant-Menzies, friend to Tony and the witness to Brenda's chilling &quot;Thank God&quot; comment (same one as mentioned above) marries her at the end of the book.  Why?  That is puzzling and it seems a bit too neat to tie them together when there are the loose ends of the &quot;Shameless Blonde&quot; and Therese de Vitre flapping around.  <br />Overall though I thought this was a good book, and as I have already said, one that I won't forget very quickly for its sinister second half.",2001-07-22

While it is not as sophisticated as Bridshead Revisited and its characters are not as well developed, it provides the reader with a fantastic example of the literary form that Waugh specialized in - bitter, caustic satire.  Waugh elegantly and effortlessly provides us with the dark, mean-spirited social commentary that the French New Wave movement brought to film thirty years later.   A Handful of Dust is peopled with nothing but caricatures, but they are so finely crafted that the book lacks the clumsiness that I've found in some of his other satires like Scoop or Decline and Fall.  With them, Waugh has generated a powerful indictment of Britain's idle class during the post WWI era.   I always find it fun to read a P.G. Wodehouse novel after Waugh to get opposite ends of the spectrum.  Following Waugh's society of complete moral bankruptcy with Wodehouse's good-natured buffoonery makes you wonder just what on earth was going on in England between the wars. I must agree with many of the other reviewers that the ending is a disappointment (as are the endings to Bridshead Revisited, Decline and Fall, and The Loved One).  If Waugh is trying to create an analogy between Brenda's imprisonment in a dull marriage to Tony's plight of spending the rest of his days in the jungle reading to his illiterate captor, I think he has performed it in a rather inelegant manner.  It is almost as if he had an idea for a short story that he tacked on the end of this novel.  Nonetheless, this does not keep A Handful of Dust from being on of Waugh's finest novels.",2001-07-03

It is the story of Tony Last who is land rich but cash poor - just about every penny goes into keeping his estate running - a typical situation for these large landowners between the wars (1918-39). He is married to Brenda, a beautiful socialite who has settled into country life with him with hardly a backward glance - and they seem very happy. Until an unfortunate meeting brings Mr Beaver to visit.<br />Mr Beaver is also incredibly poor but he lives in high society in London and his mother is designer who converts old houses into new flats for the wealthy and Brenda falls for him despite his treating her rather poorly. Brenda begins an affair with him and Tony's world very slowly and carefully crumbles around him without him knowing what is happening.<br />Waugh doesn't spare his satirical pen and everyone suffers - Tony for his ignorance of thecourse of events, Brenda for her not wishing anyone to rock the boat with a show of emotion, and Mr Beaver for being one of the Noveau class who are part of the change in the class structure and way of life.<br />I believe that Waugh must have read about the adventures of Colonel Fawcett who was lost in the Amazon jungle sometime in the 1920's and I wondered if he read Peter Fleming's marvellous book of an expedition to try to find him &quot;Brazillian Adventure&quot;. These were very popular books at the time and may have given Waugh some ideas for the last part of this book is an Amazonian adventure in itself. <br />The ending is interesting for I don't know if any of the characters got what the deserved as they might under the old system of class, in the new order each character is given the fate which they have earned though.",2001-01-04

The basic premise mirrors that of many comedies of  manners from around its time; wife takes apartment in the city and takes a  lover, leaving the hapless husband at home. Wife feels guilty. Wife  attempts to set husband up with a lover. Husband is oblivious. The  repercussions are immense.<br /><br />I got the feeling that Waugh was trying too  hard at the beginning of this book, and that after he stopped trying and  started just plain writing, the book got a whole lot better. He spends a  relatively unnecessary length of time setting the scene before anything  really starts happening, and that scene-setting is interminable. (I should  mention that Amis' writing style mirrors those first seventy pages to a T.)  However, once Waugh stops attempting to be so damned urbane, and gets on  with the task of putting his characters in increasingly unrealistic  situations, both the pace and the humor pick up. The obligatory tragedy  happens, and when it does, it's a mark of how much better the book has  gotten that it's unexpected, and the reader realizes that maybe he feels  something more for these characters than a cordial sort of  despise.<br /><br />One could (and one is sorely tempted) compare and contrast  Waugh's novel with Amis' _Dead Babies_ as synecdochic of what's happened to  British humor over the past sixty years. One will not stoop to such a  level, since one is utterly infatuated with Dawn French, and thinks The  Vicar of Dibley is the cat's pyjamas where TV sitcoms are concerned. So one  will content oneself with saying that Waugh, using understatement and  irony, has written a far more humorous novel than Amis, whose main conceits  were slapstick and drugs.

Brenda is put off by the &quot;monstrous way&quot; Tony  has behaved -- namely, not allowing her to continue as the  &quot;victim&quot; of the divorce proceeding.  Her &quot;friends&quot; aid  and abet her philanderings while gossiping behind her back, and allowing  her to become penniless while they go off on holiday.  Mrs. Beaver, whose  son is the amoral, parasitic lover, is interested in the affair only by  what can be gained monetarily from it.  <br />The astonishing twist in the  story line, following Tony's harrowing adventures in the Amazon jungle, is  perplexing to some readers, but in fact serves as an interesting comparison  of the two totally different environments Tony has had to deal with, one of  &quot;civilized&quot; society, and the other of the jungle.  The more  &quot;civilized&quot; people in the jungle (all the English-speaking  characters) create just as many problems for Tony as the bats and  mosquitoes.  (Perhaps some of the previous reviewers could have thought a  little more along these lines before writing a bad review.)  <br />Also, one  has to think how Tony could have avoided his misfortunes.  He is undone by  his staidness, until it is too late.  Perhaps Waugh is commenting on the  English gentry in general(?)
