I just wish he had been able to find some degree of happiness and not blow his head off. He was a wonderfully creative person who could make you believe his fiction and his nonfiction alike.

I really have tried to like his books, hence the renewed foray into this one. But I just cannot bring myself to feel anything but boredom when reading his stories. Either I’m not sophisticated enough to understand one of our literary greats, or Hemingway is the proverbial emperor without any clothes, and no one dares point out how lacking he really is, for fear of being called ignorant.<br /><br />The Sun Also Rises is not a bad story per se. A bunch of World War I veterans living in Paris and then venturing into Spain to witness a bullfight, with a complicated love triangle – or rather, a love rectangle or even love pentagon, if such a thing exists – woven into the tale. But that already sounds a lot more exciting than what the book delivers. It might have been a good story, but it just wasn’t. Let me count the ways:<br /><br />The narrative: I know Hemingway gets praised for his stripped bare and plain storytelling, without much embellishment, but I found it totally uninspired. There are passages that go like this: I went to the hotel. I got a room with a balcony overlooking the rooftops. I took a shower and went to lunch. I ordered a bottle of wine. Then I walked up the street to the ocean. The tide was about halfway out the beach… (this is not an actual quote, I listened to the audio version of the book and so had trouble getting exact quotes, but trust me, it wasn’t all that different).<br /><br />The characters: I mean, how much drinking and eating and sleeping off your hangovers can you do? I know these are supposed to be the characters of the lost generation after WWI, but still – all they ever do is go look for a bar, order drinks, and more drinks, and more drinks, and eventually go home and sleep it off. Hemingway spends a lot of time describing which kinds of drinks they are, in intricate detail. But we never really learn as much about the characters as we might, given the right dialog, because all the dialog is wasted on the drink orders and some very superficial conversation. In fact, I liken Hemingway to a travel blogger, a not very good one. He describes what’s going on around him, all the new and exciting sights he sees – like the bullfight, the only time the story comes to life a little bit – but there is no real growth in the characters throughout the story.<br /><br />The plot: Where is the plot? So Brett, the narrator’s love, is having affairs left and right and thereby pissing off a good number of people. Through most of the story I was waiting for some kind of climax, thinking one of her spurned lovers would end up killing the latest one, and if that had happened, the story – though boring through most of the book – might have redeemed itself a little bit. But no, nothing happens – sorry, should have given you a spoiler alert – and everything just sort of fizzles out at the end. There is nothing for the reader to cling to, other than a bunch of characters adrift aimlessly and talking to each other while consuming an ungodly amount of wine and harder liquor.<br /><br />The style: There isn’t much style at all. There are no sentences you want to go back and re-read, no poetic passages, no big insights into human nature, and, most lacking to me, no foreshadowing whatsoever. It really does read like a teenager’s diary going “and then this happened, and then we went there, and after that…” I couldn’t tell you for the life of me what Hemingway’s “voice” is. Other than perhaps being able to recognize his voice by virtue of being bored to death whenever I open one of his books.<br /><br />I also would like to add that I find the writing in this story vaguely anti-Semitic. It was probably very common in those times to make the kinds of comments about Jews that his characters repeatedly make, but after a while it grated on me. It was less offensive to me than it felt obsolete, if that makes sense.<br /><br />I can honestly say thatthe only reason I finished the book was that it was fairly short and I was still waiting for my new library book at the time. When that arrived – Donna Tart’s “A Secret History” - I breathed a huge sigh of relief to have a “real” story again, one that captivated me from the first sentence and where my mind was whirling with infinite possibilities as to how it might unfold.<br /><br />If The Sun Also Rises was written by one of the many expat bloggers I follow, I would have stopped reading much faster. Hemingway seems to get the benefit of the doubt due to his name alone, but I for one am done with him and his ramblings.the only reason I finished the book was that it was fairly short and I was still waiting for my new library book at the time.

She, meanwhile, seems emotionally scarred: we learn in a conversation that her true love died during the War, while she served as a V.A.D. in a hospital.<br />Opening in Paris, where life is one round of alcoholic nights out and - for Brett - a succession of meaningless assignations with men - the group move off to take in Pamplona for some fishing and the annual fiesta and bullfights.

The protagonist Jake Barnes is war wounded and lost his manliness, so the girl he loves humiliates him by treating him like a best pal, while she sleeps around various characters that come and go through out the story.  The settings of Paris and Pamplona Spain provide a colourful back ground to that social menagerie. The running of the bulls and the bull fights of Pamplona act like an allegory to the sexuality of the menagerie. The metaphor is in the title, the sun sets on this dissolute and pessimistic menagerie therefore it rises elsewhere.<br /><br />In the early twentieth century moderns went about breaking the moral codes and taboos of that society for the sake of their art. This book is of that stripe. In the early twenty first century that seems mundane and unimaginative.  Hemingway is known for his pared down or simple style of writing. He can provoke the imagination to picture the scenes and follow the dialogue with few words. That being said I did get lost while meeting the characters in the first part of the book.

The book is a direct reflection of Hemmingway’s struggle to find meaning and the reason for existence. The main characters spend all their time drinking and dancing, trying to avoid the internal challenges they’re facing. Jake is still in love with Brett, but she refuses to be with him, causing him to question everything about life. Growing up we believe that love conquers all, so Jake is left confused and troubled about what he really knows. Hemmingway’s simplistic style of writing makes the book easy to read and understand, however I find it hard to relate to the story and its characters because of its cynical tone. I am a positive person so I have differing views than the characters and have a difficult time trying to understand their motives and actions. I’m still young and haven’t experienced life enough to make me question it, but Hemmingway has, and this is his opinion of the world after witnessing the destruction and horrors of war. It seems that Hemmingway has lost hope in the world, which isn’t the nicest thing to read about. But that’s what modernism is. It tells the truth no matter how unpleasant it is to hear. Realism before the war liked to make everything pretty and beautiful, but modernism isn’t afraid to show the ugliness that can occur. This book was beautifully written, but it wasn’t my favorite in content, merely because reading about the sadness of the world isn’t that enjoyable to me. It’s blunt and straight to the point, making its message extremely clear. I may not have been in love with this book, but there is no denying that Hemmingway is an incredible writer and there are few other authors that can match his skill and style.",2014-10-31

After trying my hardest to read this thing for four days, I'm giving up at chapter five. It takes me twenty minutes to get through two pages, and not because I'm a slow reader, but because this book couldn't keep my attention if the words were bright green and flashing on the page. I tried to give it a fair shot, because, come on, it's Ernest Hemingway! That must mean it's good—or at least has some sort of substance—right? Wrong. Very, very wrong. This book is painfully boring and nothing more, which is really disappointing. I was drawn to this book after reading an enthralling excerpt from it somewhere, and I was led to believe it would be an interesting, intellectual, and insightful read. Perhaps it is for those odd few who could manage to finish a full sentence without having their attention grabbed elsewhere, but it wasn't for me.<br /><br />Jake, the protagonist of this book, has no character to him; no beauty; all he does is cite his day in a tired tone and complain about Brett—who, by the way, is unbelievably annoying and strange. He has a few random friends which nobody really cares about and which he spends too much time with, and one of which he spent far too much time detailing the history of his boxing past in the opening chapter. (To be fair, that could be related to some event or another later on in the story, but I wouldn't know, obviously.) While I am mildly curious about Brett and Jake's past and the mysterious &#34;injuries&#34; Jake kept bringing up but not explaining, my curiosity doesn't extend far enough to get me through this book. Like I said, I gave it my best shot, but that's normally right where you can tell a book is a dud: when you have to put effort into reading it.<br /><br />Despite the disappointingly lackluster quality of this book, I'll give Hemingway the benefit of the doubt and try out some of his other books.

His effort at blending these is only somewhat successful.<br /><br />It's tempting to look for allegorical meaning in the fishing, fiesta, and bull fighting. But the truth is probably simpler: that was Hemingway's life at the time and he was writing about what he knew. They do add some color to the story, but not much depth.<br /><br />The characters are the strength of this novel, with each one exhibiting impotence when facing the headwinds of life. Cohn's boxing is his attempt to equip himself to face his struggles, but that turns out to be useless in his pursuit of his desires. Brett lurches from one cataclysm to another. Michael's life is in an irretrievable tailspin. Ironically, Jake, who is literally impotent, is probably best equipped to deal with circumstances, but  his aspirations remain out of reach.<br /><br />The resulting fatalistic tone evokes the Lost Generation of the 20's.

Reading and re-reading her best known books, Mrs. Dalloway and To The Lighthouse, has taught me how to approach this genre, identifying distinctive themes and formulating reasonable and satisfying interpretations.<br /><br />When Virginia Woolf, in her own beautiful prose, employs her characters to unself-consciously manufacture social reality, they do so using the tools available at the time:  a composite of social conventions and cultural artifacts that are innately transitory, though they feel undeniably timeless and unmistakably real.  She proceeds in a way that is discernible to careful readers but doesn't smash it in their faces.  There is no doubt that life is inherently meaningless, interpretable only through the meanings that her characters create in ways that are taken for granted and only very subtly evident.<br /><br />We also see the effects of the catastrophe that was World War I, and the technology-intensive, rapid transformation of social relations that accompanied and followed the War.  In time, the world of culturally shared meanings becomes quite different from traditional beliefs and practices.  Still socially constructed and mutable, they constitute a new reality, as seemingly reliable and true as that which came before, an epistemological transformation of commonsense that Woolf captures with elegance and insight.<br /><br />It would be foolish and perversely doctrinaire to expect Hemingway's modernist fiction, as manifest in The Sun Also Rises, to mimic the work of Virginia Woolf.  However, while she manages to deal with modernist themes and issues with remarkable literary skill, Hemingway, sadly, can't seem to pull it off.  His ostensibly lean and masculine prose too often strikes me as just plodding indifference.  Maybe even a lazy caricature of himself.<br /><br />The themes of modernism are there, more or less, but they exhibit themselves with uncaring decadence and dramatized brutality.  With occasional ancillary exceptions, the characters are vulgarly obvious aesthetes, frenetic seekers of meaning and purpose that just isn't there and that they don't know how to create.  Their levels of chronic self-absorption run deep and disclose nothing to grab hold of.  These are characters who seem incapable of coming to terms with the world as they find it, and perhaps consequently are obsessively concerned with affectations and gossipy exchanges over drinks of various kinds in a seemingly inexhaustible collection of cafe's.  They bring to mind the aimless fidgeting of hyper-active children.<br /><br />The narrator and protagonist, Jake, is a determinedly solicitous cipher, everyone's best friend, who comes to us out of nowhere and has no life apart from his &#34;crowd&#34; of privileged characters.  Perhaps a bit more abstemious and a bit less conspicuously aimless that the rest, his war wounds have left him helpless in crucial ways.  One wonders just what Jake, and for that matter the rest of the &#34;crowd,&#34; is seeking beyond comfortable idleness and, eventually, the excitement generated by artfully staged and savagely manipulated blood sports such as bull fighting.<br /><br />Hemingway's characters seem to be devoid of insight, blinded by the modern world with its limitless but transitory possibilities.  They chat about going to England, South America, the U.S. and anywhere else that might occur to them, but they have no compelling reason not to just stay where they are.  They could write books, and some do, though it's unclear that quality rather than the familial connections of the wealthy gets the occasional book into print.  Besides, what would they write about?  It seems that all they know is each other, and their conversational exchanges are typically so tedious and banal that knowing each other is not knowing very much.  Yes, the fact that their lives are fraught with the tedious and the banal could be the basis for a novel, and perhaps that isHemingway's point, but if it is, he made it in a tedious and banal way.<br /><br />The characters, moreover, are little able to appreciate the beauty in much of anything unless it takes the painfully brutal form of a bull bred for fighting goring an awkward, defenseless steer in just exactly the right way.  The steer was put in the ring to give the bull something to do, a diversion, the same empty purpose that bullfighting itself serves for its audience.  Something sufficiently ugly, merciless, and unforgiving to penetrate their protective shells of effete indifference.  Ironic that the responses of Hemingway's characters of privilege, with the exception of Robert Cohn, whom the others tolerate but nothing more, is so much like that of the rural peasants attending their annual festival.  Diverted from ennui or diverted from hard work and hardship, apparently there's not much difference.<br /><br />Robert Cohn, moreover is a mystery.  Oddly, this pathetic hanger-on is the only member of the privileged herd that has mastered a blood sport, the sort of attainment on which Hemingway placed an inordinately high value.  But Cohn's skill as a boxer is of no value when it comes to getting what he really wants.  His restraint in tolerating the vicious taunts of Mike and occasionally some of the others, renders his physical prowess pointless.  Besides, Cohn lacks the passionate killer instinct that is the hallmark of a worthy blood sport practitioner.  One wonders why he's there, doing little or nothing but absorbing punishment.  Certainly the mercurial and spoiled Brett is not going to turn her amorous attention toward him, resuming their long dead affair.<br /><br />There is a great deal of descriptive material in this novel, covering cities, villages, cathedrals, distinctively Spanish mountainous terrain, fruitfully flourishing wheat fields, the skin tones of peasants and the wealthy, and a good deal more.  But Hemingway's treatments of even the most inspiring and colorful natural phenomena and man-made artifacts are pretty conventional, lacking in interesting detail, unless a matador is killing a bull.  Perhaps this limitation is one reason why I found myself longing for a narrative.  Modernism is averse to narratives, unnatural patterns of temporal coherence that introduce meaning that is nothing more than an imposition, a conceit that prevents us from seeing the world as it is.  The Sun Also Rises is so substantively sparse, however, that the absence of a narrative leaves us groping for a clue as to why it was written.<br /><br />We live in a world that is cruel and brutal by its very nature.  Why we feel the need to introduce dramatized exaggerations that yield still more pain and lethality and call it an occasion for a waspish game of bridge or a week-long drunken festival topped off by the slaughter of bulls is a mystery.  The psychological and physical savagery that we control is of our own making, but so what?<br /><br />My favorite novel is The Old Man and the Sea, a book of rare beauty and infinite wisdom.  Some hold that Hemingway would not have won a Nobel prize without it.  Perhaps in his earlier work, The Sun Also Rises included, Hemingway was developing his art, discovering how to write like a genius.  Otherwise, I can't think of a good reason for writing something so pointlessly empty as this novel.  It occurred to me that if an unknown had submitted The Sun Also Rises to a published it would have been quickly rejected.nt, but if it is, he made it in a tedious and banal way.<br /><br />The characters, moreover, are little able to appreciate the beauty in much of anything unless it takes the painfully brutal form of a bull bred for fighting goring an awkward, defenseless steer in just exactly the right way.

We first meet our narrator, Jake Barnes, in Paris, where he works as a journalist. Jake and Lady Brett Ashley love one another, but Jake has been left impotent by a war injury, and Brett is not the kind of woman who could be happy in a relationship that didn't offer her sexual fulfilment. So Brett embarks on a string of sexual adventures, usually with friends of Jake's, while Jake drinks. And drinks. And drinks. Actually, so does Brett. And by about a third of the way through the book, I was toying with the idea of knocking back three bottles of wine, a couple of brandies, and an absinthe or two myself. (But then the 'lost generation' usually has that effect on me - privileged, feckless wasters living off Daddy's money, and blaming their dissipated lifestyles on the war. Poor ex-soldiers, of course, just had to go home, get a job and get on with things - they couldn't afford to get 'lost' in Paris or Spain. Poverty is such a great sat-nav.)<br /><br />When Paris begins to run low on alcohol, Jake and a loose group of friends and acquaintances, including Brett and her fianc&eacute;, make their way to Pamplona in Spain for the annual bull-fighting fiesta. There is a lot of alcohol available in Spain, of all different kinds, and this, together with the fact that every man in the party has either slept with Brett or wants to, leads to lots of macho posturing - not unlike the more formalised posturing that takes place between the matador and the bull. Surprisingly enough, Lady Brett seems to quite like matadors...<br /><br />Hemingway's writing style is an odd mix of sometimes overly simplistic prose with occasional passages of real beauty. Some of the dialogue is mind-numbingly trite - repetitive and dull - and he gets fixated on details from time to time, like how much a bottle of wine cost or what each person ate. I tired very quickly of the endless descriptions of binge-drinking and drunken quarrelling. But some of the descriptions are excellent - the dusty journey to Pamplona, the passengers met by chance en route all merge to become a strikingly vivid picture of a particular place and time. As they all sit around drinking in Pamplona, I felt I could see the various caf&eacute;s and bars clearly, almost smell them. The interactions between the ex-pats and the natives are brilliantly portrayed, particularly the growing disapproval from the real aficionados when Brett's behaviour begins to threaten the traditions of the bullfight. And as for the arena itself, I found I was unexpectedly fascinated by his depiction of the rituals around the running of the bulls and the bullfighting.<br /><br />The same patchiness applies to the characterisation. I'm not at all sure what he was trying to achieve with Lady Brett's character - but I'm pretty sure he didn't achieve it. She didn't come over as a real person to me at all. Her permanent drunkenness and ridiculously promiscuous behaviour may have made many men want to sleep with her, but the idea that they all fell in love with her was a stretch too far. I felt as if she was a puppet rather than a character, her behaviour merely a device to provide reasons for strains and tensions to develop amongst the group of men.<br /><br />I'm sure screeds have been written about the blatant anti-Semitism in the book and I must say I wasn't overwhelmingly thrilled by his stereotyping of his Scottish character either. But honestly both characterisations seemed to me more like lazy regurgitations of racial caricatures than any kind of active racism, and it was the 1920s, so no doubt they seem more shocking to us now than they would have been then. In fact, I wasn't at all sure that he wasn't attempting to gently ridicule the prevailing anti-Semitism of his time - but if that was his intention, by leaving it ambiguous, again I feel he failed.<br /><br />However, I feel we get to know Jake well and some of the others come over as fairly well-rounded. There is a good deal of subtlety in the way he slowly reveals Jake to us as the most resilient of them all - the one who is physically damaged, but with the most emotional strength in the end. The whole 'there's more than one way to be masculine' message may seem obvious in retrospect but it's actually fed through in a gradual and almost understated way, and I felt I only really saw what Hemingway was doing as I looked back at the book after finishing.<br /><br />I'm going to confess that in the end the book impressed me considerably more than I expected. Despite my many criticisms, I found it an absorbing read that drew me into the world Hemingway was describing and made it a believable one; and my appreciation for it actually grew in the few days after I had finished reading it. I feel that it needs to be approached like an impressionist painting - when you're close enough to see the detail it all looks a bit messy and it's hard to make out the picture. But stand back a bit and the details recede - the constant descriptions of drunkenness, the repetitiveness, the banality of the dialogue - and the picture that emerges of a damaged man metaphorically rising from the ashes through a kind of examination of maleness is really quite compelling after all. 4½ stars for me, so rounded up.<br /><br />NB This book was provided for review by the publisher, Scribner.ambiguous, again I feel he failed.<br /><br />However, I feel we get to know Jake well and some of the others come over as fairly well-rounded.

It belonged to my sister, and I simply read the first page or two, just out of boredom.

Instead of pages of exposition, he simply reports the actions of his characters, leaving judgment up to the reader.  He reveals his characters subtly, and they evolve throughout the work.  Each character feels real...they seem like real people with real motivations.  Each is flawed, yet noble in their own way and for their own reasons.<br /><br />Hemingway was the original thrill seeker, and his settings were always unique and colorful.

In my view, stimulated by a recent reading, my first, one might search fruitlessly to find a flatter and more colorless array of disappointment.<br /><br />To be fair, the novel is almost a century old, and was highly experimental and daring in its time, and will undoubtedly always occupy a slot in the history of American literature. Yet, one is hard-pressed to overlook the gratuitous anti-Semitism and the thinly veiled misogyny, blanketing the main characters' world view. Then we have the dearth of conventional literary appeal: excessive use of the verb to be, and the passive voice, a poverty of inventive or fresh simile or metaphor, tediously short dialogue and slang (now dated), a wearying and self-conscious affectation of both short and long sentences, together with an aimless, almost slovenly, structure.<br /><br />Granted, Hemingway has nailed an immature and lost generation of drunks and wandering souls lost between the world wars, (proto-beats, and proto hippies) and enriched their thin atmosphere with free-wheeling European travel, picturesque mountain trout fishing, decaying European aristocracy, innocent peasantry, and blood-soaked bullfights, all leanly described, and some, more or less, employed as symbols.<br /><br />But the relentless machismo wears thin, the 24 hour a day drinking quickly becomes annoying, and the days spent with rude American twenty-thirty somethings traipsing around the Spanish countryside, usually from bar to bar, and in a blur of romantic and alcoholic frustration, end with relief, at least for this reader.",2014-03-11

The prose and imagery are as dense as a rainforest. In places I could use a machete to hack through the thickets of what now seems like purple prose.<br /><br />Hemingway has never been my favourite author from that era, but I have to concede that his writing, because of the journalistic brevity and lack of fancy synonyms and run-on sentences, has made him more readable than the aforementioned authors. “The river looked nice. It was always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris.” That’s a typical example of Papa’s stripped-down style in this novel. And that is the essence of his originality and main contribution to literature.<br /><br />It looks simple, but it’s not that simple to do. As Nathaniel Hawthorne noted, “Easy reading makes for damn hard writing.”<br /><br />For a first novel, this tale of expatriates in France and Spain has its shortcomings: overly long conversations (mostly in bars), a lack of character development, and little sense of what the opening quote from Gertrude Stein, “You are all a lost generation,” adds up to in the book. None of them seem all that lost to me. Lost in their bottles. Lost to each other, perhaps. But not lost in these alien cultures, which is the usual expat’s dilemma.<br /><br />Essentially a love story about the macho Jake, Hem’s stand-in character, and the beautiful British butterfly Brett Ashley, who flits from man to man, the narrative hits its stride when the characters arrive in Spain. Papa’s strongest points as a storyteller emerge when describing the running of the bulls in Pamplona, which continues to this day, along with the bullfights, and the chaotic, drunken revelry of the fiesta.<br /><br />Jake, and by extension the author, reserves his real love not for Brett but for the bullfighters. “Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the terrain of the bull. This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy. People went to the corrida to see Belmonte, to be given tragic sensations, and perhaps to see the death of Belmonte.”<br /><br />In the end, the multiple love stories implode and, because of the narrator’s reticence, not enough is felt. Still, it will be a long while before I get that image out of my head of what Brett does with the severed ear of the bull the matador gave her.<br /><br />This is not one of Hem’s masterpieces, contrary to all the hype, but as a workbook for him to work out his signature style of punchy, still influential, minimalism, and his manly subject matter, it is, nonetheless, a seminal novel.",2014-02-24

US,24478907,RWNRZZ1IP1833,0743297334,781452863,The Sun Also Rises,Books,4,0,0,N,N,"Hemmingway","Ernest Hemmingway’s book “The Sun Also Rises” is a fabulous depiction of life during the aftermath of the First World War amongst the popular “Lost Generation”. Hemmingway himself was one of these in the “Lost Generation.”<br />After the war he suffered injuries that made him impotent which fueled his nomadic and detached lifestyle. After the war he wandered around Paris for several years where he came to write “The Sun Also Rises” in which he could be portrayed as a parallel to the protagonist Jake. In “The Sun Also Rises” Hemmingway gives the reader an inside look into life through the eyes of Jake, a young intelligent writer fresh out of World War I. Along with his group of friends of other intellectual writers and musicians, Jake travels throughout Europe to end up Spain for the famous Bull Run where the story comes to an conclusion. Through out this book Jake and most other male characters become intoxicated with Lady Brett Ashley until it is protracted to the extent of creepy devotion in some cases. Brett is a very confident, strong willed woman who seems to stumble from man to man, always with a drink in her hand. This group of friends or rather Brett’s old and thrown out company, simply wander around aimlessly, living vicariously through their depressions and anxieties from the war but never without their most important entity, liquor. They seem to be enjoying life as it comes to them without too much purpose, as the “lost Generation” does. However Brett always seems to return to Jake even though she is reluctant to be with him due to him impotence. It seems to me, as if this book is a compilation of the many men of Lady Brett Ashley and the life they lead after her.<br /><br />Although the book does not seem to have a centralized plot, Hemmingway’s style of writing is adept and truly captures the readers mind and brings them onto the streets of Paris circa 1920’s. His writing is vivid and descriptive in nature and keeps the reader intrigued withholding just enough detail, leaving enough for the reader to imagine. All the while he is discrete enough in the events as to hint towards a drunken night that may or may not have led to sexual activities, letting the story really become our own imagination subconsciously. Hemmingway paints a beautiful picture but allows the reader to determine the colors. Which leads us, as the reader, to believe what we want to believe without even knowing that we planted in into our brains, in this way making the story ours. Which inflicts the reader with a deep connection to the book and to the author who so brilliantly wrote it. This makes me and probably many others enjoy Hemmingway’s numerous books. Although my Hemmingway literature is not quite up to par, certain characteristics have been noticeably constant, such as the descriptive, yet vagueness of his writing.  Amongst this was the central theme of the persona of the true men from the “Lost Generation.” Hemmingway simply put it “Enjoying living was learning to get your money’s worth and knowing when you had it.” (152) The lifestyle that these fellows live was as Hemmingway put it, getting your moneys worth and the fact of knowing it.  That is really all the “Lost Generation” was about learning when to get your money’s worth and living to the extent of learning this fact.",2014-02-21

The characters drank heavily, partied constantly, and engaged in casual affairs, but only Jake Barnes, the protagonist of the novel, seemed to express any remorse for his past actions. The characters Hemingway created seemed two-dimensional, focusing more on simple pleasure than anything with any weight. Although the novel is praised as an American classic and Hemingway’s masterpiece, The Sun Also Rises features many simple characters that are not extremely likable and undergo little change through the novel. Many argue that the characters are simply masking pain that the World War One created, but Jake fought in the war and shows more depth than any other characters.<br />Jake Barnes described his friends as shallow in the novel himself and said that he had a “disgusted feeling” around them in Chapter 14.  Jake stands as perhaps the only remotely realistic character; he shows sadness over his injury, feelings for Brett, and nostalgia for the time before World War One. Others, however, do not share the same realistic traits. Lady Brett Ashley hopped from lover to lover, Robert Cohn idolized beautiful woman, and Mike served as the bully of the novel. The characters never developed and remained flat throughout the progression of the novel.<br />Despite the popularity of Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises, the characters were displayed simplistically.

I understand why it is a milestone in<br />Twentieth Century literature, with the emergence of Hemingway's power-lifting of the language and his famous, \\""clean, well-lighted page.\\""  I acknowledge its deserved place in literary history.<br /><br />But it just didn't grab me.  Ennui and wasted lives--and prodigious amounts of alcohol--didn't hold my attention after awhile.  The characters' liberal use of the \\""n\\"" word (Amazon won't let me write it out) when they discuss a black prize fighter was jolting, but can perhaps be forgiven as a throwback to the times.  The insensate cruelty to animals was horrifying, but might be read metaphorically as symbolic of the characters' own wounds and their emotional goring of each other.  The anti-Semitism that runs through the novel, in terms of how the characters view Cohn, is hard to take in any time period and hard to excuse.  Okay, maybe that too is a reflection of the characters' times, especially considering what was coming in Europe.  But add the endless boozing, the occasional brawling, and the bloodied bulls, as well as the copious dialogue that leaves so much for the reader to fill in to try to figure out what's going on with these aimless people and their seemingly trivial lives, and The Souffle Never Rises for me.<br /><br />If you think this novel is great, I won't argue.  I just kept waiting for something to happen, for something definitive to occur, for some resolution of something, no matter how small.  Maybe that is the whole point.  For these characters of the Lost Generation, there is no answer.<br /><br />Probably the reason this tepid novel lives on is Hemingway's revolutionary use of language, which I'll grant is formidable, if not always gratifying.  Sometimes it just seems grating, like a rattling engine that needs oil.  I'll remember the language, if not the story.  The plot?  A group of useless, overindulged people get bored drinking in Paris, so they go to Spain to drink while looking at bullfights, and then they go home (undoubtedly to drink some more).

And drank.","This \\""classic\\"" is a huge disappointment, and I don't see why this was the book that catapulted Hemingway into a pantheon of great writers.<br /><br />Almost none of the elements of what constitute good fiction are in this book, such as any emotional or psychological growth among the characters. The main character, Jake, is really Hemingway, and this novel is a barely disguised diary of his time in Europe wasting time in cafes and bars with his friends, talking about their inability to write (hint: maybe it's because they were always drunk?) and in particular, his famous travels to Spain to watch and write about the bull-fights that mesmerized him. It is also about the love and lust several of the characters, including Jake, have for Lady Brette Ashley, a not-quite-divorced, penniless, beautiful and reckless woman who continually runs off with men she has just met, notwithstanding her engagement to Mike. She is supposed to be a sympathetic character, but her total lack of judgment, total lack of consideration for the feelings of others, and inability to pull her life together, don't earn sympathy in my book.<br /><br />In fact, the only character who I found even slightly sympathetic is Robert Cohn, a Jewish friend who became a boxer in part \\""to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton.\\"" Part of my disappointment in this book is that Hemingway opens the story writing absorbingly about Cohn, but then he lets Cohn disappear from the narrative for a very long time, leaving the reader to wonder what role he will play later in the story. Cohn also loves Brette (who doesn't?) and while his judgement in women is just as bad in this regard as all the rest of the men who fall for her, I felt his pain at having been able to run away with her for a week or so and then, as all her other lovers, get unceremoniously dumped for a newer face. Also, he knows he is disliked in this sophisticated crowd for being a Jew, and behind his back is called a slew of anti-Semitic names.<br /><br />Having just read The Paris Wife, a pretty good historical novel about Hemingway's first wife, Hadley, I also knew that The Sun Also Rises makes no mention of Hadley as a character, though they were married at the time of these experiences and she was with him in these travels. Though he dedicates the book to her, Hadley must have been enormously hurt to have been written out of this narrative, which Hemingway finalized with the help of one of his many drinking buddies, F. Scott Fitzgerald.<br /><br />Giving credit where credit is due, Hemingway's spare style of writing, often the subject of parody, can be arresting, but the repetition of the most mundane details is tiresome, as is much of the narrative:<br /><br />\\""I feel sorry about Cohn,\\"" Bill said. \\""He had an awful time.\\""<br /><br />\\""Oh, to hell with Cohn,\\"" I said.<br /><br />\\""Where do you suppose he went?\\""<br /><br />\\""Up to Paris.\\""<br /><br />\\""What do you suppose he'll do?<br /><br />\\""Oh, to hell with him.\\""<br /><br />Jake is almost alarmingly empty as a character; he is seemingly moved only by the artistry of the gifted matador and his love for the unattainable, impossible Brette, but his voice, Hemingway's voice, is stilted, spare and ultimately unsympathetic.<br /><br />The title of the book comes straight from Ecclesiastes, from which Hemingway quotes when the book opens, but the characters in the book usually miss the sunrise because they are sleeping off their mindless drunkenness from the night before. Maybe this \\""Lost Generation\\"" wouldn't have been quite so lost if they had all met at an AA meeting instead and made something of their lives.ind his back is called a slew of anti-Semitic names.<br /><br />Having just read The Paris Wife, a pretty good historical novel about Hemingway's first wife, Hadley, I also knew that The Sun Also Rises makes no mention of Hadley as a character, though they were married at the time of these experiences and she was with him in these travels.

After reading it the second time I decided to read some criticism on the work to see what I was missing. I found two helpful collections of critical essays: [[ASIN:1555460453 The Sun Also Rises]] edited by Harold Bloom and [[ASIN:0737701951 The Sun Also Rises]] edited by Kelly Wand, and a short, book-length treatment of the novel: [[ASIN:0805779620 The Sun Also Rises: A Novel of the Twenties]] by Michael S. Reynolds. I would recommend all three to anyone wanting to dive a bit deeper into Hemingway's novel. I have also spent a great deal of time thinking and reflecting on the novel. I have been trying to figure out what I liked about the novel and why I did not like it more than I did. I have reached some tentative conclusions. I will try to share some of those conclusions in my review. I definitely think this novel is worth reading even if you do not enjoy it.<br /><br />SUMMARY OF THE BOOK AND SOME OF THE THEMES<br /><br />The novel follows a group of American and British expatriates in Paris. Jake is the war wounded narrator, Brett is the woman that pretty much all the men are in love with, Mike is Brett's fiance, Robert Cohn is the Jewish boxer who tends to be the punching bag of the group, and Bill is an American writer. Jake takes a trip every year to the San Fermin festival in Pamplona to see the bullfights and he invites the rest of the gang to go along. The novel is really about the changing relationships between the characters. Anyone expecting a really dramatic story is going to be disappointed. Traditionally the novel has been viewed as a portrait of the so-called \\""lost generation\\"". Virtually all the characters in the novel, with the possible exception of Cohn, have been wounded in some way by the war, and there is no doubt that the characters in the novel are all suffering from a lack of sustaining values. However, Hemingway himself, apparently, did not like the term \\""lost generation\\"" even though he used Gertrude Stein's quote as one of the epigraphs for the book.<br /><br />There are really two central conflicts in the novel. The first is obvious and revolves around Robert Cohn's love for Brett. Robert Cohn is the only character who did not fight in the war and he is the only character who still believes wholeheartedly in Romantic love. He is the least cynical character in the book. He is, perhaps, a bit of a Don Quixote figure, still defending an outmoded value system. This gets him into trouble with Brett with whom he has a short affair. The relationship between Cohn and Brett highlights the dangers inherent in all relationships. If the two parties have different ideas about what the relationship is about, and different value systems in general, there is likely to be miscommunication, misunderstanding, and heart-break.<br /><br />Cohn's conflict is the obvious conflict but, as Michael S. Reynolds points out in his book, the central conflict really revolves around Jake. It is difficult for the reader to pick up on the central conflict (I missed its importance until I read Reynolds' book) because Jake tends to make himself invisible in his narration. Jake is also in love with Brett but because of an unfortunate war wound is incapable of physical love. Brett seems to love Jake as well but cannot settle for a non-physical relationship so Jake has to watch her sleep around with other men. Jake has a real love for bullfighting. He goes to the bullfights every year and he is the only American that the Spanish respect as possessing aficion, or passion, about the bullfights. Bullfighting gives Jake some sustaining values: courage, honor and artistry, among them. However, Jake is unable to say no to Brett, and winds up pimping her out (Cohn's words) to the bullfighter Pedro Romero. A Spanish hotel owner with whom Jake has had a relationship for a number of years sees this and by the end of the novel the two are no longer on speaking terms. This is, as Reynolds argues, the central tragedy of the book. Jake was given a moral test and he failed, and his trips to Pamplona, if he continues them, will never be the same.<br /><br />There are lots of interesting themes in the novel. There is, of course, the theme of emasculation. Jake is emasculated in the war and is further emasculated in his relationship to Brett. Despite Hemingway's reservations about the term \\""lost generation\\"" the destruction of traditional values after the war is clearly another theme of the novel. Jake and his group do not really have a sustaining philosophy of life. At one point Jake claims that \\""Enjoying living was learning to get your money's worth\\"" but claims that in five years that philosophy will \\""seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I've had\\"" (148). Jake also claims \\""I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it\\"" (148). Technically Jake is Catholic but we learn throughout the book that he does not have much religious feeling. That is, perhaps, another casualty of the war. So, throughout the novel, we see a group of people trying to figure out how to live, and not doing all that great a job at it.<br /><br />Another theme that I found very interesting is the return to more primitive, one might say pagan, value systems as a replacement for Christianity. This shows up in a number of places in the book. Jake and Bill go on a fishing trip in Burguete and meet a British man named Harris and they all go to visit a monastery. They all agree it is a remarkable place but, Bill asks, \\""It isn't the same as fishing though, is it?\\"" The others agree that it is not. Clearly, there is an attempt to return to nature here, and nature is viewed as more reinvigorating than traditional religion. The only time the reader gets any sense of health reading this novel is in the descriptions of nature and in the characters' contact with nature. There is also an interesting mix between the Christian and the pagan in the San Fermin festival. It is, in name at least, a Christian festival in honor of a Christian saint, but the practice of bullfighting (sacrificing the bull) is a much more primitive religious practice, and it is clear that all of the characters, especially Jake, are much more moved by the bullfighting than they are by the Christian aspects of the festival. There is, it seems to me, an attempt in the novel to move back to a more primitive form of religion to find some sustaining values after the collapse of Christianity. There is a similarity here between Hemingway's novel and T.S. Eliot's poem [[ASIN:0393974995 The Waste Land (Norton Critical Editions)]].<br /><br />WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THE BOOK OR WHAT HEMINGWAY DID WELL<br /><br />Now, before I try to explain what I did not like about the novel I want to highlight a few things I liked about the novel. First, Hemingway does a great job portraying powerful emotions. There is an interesting exchange between William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway that I think is relevant. William Faulkner criticized Hemingway by saying \\""He has never been known to use a word that might send a reader to the dictionary\\"". Hemingway replied by saying \\""Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words?\\"" Personally, I much prefer Faulkner to Hemingway, but Hemingway definitely has a point here. Sometimes simple and direct is more powerful. There is a scene where Mike and Robert Cohn get into a fight. Mike calls Robert Cohn a steer because he is always \\""hanging about so\\"". Hemingway (or Jake) simply writes \\""We were embarrassed\\"". That is all that is necessary to convey the discomfort and the powerful emotions broiling beneath the surface of the scene. It is a very painful scene to read.<br /><br />There is another scene where Brett says \\""Oh darling...I'm so miserable\\"" and Jake replies \\""You were happy a minute ago\\"" and Brett replies again \\""It's all gone\\"". To me, that is much more powerful than if Brett hadtried to write an impromptu poem expressing her misery or provide some literary metaphor for her depression (\\""it is as wide and deep as the ocean\\"" or something like that). Just saying \\""I'm so miserable\\"" is more powerful than any literary trope which will tend to sound contrived. There is really an emotional hell just beneath all the quiet stoicism and ironic detachment of this novel and Hemingway does a great job conveying that in very few words. It is part of the reason reading the novel is not always all that pleasant of an experience. We can feel the misery and despair that is just beneath all the supposed gaiety. Hemingway also used to say that writers should portray how people actually feel rather than how they think they are supposed to feel. He definitely lives up to that. We have, I think, a lot of misconceptions about love. Love is a very complex emotion that is mixed up with a lot of other emotions and not all of them are positive. Pride and jealousy, for example, both play a huge role in the emotion we call love. Hemingway portrays the complexity of love, and the destructive ingredients of love, quite well.<br /><br />Another thing I appreciated about the novel was Hemingway's sparse style in his descriptions of nature. I have been reading Henry David Thoreau recently, and as much as I love Thoreau, and as great a naturalist as he was, Thoreau still gets caught up in some of the standard literary tropes when describing nature. It does not feel direct. It is mediated by literature. Hemingway describes nature directly. There is actually a place in the book where he writes \\""The trees were green\\"" (94) and that is his entire description of the trees. There are no descriptions of Apollo driving his winged chariot across the sky, etc.. Hemingway cuts all that away. If I am honest with myself I really prefer a slightly more ornate style. I prefer Faulkner to Hemingway. However, I do think that Hemingway's sparse style was necessary. It was like a cleansing forest fire. It removed a bunch of sick and dead foliage and allowed new shoots to bloom in literature. For that I am very grateful to Hemingway.<br /><br />REASONS I DID NOT LIKE THE BOOK MORE THAN I DID<br /><br />The first thing to be said is: I am a philosophy student. I love ideas and I enjoy metaphysical speculation. Hemingway was not really a philosopher. He was clearly more interested in character and emotion. There is big emotion in this book but there are not really any big ideas in it (none that I have found anyways). I have a feeling that Hemingway would have considered metaphysical speculation unhealthy. While I can appreciate that standpoint to life it does not change the fact that I tend to prefer novels that have big ideas in them or helpful insights into life. There are not that many helpful insights into life in the novel. There is not a lot of wisdom to be found. The characters are all lost, trying to figure out how to live in the world, and while they are certain that the old ways of living in the world are no longer possible, they do not yet have much to offer in their place. The lack of big ideas and insights into life is one reason I did not like the novel more than I did.<br /><br />There is also a lack of sincerity in the novel. A number of critics really loved the fishing scene with Jake and Bill. They seemed to think it highlighted Bill's humor. To me, it highlighted Bill's incessant sarcasm and lack of sincerity. When they eat lunch they have kind of a mock saying of grace. I find this inability to be sincere to be a rather annoying trait. The characters are all very cynical and they clearly despise (at least at times) the one character who does not entirely share in their cynicism: Robert Cohn. To me, Robert Cohn and Brett Ashley were the most sympathetic characters in the book. Robert Cohn may be delusional but at least he believes in something and is willing to look foolish in defending what he believes. Brett Ashley may make emotional mincemeat out of most of the men in her life but she does not seem cruel to me. She is just wounded and desperate. From the criticism I read on the novel, however, it does not seem like most readers share my views. Most readers think that Cohn and Brett are very unsympathetic characters. If that is how Hemingway intended them it goes a long way towards explaining why I did not like the book more than I did. I think novelists should always try to understand their characters and genuine understanding always breeds sympathy. If a character is portrayed as extremely unsympathetic chances are they are a cardboard cutout character, with no real depth, enlightened by a merely superficial gaze.<br /><br />The novel is also quite depressing. It is, in my opinion, much more depressing than more openly nihilistic novels (Celine and Beckett, for example). The characters are all caught up in what the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard called the aesthetic existential sphere. There is despair beneath the surface of the aesthetic sphere but it is unconscious. Openly nihilistic novels are expressions of conscious despair. In [[ASIN:0691020280 The Sickness Unto Death]] Kierkegaard argues that unconscious despair is worse than conscious despair. At least the person who experiences conscious despair is aware that they are sick and searching for a cure. The characters in this novel are attempting to drown their despair in alcohol and sex rather than facing it directly. It gives the novel a very unhealthy feeling that made it difficult for me to read at times. Perhaps that is what Hemingway intended. If so, he definitely succeeded. It is definitely powerful. Still, it reduced my enjoyment of the novel somewhat. The despair in the novel is slightly contagious and I found myself getting sucked into it at times.<br /><br />One final observation and then I will bring this overly long review to a close. Part of my problem with the novel may be my own fault. It is possible I am reading the novel as if it were a nineteenth-century novel. I assume that Hemingway is trying to say something, that he wants the reader to adopt a particular position in relation to his characters, and that might not be the case. I may be assuming too much about the judgments that I think Hemingway wants me to make about his characters, and I tend to disagree with the judgments I think Hemingway wants me to make. For example, I assume that Hemingway approves of Jake's stoicism and disapproves of Cohn's lack of stoicism. Jake suffers silently while Cohn's primary sin seems to be that he is unwilling to suffer silently, to suck it up, so to speak. I do not agree with the values behind that judgment, so if that is the judgment that Hemingway wants the reader to make, it is another reason I did not enjoy the novel more than I did. However, it is possible that Hemingway is not expecting any particular judgments from the reader. Modern novels do not tell the reader what to think in the same way that older novels do. The reader is allowed to make up their own mind. Things happen, and those events effect different characters in particular ways, but there is no God's eye view from which to decide which reactions are \\""good\\"" and which are \\""bad\\"". So, if I could convince myself that Hemingway is simply holding a mirror up to a particular time and place, and leaving it up to the reader to form their own judgments, I would, I think, enjoy the novel much more than I did.tried to write an impromptu poem expressing her misery or provide some literary metaphor for her depression (\\""it is as wide and deep as the ocean\\"" or something like that).

This story doesn't really seem to be about anything.  The true meaning must be taken more from symbols and allusion rather than the direct actions of the characters.<br /><br />The story follows a group of bored socialites as they travel from Paris to Pamplona, Spain in post World War I Europe, no doubt in search of some kind of meaning for their morally bankrupt lives.  The group spends several days in Pamplona watching the running of the bulls and the bull fights, before splitting up and going back to their respective homes.<br /><br />Ernest Hemingway is considered by many to be one of America's most brilliant writers, winning both the Nobel Prize for Literature, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.  A brilliant writer, but ultimately unhappy it seems.  He was married four times and eventually took his own life in 1961.  The Sun Also Rises was Hemingway's first novel, written in 1924 and published in 1926.<br /><br />William Hurt became one of my favorite audio book narrators after hearing only one of his books, Stephen King's Hearts in Atlantis.  He has a really unusual style that, at first, sounds odd and bewildering.  After listening to him for a while, however, he really grew on me.  Frankly, I don't think I would have picked up this audiobook if he hadn't been the narrator.  I enjoyed his reading again, although I can't honestly pinpoint what it is I like about him.<br /><br />The Sun Also Rises was a tough one for me.  On the surface, it seems to be a story about wealthy people who lead empty and meaningless lives.  In part, I think that's what Ernest Hemingway intended, but why are their lives so empty?  I did a bit of reading up on this novel, looking at what other people had to say about it.  They throw around words like \\""expatriate\\"" and \\""disillusioned\\"" and \\""lost generation.\\""  Why this so-called \\""lost generation\\"" became so \\""disillusioned\\"" that they \\""expatriated\\"" themselves is beyond me.  Were they disillusioned with humanity because of the war, or was it just America's involvement in the war?  I guess I'll have to leave that up to the scholars.  Even though I didn't really get this audiobook, I learned a lot about the running of the bulls in Pamplona, and also about a little slice of American history as well.ey disillusioned with humanity because of the war, or was it just America's involvement in the war?

While Hemingway's Jake Barnes in The Sun Also Rises has been made impotent by a WWI wound, he bears his fate with stoicism, dignity and even detachment, whereas the draft card and Vietnam medal burning protestors and soldiers of the `60s express pure rage.  Hemingway's code of demonstrating manliness by standing one's ground \\""with grace\\"" as the Cape Buffalo charges would be viewed as absurd and insane by the spectrum of 60's activists from students to professors to clerics to housewives.<br /><br />Which is not to say Hemingway's people are ethically decent at all times.  Robert Cohen is treated shabbily notwithstanding his Princeton education and championship boxing ability.  Jake Barnes and his waspy cohort refer to Cohen's pushiness, hang-dog tagging along and even his nose in conversations both direct and implicit regarding his Jewishness.  The bullying and belittling of Cohen to a significant degree drives the plot, making it impossible to avoid reading Cohen as a ready-made character that relieves Hemingway from the labor of character development.  One also wonders if this shortcut reflects the author's personal view of Jews?<br /><br />I have read The Sun Also Rises at least a half dozen times since the 60s but only lately have thoughts of the author as bully occurred.  Which raises the question, do the attitudes of the times affect ones reaction to literature or does a text deemed great in one era succumb to cultural shifts in another?",2013-05-03

Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, and other members of the post-WWI \\""Lost Generation.\\"" \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"" is a novelization based on this Paris caf&eacute; society as well as on Hemingway's 1925 trip to Spain. It is an astonishing, riveting book. It is hard to believe that Hemingway wrote the first draft in two months, and that it was published when he was only 27 years old.<br /><br />Jake Barnes is the narrator of the book, a working journalist with friends in the \\""Lost Generation\\"" caf&eacute; society of Paris during the jazz age of the Roaring 20's. Jake suffered an unspecified wound during the Great War, rendering him impotent. Jake's true love is Lady Brett Ashley, a thoroughly modern woman who has been through two divorces and now has a new fianc&eacute;, Mike. Robert Cohn, a Jewish boxer and Bill Gorton, a novelist, round out the group of friends. They decide to attend the Festival of San Ferm&iacute;n in Pamplona, Spain and witness the \\""running of the bulls\\"" and bullfighting firsthand. Cohn, who had an affair with Brett, is unable to contain his jealousy and the group slowly disintegrates.<br /><br />The bullfighting scenes are breathtaking. Brett falls for the young matador Romero, and we see and learn to appreciate his artistry in the bull ring. The matador faces the existential nothingness in the charge of the bull, and puts down death with the thrust of his sword. Hemingway effectively contrasts the authenticity (living life fully) of bullfighting and of the working man (Jake), who continually pays the bills, with the inauthentic expatriates of the time living on inherited money. \\""Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bull-fighters.\\""<br /><br />In the terrific middle section of the book, which serves as a kind of interlude between The Paris and Pamplona sections, Jake and Bill go on a fishing trip in Spain. The bus trip with the Basques and the spare descriptions of the days at the river and the beautiful scenery is therapeutic for Jake and simply glows for the reader. It is all about the redemptive power of nature and is a rebirth of sorts for the two after the debauchery of Paris, after the horrors of war, and as \\""men without women.\\""<br /><br />Hemingway always tried to write truthfully, and the book contains many quotes that stood out to me.  Jake says, \\""It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.\\"" An elderly gentleman called The Count observes, \\""It is because I have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well. That is the secret. You must get to know the values.\\"" Also, when Brett talks about Mike she says, \\""He's so damned nice, and he's so awful. He's my sort of thing.\\""<br /><br />Interestingly, the novel is a roman &agrave; clef, meaning that the characters and action are based on ones in the real world. Hemingway and his wife visited the festival in Pamplona for a third time in 1925 and took with them Hemingway's boyhood friend Bill Smith, Donald Ogden Stewart, Lady Duff Twysden (recently divorced), her lover Pat Guthrie, and Harold Loeb. \\""In Pamplona the group quickly disintegrated. Hemingway, attracted to Lady Duff, was jealous of Loeb, who had recently been on a romantic getaway with her; by the end of the week the two men had a public fistfight. Against this background was the influence of the young matador from Ronda, Cayetano Ord&oacute;&ntilde;ez, whose brilliance in the bullring affected the spectators. Ord&oacute;&ntilde;ez honored Hemingway's wife Hadley by presenting her, from the bullring, with the ear of a bull he killed. Outside of Pamplona, the fishing trip to the Irati River (near Burguete in Navarre) was marred by polluted water. Hemingway intended to write a non-fiction book about bullfighting but thought thatthe week's experiences had presented him with enough material for a novel.\\"" Wikipedia contributors. \\""The Sun Also Rises.\\"" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

I have read nearly all of his novels and admire his devotion to writing insofar as he lived humbly in Paris among the Lost Generation to establish himself as a novelist. He paid his existential and literary dues as a novelist and was richly rewarded for his gifts. \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"" is an early work and, although one can see his promise as a novelist, this particular novel suffers from a green, preening style, which may well the case of early autobiographically consuming novels. The book is taken from Hemingway's experiences in Paris on the Left Bank, the fiestas of Pamplona during the running of the bulls and fishing for trout in the mountains of Northern Spain. Despite the relative immaturity of his style he was an innovator: he was one of the early novelists to write dialogue with a truly sensitive ear attuned toward the ways in which ordinary people spoke to each other. He was committed to creating verisimilitude in dialogue and dialect. The characters cover themselves in their conversations with the slang of the day: \\""Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, (sic) you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship...The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on.\\"" One claim he makes, the truth of which may not be denied, is that we certainly pay for the things that we do: \\""You paid some way for everything that was any good.\\"" So Hemingway produces a literary style for dialogue that is so readily played out in the novelists who follow him and becomes so advanced in its execution by them that a work like \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"" almost seems a parody in many places. It must be one of the most quoted works in the Good Bad Hemingway Contest held annually which both praises and parodies his novels. He writes in criticism of another writer that \\""He's through... He's written about all the things he knows, and now he's on all the things he doesn't know.\\"" Hemingway always wrote about the things that he knew from first-hand experience: war, fishing, writing, Cuba, Key West, the UP of Michigan, Paris, safari and women. Hem was a man of half as many wives as Henry VIII. Although he knew many women intimately, he didn't really understand them fully. I find that in many places Hemingway's women, even Lady Brett Ashley, play over and over again primarily as helpless objects of desire. In this book like most of his other characters Brett is a flat character and a stereotype for women of his era. I also found that other minorities (Jews, Afro-Americans) seem diminished in his work except for bull fighters and fishermen, essentially they are servants to a greater or lesser extent. Later in the \\""Old Man and the Sea\\"" clearly this is not the case but it is true here in this book. He still has not yet really developed the sense of humanity which would emerge later to earn him a Nobel Prize for Literature. The male characters also seem flat with the Jewish boxer, Robert Cohn, and his hedonistic friends, Bill and the drunken Michael. He draws the bullfighter, Romero, a Spanish Romeo quite elegantly because he imbues in this character the deep respect Hemingway had for the courageous bullfighters and also portrays the bulls themselves as heroic, magnificent forces of nature, downstream like the great marlin, doomed by man's tragic desire to conquer and kill them for sport or sustenance as God similarly may play with mankind. Jake Barnes is a well drawn figure because he is Hemingway. It's as if Hemingway created Robert Cohn to be himself like a boxer, and Mike like the big drinker and the Hemingway women as the objects of desire that he sought. The book is poorly edited: I know, sorry, not withstanding Maxwell Perkins this is heresy but I stand by my claim. The stories about the fiesta at Pamplona and running of the bulls and the trout fishing and Brett with Romero weave a compelling tale worth reading. His writing about bull fighting and fishing attest to his fascination with both sports and elsewhere in hunting on safari. Then there is, of course, the elegant innuendo of the unfortunate war wound, one of the great scars of life for a man devoted to total immersion in his existential experience: none of us go through life without scars and a few may become immortal but rarely do we come out alive in the end. By all means read Hemingway but perhaps not this novel.

The novel is short; at only 251 pages, it can be read in a few hours (although you'll want to read it slowly, since Hemingway packs so much into each short, declarative sentence).  Despite it's length, reading the book is like alternating between running through mud and running on pavement.  Sometime the prose is captivating, but at other times it is frustrating to deal with such annoying characters. How can Robert Cohn be so spineless? Why can't Brett Ashley understand that she's leading these men on? What is Jake trying to get out of pursuing Brett?<br /><br />What I ended up enjoying most about the book, and contemplating for some time after, were the same things that annoyed me when reading.  The characters are flawed, annoying, constantly giving in to emotion and self-indulgence, but these things make them real. I can compare them to people in my own life; I can imagine how these people actually are.  Hemingway is able to successfully convey how these people are because he omits so much. If he described their appearances and antics with too much detail, they would become difficult to relate to, but by keeping them somewhat mysterious, like a new acquaintance, they become easier to understand and fit into what I know.<br /><br />Unfortunately I cannot comment on how \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"" compares to his other works.

It roared into the Roaring Twenties and Prohibition, a generation reeling from the disillusionment of World War I and ready for liberation from suffocating Victorian social strictures and the existing cumbersome florid literary style.<br /><br />The Sun Also Rises  appeals especially to the young hedonist whose parents never \\""did it\\"" in daytime and felt guilty if they did it for any purpose but procreation. The book gushes with drinking scenes that tantalized alcohol-parched Americans whose access to liquor had been severely restricted for years. The characters behave less like mature adults than kids who've just reached drinking age.<br /><br />If the appeal of booze and an airy new way of writing weren't enough, Brett Ashley, the female lead and possibly the first truly liberated woman in American literature, ensured the book's success. In the United States, women had in 1920 only just acquired the right to vote. And here was a beautiful mature woman enjoying unmarried sex with serial partners of her choosing while wearing a man's hat and short hair. What a seismic shock to conservative Midwestern values.<br /><br />Hemingway was only twenty-four when he wrote The Sun Also Rises. He'd barely begun to live. At eighteen he'd spent a mere five weeks in military uniform before he was injured, convalesced in a hospital and got sent home. How could a twenty-four-year-old who'd never even been to college know much worth writing about other than his war experience, which the book hardly mentions? Perhaps there's an answer in the way Hemingway hurled himself at life. Life excited him. He lived the hedonistic lifestyle for which so many post-Victorian readers hungered. But he also reflected on himself and the behavior of those around him and wrote about what he noticed.<br /><br />It's interesting that both The Sun Also Rises and The Great Gatsby are about young men  obsessing over beautiful but shallow women and were written at about the same time (Feb '25 for Gatsby and Oct '26 for TSAR) by two young men who were had been close friends.<br /><br />[May contain spoilers]Synopsis: Three expatriate American writers, Jake, Bill and Cohn, rendezvous in Paris before leaving on a holiday trip to the bullfight fiesta in Pamplona, Spain, accompanied by a beautiful British divorcee and her new beau, Michael, also a Brit. Jake narrates the story and is in love with Brett but impotent due to his war injury. She professes to be in love with Jake but they are not intimate. On the way to Pamplona, Jake and Bill go fishing and Cohn goes off to be seduced by Brett.<br /><br />In Pamplona there is a lot of drinking and misbehaving and they attend the bull-fights. Brett becomes enamored with a champion young matator, Romero, and seduces him. Cohn, jealous, confronts them and severely beats Romero, who must go into the ring the next day despite his injuries. Cohn also fights with the other two Americans. Brett runs off with Romero for an affair and a week later expels him and calls Jake to help her reunite with Michael.<br /><br />Jake's impotency is a twist that doesn't seem to have much purpose other than to neutralize the narrator by insulating him from being a full-on competitor to Cohn for Brett's affections. Jake's neutered status does pique the curiosity. Perhaps it stems from Hemingway's experience convalescing in hospital from the war injuries that handicapped him temporarily in bed. (Brett's complaints of being sexually frustrated may have originated with Hemingway's nurse and paramour, Agnes.)<br /><br />The Sun Also Rises  is about the emptiness of idle self-indulgence. Through the voice of Jake Barnes, Hemingway expresses his groping quest for meaning and morality. The book holds up the mirror to a group of misbehaving expatriates and says, \\""Here, look at yourselves!\\""<br />An absurd premise for the book might be that immorality is whatever makes you feel guilty:<br />[Jake, drunk and narrating] \\""...I wished Mike would not behave so terribly to Cohn, though. ...I liked to see him hurt Cohn. I wished he would not do it, though, because afterward it made me disgusted at myself. That was morality; things that made you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality.\\"" Is this the musing of a drunkard or are we supposed to take it seriously?<br /><br />Throughout the book, Jake gropes into moral territory, reflecting the view that life is just a series of transactions, this-for-that value exchanges. This view appears six or seven times, on pages 34, 67, 78, 152-153, 156, & 237.<br />Brett (p.34): \\""'Don't we pay for all the things we do? ...When I think of the hell I've put chaps through. [meaning torturing men with her provocative sexuality] I'm paying for it now.'\\"" [meaning she's the one now being tortured by denial of sexual relations with Jake, whom she professes to love, due to his impotency.] The operative phrase here is \\""we pay for all the things we do.\\""<br /><br />The values concept appears next during a string of scenes involving Count Mippipopolous (pp. 60-71):<br />[The Count] \\""'You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well. Don't you find it like that?' [He feels he's earned the right to enjoy life. He's entitled because he's paid his dues.]<br /><br />'Yes. Absolutely.' [Jake]<br /><br />`I know,' said the count. `That is the secret. You must get to know the values.'<br /><br />`Doesn't anything ever happen to your values?' Brett asked.<br /><br />`No. Not any more.'<br /><br />`Never fall in love?'<br /><br />`Always,' said the count. `I am always in love.'<br /><br />`What does that do to your values?'<br /><br />`That, too, has got a place in my values.'<br /><br />`You haven't any values. You're dead, that's all.'<br /><br />`No, my dear. You're not right. I'm not dead at all.'\\""<br /><br />Here the theory of life as a series of transactions, value for value, is asserted by the Count and Jake agrees. Brett probes for a weak spot in the theory, implying that love trumps everything, but the Count sticks by his assertion that suffering (he's been to war and is battle scarred) entitles one to appreciate the good life.<br /><br />The values theme appears next on page 78: [Bill] \\""`...Simple exchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog.'<br /><br />`We'll get one on the way back.' [Jake]<br /><br />`All right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with un-bought stuffed dogs.'\\""<br /><br /> This is a minor repetition of the theme, hardly worth mentioning except as a reminder that sometimes the exchange of values may seem out of balance.<br /><br />Having prepared the reader, Hemingway next takes the philosophy of the value exchange much deeper on page 152:<br /><br />[Jake, narrating] \\""I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one swell thing you could count on.<br /><br />I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money's worth and knowing when you had it. [emphasis added] You could get your money's worth. The world was a good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years, I thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I've had.<br /><br />Perhaps that wasn't true, though. Perhaps as you went along you did learn something. I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you learned from that what it was all about.\\""<br /><br /> The above passage includes an outright declaration of Jake's transactional theory as the \\""...exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else.\\"" What could be more clear?<br /><br />Next Jake applies his transactional theory to the mundane act of reading a book (p. 153):<br /><br />[Jake, narrating, drunk]\\""I knew that now, reading it in the over-sensitized state of my mind after much too much brandy, I would remember it somewhere, and afterward it would seem as though it had really happened to me.

That was another good thing you paid for and then had.\\""<br /><br /> On page 156 is another reflection on life as exchange transactions:<br /><br />[Jake, narrating about the peasants] \\""They had come in so recently from the plains and the hills that it was necessary that they make their shifting in values gradually. They could not start in paying cafe prices. They got their money's worth in the wine-shops. Money still had a definite value in hours worked and bushels of grain sold. Late in the fiesta it would not matter what they paid, nor where they bought.\\""<br /><br /> This is another minor reference to values, reinforcing the transactional concept.<br /><br />On page 237 the values concept is mentioned one last time before the meaning of the book is fully revealed in the denoument:<br /><br />[Jake, narrating, about being back in France] \\""It felt comfortable to be in a country where it is so simple to make people happy. ...Everything is on such a clear financial basis in France.

She mentions repeatedly how good or \\""set-up\\"" she feels after her conquest, which also destroyed Jake's dearly earned reputation among the afficiones of Pamplona.

She then turns her attention to Jake and how good he could have made her feel if things were different: \\""'Oh, Jake,' Brett said, `we could have had such a damned good time together.'\\""<br /><br />  But Jake has wised up: \\""'Yes,' I said. `Isn't it pretty to think so.'\\""<br /><br /> From Brett's angle, life is a string of transactions skewed in her favor.

Hemmingway's first novel, The Sun Also Rises, is anticlimactic and uninteresting, however his writing style is a treat, which leads me to the conclusion that although Hemmingway had a talent for writing effective sentences, at this point in his career he hadn't quite become a good storyteller.<br /><br />The story brought the reader along on a ride of people with money, no morality to drive them, too much time on their hands and a bordom of what to do with themselves. So the story is essentially made up of the characters going to clubs, and restaurants, arguing/joking in a drunken stupor and then eventually deciding to go do the same thing during the bullfights in Spain. That may sound interesting but in Spain it's the same story, they do nothing new, and there is no climax. The only thing close to a climax is that Brett cheats on Michael with another man, but the way he describes their interaction is dull and he doesn't present it in a way that hooks you. It was way too obvious and you knew it was coming.<br /><br />As for the writing, there is a lot to learn from. In some ways it shows how impactful terse sentences can be. There were times when I was caught off guard by the imagery that came to mind through his simple statements, but that can only be appreciated for so long. The long descriptions of Spanish countryside for instance made an already slow story come to a complete halt.<br /><br />So to sum it up, the story is slow and nothing that anyone in LA or modern times hasn't seen a million times over. The one thing I find interested is that I didn't realize that society then was so similar to society today: so hopeless, hedonistic and foolish in nature. Let me put it this way, if you aren't looking to be entertained, but would like literary insight on creating terse, yet impactful sentences, then this is the book for you. The book is a piece of history in Hemmingway's career when he hadn't quite found something interesting to say, but it's interesting none-the-less because of the way he says it.",2012-11-08

It has some first novel problems, namely issues with structure in certain places.  There are digressions that really aren't that important, and as hard as the author tries to understate matters, some things are beaten into your head and other details, important details, are surprisingly easy to miss.<br /><br />But the thing that makes this so complicated to review is the characters' overt anti-Semitism and utter unlikeability.  One wonders if this combination of being unlikeable and also anti-Semitic is some accident, or if Hemingway really wanted to make clear that the only characters with even the vaguest sense of honor in the book are Jake, who tolerates the Jewish character, Cohn, and Cohn himself.  At some point, Brett even points out that the rest of the characters are even worse than Cohn despite them making so many digs at his religious background.  One wonders why Cohn even wanted to associate himself with this crowd.<br /><br />But one wonders even more which side of the fence Hemingway came down on.  The novel is based on his own real-life experiences of a trip to Pamplona, so we have to wonder which of the characters really reflects him.  Did he hate Jews, and doesn't realise how unlikeable and hateful his characters are, or are they a means to show the inherent contradictions of the idle aristocrats of the 20s expat community?  One wonders indeed, and it is quite uncomfortable for a modern person to be left wondering along these lines.<br /><br />That said, the writing quality is excellent and is in the typical no-nonsense Hemingway style, but this can be a very emotionally complicated book to read, especially for a Jewish person.

After finishing The Paris Wife by Paula McLain my fellow book club members wanted to know more about Ernest and Hadley's life among the \\""Lost Generation,\\"" so we agreed to read Hemingway's novel about that period to see if more details were available.  Yes, there are more details but no, they're not particularly interesting.<br /><br />THE SUN ALSO RISES was Hemingway's first successful book.  It's no secret that the hero, Jake Barnes, was Hemingway's portrayal of himself.  He never attempted to hide that or the identities of the friends he and Hadley consorted with as he depicted them in the book.  Several became ex-friends after the book was published.  Hadley, the love of his life for a while, was never even mentioned in the book although several other women had prominent parts in his narration.  Lady Brett was patterned after a woman who was prominent in Ernest and Hadley's life,  perhaps more prominent than Hadley suspected.  Hemingway eventually had the good sense to dedicate the novel to Hadley, realizing her displeasure at her omission.<br /><br />The book is a record of the meanderings of friends without much to do except ramble around, drink heavily, squabble with each other, eat a lot, and attend bull fights.  There's not much chicken on those bones.  It's a novel that comes across as stodgy and outdated, with the narrative somewhat unrealistic.  It's not likely that the worldly characters Hemingway portrays would eschew the use of profanity in real life, although I can't recall a single cuss word being spoken in the book, even during insults and the administration of drunken beatings.<br /><br />The question, therefore, is what has the book got going for it?  Most emphatically, one has to say, it's got Hemingway's nonpareil writing skills.  People aspiring to be writers can only drool at his ability to forego the use of adjectives while implanting a vivid scene in his readers' minds.  As an example, I offer Hemingway's description of arriving at Pamplona by car:  \\""...there were trees along both sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the road went on, very white and straight ahead, and then lifted to a little rise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings close around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and shifting in the wind.\\""<br /><br />As a reader, one forges ahead breathlessly through mundane plot and archaic conversation to delight in spare and magnificent word craft.  And so it is with most of Hemingway's works.

I have read it and re-read it many times. It had been a few years since my last reading and when my wife and daughter came home with a 1960's collection of his novels that they bought at a garage sale for me for only a mere three dollars, I decided to give it another go. Conclusion: it is still great.<br /><br />This was Hemingway's first novel. It comes in around 90,000 words, is paced very well, and shows the foundation of Hemingway's ground breaking style of the time. The book is simple, primarily made up dialogue, of which Hemingway is a master, and broken up with stark descriptions of the country. The Sun Also Rises was an instant hit when it was published by Scribners in 1926 and made Hemingway a newly discovered star among critics and readers. It is, in my opinion, his finest work.<br /><br />I have read all of Hemingway's work. He is most certainly the king of the short story, a fine novel writer, and superb letter writer. He holds no punches when it comes to character and allows the reader to form his/her own opinion when it comes to them. Several times while reading The Sun Also Rises, I put the book down and commented on how much I loved the book. What I enjoy most about it is that Hemingway allows the reader to read between the lines, not an easy task and one that I try to do in my own writing. I like that not everything needs to be explained; that assumptions can be made. I enjoy forming my opinion on the matter. As a reader, I should be able to judge and convict at my will.<br /><br />So, for those that love Hemingway and if you have not read The Sun Also Rises in a long while, I recommend picking up this classic and burying yourself in 1920's France and Spain for a while. It will make you laugh and cringe as Jake and the gang tear up the countryside in search of a good time while trying to come to grips with lost love, forbidden love, and new found love.

His writing is clear and the story never drags.  The book struck me as a \\""Seinfeld novel,\\"" that is, an interesting story about nothing.  At the novel's beginning, Hemingway offers Gertrude Stein's famous statement about the \\""lost generation\\"" of post-World War I Europe.  The characters in this story are definitely lost, or at least alcoholics.  Nearly every scene involves the consumption of a lot of alcohol; I was surprised any of the characters could stand, let alone relate Hemingway's crisp prose.  The Seinfeld comment aside, the novel centers on an American journalist who lives in France and travels to Spain with a group of friends.  All of the friends are damaged goods in various ways, but mostly they seem bored and heartbroken (not in the romantic sense of heartbreak, but the spiritual sense).  In the aftermath of the Great War they simply do not know how to comprehend life.  Careers, religion, and even love seem meaningless.  The people just exist -- and go to bullfights.  Indeed, the book is famous for Hemingway's vivid description of bullfighting in Spain; while the writing of these scenes is superb, I found myself cringing at the cruelty of the sport, which I suspect was not Hemingway's intention.  He would think I am being a weanie.  I am not sure I would widely recommend this book because of its somber tone, but if you're feeling a little lost and need something to relate to, give it a try.",2012-06-03

So, I can give a review that has no assumptions.<br /><br />The main character, Jake, is a guy that I could go drinking with.  While he has his own opinions on things, he will listen to what you have to say.  You can have many conversations with the man, on a variety of topics, and Jake can keep up with you and keep the conversation lively.  He doesn't thrust his opinions on you, but \\""tells it like it is\\"".  Jake can hang with those flaky expatriates that live in Paris, and be friends with them.  However, Jake has deeper feelings that are not quite written in the book, but you can sense them.<br /><br />For beginners, Jake is hopelessly in love with a seriously \\""high maintenance\\"" beauty named Brett - but he won't completely admit it (he actually does, but then withdraws when she shrugs him off), and he tries to fake bravado or coolness or whatever, so that he won't appear weak or desperate to her.  The girl of his dreams is not really someone you'd marry and settle down with, but he's in love with her, and maybe the two of them can continue on their partying ways after they marry - or maybe Jake hopes to settle her down.  To me, the tragedy of the novel is Jake's love for this woman, and it is hopeless for him to believe that he can have a life with her.  Jake's character is poignant in this regard, and I was truly saddened by his character.<br /><br />Ernest Hemingway's writing is economical, to say the least.  He writes like a newspaperman (no coincidence that the main character is a newspaper reporter).  His sentences are very short/staccato.  As you read the book, the pages fly by so quickly that you can devour the book in just a few hours - I owe this to the quickness of the prose and, of course, to the short length of the novel.  I loved Hemingway's writing style - each sentence gets to the point, and only the point.  But while many of these short sentences seem simply to describe things, there is a lot of intention between the lines.  So, while the writing is economical, there is more than meets the eye.<br /><br />Also, I felt like I was riding along with Jake on his trip to Spain (honestly, I felt like a buddy tagging along).  Most likely, I would have done the same things as Jake does (assuming I was still single, maybe a little younger).  That is, we'd go out and see the sights, walk around, and drink.  I have to admit that the characters do more drinking than I would on such a trip (beer with breakfast for instance), but I think I could hang with them for a couple of days.  Although, in the throes of drink, the characters can get quite mean - which seems to fall in with reality.<br /><br />Now that you know my feelings about the book, here's a summary of the novel.<br /><br />Jake is the center of the novel.  He's a newspaper writer who wants to go the the Pamplona bull fights in Spain.  Before he goes, he introduces us to two other major characters in Brett and Robert.  As an unfortunate sign of the times, Robert's \\""Jewness\\"" is something that is brought up more forcefully than would be politically correct nowadays.  I am not sure what the purpose of letting us know that Robert is a Jew, unless it's supposed to be some opposite of the Catholicism practiced by Jake (and the hap-hazard way that Brett practices Catholicism).<br /><br />In any case, both Brett and Robert end up in Pamplona with Jake, along with a couple of other people Jake knows - including a guy who has married Brett (although Brett is nowhere near a marriageable person - I think her husband suffers the misery that Jake would if Brett had married him).<br /><br />While in Pamplona, Jake meets these other people he knows and goes fishing.  Jake does a good job of describing the scenes that they pass through, and the bull fights are given in wonderful detail.  I learned a lot about these fights (personally, I find bull fighting reprehensible, but Jake describes things in such a matter-of-fact way that I could deal with them).  Of course, a lot of alcohol is consumed, his girl Brett has eyes for a bull fighter, and Robert becomes a big problem.<br /><br />As an event, the Pamplona Bull Fights and the festivities surrounding them, were very vividly told and the reader is along for the ride.<br /><br />After the bull fights, Jake still has some vacation time left and manages to avoid home for another week.  Brett meets with him, and it is here that we see that Jake and Brett are never to be - but I'm sure they will remain friends forever.<br /><br />I was really heartbroken by the character of Jake, someone who can't have the woman he wants, even though he is certainly willing to make any concession for his potential girl.  I even suspect that Jake would put up with Brett's infidelities, just so long as she came home to him.<br /><br />One last bit of warning to the readers of today involves a certain derogatory term used to describe blacks (the \\""N word\\"").  Jake, and others, casually use this word.  I didn't feel like they did so in a hurtful sense, but I did think the word was meant to indicate that the blacks were somehow not on the same level as whites (Robert, the Jew, suffered similarly).  The time frame of this novel was right after WWI, but I have no concept of the feelings of the time, so I can't comment on the hatefulness implied by this term - but I am guessing that its use wasn't pleasant to those to whom it referred, and it wasn't meant as a pleasantly.",2012-02-21

I chose The Sun Also Rises because I had not previously read this one.  I was disappointed. There was no discernable plot other than a group of American, English and Scottish expatriates who go on holiday with a lovely lady who they are all involved with in some way or another.  The plot consists only of an obscene amount of alcohol consumption, jealous intrique and the fiesta and running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, and pretty much ends as it began as far as the cast of characters are concerned.  Many authors and novels don't wear well over time so I was not surprised when I wasn't wowed by this book.  Still, Hemingway had a raw talent as a writer.  I think the reason he was so popular in the twenties is that his style was so unlike the classic authors who came before him.  He really introduced a very crisp style of writing, with limited description, and heavy on dialogue which moves his stories along.  Also, part of Hemingway's charm was, and remains, the fabulously flamboyant and handsome man he was in real life.  I would recommend reading Hemingway's A Farewell To Arms, as I recall really liking that book.  Styles, like everything else, change over time.  It's doubtful many hugely famous authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century would wear well today, but that's not really the point.

Barnes is an emotional desert, defeated by his physical injuries from the war and unable to please the love of his life, he sits idly by as the lovely Brett tramps about to both's unhappiness. His physiology goes unmentioned and begs the reader ask if his impotence is just a psychosomatic manifestation of a broken psyche. He and the other expatriates vamp around Europe and drink feverishly, reflecting their escapist desire for a never-to-be-found home-away-from-home.  Otherwise inert, Jake lives vicariously through the Spanish bull fights. Perhaps he is unconsciously drawn to them by their symbolic significance - triumph of man's nature over his impulsive animality; perhaps by the likeness of the fight's rhythms to his own unrequited game of love; or simply by its reputably macho and morbid allure - a palpable conflict of life and death. Hemingway's own fascination with the sport may be gleaned from his Death in the Afternoon: \\""Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter's honour.\\""  In this work, Hemingway's emblematic prose embodies the aridness of his characters. It also serves to place a sharp focus on the story and on the characters, rather than on flowery and shallow language.",2011-12-29

It literally takes you for as trip along with a group of American and English expats as they journey from 1902s Paris to the gritty and brutal bullfights in Spain. The romantic side of the story features the flamboyant Lady Brett Ashley, who Jake Barnes is hopelessly besotted with. As a reader you can easily become immersed in Hemingway's distinctly vivid descriptions of both the romantic locales and violent bullfights, and with the characters' disillusionment, moral bankruptcy and unrequited love. It's got tragedy, romance and locations to die for--and language that lingers in your mind.  Hemingway's pacing allows for you to really soak everything in, and forces you to pay attention to his beautiful prose. If a reader is used to speed reading and doesn't have a true appreciation for the language, they will find the book too slow. For those who really appreciate classic literature, you will find the prose stylish, detailed and beautiful. The characters are vibrant, charismatic and quirky, and it's amazing to see how they lived life to the fullest and indulged in debauchery so far back in the day.

She enjoyed F. Scot Fitzgerald. I don't so much. Both men wrote sparingly under Gertrude Stein's tutelage. Both men were part of the same expatriate crowd living in Paris after the conclusion of WW I. Hemingway and Fitzgerald both lived \\""the lost generation\\"" lifestyle. Fitzgerald drowned in it; Hemingway left and grew as an important literary author until he could no longer write shortly before his suicide in 1961. He became as impotent as Jake Barnes suffering from not a physical malady but that of mental illness, probably Manic Depression Disorder. But his genius started with this book that was published in 1926.<br /><br /> The dialogue is strong and compelling as he digs into the moral morasses of excessiveness of that shallow, drunken, and selfish crowd Hemingway belonged to.

They are powerless in their love for Lady Brett Ashley.<br /><br /> But Brett is powerless in her love for Jake. She loves him wholly, but needs what Jake can't give her. They dance the bull fight; she is the matador luring Jake by wearing his love down and pierces his heart time after time.  It is the price Jake and Brett must pay for wanting what can never be.

It is so stripped down that it is accessible to all with no need to get out the dictionary, although much is left for the reader to fill in.<br /><br />While Hemingway deftly crafts his characters, he does so with spare brush strokes, so much is left for the reader to fill in and life's experiences will shape how the reader perceives each.  Essentially there are four major character Jake Barnes the impotent writer/journalist, Brett, Lady Ashley, the twice married dissolute thirty-five year old  socialite, Mike Campbell, Brett's bankrupt fiance, Robert Cohn, a writer friend of Jake's, Bill Gorton another friend of Jake's who has recently arrived in Paris.<br /><br />Hemingway has taken a simple tale, with simple language of a journey to the running of the bulls in Pamplona and formed an intricate novel involving themes of masculinity, nature, religion and honor.  Masculinity is always in the background of The Sun Also Rises.  Jake and Bill rollick on the top of the bus drinking wine from bota bags held at an arms length with the Spanish laborers.  Brett , the temptress, the siren plays the counterpoint to masculinity.  All of the men are drawn to her even the nineteen year old Spanish bullfighter, Romero.<br /><br />As we learn the steers of Pamplona manage the bulls, it is the nature of things.  We note the beautiful Spanish countryside, the changes that the travelers pass through on their journey south through Spain to Pamplona.  We experience the cold water of the Itara river as Jake and Bill fish for trout.  Nature is always an essential part of the novel and contrasted with the bars and bottegas where wine and liquor flow freely.<br /><br />One can't read The Sun Also Rises without some thought of anti-Semitism.  Every time Robert Cohn enters the picture he is described as Jewish.  The other characters constantly denigrate him, while the reader wonders what he has done to be so despised.  He went off with Lady Brett on a trip previously and hopes to reenter the relationship.  It seems this was badly presumptuous and in bad form.<br /><br />There have been numerous explanations and interpretations of this.  The dismissive and portentous one, that it was commonplace of the literature of the time and so allowable.  There is a biographic one, in which The Sun Also Rises is a retelling of Hemingway's own trip to Pamplona and his loss of friendship during this time with Harold Loeb and created Cohn as a way to even the score so to speak.

His writing became famous for evoking true sentiment without the use of dull, verbose language. On the surface, it appears that the words are very simple; sentences containing only three words or less are everywhere. The true wonder of The Sun Also Rises doesn't lie in its simplicity, but in the fact that the true emotion lies underneath the words through the process of omitting what is unnecessary to reveal the more important themes that too many words can mask.  As Hemingway's debut novel, this book is a literary landmark. Modern writers give more consideration to deciding whether they would rather emulate Hemingway's style or avoid it than any other author. His style is very unique and broke new ground during his time. Hemingway uses terse prose focusing on short, truncated sentences and long passages of dialogue mixed with vivid description and subtle but powerful characterization.  The Sun Also Rises is the quintessential novel of the \\""lost generation\\"" of youth after WWI. Jake Barnes, the hopelessly depressed main character, has suffered a traumatic injury during the war that has left him impotent and unable to physically support his true love, Lady Brett Ashley. Brett is consumed by social norms and cannot allow herself to be with Jake because of his condition, claiming she would \\""tromper\\"" him with other men. The relationship between these two characters, narrated by Barnes, is absolutely brilliant. The futility of love as well as the aimlessness of life carries the book.  Other characters include the Jewish middleweight champion and semi-accomplished writer, Robert Cohn. Cohn is constantly teased by Brett's partner, Mike Campbell, a violent drunk who has gone bankrupt after the war but chooses decadence over frugality. Bill Smith, Jake's close friend, seems to be the least disillusioned member of Jake's group, but he is not without his violent tendencies.  The story focuses on the travels of these young men and Brett as they travel from Paris to Pamplona to see the Fiesta di San Fermin. The group seems to meander with no purpose, showing the accepted beliefs of veterans after WWI. They travel from place to place with no purpose, getting \\""tight\\"" at every place they can.  The book climaxes with perhaps the greatest description of the Spanish countryside and culture in all of literature. In Pamplona, the friends witness the encierros de toros (literally \\""running of bulls\\"") into the amphitheater where they watch Pedro Romero, a handsome and talented young bullfighter, do his work.   The beauty of this Spanish festival has forever been immortalized by Hemingway's simple prose that needs to be read to be believed. The near perfect detail of the European country and urban life is very believable. Hemingway has a good balance of choosing true sentiment over sentimentality. The book is simple yet complex, and very satisfying. The language contrasts between pages of dialogue that take very little time to read and pages of long, descriptive paragraphs. Sometimes this effect was dizzying as it took the reader in and out of the scenes too quickly. I often found myself confused when the tone would shift from very limited conversation to excessive, detailed paragraphs about the surrounding area. It also didn't help that three or more people are usually speaking at once, and an indication of who is actually speaking is rarely presented. Sometimes there is no way to tell, but the reader can assume who is speaking based on their choice of words (Jake speaks very little, Brett applies forced British slang).  Very often, the reader forgets that the characters in the book are American. At times, even the characters themselves need to be reminded. The characters are pseudo-intellectuals, abandoning their morals to assimilate into the luxury of European culture. They believe that money can truly buy them friends, and they flaunt about theirsuccesses but rarely reflect on their flaws.  The excessive use of alcohol may not be appropriate for everyone. In nearly every scene, the characters are drinking or asking a friend to have a drink. Clearly, the characters are trying to escape from the traumas of the war. However, the repetition becomes predictable very early on and stays throughout the whole book. The idiosyncrasies of each character are only truly seen during their instances of extreme drunkenness, whether it be anti-Semitism or proclamations of love and hate or violence.  The novel ends much like it begins. Jake and Brett are in a car, hopelessly lost and in love. After the celebrations have ended, the two characters can't help ending up in the same place no matter how much they try to escape, much like the sun will always rise and fall in the same place every single day.  Only 1/8 of an iceberg is visible from the surface of the ocean. For readers of The Sun Also Rises, I recommend that you dig deep into the words on the page in order to reveal a better understanding of Hemingway's intention and to improve the reading experience overall.",2011-11-18

Many people hesitate to pick up classics from authors like Faulkner, Wolff, or Bronte because they are wordy or slow reads -- but Hemmingway is the exact opposite. Gone are long winded descriptions of characters and setting; the prose is stripped down the most minimal form. Yet the brevity of the sentences has a strange beauty, and the staccato prose is strung together into vivid imagery and realistic dialogue.  The strength of this novel lies in its characters and their conversation. Their interactions continually push the story forward while giving value insight into the speaker's past.   On the other hand, the novel starts off quite slowly, and it can be difficult to get past the first third. Once Jake leaves Paris and travels to Spain, the story becomes a bit more interesting. If you are looking for an action packed thriller or juicy romance, you won't find anything here. What you will find are a colorful set of characters, from great friends to bitter enemies. You become connected to Jake and his struggles with the elusive Brett, his un-acheivable love. You feel yourself in the colorful hills of Spain and in amongst the streets of Pamplona.   If you can get past the slow start, and look at the beauty of what Hemmingway has created with such a different writing style, you will appreciate this book.

Hemingway uses alcohol in the novel, as a way to create this emotion and mix it with imagery that ranges from sharp to blurry to depict the scene.  The different sets create a world that is realistic and yet free from the mundane.  With bustling fiestas, to flowing streams and mountain valleys, Hemingway lures the reader into his own world of love and lost.   The beginning of the story starts out with a character description of the self made man, Robert Cohn.  It takes the first few chapters to really describe Cohn, but without them the reader would be lost later in the novel.  The story then turns to the relationship between Jake and Brett, two main characters who have had a relationship in the past and still love each other.  The passion that is seen between these characters is the main focus of the book, showing how two broken hearts deal with the pain in different ways.  Whenever Brett is alone she goes to Jake and they put themselves through the pain all over again. However, when they are finished Brett runs off with another man when really she could only be happy with Jake.  On the other hand, Jake uses alcohol to deal with his pain until Brett comes back to him.  This is the only time that Jake feels like himself, when Brett is with him breaking his heart, or when he is completely drunk.   Imagery becomes the focal point in Hemingway's settings by creating worlds and filling them with his experiences.  He uses adjectives that make the reader feel as though they are a part of the scene, standing in the crowd amongst the people.  Jake and Bill, another main character, take a detour before going to a fiesta to go on a fishing trip.  The detail that was put into this scene makes it possible to see inside of Hemingway's mind, picking out what he wants the reader to experience.  When someone reads this, who knows something about fishing such as myself, they will find that it is extremely accurate and descriptive, not to mention exciting and full of life.  Hemingway turns scenes that would normally inform, and makes them into inspirational stories of success and grandeur.   The last scene of the novel is a fiesta created by Hemingway to stir the senses of the reader.  The detail that he puts into the party makes it seem like the reader is inside the story sitting at the bar with the characters.  Unlike many other authors, Hemingway did not leave the reader out of anything, from drinking out of homemade wineskins, dancing in the streets, and the famous bullfights, he produced it on paper as a director produces a movie.  Even the little things such as tables and chairs become objects of creativity, \\""The marble- topped tables and the white wicker chairs were gone, they were replaced by cast iron tables and severe folding chairs.  The café was like a battleship stripped for action,\\"" (Hemingway 153).   The passion and creativity that Hemingway puts on paper creates a sense of emotion that enthralls the audience.  The style that he preforms in the novel sets the stage for emotional build-ups and creative conclusions.  The ability to include his reader in the novel is another plus to the totality of his creative talent.  Hemingway's style creates such a vivid world that only the characters themselves know what they're missing.",2011-10-14

I oftentimes find that the book I am reading whispers the name of the next book, or next several books, rather than I having the luxury to choose for myself. This was definitely the case with \\""The Paris Wife\\"", the subject of my last review.  I discovered while I was devouring it that when living in Paris at the beginning of his writing career, Ernest Hemingway became enamored with Bull fighting in Spain. He went to Pamplona several times to take in the contests, after first being introduced to them through stories told by Gertrude Stein (a friend of Hemingway's who was also an ex-pat living in Paris, and who also became a famous author).  In fact Hemingway's first child was named John Hadley Nicanor Hemingway.  Nicanor Villalta was the name of a famous toreador who artfully slay his bull the first time Hemingway took his wife, Hadley, to the fights while she was pregnant with their son.  Hemingway's first novel and work of substance, as well as the subject of this review, was \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"", a story woven around and through the passion Hemingway felt for bullfighting.    In 1926, while Hemingway was living in Paris, he took his wife and a group of friends to Spain for the week long festival.  There were seven people in the party, mostly Americans familiar with each other from living in Paris and traveling in the same social circle.  There was one other woman besides Hemingway's wife in the group, Lady Duff Twysden, who had once upon a time in one of her previous unions, married into her title.  She went by Duff.  She was beautiful, glamorous, and made it a point of attracting the attention of the men around her in spite of the fact that she was engaged tobe married to another member of the party, Pat Guthrie.  Pat drank too much and didn't hold his liquor well, but even so he was cognizant of the mutual flirtations that were going on around him involving his fiancee.  To add to this amorously charged and stress-filled atmosphere, another member of the group, Harold Loeb, had only just returned from a romantic tryst at St.-Jean-de-Luz with Duff.  Harold was head-over-heels for Duff, and felt that after having her to himself for a week, he had a legitimate claim to her.  She was finished with Harold by then in her off-hand way, and had moved on to the attentions of Hemingway...  During the course of the week, Hemingway, Harold and Pat circled Duff with the intensity of sharks at a feeding frenzy, which created an aura of discomfort for all of the friends.    The \\""Sun Also Rises\\"" takes place in Pamplona during the bullfighting festival in July. It is actually based on the trip Hemingway planned for his friends.  Interestingly Hemingway chose not to include his wife in the novel, even though she was present during the actual event.  In the book there is continuous inebriation, arguing, and fighting over the favor of Brett, who plays the part of Duff.  The twist is that Brett trifles with the men, but sets her sights on conquering the beautiful young toreador after she sees the grace, power and fearlessness of his performance in the ring.    It was interesting to read this book after having an understanding for Hemingway's life when he wrote it.  It was also fascinating to know that Hemingway based this book on a real life experience.  It was like having a window into his existence. Unfortunately, I can't honestly say I enjoyed his writing style.  I know it is said of Hemingway that the power of his writing came from his ability to be succinct.  I found, however, that his writing lacked the richness of description and analogy, which made it feel flat.  He also repeated words and phrases, which I thought tedious.  I am keeping in mind that this was Hemingway's first novel, and that he was not yet a literary giant when he wrote it.  I am looking forward to reading \\""A Movable Feast\\"", which was the last book Hemingway wrote before his death.  It is a reminiscence of his life in Paris with Hadley.",2011-08-19

The book begins with a Gertrude Stein quote, \\""You are a lost generation ... \\"" followed an excerpt from the book of Ecclesiastes, chapter 1, which I put here:      \\""Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever ... The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, And hastens to the place where it arose.  The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes,  ever returning on its course.  All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again.\\""      You can see where the title of the book comes from.      I think that the Stein quote, the Ecclesiastes excerpt and a little bit of a background on the existential despair that characterized Europe after WWI help us to understand the book.  All these folks, Jake and his friends are stuck in life.  They are constantly moving about and doing things, but they are all existentially stuck somewhere and cannot seem to move out.       To say it more in an Indian fashion.  These folks are stuck in a this-worldy-samsara and each is looking for one thing or another to get them out of it.*  You can see this in their daily lives as Hemingway describes it. So much of what goes on with them seems to be just a constant flitting from place to place, cafe to cafe, bar to bar, restaurant to restaurant, drink to drink, lover to lover and it never seem to end or settle anywhere. Life is a bunch of circles for them. You go here. You go there. You do this. You do that. You do this. You do that. (Is this getting dull to read?) In the end you wind up right back where you started.  What is the point of any of this? They are truly a lost generation.      And amidst all this Jake has a particular problem that affects so much of his life and which would seem to be like an anchor dropped in this dead worldmaking his escape from samsara futile. So what will happen? Will he ever escape? And what of his compatriots? What will get them out of where they are?      *In Hinduism, there is this concept called samsara.  It refers to the unending cycle of rebirth and death that we are all trapped in.  Likewise I say, even within our own life, there is a sort of a this-worldly samsara, in which we get stuck in, that is characterized by unending routines, cycles and monotony.

Of course, the language and dialogue are seemingly direct, plain, and unpretentious. The plot seems simple and even unsophisticated - at least five expatriates \\""live it up\\"" on a languid road trip from Paris, France to Pamplona, Spain. You get a fine European country travelogue and intimate descriptions of bullfighting. You get fishing, casual love affairs, and even a clumsy fistfight. Sounds like a novel a college student could swallow in a day or two - even during Spring Break. Well, yes and no.<br /><br />If you are not acquainted at all with Hemingway's spare, naked prose, quite naturally TSAR seems like a pulp fiction novel about nothing. But if you are even superficially aware of the novel's milieu -post World War I Europe- you know enough to penetrate the surface of this simple story to see the sad, existential despair underneath. Each of the main characters, the first-person narrator and \\""emasculated\\"" newspaperman Jake Barnes, the earnest Jewish pariah Robert Cohn, the insolvent, crude Mike Campbell, the fun lover Bill (forgot his last name), and especially the pathetic maneater \\""Lady\\"" Brett Ashley ultimately lead empty, unfocused lives of both quiet and not-so-quiet desperation, and futilely try to fill that emptiness with food, sex, machismo, and especially drink (lots of drink). I think thats the predominant theme of TSAR - WWI shattered our past lofty illusions and placed us in terror of our mortality and there's nothing we can do to ensure a bright, safe future. We are doomed to oblivion, so in the meantime all we can do is \\""enjoy\\"" this fleeting present as much as we can. This nihilist philosophy is strikingly similar to that of Norse mythology, except it does not spur TSAR's characters to perform heroic acts.<br /><br />Although of course the writing is not ornate in TSAR, it seems obsessed in describing so many things in closely-observed detail. We get specific descriptions of Parisian streets, Spanish countrysides, European cafes, the Pamplona corrals and bullfighting arenas. I think it is a deliberate distraction to underscore the inconsequentiality of Jake's and his friends' lives - just something to kill the time. Hemingway lavishes particular attention on the Pamplona fiesta, which lasts several days and is filled with noise, parades, fireworks, and of course the running of the bulls. Again, sound and fury signifying nothing.  Sometimes the characters can't even enjoy the surroundings; on several occasions, for example, Jake is so hung over or tired or both, he misses some of the bull fights and has to get secondhand information from his companions (I hesitate to call them friends). The information is usually unvarying; either Mike can't pay his creditors, Robert Cohn is an unwanted pest, or Brett jilted yet another suitor. Too much information about nothing.<br /><br />TSAR will either inspire thoughts of empathy or schadenfreude within you. You may sympathize or even empathize with this frantically hedonistic crew, or (as I must confess I did) wax superior and relieved that my life, full of woes and cares as it is, is not that sad. Most of us may relate best with Jake, who is as dissolute as the rest but at least is aware of it. For example, he is in love with Brett but cannot consummate it because of his WWI wound. Toward the end of the novel, when Brett wires him for assistance and exclaims that they would have a grand life together if not for the wound, Jake replies \\""Isn't it pretty to think so.\\"" Jake has no delusions.<br /><br />TSAR's overall tone is pessimistic and even bleak, but it has its sharp observations of humor, as when Mike states he has two types of bankruptcy - gradual and sudden. The characters' put downs of each other are amusing. Jake learns you have to buy friends and decides not to tip the train conductor more generously because he'll never see him again. The European descriptions are charming and may give you the urge to travel. But yet again, the point is it is all a superficial veneer. In conclusion, TSAR will be a fast but baffling read for unworldly people who will wonder what the fuss is all about, but for more mature, world-weary people, it will reveal the empty, present void beneath the busy surface.r see him again.

The characters seem juvenile, all of one type, all variations of Hemingway's antiquated notion of manhood. The female protagonist, Lady Brett, is just a male fantasy, the femme fatale no man can have, who is unhappy and unfullfilled herself. These vamps seem to populate the literature of the twenties--modeled on famous bohemian heiresses or actresses of the day. Jake, the main character, is another Hemingway self-description, alienated and in pain, with little wit or cleverness in self-reflection.  With uninteresting characters, a somewhat primitive ethos of manhood, prose style that may have been novel in its inception in the twenties but flat upon reading now, and not much in the way of unusual narrative, I am puzzled this book retains its high acclaim. One wonder if it is simply because, with its short words, it is easy to read.

When Jake sees Brett--the woman he loves--with other men, he passively goes along with the situation; it is only at night that his true emotions come out: \\""This was Brett, that I felt like crying about. Then I thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car . . . and of course in a little while I felt like hell again. It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the day, but at night it is another thing\\"" (Hemingway 42). This shows that in the day he might be able to mask his pain--with drinks and friends--but at night his tortured soul makes itself known. However, the revelations of the night before are quickly shoved under the rug and the next day or week the cycle repeats itself. He does not even try to get Brett for himself; he acts like the battle has already been lost and that any future actions he might take would be utterly futile, which is true because he has lost his manhood and there lies the tragedy of Brett and Jake's relationship.             Jake does not suffer alone. All the characters in the book act like fate has been decided for them and remain compliant in nature. Cohn the Jew--always the outsider, even in his own country--perhaps suffers the most acutely. He desperately wants to find a place of acceptance and belonging, and is disillusioned into thinking that South America holds his answers. Jake tries to talk sense into him saying, \\""Robert going to another country doesn't make any difference. I've tied all that. You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. . . . If you went there the way you feel now it would be exactly the same\\"" (19). He clings the hardest to his affection for Brett, because for once someone chose to be with him and he cannot fathom that it was not real. He pathetically follows Brett and Mike around like an affectionate puppy trying to get a moment of attention, which becomes incredibly annoying to the reader.                 Brett is not a likeable character. She causes most of the pain and suffering of the men by toying with their hearts' and causes bitterness and conflict among them. You could say she was an early proponent of sexual liberation and femininity, however, that doesn't really describe her character because she often relies on men to pick up the pieces. Throughout the book she is such a pitiable, broken thing that regrets not making things work with Jake. Therefore she is not a strong female character.                 All in all the plot was a little dry with endless drinking and partying. None of the characters seem to need to work, so it was a bit infuriating listening to them complain bitterly about their lives. But as my friend pointed out, it is important to remember the context of the novel and how everyone was so disillusioned after the war that productivity, change, and hope seemed pointless. I thought the bull fighting and the bull fighters themselves were highly entertaining and symbolic; Romero represents the invincible, youth full of hope and wonder, while Belmonte full of bitterness and disillusionment represents old age.

There is a lot of interesting description of the events there, and then novel ends in a mood of resignation.    Hem was the master of \\""show don't tell.\\""  The only character whose head he lets us into is Jake, and even then, only a little bit here and there.  The story is glamorous and interesting, but for me at least, the robotic prose gets tedious.  What is interesting is how Jake proves that even somebody like him, who has lost his physicalmanhood, can still be a very fine man, a finer and better and more moral person than the losers and blowhards and louts and drunkards that he consorts with.  I think Hemingway should still be taught in high school, but probably not this book. \\""A Farewell to Arms\\"", or the short stories, or \\""The Old Man and the Sea\\"" might be better.",2011-01-09

While I was very excited - I have to say however that I was fairly disappointed with this 200+ page novel. More than once during this novel, I had thoughts of putting it down never to return to it.     The pace of the book, extremely slow and methodical, make it very difficult to get through the whole story. The tone is fairly monotonous for most of the book with the plot unwinding in very ordinary fashion without much intrigue whatsoever.     I found the characters in the book to be a bit annoying - their excessive eating and drinking along with their rather quick, undeveloped dialogue proved difficult to digest.  The characters appeared to avoid  some of the major topics, situations and events that were laid out in the novel in favor of drinking, eating & socializing.     The saving grace of this book is Hemingway's depiction of bull-fighting towards the end.  Even though many pages are not spent in this area, there was well-written, intriguing and even suspenseful prose in those bull-fighting pages.     The main reason I read this book through till the end was to find out how things would develop and end with the character Brett - and her relationship with Jake.

In it, Hemingway focuses on the concept of love but in a very unique way. Hemingway uses his characters to portray love as a scary thing. He strongly supports his notions regarding love throughout the book.         The book takes place in Paris and Spain. A group of friends travel to a small Spanish town for a fishing trip and to participate in the annual grand fiesta. The group consists of four men and one women. The women, named Brett, had some interesting ideas towards relationships. She creates conflict between the men and even between some newly found Spanish friends. It appears Brett creates conflict to avoid getting close to people. The drinking is endless, creating even more conflict between friends. Many relationships are ruined in a period of only a few days.         The book is told from the first person perspective of a well off American writer named Jake, who lives and works in Paris. Hemingway uses Jake to tell the story of how some people lived during the early 1900's. I think Hemingway wrote this book to give a good, entertaining look into the lives of Europeans in the early 1900's. I also think something in his own life gave him the idea to write this book. He spent a portion of his life living in Paris; his experiences there could have contributed to the portrayal of events in The Sun Also Rises.         Hemingway's style of writing through the dialogue of his characters makes this book suitable for all teens and adults. Hemingway never overstates conversation. There is a purpose in every word he writes, and it sounds like you could actually be talking to the character. Hemingway's idea of love was intriguing in that he describes it as complicated and unforgiving. In the future, this Hemingway presentation of love could change my opinions of other characters in other books.         I would highly recommend this book to others for several reasons. First, I think everyoneneeds to read Hemingway to experience his unique writing style. It is brilliantly simple. Second, the ideas presented regarding love are intriguing. For example, Hemingway focuses on fear of love and suggests people don't always end up with their true love. Hemingway's portrayal of people's fear of relationships may help explain some reasons for divorce. For example, fi people tend to avoid the most meaningful relationships, the \\""lesser\\"" relationships may be more likely to end in failure. Third, this book remains contemporary. Everyone who reads this book can find a connection to themselves or a family member. Indeed, Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises focuses on the many layered connections of his characters--I think those connections made this book easier and more fun to read.-By Hannah Hunsaker",2010-10-29

The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a tragic hero of sorts. He was wounded in WW1 and his injuries rendered him impotent.  His injury deeply affected his psyche, and he is insecure about his masculinity as a result. The love of Jake's life is the beautiful Lady Brett Ashley, who cared for him during the war when he was wounded. She is a shallow woman, who cares for Jake, but will not commit to him because sex is very important to her. Instead Lady Brett spends her time with a variety of men. Jake, on the other hand, spends much of his time in Paris with his buddies, each drinking in cafes and wasting their lives.<br /><br />The activities that Jake and his buddies engaged in were really quite sad.  They seemed like they never grew up, but instead their behavior was reflective of their wish to forget the horrors of the war.  They wandered rather aimlessly, a highlight being the fiesta and bullfights in Pamplona where the group engages in more drinking, dancing and debauchery.<br /><br />This book was originally published in 1926, and its strength is definitely the style in which it was written. Hemingway's writing is sharp and insightful, and you feel every detail: the sight, sounds, the place. The characters, although flawed were sympathetic. I loved how he got into the psyche of the characters, helping the reader feel what their life was like, and why they made some of the decisions they did.  I thought it was rather ironic that the title, \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"", which to me symbolizes a new dawn, a new day, really had no significance for Jake and the other characters in this novel. Rather they never moved on with their lives, stuck in time, as a result of the past. Hemingway seemed to truly understand the struggles and challenges that life handed his characters, and for that matter -- each of us. Some individuals are made stronger by adversity, but others are not.

The expatriot American community in Paris and Europe in general after World War II brought together a band of talented writers, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, James Joyce and Gertrude Stein, whose famous quote \\""You are all a lost generation\\"" is listed at the front of Hemingway's work and whose talents are later criticized by Hemingway in other writings. This first effort by the young Hemingway was noteworthy at the time as it was a bold, new style, clean, terse, abrupt and different from that being released by other novelists. Thus Hemingway first gained attention as a writer worth following.     The book is a story of the daily lives of several \\""lost\\"" people, including Jake Barnes and the incredibly beautiful, sexy Lady Brett Ashley, who every man desires and who has slept with nearly all of them. The plot literally revolves around three things- drinking, eating and various love affairs or near affairs of the main characters.

The central characters are damaged from World War One. They have no purpose in life. So they wonder around Europe getting drunk. This is also a book about what is not said between people in a situation. It is about the dark side of love. Well not in the gothic sense. Lady Brett Ashley is the epitome of the flapper girl.

Jakes Barnes loves her dearly but is the only character with enough sense to know he will never be able to have her. Hemingway was a man's man. He saw a raw sexuality in the violence of bullfighting.

The prose is artistic but direct, with occasional poetic musings about scenery or bullfighting.  And when it comes to the similarities, I think Fitzgerald achieved much more than Hemingway.    Ultimately, though, I appreciate this book for what it is.  No, it's not as good as Gatsby.

(The anthropology of the bull-fighting is the most famous part of this book.) As classics go, this one has a high chance of disappointing: the tension in the novel, such as it is, comes from their all being in love with the same soon-to-be divorced Englishwoman, and if the characters change at all over the course of the novel, it's vanishingly subtle --- except they're all much closer to the day that a doctor diagnoses them with cirrhosis of the liver.    Yeah, yeah, I know we're also supposed to genuflect before the icon of the great Revolutionary of Style, but in truth, Hemingway leaves me cold. The way everyone talks about how `economical' his writing was makes him sound less like a writer and more like a home-front housewife who cleverly figured out how to stretch her family's ration coupons further. Take for instance this passage:    >There were lighted bars and late open shops on each side of the street. We were sitting apart and we jolted close together going down the old street. Brett's hat was off. Her head was back. I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was dark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des Gobelins. The street was town up and men were working on the cartracks by the light of acetylene flares. Brett's face was white and the long line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares. The street was dark again and I kissed her. Our lips were tight together and then she turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away as she could get. Her head was down.    Say this out loud and it just sounds silly: you have the clumsy instances in which back-to-back sentences end with the same word (`street' and then `flares') plus the repetition of four-word sentences actually sounds wordy because you the reader have to stop and supply the missing connections. This writing might have played a key role in the evolution of fiction, but it can't, on its own, be said to be good writing, or even decent writing. And the clipping of words gets to be downright irritating in three-way conversations when you're not told who is speaking and the dialogue is so vague that the words are not obviously in the style of one person.     The novel isn't all bad. Hemingway's style, for instance, can sometimes lend itself to capturing the essence of drunken conversation, and since everyone is always `tight' in this novel --- in every scene you're told what they're drinking --- he gets a lot of chances to nail it. Two moments in particular stand out. One is in which a guy gets silly as his blood alcohol level increases and he makes an argument that ends with, \\""[The] Road to hell [is] paved with unstuffed dogs.\\"" In context, this makes sense and for a moment the character seems like a warm and funny person. The second successfully inebriated moment is when the tension over the woman breaks above the surface and one drunk launches a relentless verbal attack on another man despite everyone telling him to shut up. The scene is brilliant, but it was too little too late: as I paused to absorb the scene, I glanced up to the top of the page and thought, \\""Page 146 and something is finally happening.\\""    But what really sinks _The Sun Also Rises_ are the comparisons it begs. The novel fits into two saturated genres. Two vastly superior `expats of Paris' novels are George Orwell's _Down and Out in London and Paris_ and Geoff Dyer's more recent _Paris Trance_ (and there's a lot in between). One could argue that novels like this have the benefit of having _The Sun Also Rises_ to draw upon. That's true, but it doesn't make Hemingway anymore fun to read and it doesn't hold water when talking about the other saturated genre this novel represents, namely, accounts of the Great War generation. In that case, F. Scott Fitzgerald's _The Beautiful and Damned_ dances circles around _The Sun Also Rises_, like Fred Astaire sensually gliding around a dumb fire hydrant. Ironically, Fitzgerald, who helped in the editing of _The Sun Also Rises_, would go on to die in obscurity while this novel began Hemingway's march to the Nobel Prize. Such is justice in the literary world.",2010-03-14

The story was aimless meandering - pointless and plotless, and the characters were pitiful. I wouldn't normally have chosen to read it, but it was the selection of the month for my book discussion group.<br /><br />The main character, Jake, told the story in the first person but gave away very little information about himself. He and his loser friends wandered around Europe, staying in various degrees of intoxication throughout the book. He seemed to be having a platonic love affair with the main female character, Brett, who came to him with her problems and disappointments, declared her hopeless love for him, and then went off to sleep with one of his drunken friends.<br /><br />Nothing ever really happened in the book; no mission to accomplish, no barrier to overcome, no antagonist to beat. Hemingway spent very little effort describing his characters and far too much effort reporting on the scenery. There was alot of dialogue, but inane, redundant, and mostly meaningless. I don't know what Heminway's personal views on ethnic and racial diversity were, but this book was definintely not \\""politically correct.\\""<br /><br />The only real 'action' (if you can call it that) was a very boring description of an uneventful fishing trip to Spain, and then a fiesta and the accompanying fireworks and bullfights.

It was the most enthusiasm he'd shown throughout the entire book.<br /><br />None of the characters knew what they really wanted and let life drift by them in a drunken fog.

The Sun Also Rises is a representation of the post-World War I world of high-class scholars and women drinking and loving their way through Europe. Hemingway's description of Spain (unlike Paris), is praise-worthy. His contrasts between country and city, calm and fiesta, are concise and beautiful and certainly picturesque. His fiesta was somewhat dragged out, as is most of his book, but the depictions are fascinating to one's imagination and certainly leaves room for interpretation. The crowds of dancers and bulls and the massive amphitheater all leave the reader with a new impression of Pamplona's novelty.   Frustrating as Hemingway can become, he does bring the most important point of the story to an unfinished halt, rather than giving a concise happy ending or great loss of love. This contradicts most books and gives him a mysterious edge, creating an intriguing continuous plot that lets the reader create their own preferred ending. Without such endings, books become disillusions of life as we know it. Ernest Hemingway is gifted and unique, but it is easy to get lost in the way his mind thinks.",2010-02-12

These pour souls are what remains of the youth of World War I, a generation whose hope in humanity has been destroyed and who now drift through life aimlessly in a search for meaning. Hemingway takes us on a trip to Paris, where we meet Jake Barnes (the voice of the novel), a man who has been both emotionally and physically wounded by the war. We also meet the woman Jake loves, Brett Ashley, but due to his wound and her independent spirit, they cannot be together. Along with the unfortunate lovers is Robert Cohn, a former boxer and budding author who cannot keep his emotions in check. The Sun also Rises tells the intertwining story of these three Americans and their companions, as they travel from France to Spain for a Bull Fight and fiesta.       Hemingway's strengths lie in his creative symbolism, nuanced dialogue, and beautiful descriptions. As the characters interact with one another, the reader can always feel something more looming behind their words. Especially when Brett Ashley speaks, her voice is that of a carefree woman who truly longs for a more meaningful life, although she will never actually admit it. When Hemingway describes a scene, he uses color to assert his feelings about the place. For example, France is often pale and slightly gloomy, while Spain is always vivid and teeming with life. Water and bulls are other symbols in the novel, but I would not want to spoil the fun of deciphering their meaning for anyone else.        Like all of the classics, The Sun Also Rises does have its shortcomings. At times the plot will drag on, with characters doing nothing but drinking, complaining, and drinking some more to escape the drudgery. This novel is not for the faint of heart, it is one that requires steady reading and some contemplation. So if you are looking for a quick read on the plane or at the beach, I would recommend you save Hemingway foranother time.         Personally, I enjoyed exploring The Sun Also Rises. Hemingway has a unique writing style that made me pause and sometimes even chuckle under my breath. His character Jake Barnes is witty and insightful-- the kind of person you enjoy getting to know as you read along. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a little scandal, romance, and a journey into the minds of lost souls.",2010-01-22

The stories in this book tell of their experiences living in Europe, drinking together at different bars, and travelling, specifically to Spain. This book fits very well with Hemingway's Lost Generation due to the fact that I felt completely lost reading it. I had trouble discerning what the point of the book was until its conclusion. At one point I believed this book would be similar to Jack Kerouac's On the Road, and at other times I simply thought it was a look into the incredibly interesting world of Spanish bull fighting. The lack of a driving plot made this book difficult for me to get through, and I never found myself completely consumed with Hemingway's fictional world. On a better note though, Hemingway's style of writing is exceptional. His diction reveals a subtle sense of humor through random puns and joke's within the dialogue of his characters. The dialogue Hemingway creates between his characters is very real, and effectively draws the reader into the story.         If The Sun Also Rises were to be placed into a literary genre, it would most likely be a story of forbidden love. This label however does not fully capture the theme of the novel. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is clearly in love with his friend Lady Brett Ashley, but unable to act on his feelings due to insecurities he has. Many of the other main characters in this book are males, and almost all are equally obsessed with Brett, but all also lack the confidence required to win her over. While forbidden love is a strong theme, the idea of human insecurity plays a strong role in this story. I also found the way Hemingway writes about Spain in this story to be quite interesting. His elaborate descriptions of bull fights and his instructions on how to properly drink from a wine skin give the reader an idea of Spanish life. I would recommend this book to someone interested specifically inthe Lost Generation, but to no one else. It simply did not suck me in the way other books have.",2010-01-22

For some reason I had it in my head that his writing would be haughty, inaccessible and laborious to read.  I was pleasantly surprised that none of my preconceptions were true.    The writing style in Sun Also Rises is fluid, simple and easy to follow.  His sentences are short and easy to follow.  His dialog is natural.  His descriptions are straightforward and to the point.      Even though the simplicity of the style made the reading quick and easy, I quickly saw that there was a lot going on \\""between the lines.\\""  As terse as much of the writing is, it was apparent that what was left out was just as important (perhaps more so) than what was on the page.    As a case in point, nowhere in the book does Hemingway explicitly identify the nature of the wound that Jake received in the war.  In fact, if a reader wasn't paying close attention, the importance of that wound would quickly fade into the background.  However, there are plenty of clues as to the type of injury and the nature and extent that it has affected Jake's life.  The injury was probably the largest case of something \\""not written\\"" that was important.  There were a few other instances where I felt like Hemingway was leaving out significant details while alluding to their importance.    The character development in the book was very interesting.      With the first person narrative, we only really get into Jake's head (although, as mentioned above, there's plenty of detail he leaves out even about himself) and everything is tainted by his view of life.  At first his view felt fairly realistic and trustworthy but it quickly became apparent that he was jaded and cynical.      I felt like we got a pretty good feel for Cohn by the end of the novel.  His character seemed to be the most straightforward and easy to understand and also seemed to follow along with the narrator's initial description of him in the opening.      Lady BrettAshley's character was a bit more troublesome.  She generally felt like a party girl who absolutely loved life and was always happy, but as the layers came back, she had more emotional depth than first expressed.    The other characters in the novel were intriguing but again it was hard to unravel their motivations and get at the heart of their character because their words and motives were often veiled by volatile or sullen behavior.  The various lovers of Brett and friends of Jake were interesting but seemed to serve as reflections to play off Brett and Jake and let us gain more depth into those personalities.  The drunken repartees and the random banter was funny at times, harsh at others.    The overall tone of the book was almost paradoxical.  As readers, we're following around a group of expatriates as they party and travel around Europe reveling and enjoying life for all its worth.  From a high level, you would think that this would be great fun.  But as we drill down into the hearts and heads of these characters, the true story became rather depressive.  Instead of a semi-aristocratic party crowd, in the end it felt like we were following a bunch of slovenly lounge-a-bouts who only lived for the next drink.      Both Brett and Jake had a yearning for some true emotion or passion in life but neither was able to find a clear path to that state of happiness.  Instead, all of the characters lived lives of broken, or disabled, relationships.  They wandered aimlessly through life spending money like water in order to try and find some sort of emotional high (or perhaps a liquor induced numbness) to detract from their otherwise unfulfilled lives.    After reading this book, I have a desire to seek out more Hemingway and read more of his stuff.  I really enjoy the style he used in this book and found his characters intriguing and approachable.  The story and emotions were thought provoking and effective.    Definitely recommended.    ****  4 stars out of 5",2009-11-09

There's no story behind it. The narrator, Jake Barnes, is afflicted by a strange wound that apparently leaves him incapable of entering a relationship however, this wound is only mentioned in a passing glance and never revealed, expounded upon or even brought up ever again. The characters are either jerks or cardboard. There's no conflict and no resolution. It's like if Seinfeld were a book.    After trying to find out what all the fuss is about over this book, I found that there are some symbolic parallels between Lady Ashley (the central figure of the book, apparently) and other people or actions in the book (the bull fighting, for example). In addition, this book does seem to give justice to the generation of the time, which is cool for history buffs. So it is a more clever book than it appears on the surface.    I won't say this book isn't good. For all I know, it probably deserves its title as a classic.

Eager to prove how smart he was, the emperor quickly read the novella. When he was finished, he realized he was an idiot. Rather than being brilliant, he found the book to be a collection of insane ramblings and occurances that could only be interesting to Hemingway himself. It was about a man on a search for truth and meaning in the world, but he went about this by getting drunk and pretending that he liked poor people. However, when he saw true poor people in Spain, he thought about how terrible it would be to be them. This made no sense. The philosophy for a better life was more vapid and meaningless than the life before. Rather than changing the emperor's life, it made him long to have 4 hours of his life back.

The exchange between the Count and Jake Barnes in which the Count reveals the secret of staying in love makes \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"" one of America's great books.   Ernest Hemingway provided great comfort to those of the post World War I generation vexed by the seemingly unattainable amid growing material plenty. Jake feels inadequate because his war experience has left him unable to do sexually what he used to do. He's wounded by his lack of marriage to Lady Brett Ashley. Along comes the Count to tell Jake in a veiled and thus powerful way - It's not you. It's the situation. In particular it's this noble yet easily corrupted notion that equates love with possession.   Hemingway isn't fulminating against marriage - he was married four times himself. What he's warning against is making love conditional upon possession. Through the Count, the author is telling us if you love somebody then meet them where they are. Marriage is fine as long as it's based on a mutual understanding, not the desire of one to possess another.   It should certainly not be dependent on any physical appearances as the words and actions of the Biblical patriarchs show us - see Genesis 12:11 and 24:57. For a hint of how the economic concept of acquisition has overflowed its banks, see Max Weber's \\""The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.\\""   Hemingway's meditation on possession echoes Weber in demonstrating the doctrine's wider social implications. Papa can be viewed as warning his countrymen and future generations about indulging in personal material comforts and the nation's drive for dominance in global affairs.   The personal and national drives are summed up in the character of Robert Cohn. The Jewish Cohn is the embodiment of the emerging new immigrant America. Cohn's failure with Lady Ashley proves the Count correct again.   Hemingway's treatment of love and possession is mirrored in \\""The Great Gatsby\\"" and \\""The Bridges of Madison County.\\"" Jay Gatsby isdestroyed by his desire to acquire Daisy Buchanan (this is the \\""foul dust\\"" that F. Scott Fitzgerald foreshadows early in the novel) although he shows himself to be the finest of men by not making his love conditional.   Clint Eastwood's character in the movie version of \\""Bridges\\"" (I haven't read the book yet) sums it up well - \\""They're too many lines being drawn. This is mine. This is yours...\\"" Yet the lure of rescuing someone from a seemingly bad situation is powerful (see King David's experience with Bathsheva, II Samuel chapters 11 and 12) and activates the acquisition impulse. Eastwood's character is nearly seduced by it. His love pulls him up just as he's about to create strife for Meryl Streep's character.  For more about the difference between possession love and true love contrast the agony of Carly Simon's song \\""You Belong to Me\\"" with the serenity of Whitney Houston's \\""I Will Always Love You.\\""  By studying \\""Gatsby\\"" and \\""Bridges\\"" we recount Hemingway's wise counsel of \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"" - love and strife don't go together and if you love someone set them free.",2009-08-07

But, Hemingway's writimg style and language are just so perfect. I love how Hemingway's writing is blunt, and so to the point. It's like he writes directly from trhe heart, without thinking too much. Like oh this sound good, or no, this sounds better. He just states his thoughts on love and on life.    I remember a documentary I saw on Hemingway; about having his heart broken by a women he met during his own service during war. Don't know if a majority of readers are already aware of this. So, as I continued reading the book I kept sensing connections between Cohn and jake, to Hemingway. I think both characters contained certain traits which related to Hemingway's own personal characteristics. I think Hemingway wished he could have been more like Jake in instances of his own life. How Jake was very strong and in control of his emotions, and his resistance to falling absolutly in love with Lady Ashley. Cohn on the other hand makes a complete fool of himself by going head over heels for Lady Ashley. Love showed how weak Cohn is, and how strong, and cool Jake was. Maybe Hemingway's wished he could been more able to be like Jake, and therefore impervious to ever becoming heart-broken.

It's view of life is bleak to the very end, almost to a fault; but it has a kind of sparse poetic grace in descriptive language that carries one through the pessimism on a wave of aesthetic bliss.<br /><br />The greatness is a product of this original narrative style executed to nearly perfect emotional and tonal effect. It is a new kind of stream of consciousness: not flashy, jazzy and allusive like Joyce, Woolf, or (three years later) Faulkner; but instead a steady chain of observations from the inner thoughts of someone who is sane, experienced, and who looks to report reality with a kind of shell-shocked, bunker objectivity; and whose emotions come through in the cynical realism one might expect from a survivor of an apocalypse. At times the spare descriptions created insufficient clarity, so that some sentences cannot be definitively intepreted and so the meaning is lost or diminished, but such sentences are rare.<br /><br />The emotion underneath the cynicism is subtle, and its impact is cumulative. It develops as one comes to trust Hemingway as a truth-teller. The narrator and main character tells a story of aimless and pleasure-less indulgence, in which war trauma (physical and psychological) is the felt but unspoken source and context of all the emptiness in the characters' actions.<br /><br />Jake Barnes is the owner of the consciousness being so artfully described. But Brett Ashley, the woman he loves and can't get away from, is the vortex of all the emotional action. She is a woman who loves Jake and is not deceptive to him, yet because he can't satisfy her she uses several other men for sex. She seems to have some vague variety of intermittent idealism and moral pride, so she occasionally struggles to manage the side-effects of her cold impulsiveness.<br /><br />Brett is a remarkable character in that clearly she is damaged like Jake (psychically if not physically), and yet she has a unique power that none of the men do, and in watching how she uses that power, one cannot decide to the very end of the story if she is more or less of a person than Jake, or if she has courage, or is worth much sympathy, or if her conscience is fully developed, or if she even has a conscience. That is, one wonders if her apparent moral pride and idealism are actually just grief for having lost any moral pride and idealism.<br /><br />Her deep, enigmatic complexity (and how it makes the reader react) is the greatest accomplishment in this story, but given her place as the emotional center of the story, the emptiness surrounding this elusive complexity also makes perhaps the most cynical statement in a book filled with such cynicism, about the powerlessness that emotionally damaged humans have over their own will. The book has a great last line which sums up all of this tough-minded despair.<br /><br />It may be a matter of opinion as to whether 'The Sun Also Rises' is a classic tragedy or just a well-executed exercise in morbid masochism.

It sure was mine. As with \\""Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\"" this is one of the greatest debuts of any novelist and a modernist masterpiece. However, unlike \\""Portrait\\"" this is not a bildungsroman. The closest Hemingway ever had to a Stephen Daedalus is Nick Adams and he is forever relegated to the short stories. From this novel going forward all the main characters are going to be the adult Hemingway and his experiences, albeit with a tagged on name.<br /><br />Twain, whom Hemingway regarded as the greatest American novelist, is a clear influence on the breezy travelogue prose here. I'm reminded of of the kinetic stagecoach experiences of \\""Roughing It.\\"" If Twain sounds old remember that Hemingway was much closer in time to Twain than we are to Hemingway. Twain died just 16 years before the publication of \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"" when Hemingway was 27 years old. However, I sense impressionism was also an influence in the simple broad brush he paints with when describing landscapes. In fact, I know it was via his autobiographical \\""A Moveable Feast.\\"" This is what informs his Zen style. A river, some trees, a patch of strawberries growing on the side of the mountain...you're in an impressionist landscape once they hit the Spanish countryside.<br /><br />It is in this effortless prose that you go cruising right along into the Paris of the twenties, fishing in Basque country, and fiesta in Pamplona. Be prepared also to drink, drink, drink. It's Prohibition but we're not in protestant America, we're in the greatest city of a continent that has been drinking for thousands of years.<br /><br />Twain influence notwithstanding, this no freewheeling jaunt of quaint misadventures sprinkled with Southwestern humor. We're in the post-WWI, post-Spanish influenza (which killed vastly more souls than the war) years of modernism and that means godless ennui, absinthe, and the Lost Generation: arty expats saturated with drink and (self-inflicted) heartache in Paris.<br /><br />Some reader commented \\""I don't get it.\\"" You're not supposed to \\""get it.\\"" If you want to \\""get it\\"" go read a Tom Clancy novel. This is about poignant irony - a high class flapper slut and a castrated vet in love with each other but forever apart. This is about wanting what you cannot have and dealing with it in one of two ways: the WASP-y approach of repression and stoicism (Jake), or the emotional way by drinking yourself stupid (Mike) or imploding and hurling yourself at others (Cohn). This is a bitter Je ne sais quoi ode to the unconsummated longings of expatriate Americans and Brits in 1920's Paris and it's not meant to be understood, simply experienced. Happy endings are impossible here.<br /><br />But the characters' sexcapades and drinking are only the story - the rest is the poetry of Hemingway: the river, the Basques on the bus, the festival of San Fermin and of course the bullfights. Because Hemingway is so associated with the bullfights you expect the running of the bulls to be a long descriptive event in the novel and it's a nice surprise when it is not. Jake, the narrator, is hungover and wakes up late and watches it from the balcony of his hotel then goes back to bed. When they run again he sleeps through it. Whatever your preconceptions are about Hemingway it won't matter - everything in this book reads fresh and new and the prose is effortless and flows like the wine in the bota bags.<br /><br />The closest Hemingway ever came to an artistic manifesto can be found not in his \\""iceberg analogy\\"" interview with the Paris Review, but in the following quote from him:<br /><br />\\""All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened and after you are finished reading one you will feel that all that happened to you and afterwards it all belongs to you; the good and the bad, the ecstasy, the remorse, and sorrow, the people and the places and how the weather was.

We are treated to the café lifestyle of the Lost Generation in Paris, followed by a trip to Pamplona to witness the running of the bulls, all of it liberally lubricated by alcohol.  But despite the nearly non-stop pleasure-seeking, there is very little joy for the characters in this book.  It all has the feel of a party that has gone on too long; the party-goers become irritated with each other because they should have all gone back to their \\""real\\"" lives long ago.  Unfortunately, they are not sure what their real lives should consist of, so they grasp at temporary relationships that always end badly, leaving them ever more jaded and unsatisfied.  This is dramatized powerfully by the cloud of men buzzing around the lovely and charming Brett, who abandons each in turn when the threat of physical and emotional intimacy becomes too great.  It is Jake's inability to perform the physical act of love that enables their extended emotional connection, making him the person she turns to after each failed affair.  I suspect that if Jake were not wounded as he is, she would flee from him as well, and the final paragraphs of the novel make it clear that Jake thinks so, too.    If there are few pleasures for the characters, there are many for the reader.  In addition to Hemingway's masterful depiction of character, the novel works as a travelogue, particularly in his wonderful evocation of Spain.

I never read anything until a year ago when I picked up a copy of The Old Man and the Sea, which I liked. This year a friend of mine was sent ten copies of this by the publisher as a gift. Who am I to refuse?<br /><br />Hemingway, I think, is one of our national treasures for a number of reasons. Obviously, his sense of journalistic integrity helped him become the novelist that he is. But this book isn't just good because of the style. Hemingway also has a knack for choosing to write about things that are inherently wrenching and interesting.<br /><br />The story, essentially about a man castrated by the war and his doomed half-love for a slutty, spoiled ex-girlfriend, is backgrounded by a vacation in Spain, where Jake, the main character, and his friends go fishing before the fiesta of the running of the bulls. The drama behind this intimate almost-love-affair is what really puts this book over the top and where it becomes a masterpiece. The descriptions of Spain, of water, of simple pleasures, of bullfighting, of eating, of getting drunk, of fighting, of swimming, are almost grotesquely beautiful; they will turn your heart over.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, however, it's clear that Hemingway made an intelligent, clear stance. He's not just a writer, he's a master; and his writing style is one that he chose because he understood both that he was gifted with an incomparable grace and how to manage its effects to their most extreme. To quote him:<br /><br />\\""She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull, and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bullfighters used to make it look as theough they were working closely . . . Romero's bullfighting gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of the line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time.

Then, when one reads a book like this, one clearly understands and is not afraid to feel the irony of this book; its amoral characters, and its nihilistic portrait.<br /><br />By 2008, that center is nowhere to be found, and hence readers look for something else in any book; sympathize with the characters, to get something warm and true in the positive sense from the experience, to \\""enjoy\\"" books, rather than learning a dry lesson (the spare prose helps) in the negative.

I don't know how clear I was in expressing my thoughts, but I feel that irony in writing has outlived its usefulness.<br /><br />Also, these characters do not think, or do their best not to.

The war is alluded to so obliquely that its importance in fully understanding this book may elude altogether those unfamiliar with the psychic cataclysm it caused in society after 1918. At the time, Hemingway didn't need to talk about the war directly; his readers would have recognized its presence in the shell-shocked attitude of his characters immediately.

Brett is an alcoholic nymphomaniac who may ((or may not)) be driven to self-destructive excess by the inability to consummate her love for Jake. In effect, Jake is the wise, passive, philosophical eunuch at the center of this expatriate circle of friends. He is the mediating buffer between Brett's lovers, keeping the party going, as it were, defusing the potentially explosive passions around him when they don't simply fizzle out from sheer exhaustion.<br /><br />By the end of the novel, carried along by the precision of Hemingway's prose, caught up in the ennui-inducing cadences you tend to forget the imitations and parodies that have all but rendered his style a hardboiled clich&eacute;.

These are: Romero, the matador, who brings both excellence and integrity to his work; and Robert Cohn, a romantic who is in love with the alcoholic Lady Brett. When the powerful aspirations of these characters emerge in TSAR, the shallowness, emptiness, and cruelty of other characters--Jake Barnes, Bill Gorton, and Mike Campbell--finally comes into focus. Thereafter, TSAR is fabulous.<br /><br />But before these values are established, Hemingway seems only to be telling a story about the superficial sociability of thirty-somethings in the 1920's. These characters drink too much and are incapable of love, sometimes due to their wounding experiences in World War I. Their lives are mostly alcoholic busyness and Hemingway captures their tedious gaiety to perfection. But without the foils of excellence and idealism, these characters and their behavior seem merely dull, boyish, and humorless. Further, they are relentlessly anti-Semitic, which this reader experienced as a brainless reaction to the unrewarding and trivial content of their days and nights. (If something is wrong, blame Robert Cohn.)<br /><br />Stylistically, TSAR is uneven. Frequently, Hemingway uses a technique of following observations in strict temporal sequence. This works wonderfully when, say, Jake is praying in church and his mind moves, without much control, from one subject to the next. But this technique works less well when Hemingway describes the countryside, which is often. His style is: I saw this. Then I saw that. Next came this. The effect is that the writing doesn't attain focus. Here's one of many examples, this one from Chapter 10:<br /><br />\\""We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest, and there were white cattle grazing in the forest.

This is a story about addiction.  This is a story about finding yourself in a torn apart society.<br /><br />There are two beautifully written scenes.  The first is a scene out in nature (Spanish wilderness) with the typical Hemingway fishing scene between two men that provides the most truthful dialogue of the entire novel.  Since they are away from civilization the men are also somewhat free from the boxed-in feeling they felt in society.  Absolutely beautifully written.  Hemingway really knows how to tap into the human psyche.<br /><br />The other scene takes place during the bullfighting season in Spain.  Lady Ashley is like the bull with all the rest of the men around her as the steers.  She becomes enamored with a spanish bullfighter and essentially leaves the other men she was somewhat dating for him.  The scenes are well described and full of powerful emotions Hemingway is so good at describing.<br /><br />All in all, what a fantastic novel.

Who wouldn't enjoy a European vacation like Jake Barnes'?  Especially those sections where he is alone in San Sabastian swimming, eating and drinking or fishing with Bill on the Irati River.  Even Jake's life as a newspaperman in Paris, filled with long, lingering lunches, and visits by eccentric characters and hard-noised newspapermen with snappy, peppy comebacks, creates a picture that is far from alienating.  This is, in some ways, part of the appeal of The Sun Also Rises.  The nostalgia is contagious. Throughout the novel many of the characters have nostalgia for the First World War, a war which damaged them all physically, psychologically, or both.  Compared to the muddle of civilian life in the 1920s, the simplicity of war's exigencies created a mix of nostalgia and forgetfulness.  The same holds for us, the readers of The Sun Also Rises, the heirs to its vision of disillusionment.  Our losses and extractions are so dramatic, our culture so debased, that The Sun's bleak landscape of loss is appealing, poetic, romantic.",2008-07-14

Hurt is too intrusive as a reader.  He hams up the part of Michael Campbell with a thick and drunken Scottish accent.  His reading makes a likeable character like Jake's buddy Bill seem like an oaf. His impression of Lady Ashley leaves one wondering why Jake or anyone else would even bother with her. Actors, of course, are supposed to interpret the work, but a lighter hand is necessary when reading a book as opposed to acting out a play.  Moreover, Hurt's interpretation is unjustifiably negative.  Yes, Hemingway is writing about the post-World-War-I \\""Lost Generation\\"" and, yes, Jake hangs with a bunch of alcoholic wretches, but Hurt's interpretation is a bit too cartoon-like.  There is more subtlety to these characters than Hurt is willing to acknowledge.     As for Hemingway's book, it's worth reading and re-reading.  And this audiobook has allowed me to re-read the book easily at a later stage in life.  In some ways the book does not age well.  Robert Cohn is a central character, and the rank anti-semitism of the author as well as his characters is inexcusable.  Cohn's \\""Jewishness\\"" is totally gratuitous.  Hemingway could have sketched this character without this cheap and mean-spirited use of the easy prejudices that so pervaded his time.  Yes, we have to give Hemingway some slack and not judge him by modern standards; but not everyone was an anti-semite back then and a better man would have overcome this social prejudice.    On the other hand, the book is extraordinary for the muscularity of its prose.  The story is told largely through dialogue and spare descriptions.  It is a riveting style that draws the reader into the book and requires the reader to make many of the essential judgments about the various characters.      I can't agree with those reviewers who are left unmoved by the story.  The story is quite interesting andfast moving.  And it touches on the elemental themes of how to define a moral code in a lost world.  Also striking is Hemingway's struggle with how to define masculinity in such a world.  Jake seems to strike the best balance between assertiveness and empathy, but lacks the physical abilities.  Cohn has the physical gifts but none of the emotional ones.  The other characters seem to suffer from various self-destructive impulses, which seems to be a common outlet for the the masculine impulse.  Perhaps the best masculine role model is the bullfighter, Romero, but there are hints that even he is prone to corruption and self-destructiveness.    I recommend the book, but see if there is an older, better reading somewhere.",2008-05-22

Hemingway had a history of alcoholism and this novel serves as release for the author. The speaker, Jake, takes an adventure and in turn experiences a self-discovery. The fiestas, society, and friends meant everything for Jake at the novel's opening. However through a difficult journey dealing with lost love and false friends, Jake manages to realize several truths in his life: his drinking will lose him friends and those he calls friends are not true in their loyalty.    Montoya, the hotel owner that shared Jake's passion for bullfighting, no longer wished to associate with Jake after the fiesta. Due to all the rabble-rousing, partying, drinking, and the friends Jake brought, Montoya no longer could bear to be associated with Jake. Hemingway, too, lost friends as a result of his hurtful drinking habits.    Despite his losses, Jake realizes that his love for Brett is merely and allusion. The novel ends:  \\""'Oh, Jake,' Brett said, 'we could have had such a damned good time together.'... 'Yes,' I said. 'Isn't it pretty to think so?'\\""  Jake has come to terms with the fact that he is to be a loner, that he needs to be alone.    The Sun Also Rises is considered not only one of Ernest Hemingway's best books, but also one of the greatest classics of modern literature. I believe that the book is so powerful to read because the author underwent a catharsis in writing the novel. In writing the novel, Hemingway attacks his alcoholism and takes the first steps towards dealing with it. It is from that natural process that the reader is able to feel the emotions in the book. The language is curt yet true. The book is great.",2008-05-22

The story of the trip to the bullfights in Spain was true and one of many that Hemingway and his friends made in 1920s Spain. It takes place in a few days and this was the first big novel that made him famous. Prior to this, he was known as a short story writer. One character, Robert Cohn, was a friend who was quite angry at his role in the fictionalized version of the trip. He thought Hemingway had made him look like a fool and he threatened to kill Hemingway, a famous brawler among his friends. There was a small bar in Paris, across the street from the Cafe de la Paix, where they all used to hang out. It is no longer there but was on my first trip to Paris. Hemingway spent several days waiting for this disgruntled friend to come in the bar so he could try to defuse the anger before something serious happened. Finally, after about a week, the friend walked in and Earnest jumped up, ran over to him and shook his hand, greeting him as an old friend. The ploy worked and the feud was over.

I reread \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"" last week, and to my surprise, I adored it. I remembered having experienced utter boredom the first time around, but now I know it was only because I did not know how to read, obviously.    Hemingway's use of economy of words and understatement are things you must be aware of, which means: simply because the style appears simple does not mean the text is. There is a lot more than meets the eye, and for this, one may easily miss out on the essential heart of the novel. This is certainly what I did on my first reading.     Short sentences perhaps tend to make the reader read faster, and that would be a fatal mistake with Hemingway. Because you have less, you must pay more attention. The narrative will not give you chewed meat: you have to do your own chewing. And this is Hemingway's strong point and trade-mark, and narratively speaking, it works wonders if you work with it. I was of the mind that his style only really worked for short stories, but \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"" proved me wrong. This is a powerful novel, highly enjoyable, and a landmark in worldwide literature.    Certainly one of Hemingway's best, and one of those novels you must read!

Perhaps I can explain why. Perhaps I cannot. Let me make an effort, though I fear it shall please no one.<br /><br />I do not know if I'll open another Hemingway book anytime soon, but since this was the first novel by this writer I have read, maybe it's premature to make judgments about his entire body of work. Still, as I struggled through one flat and boring chapter after the next in the dialogue-driven The Sun Also Rises, populated as it was with single-dimensional characters I did not like, situations that disgusted me, and settings that were admittedly nicely-described, I kept having a thought that no doubt qualifies among Hemingway fans as heresy: do the masses truly like Hemingway's novels, or are they swept up in the mystique of his legend to the point that this carries into the books themselves and therein explains their power to draw so much praise?<br /><br />Frankly, folks, I didn't see a lot to embrace here. Hemingway's sentences were like bare skeletons devoid of flesh above them. I expected genius and found mediocrity: mediocrity and a cast of spoiled, mildly tragic middle-aged figures who drank themselves sick, quarreled, traipsed across western Europe and left behind abandoned children and jilted spouses, all in pursuit of the excitement that eluded them. They did not even have the excuse of youth to exonerate them, these were by any definition adults. I kept thinking that, well, maybe if more than one of them actually had a job they wouldn't have had so much time on their hands to feel miserable and dissipate. As for them being a, to quote Gertrude Stein, \\""Lost Generation\\"" robbed of meaning by war, it was made clear that so many of these characters began their lives of irresponsibility well before the outbreak of the First World War.<br /><br />Furthermore this novel was not a story, it was a series of loosely connected situations. In my opinion, Fitzgerald, Hemingway's contemporary, wrote rings around Hemingway, as did several other writers of the period I could name. Also for a man who won the Nobel Prize, Hemingway's habit of mixing past and present tenses (I'm talking about in his prose, not character dialogue) surprised me. To all the English teachers out there who used to get on my case for committing this compositional error, I'd like to ask, if mixing tenses is bad writing, then why did this author win the Nobel Prize, and if he won the Nobel Prize mixing tenses, then why is it bad writing?<br /><br />I do not wish to give the impression I loathed The Sun Also Rises, because I didn't. I did enjoy the frank exchange of views between this novel's characters on issues of race, religion, and general ethos, their use of epithets verboten today, and the politics of sexual congress, but that alone did not carry the plot to conclusion, and too much fell too limply by. Truthfully, the novel is about expatriate drunks who go on holiday to Spain to watch bulls be slaughtered by a young man after whom the central female character lusts. As for the dialogue, anyone who finds depth in the conversations the characters have is inventing that depth himself.

And, when one comes into a story that assumes you have lived it, it is difficult to fully appreciate the story. The Sun Also Rises is that kind of story.    The dissolutes who wander Paris and Pamplona hardly muster sympathy from the likes of us, who know only a war fought surgically at high altitude, on television. In our times, so far anyway, the hapless grunts in harm's way are volunteers, who volunteered without conscription as the alternative. To those of WWI, it was a Hobson's choice.    This story is set in the early to mid 1920's. With the glories of battle of a Beowolf now permanently erased from the imaginations of these characters, and the mindless slaughter of civlized warfare firmly implanted in its place; our heroes roam foreign lands in search of a reason to live. That debauchery is the reason should be no surprise. It was age and experience appropriate.    Yet there's implied redemption.

I'd say about half of the book is taken up by very realistic and choppy conversation among the characters.  Much of this conversation (as well as the narrators musings) seem rather inane in many parts but help develop the characters into real people.<br /><br />An excellent book and a great example of Hemingway's style.",2007-12-05

Just read The Sun Also Rises with my book group, and every one of us was disappointed. Much is ballyhooed about Hemingway's writing, but we all found it painfully choppy and repetitive, with a tendency towards detail that does nothing to further the story.  This distinctive style may appeal to some, as evidenced by many of the previous reviews, and it must have seemed avant garde in the 1920s. But uniqueness does not equal excellence.    Hemingway's characters were vapid and unsympathetic--all alcoholics, all self-indulgent, all living without purpose, all socioeconomic and racial snobs. What's to like here? And each of the men is unexplainably infatuated with the same woman, whose only claim to fame is her willingness to cuckold her fiancee with anyone with an XY combination. Okay, okay...you don't always have to like the players, but you have to be able to connect with them on some level.  The consensus was that we'd hate to be trapped in an elevator with any of them, and we came away from the novel feeling that we'd learned nothing about what makes people tick.    We did enjoy the chapters that revolved around the bullfights themselves--some really vivid descriptive passages are the reason for my two stars.

Going beyond the tragic hero, the charcters are perhaps best described as arrogant and self-centered.  Coupled with the terse writing style of Hemingway, this makes for a quick read with a somewhat clever plot.    While bull fighting actually takes place in the plot, it is also a clever metaphor used in the story.  The main character Robert Cohn follows Lady Brett Ashley around like a stupid bull follows a bull fighter.  It is hard to feel sorry for Cohn when everybody realizes Brett's disinterest in Cohn except Cohn.  It comes to a head when Brett falls for the bull fighter and Cohn assaults his friends for viciously taunting him about Brett's disinterest.    While the main theme is somewhat clever, much of the other prose seems to be self-loathing and scenary.  When the characters get drunk, they pour their hearts and failures out like spilling wine.  Even when Bret finds her resolution, the reader could anticipate the downfall.    It is difficult to like any character in the story which may leave the reader with an awkward feeling.

The novel features a cast of characters that are not especially likable and the first third of the novel moves a little too slowly (Jake and his friends lead aimless lives -and the first part of the novel is pretty aimless).<br /><br />Jake and his fellow expatriates spend the entire novel getting drunk, being drunk, or recovering from having been drunk (or `tight' as they like to say).

It would be easy to dismiss these characters as unpleasant, and therefore uninteresting, but in the context of the years following WWI, I found myself feeling some sympathy for them.<br /><br />Simply put, they're damaged goods.  Jake, Mike, and Bill all fought in WWI(Jake becoming less of a man as a result) and were forever affected by it.

Jake, Mike, and Cohn are all in love with her to varying degrees and pay an emotional price as a result.  Brett's self centered behaviour complicates the lives of the men who are enamored by her.  Jake, who is impotent because of the war, demonstrates his love for Brett by helping her pursue men and then picking up the pieces when the affair ends badly.<br /><br />There is no happiness for the lost generation in The Sun Also Rises and considerable irony in the novel's final sentence.

After the third reading, the writing style seemed to disappear into the background, and it became almost soothing.  I began to see more of the characters through the clarity of the writing, and they became much more real to me.  The depth of the plot and symbolism started to come through, even though I'm not particularly searching for such things. <br /> <br />As I write this, I almost feel like I'm at the very beginning of understanding him.  Almost like if you program in Lisp for awhile, you stop seeing the parentheses. <br /> <br />I think this book is now one that I'm going to pick up many more times in my lifetime because of the familiarity of it, and the feelings of \\""home\\"" it brings to me.  I don't know if that's what Hemingway intended, but I feel pretty close to Jake and the rest of the characters. <br /> <br />I suppose what I want others to get out of this review, is that if you're afraid to read Hemingway because it's going to be too hard, you're way off.  There is something for everyone here.  You might even find it *too* easy at the first reading and go back for more.. just like I did.  I think as I go through Hemingway, it'll be like peeling away layers of an onion.  Even if I never peel away more than one or two layers, it's still worth it. <br /> <br />I'd recommend this book to anyone... really, it's readable by anyone.  You don't need an education in literature or to be particularly \\""sophisticated\\"".  It's an easy read, so if you don't like it.. not much wasted, but I really think you won't regret it, especially if you go back for a second or third helping. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />",2006-12-11

The way he wrote was by working damned hard, harder than most writers have ever worked.  He thought through each sentence as a thought as well as a sentence, and this is no easy task, and yields no easy formula.  Hence the newness and subtlety, and the sense that \\""The Sun Also Rises,\\"" though full of frivolous characters, is sturdy and never frivolous.  It is unified by a sort of analytic integrity, and it needed a man with both feet on the ground to lend it weight. <br /> <br />The plot of \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"" seems to make much of nothing.  Food is talked about, drinks are drunk, and young people do a lot of not thinking.  Jake, the American narrator, lives in Paris and travels to Spain to fish and watch bullfights.  His principle companions are a preppy leech and a weak flirt.  He's in love with the girl.  And yet the story doesn't meander because it isn't distracted by the allure of the inessential.  Go elsewhere to feel lost in France or Spain.  Hemingway was interested in making, not describing--in building art through language like Cezanne built images in paint: with deep structure trumping impressionistic reportage.  Like a Cezanne canvas, \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"" seems drained of anecdote but never mundane.  It forsakes the grand gestures but leaves the formal tension.  Startlingly strong feeling bleeds through. <br /> <br />(Even the bullfight scenes, where Hemingway lets himself get a bit journalistic, come off as more color and feeling than event or spectacle.  Maybe all were one in Pamplona.)   <br /> <br />Is \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"" his best book?  Maybe. \\""For Whom the Bell Tolls\\"" certainly beats it for scope and local color, and has the distinction of being one of the best war books ever written, and that's a category to care about.

The male protagonist, Jake Barnes, is apparently impotent and thus, is left to taking care of Lady Brett Ashley without any of the pleasurable rewards.  Don't look for a plot, there isn't one.  The book is simply a recitation on what expatriates did in Paris and Spain after World War I.  Hemingway's style is clear and succinct, but definitely overrated.

To say that he is considered the defining novelist of the twentieth century, I find his work to be ordinary, with little to really comment on. <br /> <br />There are moments in the novel where one is struck by the loneliness of the lead character, Jake. This is attained through the style of prose, which is hard and straightforward; dialogue and scenery-driven and lacking in inward contemplation. This does effectively create the feeling of isolation of a character who, like Hemingway himself, has experienced the first world war and is a member of the \\""Lost generation\\"". Jake finds himself carried aimlessly through Europe with characters who seem to be endlessly eating and drinking to conceal inner emptiness.

It is difficult to press on with a book in which you realize part way through that nothing is going to happen.

He and his rather dysfunctional group of friends live in Paris and decide to take a group trip to Spain. Hemingway's purpose in writing this story was to critique the people of post war society, a.k.a. the Lost Generation.  <br /> Hemingway creates a story that seems stripped to the bare essentials by using a very straightforward writing style. He omits much of the detail that would become monotonous within the plot and provides the reader with characters that are seemingly incapable of receiving sympathy. As for myself, I thought the characters were pathetic because they wasted much of their time drinking, having sex, or longing to have sex. The sexual themes within the novel are very prevalent, because Brett, the main woman present, is indeed very sexually active. The novel lacks having an engaging plot even  though it is written very well.  <br /> Hemingway's main characters, Jake and Brett lack in depth. Jake is almost always found drinking, alone, or pursuing the love of his life, Brett. His pursuance of Brett ,however, is pointless because the war rendered him impotent and thus lacks in Brett's favorite past time. He becomes the most sympathized for, because he nobly sacrifices his own feelings for the betterment of Brett. Brett, on the other hand, is the object of all men's desires. Being beautiful, she gets what she wants and without a bit of emotion, kicks the old to the curb and says hello to the new. Her lack of emotion and inconsiderate nature tend to pull any sense of liking Brett as a character.  <br /> Overall, Hemingway creates a group of friends, and main characters that make you thankful for what you have. You walk away from the novel thinking, \\""I'm so glad that's not me!\\"" As a whole, it showcases Hemingway's incredible writing style, but lacks in what makes for a most memorable experience... interesting plot.      <br />",2006-04-18

Jake was a soldier in World War One and is now living out the rest of his life in France and Spain.  Hemingway wrote this book as a critique on the lives of people in post World War One society.  He describes the lives of the Lost Generation, those who fought and lived through the horrors of World War One.  This review describes the background for The Sun Also Rises, summarizes the main points, and discusses the overall effect The Sun Also Rises has. <br /> <br />        Hemingway wrote this book between 1924 and 1926, a few years after World War One ended.  Many World War One Veterans came back from the war disillusioned.  Life lost most of its purpose for the veterans after seeing so many die in such a brutal fashion.  Hemingway is commenting on how World War One changed these people's lives for the worse.  He does this through describing the lives of Jake and his friends. <br /> <br />        The book opens with Jake and his friends living their lives like normal.  They are writers living in Paris.  Jake says, \\""Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself.  Braddocks was his literary friend\\"" (5).  Then Robert, Jake, and their friends Mike, Bill, and Brett travel to Pamplona, Spain to join in the fiesta of San Fermin.  During the fiesta things start to go wrong for the friends.  Everyone is drinking nonstop and this makes disagreements come to the front.  Brett and Mike are engaged to be married but Robert Cohn wants to marry Brett, this conflict ends in a fight between Robert, Jake, and Mike.  This happened during an argument, Jake describes, \\""I swung at him and he ducked.  I saw his face duck sideways in the light.  He hit me\\"" (191).  Near the end Brett ends up running off with a bullfighter named Pedro Romero.  However, there is still more to the story in which you will have to read to find out how it ends. <br /> <br />        This book does an excellent job of getting the point across that Hemingway was trying to convey.  Hemingway does an amazing job of showing how terrible life is for the Lost Generation.  The war has completely ruined Jake's life.  Jake and Brett both love each other; however they cannot be together because of a war wound Jake received.  At the end Brett says, \\""Oh, Jake, we could have had such a damned good time together\\"" (247).  Had Jake not been injured in the war he could have lived a happy life with Brett.  Instead he just passes the time, either drunk or alone.  After the fiesta of San Fermin, Jake went off by himself.  He did not wish to stay with his friends. Instead his philosophy was \\""If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money.  I spent a little money and the waiter liked me\\"" (233).  He did not need true friends; people who were nice to him were all he wanted.  Life had no purpose for Jake; he was just letting the days pass him by. <br /> <br />        Ernest Hemingway's book The Sun Also Rises is set in the decade after World War One, describes Jake's life, and does a great job of critiquing the lives of the Lost Generation.  This is a great book that everyone should read.  It does a good job of describing the impacts of war on the soldiers.

Hemingway captures the feel of that city and the \\""in\\"" crowd that partied there.  The story is told by narrator Jake Barnes, an American whose mysterious wound from the war (World War One) has left him sexually incapable.  This makes forever unattainable the British object of his affections, chic and lovely Brett.  Others in the clique include Brett's drunken fianc Mike Campbell, her angry ex-lover Robert Cohn, and sardonic novelist Bill Gorton. These characters hang together and enjoy themselves, despite disillusionment, alienation and longing - not too mention rather empty lives and a sad fixation with alcohol.  Even their playful trip to Pamplona to watch the Spanish bullfights feels like a competing mix of good times and escape.   <br /> <br />Despite Hemingway's crisp prose this is an over-rated novel, and far from the author's top efforts like FAREWELL TO ARMS and OLD MAN AND THE SEA. Still, Hemingway was on his way, and he joined James Thurber, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, William L. Shirer, Gertrude Stein and Kay Boyle as talented U.S. writers who spent much time in Paris during the 1920's.    <br />",2006-03-04

I realize Hemingway is a master of American literature and is revered by legions, but I simply am not impressed with The Sun Also Rises.  Our characters are disillusioned members of the Lost Generation, those people who experienced WWI, and residing as expatriates who enjoy the many lavishes of France and Spain.

Although they have obviously had a long history together, Hemmingway leaves most of it up to the imagination. Similarly, much of Jakes personality is not directly described, but left to the reader to infer based on his interactions and descriptions of Cohn. Hemmingway takes a \\""Skinner behavioral\\"" approach to motives and cognitions; he only describes the stimulus and the behavioral reaction with no attempt to describe feelings, perceptions or intents.<br /><br />On my initial reading of the Sun Also Rises when I was in college, I think I was drawn to the party atmosphere of the book. It's the life I would love to live if I didn't need to work and had lots of money. Across country lines and from one fiesta to another, how great. Jake constantly is socializing, drinking and meeting new people. He often enters a bar with one group of friends and leaves with others. The book describes a better spring break than any MTV reality show. Subsequent reads of the novel bring out much more intimate study of human personality.<br /><br />The climax of the story occurs in Pamplona, Spain at the Fiesta of San Fermin. A radical festival takes place in which the people of Pamplona play the leading part, but in which the characters come to full physical and emotional conflict. Hemmingway's description of the activities and emotions of the quasi-religious festival brought the running of the bulls and bullfights into the American conscious.<br /><br />The Sun Also Rises is existential in its approach to life. Jake claims to be a catholic and goes to church several times. Within the story there are several references to Catholicism and catholic colleges. However, Hemmingway aims to describe life, as it should be, with no regard to an after life. As a man, you are judged based on how you conduct yourself on the earth during your life time. Based on The Sun Also Rises, a ranking system of \\""manhood\\"" can be constructed according to three factors: 1) grace under pressure (in face of death), 2) level of passion (aficion) for which they live life and 3) by their response to the man-eater Lady Brett Ashley.

Robert Cohn: Lowest level of manhood. May seem like a likeable and insightful fellow, but becomes irritating over time.

Both concise and detailed, his sentences seem choppy when separated from a passage but when strung together flow with aesthetic quality. And it is the simple beauty of not only the language with which he writes, but his ability to capture the human psyche perfectly within in each of his characters that makes this novel timeless. It has no need for the overly dramatic plots or climatic scenes that make modern novels so frivolous; the characters are all that is needed. Each one that was introduced into the plot was easily identifiable; I saw within each my best friend, my brother, and my neighbor, I knew exactly the types of people he wrote about. And it was this character interaction that kept the novel afloat. Whether it was Jack, Brett, Bill, or Mike's ever present drunken follies or the love triangles constantly being roused by Lady Ashley, Hemingway never missed an opportunity to comment on the lost generation; those poor, hapless souls, drained of hope and morality by the Great War, who drank away their years in Europe. With lost morality these friends loved, lived, and lost for a sunny week in Spain that helped reveal just how complex human relationships can be. Nothing was as subtly insightful though, as the underlying theme of the impotence affecting Jack which reveals that a loss to masculinity is not just physical but mental too.  <br /> <br /> Ernest Hemingway has once again created a masterpiece with his laconic, masculine prose that when vaguely skimmed appears elementary and choppy but when savored reveals it's wisdom and beauty.

Jake explains to Georgette that the clocks displayed in the window show the hour in each of the four time zones across America. Georgette, who is a prostitute from Belgium, looks at the clocks in the window and says: \\""Don't kid me.\\"" <br /> <br />It is an odd little scene, and on the face of it doesn't make sense.  But it is the key to the book.  The novel is about time and death.  For Georgette and Jake, who are survivors of the 1914-18 war, time doesn't exist in the traditional sense.  For the survivors of the war, as for the dead, time is understood to be over.  <br /> <br />In the 19th century, most Americans considered the passage of time to be a metronome of human progress.  The equation of time with progress was a form of  boosterism, born from the great success of the industrial revolution and the Westward expansion of the country.  As time went on, things got bigger, better, faster, richer and further West.  Time and progress were synonymous.  <br /> <br />For the war generation, this naively optimistic view of time and industrial progress ended abruptly and in it ended in violence.  It seemed that industrial progress had paid itself off in the industrialization of death - the machine gun, the French 75s, the recoilless artillery of Krupp.  <br /> <br />The Great War was not a gallant, romantic, sabers on horseback conflict like that depicted in late 19th century newspaper accounts of the Spanish American war.  The Great War of 1914-18 came to be seen, from the point of view of writers in the 1920s, as an unfair fight between men and (indifferent, impersonal, efficient) killing machines. A highly mechanized slaughterhouse. <br /> <br />Hemingway's generation, the so-called \\""lost generation,\\"" was lost in fact.  A generation died in the war.  The statistics of mortality were for those days stunning and incredible.  <br /> <br />The novel is set in Paris around 1924, six years after the armistice.  For the characters who were soldiers or survivors like Jake and Georgette, the daily circuit of the sun is a clock without purpose.  Time is meaningless to them, just as it is to the dead.  Hence, the sun \\""also\\"" rises.  It happens every morning of course but it is an event that occurs off to one side.  It does not bring the hope of a new dawn, it does not mean \\""life goes on.\\""  In this novel, emphatically, life does not go on - there is no progress.   <br /> <br />The war survivors' perception of time has shrunk to the present moment, in which they live.  They elaborately avoid looking back - the war is just a huge hole in their personal stories -- and they cannot look forward, in the sense of \\""looking forward to\\"" a superior future. For the survivors of the war, time has been turned around, flipped.  Death has already happened - it is behind them.   They do see the sun rise and set.  But although time passes, it does not really go anywhere.    <br /> <br />The passage of time into a brighter future, the progress of the sun through a succession of time zones across the US from east to west - all this strikes the Belgian survivor, Georgette, as utter nonsense. \\""Don't kid me.\\"" She says.  <br /> <br />The war is the silent, unmentionable core of The Sun Also Rises, but the characters sometimes mention it inadvertently, in asides, and the reader gets tiny glimpses of what happened to these people the war, and what it did to them.   <br /> <br />They never move forward. Writers start, or fail to start, books that they never finish.  Love affairs lead to nothing, no marriages and no babies.  There is a constant theme of drinking to coast through the present and to forget the past.  Another diversion is an obsessive concentration on the sensual minutia of the present moment.  Jake, a former combat pilot who has suffered some sort of wound to his groin, never detailed, is outside of time in the biological sense that he cannot reproduce.  He has lost his \\""line\\"", that is, the line of familial and biological continuity between past and future. <br /> <br />Conflicts in the book frequently arise as mutually amazed confrontations between Americans who skipped the war, and still have their 19th century sense of optimism and progress and honor intact -- and the \\""new\\"" Americans like Hemingway - expatriates from American space but, more importantly, from the old American sense of time as something positive.  In what has probably become the most famous line in the book Jakes says: \\""I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together.\\""   As an American war veteran, Jake himself has a huge rip through his own story.  <br /> <br />This year, The Sun Also Rises is 80 years old.

But beneath the surface is where the depth of character and meaning reside making Hemingway that rarest of breeds, the writer both accessible to the common reader and challenging to the reader looking for something more.   <br />All of that said what drives this wonderful novel is great characters.  They are not great in the sense that they are outstanding people.  They are great in the sense that they are wonderfully developed and wholly believable.  Robert Cohn is perhaps the most annoying invention this side of Fran Drescher, but his character rings true, and while we hold contempt for him, we also pity him.   <br />The story is about a man, Jake, who lives in paris after the first world war, and works as a journalist for a foreign paper.  Jake is in love with Brett, but due to an unspecified war injury, he is unable to consummate the relationship.  Robert Cohn is Jakes clingy friend who takes an instant liking to Brett, and has no such shortcomings as Jake.  He does however, manage to alienate Brett because she never loved him.  He also alienates Jake, because of the love Jake holds for Brett.  He alienates Brett's soon to be husband as well, and Jake's true friend Bill Gordon.  All of this happens during the vivid description of a fishing trip in which Hemingway equates nature with God, as the stream Jake fishes in is more akin to church than church, to a bullfight festival that is a lively and vibrant as if it were happening right in front of you.

This is unfortunate because Hemingway's best books were written early in his career, from about 1924 to 1940.  I feel that his most complete vision was achieved in For Whom the Bell Tolls, which is a large book with all of Hemingway's ideas, interspersed with a thrilling plot.  If I had a second choice, I'd vote for Sun Also Rises. Obviously the famous Hemingway style derived from Gertrude Stein and journalism.  Then he wrote about Post-WW1 cynicism and a love  gone awry.  The famous Lost Generation mops up Parisian wine and European despair with vigor.    The villain is Cohn the Jew.  I have some reservations here of course.  I feel the same way about Shakespeare's Shylock, but putting historical prejudices aside, Cohn personifies what is not cool about intellectual society in the Twenties.  Cohn doesn't get Paris, bullfighting, or fishing.  He's a great boxer, but does not box for the right reasons.  Don't worry, Hem will explain what are the right reasons.  Worst of all, Cohn doesn't get the sexual revolution.

The chief characters, besides Barnes are Bill, Robert Cohn, Mike Campbell, and Lady Brett Ashley.  That all the male characters are in love with the promiscuous Brett is just one of the tensions building as they travel to Spain for the fiesta of the running of the bulls in Pamplona.  The realistically presented bullfight yields a lesson in bull and steer herd dynamics, which becomes a metaphor for the gang's own conflicts as it steadily becomes apparent that what binds them together is the frustrating attempt to find purpose and reason in the wake of the physical and emotional devastation of wartime experience.  Hemingway employs a line spoken by Gertrude Stein in conversation as an epigram: \\""You are all a lost generation.\\"" He also quotes from the first chapter of Ecclesiastes: \\""One generation passeth, and another generation commeth: but the earth abideth forever.  The sun also riseth . . .\\""   <br /> <br />In any other hands, Hemingway's story would have been so much melodrama. In his, it is comic and tragic. His story is charged with top of the craft writing.  He excels at exposition, voice, character, dialogue, setting, and style.  Symbolism sneaks in without the author having to bang the reader over the head.  What seems like so many simple declarative sentences--he did this, she said that--creates a fully dimensional literary experience.  The characters are fully drawn, representative of their time but also of universal conflicts.  That some express antisemitic sentiments that are no longer socially acceptable (though not necessarily extinguished) provides thought-provoking material for comparing generations.There is much to discuss in this book and it is far too good to avoid by capitulating to study guides. <br />",2004-08-03

Clearly, this is a first novel, but a very good one. The first half of the book is slow and not exactly compelling, and yet by the second half, it really takes off, and I found myself engrossed.<br />Basically, The Sun Also Rises is a portrait of the &quot;lost generation&quot;, those who were so impacted by the war that their lives have no meaning in the traditional sense. They go about a series of meaningless activities that leave them feeling empty and unfulfilled. This premise is fairly existential and dark, and if that isn't your cup of tea, don't bother with the Sun Also Rises. That said, this novel does a great job of characterizing such members of said generation, and the style of the writing is attractively lucid and crisp, yet rich with symbolism.

The characters are so completely detached from their lives, and the bullfight and fiesta serve as an antithesis to their monotonous fleeting lifestyles.  Some of the characters were so downright strange, and almost fake, that it left me with a kind of empty helpless feeling.<br />  First of all, the female character, Brett, is one of the most fascinating characters I have ever read about. Her mannerisms, and life choices are so interesting. She seems very beautiful, and I can see why everyone is is love with her. The male characters are also interesting, the main character being almost emotionless and accepting of his life, although he is in love with Brett, he is happy to just be her friend. You get the feeling that being hurt in the war has really changed him, and made him apathetic, and happy to live vicariously through the bullfight. The character of Cohn is also really interesting, and dark, although the descriptions of him seem a little anti-semitic in this day and age.<br />  The descriptions of the bullfights, and the fiesta in Spain, are truly magnificent, and make me want to go to Spain and see the bullfights, even though I am a longtime vegetarian and animal lover! The descriptions were just that powerful. The character of the bullfighter is also a classic literary character, strong and attractive.<br />  The prose of Hemingway is different than anything I have ever read, and I like it.  He doesn't say much, yet he says a lot. By sticking to the simplicity of a situation, he manages to expose the depth that lies beneath. All in all, I loved this book, and I think it is relavent today, and can be related to anyone who lives their life fleetingly from pleasure to pleasure. A lot of drinking in this book!",2004-07-18

Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein, who once said of Oakland, California, \\""There is no there there.\\""<BR>  Hemingway was a reporter for the Kansas City Star, a man's man of gruff, Midwestern sentiment. He came from a family of some local prominence. Perhaps because he did not face great hardships growing up, he felt the need to test himself. In this regard, Hemingway and Teddy Roosevelt have much in common. Hemingway went looking for his manhood in World War I and found it. The experience formed him. He saw action fighting alongside the Italian allies and sustained wounds. According to his own account, he had a \\""life-after-death\\"" episode. While recovering, he fell in love with a pretty American nurse. When the war ended the romance did not take, in part because Hemingway had a stubborn streak of jealousy. But he used these events to launch a career of great works, writing in a tone of melancholy wistfulness, imbued with American patriotism and the manly need to face danger, romance and adventure with courage and idealism, tinged by ironic cynicism.<BR>\\""A Farewell to Arms\\"" was his semi-autobiographical account of World War I, including his lost love with the nurse. Hemingway captured the \\""lost generation\\"" in \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"", which detailed American ex-patriates in Europe who were mentally and physically scarred by the Great War. His main character is unable to consummate a relationship with a beautiful woman who pines for him, because he sustained injuries in the war that prevent him from sexual functioning. The woman goes on to a career of carnal conquest with a variety of men, none of whom fulfill her. Amid much drunkenness and debauchery, the book addresses anti-Semitism, a relatively new theme in the 1920s, although Hemingway is not wholly sympathetic to Jews. When the book was made into a film in the 1950s, Daryl F. Zanuck cast a handsome young Jewish man, Robert Evans, as a Spanish bullfighter.

Over time, Hemingway's style of writing has changed quite a bit and by reading this, one of his first novels, one is able to see the progression of a man outfitted with an artistic and utterly brilliant mind.  The Sun Also Rises was rather difficult to read, however, the time spent working through the novel, evaluating each character, following the plot, and picturing the development of the theme was well worth it.<BR>      The novel consists of many different types of characters.  The novel's main character and narrator, Jake Barnes, an ex-militant, is a journalist stationed in Paris where easily more drinking and partying takes place than any sort of actual work.  Barnes is also quite possibly the reason the book is somewhat difficult to read.  His tendency to keep the reader unaware of what his actions are, but describe everyone else's actions makes him quite a difficult character to understand.  A second important character happens to be the love of Jake's life, Lady Brett Ashley.  Ashley, like all of the rest of the characters in the novel is a heavy drinker.  Barnes loves her so much, and even she loves him back but refuses to make any sort of committment because she has a very indecisive attitude.  Unfortunately, her life seems to be leading to an endless sea of sadness and depression, no positive goals are in sight.  Outside of Jake's relationship, he shares good times with a group of friends, one of the closest being Robert Cohn.  Cohn is one of those friends that everyone enjoys picking on, but he doesn't what he would do without him.  Cohn is also a drinker, but shares different ideas on opinions such as casual sex and also happens to be jewish.  A fellow, yet more consistant drinker than the rest, Mike Cambell, is a rather perfect depiction of the feelings expressed throughout this novel.  He is a poor alcoholic with a horrible temper.  Barnes has a few other friends and meets many others throughout the journey of this novel, but none shed too far from the typical drunken aquatance.<BR>      When The Sun Also Rises was published in 1926, it tells a story of the concerns a group of Americans residing in Europe during the mid 1920s.  The two main characters are Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley.  During the beginning of the novel we are told that Ashley's husband was killed in World War 1 and happened to work in the same hospital that Barnes was sent to after he was injured in combat.  This is the beginning of Barnes' loving feelings for Ashley.  Jake begins his story by telling of his pre and current relationship with a fellow drinkig partner, Robert Cohn.  The morning after Jake begins his story, he is at breakfast with Cohn.  It is here where Jake points out Ashley to Cohn and he is very overwhelmed by her beauty.  A few weeks after this small get-together, Jake and Cohn are traveling in a small town near Paris where heavy drinker, Bill Gorton is introduced.  Jake, Cohn, and Gorton spend their time together fishing, drinking, and partying following their train trip to Spain.  Following 5 days of partying, Jake and Bill decide to make another trip to a small town outside spain, but Cohn decides to stay.  Jake and Bill check into a small hotel where they meet a young bullfighter, Montoya, who tells them of a bullfighting festival coming up in a few short days.  This festival is highly enjoyed by Jake and Bill being that it consists mostly of heavy drinking, dancing, and everything that generally goes along with it.  A day or so later, Cohn arrives with Ashley.  This is a suprise to Jake, who becomes extremely enraged.  There is a fight and Cohn ends up knocking out both Jake and Bill.  After a well thought out apology, there is forgiveness among the group of men.  Following this agreement, the next day the three men rent a car and head their seperate ways.  Jake chooses to go back to spain with Ashley, who has once again become indecisive about the man she chooses to be with.  The ending scene takes place with Jake and Ashley speaking of how good they would have been together, but unfortunately never were.  The novel ends with a depressing quote from Jake, \\""Yes, isn't it pretty to think so?\\"" after Ashley tells him of her feelings for him.  <BR>      The characters of this novel provide the reader with quite an obvious theme.  A theme depicting a society with no goals or any general direction in their lives.  Instead of taking the time to plan on the future, their time is spent partying and drinking, which leads them no further to happiness, even though they may think it at the time.  All this partying is merely a distraction from Jake and his friends from seeing the downfall of their futures.",2004-05-09

Nevertheless, reading this novel is like watching the development of a garden slug: you keep waiting for it to change into a butterfly, but it just never, ever happens.

Women like Brett are very independent and often utilize men to fulfill their necessities and empty, meaningless lives.  Jake, Cohn, Mike, and Bill represent men of the 1920's who are psychologically and morally confused, and who drink, travel, and engage themselves in miscellaneous entertaining activities in order to escape from reality and their inner selves.

The descriptions of trout fishing and the bullfights in Spain are as vivid as any you will find.  This is a true masterpiece.<br />A<br />Joseph Dworak",2003-10-23

Struggling with various literary and amorous challenges in 1920's Paris, several American and British young men decide to play tourist in exotic Pamplona--the annual scene of a week-long fiesta which is highlighted by many bullfights.  This carefree, dissolute crowd takes life as a lark--superficially at least; inevitably, their extravagant nightlife and lush social habits backfire and relationships disintegrate.  <br /> This story of moral decadence is narrated by Jake, a laidback reporter for an American newspaper; he hangs out with colleagues who are trying to write novels.  Mostly however, they are fatally attracted to the<BR>enigmatic but irresistible Lady Brett Ashley, despite her masculine affectations.  Slightly married to an English Lord yet slightly engaged to Mike, she is accustomed to the homage of men, but she finds herself choked by the ardent, unwanted attentions of Robert Cohn--a Jew who does not really belong in their set, despite his Gentile education. We soon realize that poor Jake is deeply in love with Brett himself, yet he generously sacrifices his own ardor in order to facilitate Brett's temporary happiness. He accepts Mike, is amused by the Count, annoyed by Cohn, but sets her up with his newest acquaintance--a handsome young matador. Ah, but whom will the desirable lady ultimately choose?<br /> This short novel reads fairly quickly; many pages consist of dialogue of short quips, making it difficult to keep clear which characters are speaking. This would make a wonderful play, since it can easily be envisioned in scenes. The final section is brief, but anti- climactic, since the leading lady has left the stage.  The subesequent plot is reduced to just Jake picking up the remnants of his dreams. No doubt this literary let-down is necessary to relax the frantic pace, but readers may resent the lack of action. Dear Jake asks no reward for his unselfish catering to Brtett's every whim.  Is there life for mortal men after the<BR>whirlwind of booze and passion in Spain?  One wonders how much of Hemingway's own experiences are included in this novel...<BR>Moths to the flame?

The characters in this book talks about a &quot;lost generation&quot; that felt a sinking in their souls after the First World War at that time referred to as the Great War.  I would argue that there is a lost generation in every generation which comprises a subset a people that feel no need to mature and live life as a vagabond.  This book brings those types of characters in the foreground with good characters.  It includes a character with low self esteem with a weakness to be loved by a woman who gives just a little attention to him, a character that acts like a jerk whenever he has the excuse to be one, a character that can't make up her mind on who to be with at that moment and a thoughtful character that puts all of this into perspective as the first person narrator.  The book is a nice one for singles to read as it give similar types of interactions.<br />It was hard trying to identify how Paris might have been like or Pamplona because there was some but not much description of the scenery of the two cities.  I mainly wanted to know the sights and sounds of the running of the bulls but the running of the bulls was mainly a background to the main plot of the story.  But I wasn't really disappointed with that as much as the ending.<br />What I got from Hemingway's style was that his stories are best when appreciated in the moment.  You shouldn't try to find a logical progression from chapter to chapter about plot and where you should see the characters going.  The beauty of his writings dives into the psyche of his characters and gets involved in how personal flaws can lead to bad situations and bad outcomes.  It doesn't try to answer how to live or how to fix them but merely seeks sympathy for them.",2003-09-01

I thought the very crux of the book was his relationship w/the proprietor of the hotel where Jake, his pals and the bullfighters stayed. Jake first of all concurs w/Montoya that the pure young bullfighter, Romero, shouldn't be exposed to the decadence of the British officials who invited him to a soiree...Jake and Montoya agreed that the invitation should simply not be communicated to the bullfighter.  Shortly thereafter, Jake colludes in Brett's seduction/corruption of that same 19 year old local hero.  After the bullfighter ends up beaten to a bloody faced pulp, Montoya shuns Jake, obviously blaming him for his part in the whole fiasco. Jake, retreats to France where he waxes on about how good it is to be in a place where people are your friends if you over-tip them; so much simpler and easier to deal with than being in a place (Spain) where the friendships are more mysterious-- alluding, though in not so many words, to his previously valued relationship with Montoya who shared his love and understanding of all the nuances of bulls and bull fighting.

Written in a terse, almost hard-boiled style, it tells the story of a wasted group of Americans and Brits living and caring for nothing in Europe after World War I.  The events, some of them rather traumatic, never seem to touch the core of these people thus giving that idea that, more all their self-worship and high-faulting ideas regarding man, nature and the way things ought to be, there is really nothing to them.<br />It is a good book, a swift read that carries you along through a series of aimless adventures that have a great deal of depth.  The exploration of what is missing in these people makes up the bulk of the story, events getting worse and worse while the characters remain stangely unaffected.  Events even seem to repeat themselves, again and again, in different circumstances and locales, something with even differing participants (although there is really no reason to tell them apart).  One gets the feeling, in later years, of a fushion of a Henry James morality tale crossed with the heartless indifference of Bret Easton Ellis' monsters--it really does go that far in explaining Hemingway's influence on the generations of writers that followed him in light of those dismissed that came before him.<br />It is a book that, for me, discounts a little of Hemingway's claim as 'a stylist that changed American writing forever' as I see much of Dashiell Hammett modified into something attempting to paint a picture in black and white instead of with a blood-splashed gray.

I read The Sun Also Rises before I read For Whom the Bell Tolls,  I thought the latter had struck me deeply and made more sense to me... but there's just something about the former. Hemingway had a real knack for telling about the struggles for finding the meaning of life.  He hit the nail on the head time and again.<br />The Sun Also Rises is all about pain and longing.  I'm a couple of months removed from reading it, but that is the truest take I get from it.  Each character has a distinct pain and longing they are dealing with...  Let me highlight some of these:<br />* Brett--  the beautiful and highly desired object in many man's eyes.  She seems to have it all.  She seems to be right where she wants to be.  But she is truly searching and lost.  It seems the one thing that would make her complete is the one thing she can never truly have...  Jake.  The late night conversations between Jake and Brett, really tug at the heart.  You just wish they could somehow get together.  But it could never be...<br />--The longing and pain of unattainable and unfulfilled desires.<br />*  Robert Cohn--  the man on the outside looking in.  Robert Cohn so deperately wants to be part of the group.  He so deperately wants to be accepted.  He so deperately wants Brett.  But he can never realize any of this because the social group he wishes so much to join has already passed judgement on him and will never let him in.  And poor Robert doesn't realize that it is only \\""WHO\\"" he is that is keeping him out forever.  Not just the fact of his ethnic background but his very personality drives him out of the group.<br />--The longing and pain of being on the outside looking in.<br />*  Mike Campbell--  He seems to be at ease in the social group.  He seems to have established himself.  But when you look at his constant barbs at Robert Cohn you can see he is really insecure about his position in life.  Mike isn't a main character but you can see yet another longing when you look at him.  He is actually in...  \\""The In Crowd\\"" but doesn't seem to be very sure he is really in at all.  To me that is the human condition in a nutshell.  Always pushing... always grasping...  always looking for more... when all we need is probably right in front of us.  What a shame!<br />--The longing and pain of insecurity within security.<br />*  Jake Barnes--  Last but certainly not least....  Jake.  Jake epitomizes pain and longing in this book.  Jake is the glue that holds this whole group together.  That is a lot of pressure on an individual.  The pressure he is under can be seen clearly by his relationship to Robert Cohn.  He is forced to go through such changes in that singular relationship.  At the beginning of the book he seems to at least have a tolerance for Robert Cohn and then through circumstance he has to sway completely.  He keeps the clashing personalities at bay all through the story.  He seems to keep Brett from crashing and burning over and over again.  I'm sure there might have been a murder between the social combatants somewhere in the story if not for Jake soothing and placating all he came in contact with.  He seems to be the only one in the book who has any social graces and tact. What a lot of pressure on one individual.<br />Jake also has this mysterious wound from the war that keeps him from having a sexual realtionship and connecting to anyone in that way.

Whether his characters are diving from caf&eacute; to caf&eacute; in search of a quick buzz or out in the woods fishing, Hemingway takes the reader there with amazing descriptive power.<br />_The Sun Also Rises_ is the story of a group of expatriates centered around the characters Jake Barnes, Lady Brett Ashley, and Robert Cohn.  Their desire to live and to experience takes them from the caf&eacute;s of Paris to the bullfights of Pamplona, Spain.  Along the way they love, hate, and betray each other, often as just a way to feel anything at all.<br />Jake is in many ways the typical Hemingway main character.  Jake was a soldier in the Great War who became wounded and fell in love with his nurse, Brett.  We see echoes of this story in A Farewell To Arms and Hemingway's life.  Jake however is physically impotent from his war wounds.  He craves Brett, but she will not have him because of her sexual needs.  While Jake is physically impotent, all of Brett's lovers end up being emotionally impotent, so Jake functions as Brett's one love, with no power to satisfy her: Hemingway's own \\""catch 22.\\""<br />A masterful stroke of Hemingway is his ability to have the environment play out the emotional state of the characters.  This extends well beyond the natural forces mimicking the characters feelings as in the storms of some gothic novel, or The Great Gatsby's conflict on the hottest day of the year; Hemingway uses the whole environment, natural and man-made to play out his dramas.  Jake's only serenity is found in the mountains away from mankind, just fishing. But as the conflict rises the story moves back to civilization to where bull-fights become more and more intense with each day.  The bulls and bullfighters themselves begin to represent various figures of the drama.  The emasculated steer trying to keep the other bulls calm, as Jake seeks peace between his friends.  The bullfighter's elegant grace at dancing with the bulls mirrors Brett's sexual games.<br />The power of Hemingway ultimately lies in his short descriptive prose.  His pithy statements set the scene, set the mood, and then send the reader on into the action.  While the train of thought style that Faulkner and Joyce use would probably better reflect how one thinks in a given situation, Hemingway's use of terse statements gives us the scene in readable understandable chunks that draw us in easier.  It may not be the way we think, but it is the way we understand.<br />The language completely sucks you into the setting.  Many point to Hemingway's and the characters' use of alcohol as their drug of choice, but the true drug of _The Sun Also Rises_ is experience.  Disillusioned by the Great War the expatriate characters shift from moment to moment just wanting to live in that moment, as if it were their last.  So as Jake soaks up the dancing and the drinking, so do we.  As Brett feverishly tries to pray in the church, so do we. We can feel the dust of Spain settle on our necks, and we can feel the cool stream run past our legs.  The jazz music makes us want to dance, and the bullfights make us want to dance with death.  Hemingway's style is not just persuasive, it is compelling.<br />So even as we find ourselves in situations we would normally find appalling-drinking in the morning, faced with a dead man lying in the road-we still find we want to be there.

Barnes and his comrades, including the \\""damned good looking\\"" Lady Brett Ashley, make their way from Paris to Pamplona and partake of the week-long bullfighting fiesta.  Hemingway reveals his own passion for bullfighting in his smooth description of the matadors' artistry and in the distinguishing of those whose work is mere illusion from those who work with true grace and courage.<br />Throughout the story, moments of violence burst through the affected nonchalance of Jake's circle.  Emotions run high as the men strive for Brett's affections, win them . . . lose them just as quickly.  One of the most enticing anti-heroines in literature, Brett is an alcoholic and (possible) nymphomaniac, as much at the mercy of her whims as those around her.  She is described as \\""Circe\\"" because she turns the men around her to pigs; a group of Spanish dancers form a circle around her but prevent her from dancing--she must be still, worshipped as an idol.  She is a remarkable character, adored and yet worthy of our pity: only an impotent man is safe with her; only a healthy man can satisfy her cravings.<br />A fascinating achievement in twentieth century writing, TSAR has aged in places, where much of the characters' slang is unfamiliar.

He went off to the war thinking of glory and heroics and saw only death, and horrible death at that. His illusions are shattered, the notion of life in an ordered, coherent universe gone. They see that life is random, chaotic, without meaning. How does one live in a world like this? That was the question central to Hemingway's entire life, and it's central to this book as well.<br />Hemingway answers the question through the famous \\""Hemingway Code\\"" that one can glean from his novels and short stories. Characters that stick to this code are heroic in his eyes. I won't detail the code here because it will ruin the pleasure of discovering it for yourself, but let's just say that the purest Hemingway Hero in this novel is Romero, the bullfighter.

If you like reading about everyday life when you drink all the time and go out and don't have a job this would be a good book for you, but this book didn't keep my interest at all.

The smart reader understands this book better.  After researching on Hemingway, I find that &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; reflects his life.  <BR>The characters are often drunks, who love to travel and take a very big interest in bullfighting.  It's a great book with many consequences that deal with human nature.  <BR>The love affairs and jealousy occurs with everyday life for some people.  Hemmingway's style of writing is not the &quot;perfect style&quot; that we read in every other book.  He uses a vulgar style. Hemingway has created these characters to be continuously frustrating and apparently beyond hope, but in doing so he makes them friendly, attractive, and people that every human being can relate to.  <BR> I enjoyed reading his book.  And for his first book, I would say that he did very well.  Once I started reading it, I could not put it own.  I am interested in the social life that happens in the book.  The love affairs, drunkenness, and racial comments are things we deal with or see everyday. The way he describes the different places, such as Paris is so simple and laid back, making the reader feel as though they are really there. He has a unique style.  This is an enjoyable book if you are interested in the lifestyle that these characters live.",2002-05-28

His writing is practically a celebration of how well Americans can live in Europe, how enticing are the cultures, and how exciting and liberating are the experiences.  \\""The Sun Also Rises\\"" indicates that, after the horror and confusion of World War I, the \\""Lost\\"" Generation seem to have found themselves quite at home outside of America living life to the fullest.  If F. Scott Fitzgerald's fiction suggests that only the wealthy can afford to be irresponsible, Hemingway suggests that anybody can afford to be irresponsible outside his or her own country.<br />The narrator, Jake Barnes, is a newspaper writer living in Paris in the 1920's.  His circle of friends consists almost exclusively of other writers and artists and their admirers, all of whom hang out in the cafes, indulge in the night life, and drink freely, heavily, and lavishly -- no pesky Prohibition on this side of the Atlantic.  Two of Jake's friends are Robert Cohn, a Jewish boxer-turned-novelist whose love affairs with women always seem to end messily, and the beautiful, desirable Lady Brett Ashley, who is about to divorce her husband and marry an obnoxious boor named Mike Campbell.<BR>  <BR>Jake takes a fishing trip to Spain with Cohn and his buddy Bill Gorton, after which they stay over in Pamplona to take in the San Fermin fiesta and watch the bullfights with Brett and Campbell.  Jake is not just a casual spectator, but a seasoned \\""aficionado\\"" who is intimately familiar with the bullfighting scene.  As the partying continues, passions heat up, a drunken Campbell constantly picks on Cohn, who, like Jake, is infatuated with Brett, and Brett sets her sights on a hot new young matador named Pedro Romero.  Although these plot points seem like they're leading up to some big, explosive climax, Hemingway, who values realism over contrivances, chooses the high road and allows the characters to resolve their conflicts naturally, like human beings, not like Hollywood caricatures. <br />Hemingway's prose in this early novel of his is usually minimalistic but, with something like boyish enthusiasm, becomes more detailed and energetic when describing the things that really interest its author, like trout fishing and bullfighting.  That he manages to capture the intoxicating freedom of these expatriates so directly and concisely is what has made him one of America's greatest literary icons.",2002-05-21

One understands Hemingway's gift when reading this book.  It is filled with such beautiful language, and lyrical descriptions that sweep you from the heart of Paris to the mountains of Spain.  <br />Hemingway's first published work describes the ex-pat lifestyle in Paris exceedingly well.  Having lived very near to where Jake, the main character lived, I could identify with his vivid descriptions he paints very well.  His foray into Spain with his fellow ex-pats is also very vivid.<br />Hemingway's descriptions are unmatched.  While some may not particularly like his writing style, if you do, you are in for a treat.  <br />I feared that I would loathe this book as I had onced loathed another Hemingway, The Old Man and the Sea.  However, that was not the case.  The Sun Also Rises is a much more involved story, not quite as steeped in symbolism and weighted by lengthy descriptions.  <br />The Sun Also Rises is a fair balance of prose and description, settings and characters.

Through each other they distract themselves from finding any deeper meaning in their existences.  So they drink, admire the beautiful scenery in Spain, and watch bullfights.

All the greater because when you really look at it, there's no dramatic action going on here - just some people talking, then going to Spain to see the bullfights. But don't let that fool you - boring this book ain't.<br />Jake Barnes, like most of the characters, is a veteran of World War I. A very unfortunate wound left physical love a complete impossibility for him, and thus he is left gnashing his teeth watching the woman he loves run around with all sorts of men. The Jewish Robert Cohn, who learned boxing in college in order to conquer his feelings of inferiority, happens to become smitten with her as well. Somehow, they and some of their friends and acquaintances end up going to Spain to experience the Fiesta, and while their experience starts the same giddy, frenzied, hedonistic way as for most people, it ends quite differently, when the book's darker undercurrents come to light. Insert scenes of cafe life, fishing, reminiscences, conversations with friends, watching the bullfights, some absolutely brutal humor, and lots and lots of liquor, and you've got yourself Hemingway's first masterpiece.

They're all here.<br />For some reason, this book seems to draw accusations of anti-Semitism. And all I've to say on that topic is: What? Anti-Semitism? Here? Please, what is this you speak of? Sure, Cohn's a Jew. And sure, the characters aren't too fond of him. And yet, Hemingway presents him in a very, very sympathetic light. Sure, we're rooting for Jake Barnes because he's smarmy and witty and cool, but when we see Cohn break down in tears in his hotel room because ..., he was naive enough to _believe_ Brett loved him, how can you possibly say Hemingway had any anti-Semitic sentiments on his mind? No, no, no, and a thousand times no. This is not a book about Jews, or Americans, or Britishers. This is a book about _people_, about young people searching for substance in a world that has none, trying to build up some sort of semblance of a normal life after having been through war. This is a book about people who feel life has passed them all by, and who have nothing to really look forward to. This book is filled with the genuine bitter loneliness of people who see nothing ahead of them. The sense of hopeless longing for something better permeates every page.<br />The Sun Also Rises is the sound of people trying to find a purpose for themselves in an increasingly shallow world. And lest that not convince you to read it, it happens to rock .... Rarely have I read more bitingly acerbic insults and comebacks, wry and cynical remarks, and deadly accurate observations. Actually, rarely have I ever felt so drawn in to the world of a book as much as here. I identified with Jake Barnes and Bill Gorton and that Englishman they met while fishing and with the boozing Mike and with Cohn. I understood their copious drinking and verbal barb-flinging because I was struck by the moments of absolutely believable fragile vulnerability that lay underneath the surface. The subtle gestures, the shifts in tone, the tough, terse prose all added to the various effects when necessary. When I was done, the book left an indelible stamp on my mind. And what higher recommendation could anyone possibly give a book than that?",2002-02-26

As someone else says here,and I agree, THE GREAT GATSBY is better written,more timeless, and about America then and now. As for 1920's expatriots in Paris, Hem's much later collection, A MOVABLE FEAST is, I think ,far superior,witty and amusing, and you can tell simply by the title, not desolate like this one.

The hero, Jake Barnes, is condemned to a life of celibacy because of a war injury.  Brett Ashley, the woman he loves, goes from one sexual encounter to another.  Mike, her fianc, is a hard-drinking Scotsman who is financially and emotionally bankrupt.  They all seem to drink to forget, but they cant escape their many problems and are doomed to fail.  The bright, sunny setting of the fiesta in Pamplona, Spain, the cafes of Paris, and trout fishing in a mountain stream contrasts the characters' feelings of depression, hopelessness, and loneliness.  The action pivots around the bullfight, symbolic of Jake's situation.  No matter how strong and powerful the bull is, everyone knows he will not survive the onslaught of the matador.  This book is a slow paced novel with an emphasis on character development, tone, and theme.  Hemingway's words are spare and lean, using powerful verbs without loading descriptions down with too many adjectives.  This powerful, well-written novel gives the reader insight to what is often referred to as the &quot;lost generation,&quot; those who survived the &quot;war to end all wars&quot; but came back broken physically, emotionally, spiritually.  If someone can get past the slow beginning to this book, they will be rewarded with a simply told tragedy that is deeply symbolic and deeply moving.",2002-01-08

As always, Hemingway's writing is outrageously good; in parts of the novel I almost had to stop and catch my breath in admiration of the work Hemingway produced. Nevertheless, I was growing impatient with the storyline, the characters entering and re-entering the novel, and the large amount of information that seemed irrelevant to any sort of larger theme. I was actually quite disappointed as I finished the book.<br />However, without any planning on my part, the book all began to make sense once I had given my mind time to put the pieces together. I then discovered, much to my initial surprise, that &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is amazing, absolutely incredibly engrossing literature. First of all, credit must be given to Hemingway's unique writing style. The direct, minimal tone of the novel is brilliant; no words are ever used that could be excised from the novel, and this allows Hemingway to say far, far more with a few words than other authors could with far more. Also, the characters are so well defined that they leap off the page. Each and every character in the book, including minor characters, not only ring true but become familiar to the reader as time goes on. And finally, once the book has settled in, the themes and concepts Hemingway had in mind become clear; disillusionment, amorality, and loss of innocence.<br />In sum, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is not a book that will be immediately enjoyable. You're going to have to put some effort into this to get a lot out of it.

Hemingway seemed to belong there. The Paris memoir A Moveable Feast is a beautiful account of those early days when Hemingway was writing his early stories. The Sun Also Rises is something quite different. Not a memoir but a novel. And a great one. Great not just because it describes 1920's Paris, which is no doubt part of it's appeal, but because it describes Americans living abroad in the aftermath of WWI. Though it does not specifically address the war, the style of life and attitude that these characters exemplify make them members of what Gertrude Stein called &quot;the lost generation&quot;. That phrase defined a generation and Hemingway's book was the best comment on that phrase and his generation. The American characters of Sun Also Rises all have their reasons for being in Europe. Part of the reason is that WWI disrupted all the old notions and fabric of society and Hemingway underlines this by showing them all in a state of aimless drift. With Jake Barnes Hemingway shows an American who understands Europeans and is at home in their company. He is a new kind of consciousness, not a representative one, but one that seems to have an understanding of life that other Americans do not. Jake's unique understanding has led him to the formulation of a code(expatriots code) which is not altogether explained but one which allows him to be at home in all cultures and deal with trying situations very well(most of the time). But Jake too is wounded. Jakes presence attracts an unusual group of friends and hangers on(some American, some European). Those who understand the code get along well with Jake and those who do not find themselves in conflict with him. Hemingway's A Sun Also Rises stands in interesting contrast to Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby. While Fitzgerald goes for a mythic rendering of American life , Hemingway describes a new kind of ground that only he occupies. Hemingway brings an understanding to things which is not specifically American but his own hard won ground. Fiction writing one imagines was his way of defining that ground. &quot;You must get to know the values,&quot; as the Count says. Each character presents an almost separate plot line.

And what a breakthough it was. Before it, he had modest success with his short stories (a literary form of which he was a master, to be sure). But it was this novel that made his reputation stateside (he was an expatriate in Paris, just like the characters in this novel, at the time he wrote and published it).<br />The book reads like a prolonged short story which is, in fact, its great strength. It is a slice of life, of very particular lives to be sure, painted in that finely crafted impressionist style which Hemingway honed in his days as a literary apprentice in Kansas City, Chicago and on the Left Bank of post World War I Paris. Briefly, the book details the escapades of a group of expatriates living it up in dissolute pleasure in the wake of the recently finished war in a recovering and still giddy Europe. Giddy, at least, within the crowded milieu in which these people mainly move. It has no plot to speak of, except for the movement of its people in and out of bars, parties and bull fights, and their conversations in cafes and taxis and, on occasion,in rural hunting lodges, most of which embody a tight and elaborate dance of almost ritual posturing. The tale follows them as they move cautiously about one another, and through various parts of Europe from their Parisian base, seeking connection and a tenuous spiritual sustenance which may only be had in the hurly-burly of a nightlife world of their own making, a world in which past troubles and insecurities can momentarily be forgotten. At its heart the novel follows, most of all, the growth of one man, its main character, from morose outsider in love with the unattainable to a person who sees his world all too clearly and, recognizing this, severs himself at the end from what he most desires. Nothing happens and yet everything does, precisely reflecting the emotional landscape through which the tale progresses.<br />I will add my voice to some others here, as well, regarding the inimitable Hemingway style, a style he fashioned (not entirely in a vacuum, of course) from the world of experimentalist writers and painters in which he immersed himself in his Paris years. At its best, the sort of writing with which he has crafted this fascinating novel explodes into the reader's consciousness, creating a sense of reality and freshness that previous forms of prose had failed to attain. It is poetry as much as prose for its rhythms and repetitive stress on simple, basic words which combine, at times, to build an image in the mind, a concrete sense of the real world which puts to shame all the abstractions and florid prose of previous literary works.<br />But there's no sense in trying to recapitulate the story here or to describe how it's told. The best thing is for the reader to step into it and experience it. It is still fresh and strong today and worth your time.y voice to some others here, as well, regarding the inimitable Hemingway style, a style he fashioned (not entirely in a vacuum, of course) from the world of experimentalist writers and painters in which he immersed himself in his Paris years.

US,52203333,R38C7D5AZ9BQ5,0736621652,781452863,The Sun Also Rises,Books,5,7,8,N,N,"Classic Hemingway","There is a certain purity of language, a freshness of style present in The Sun Also Rises that is noticeably lacking in Hemingway's later works. As pointed out very capably by Mr. Mitchell in his earlier review, the plot of the novel itself is not likely to draw many readers, as the drunken revelry of the characters does tend to get a little old. Plus, I have my doubts that anyone can consistently consume as much booze as Jake Barnes, Lady Brett, and especially the &quot;hangers on&quot; did in this novel. Jake's fishing buddy Bill and Brett's fiance were in a state of inebriation virtually throughout the novel.Here the audio format works well, because listening to a good actor speak the words of a drunken character might be easier to endure than trying to read drunken dialogue. <br />For me, the novel works in a number of ways. Hemingway clearly loved the subject matter, and I thought the beginning of the book, as did his later masterpiece A Moveable Feast, provided a fascinating glimpse of post-WWI Paris. Then, when Hemingway and his friend catch the train for Pamplona to go fly fishing and catch the bullfights, the book really takes off. Hem loved to fish and he loved bullfighting, and his enthusiasm for these sports clearly shines through. Every year someone gets gored in Pamplona during the running of the bulls, and until reading this book I could never discern why anyone would put themselves in that position. Jake Barnes is clearly a true fan and &quot;aficianado&quot; of bullfighting, and his narration points out the many subtle ways to distinguish between a true master, and an overrated matador trying to make it look dangerous while he remains out of harms way. <br />All the while, Hemingway portrays a doomed romance between Jake and Brett, all the more painful for him since he has to watch one man after another follow her around and get caught in her web. The pathetic Robert Cohn is the most striking example, since the married Cohn sent his wife to Englandto visit &quot;friends&quot;, so that he could follow Brett around Paris and Spain like a wounded puppy after she makes the mistake of sleeping with him. Cohn is clearly an unwanted companion, and the blowups between him and Brett's fiance were memorable. I also loved the scene at a Paris cafe where Cohn's wife bitterly denounces Cohn for sending her off. <br />In summary, this novel affords a real opportunity to see a good writer perfecting his craft. Hemingway hated phoniness in all things, bullfighting and writing among them, and for any serious student of twentieth century literature much time should be spent with this book. It is a pleasure to read (or listen to), and reveals more secrets each time you pick it up.",2001-08-27

As such it is as close to being a legendary book as they come, yet some seventy five years after its initial publication, it still offers a story that is also surprisingly fresh, personal, and memorable. For all of his obvious excesses, Hemingway was an artist compelled to delve deliberately into painful truths, and he attempted to do so with a style of writing that cut away all of the frills and artifice, so that at it s heart this novel is meant as a exploration into what it means to be adult and alive. Thus we are introduced to Jake Barnes, a veteran of World War One, now forced by his wounds to live as a man without the ability to act like one, forced by impotence to forgo all of life's usual intimacies, and all of its associated life connections for which he so yearns. At the same time, Jake attempts to live a life of meaning and purpose, one crammed full with activity, work, and friendships. Yet it is within this network of friendships and connections that he must confront his painful circumstances.<br /><br />Enter his true love, the feckless Lady Ashley, and indeed the plot thickens, for we soon see how Jake's physical affliction has painfully affected several others. Ashley loves him, but needs a virile man who can give her the physical love she needs. While Ashley is a woman of uncommon beauty, she is also virtuous enough in her won way to want the one man she truly loves to be her lover. Like all of us, she wants most that which she can never have, and so she returns to the source of her own dilemma time after time to Jake, her emotional match, the one man who cannot give her the mature emotional love she craves. So they are condemned to circle around each other, even while some of their friends and other members of the in-crowd interfere, compete, and seek Ashley's affections around the edges of the continuing affair.<br />What we are left with is a modern tragedy, one in which the characters must somehow resolve the irresolvable.<br /><br />Yet for all this emotional turmoil and existential `sturm-und-drang' of the so-called &#34;lost generation&#34;, people drowning in the moral anomie and circumstantial wasteland created in the gutters of their own endless wants and needs, it is most often Hemingway's imaginative and spare use of the language itself that wins the reader over.

Hemingway's prose is sparse, and his characters suffer their hidden scars- this is the stuff that made Papa famous, after all- but this is a work that is readily accessible, and while 90% of the book may be beneath the surface, the vast majority of his intent is apparent. This is not a criticism of Hemingway, as the man is one of my favorite authors, but I believe that makes this book great is that nearly anyone over the age of 15 can have a rich and rewarding reading experience with this novel. The sorrows that Hemingway's characters hide from view are common to all, and the story of unattainable, and unfulfilled, love is one of the century's best. As for the reviewer who trashed this book simply because it was &quot;early&quot; Hemingway, I don't know where to begin in stating how off that comment was. Hemingway was a literary prodigy, who reeled off a string of outstanding novels in his youth. They are all marked by tight plots, his terse prose, and a real connection with the spirit that defined the Lost Generation. In the years between his youthful height and the Old Man and the Sea, only For Whom the Bell Tolls could be described as great. The works of the &quot;mature&quot; Hemingway are short on ideas, and are long and wandering; it is as if the man simply ran out of talent. The Sun also Rises, on the other hand, is a brilliant work that works on so many levels, and, unlike some of his more epic works, can be readily enjoyed by all.",2001-01-10

The book's subject is a very fascinating one and the reason that kept me reading. However, Hemmingway half way through the novel starts to bore us and turns us from the novel instead of getting us interested in the characters. Judging from the split reviews I've read on Amazon, I've concluded you'll either be bored with this book or think it is a masterpiece.<br />The novel starts us out with Jack, a wounded ex World War 1 soilder who spends his better days hanging out in Paris Cafes and nightclubs. We are also introduced to Robert; an old school friend of Jack's and despised by others around him for being a Jew. Robert is an outsider of Jack's group always trying to fit in and cursed out by the group (I'll get to that later.) We also meet Brett, Jack's-I believe ex-girlfriend- who never knows weather she loves Jack or not. People believe that she is one of the best female heroine's in 20th cent. Literature. The group with a few others decides to go to Spain and see the bullfighting. In Spain, we think the characters will somehow be changed or come to terms with their lifestyle but it is pretty much the same as their lives in Paris. Even, the bullfighting just seems like a ho-hum experience to Jack and his friends.<br />Your average chapter in the book is something along these lines...Jack wakes up with a hangover around noon and quickly goes down for breakfast with his friends, Robert comes around and everyone yells at him, When Robert leaves everyone says anti-Semitic comments about him, Jack listens indifferently, everyone decides to meet at a place for dinner, everyone takes a nap then goes to dinner, they all order expensive wine and insult Robert more, they go to a club, Brett and Jack end up going back to their places, Brett is about to make love but then doesn't, jack falls asleep drunk. The whole process is repeated over and over through the book. Hemmingway writes in a repetition and simple tone. It all depends on your taste in the style of writing. I personally don't mind because I like Brett Easton Ellis and he has the same style; but with &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; it annoyed me because the novel was too long for it and these characters were too well-developed for that style. This novel deserved more depth and detail to it.<br />One part that I could not stand in the novel was the harshness of the characters towards Robert. Ok understand that I know it's a novel and reflecting the times but this novel just went too overboard. Every time Robert came in, I just wanted to flip past that part of the book. Hemmingway depicts these scenes in a distasteful manner that turned me off and I'm not easily stirred by writing.<br />In the end, I felt let down because no changes happened to the character lives and the conflict never changed. Why go through all the trouble if it's just Much ado about nothing? The novel was good however, in portraying the time period and &quot;the lost generation&quot; of the WW1 generation. That I give Hemmingway credit for. &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is worth your time and like I said; you'll either hate or love it. Overall I gave it three stars because I neither hated nor loved it.",2000-12-23

In Spain, there is a more restrictive meaning.  'Aficianado' only means one who is passionate about the bulls.  In fact, the concept is so restrictive that some bull fighters are considered to be just 'commercial' bull fighters and are not passionate enough about their chosen profession to be considered 'aficionados.'  This is so according to Hemingway.<br />In the broader sense of the word, Hemingway, in this book, reveals himself (as Jake Barnes) to be an aficionado when it comes to boxing, drinking, fishing, and bull-fighting.<br />I had a problem with one aspect of &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot;  I found Hemingway's excessive use of negative ethnic stereotyping to be troublesome.  For starters, he has created in Robert Cohn, a character who is emotionally unstable and thoroughly unlikeable because of his 'Jewishness.'  Following are a few examples of this portrayal:<br />In reference to Cohn  (observations of Barnes and his friends):<br />&quot;He had a hard, Jewish streak.&quot;<br />Brett's gone off with (other) men, but they weren't ever Jews.&quot;<br />&quot;That Cohn gets to me.  He's got that Jewish superiority.&quot;<br />&quot;That kike.&quot;<br />In reference to Jews in general:  &quot;She gets five hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to the Jews.  They're not really Jews.  We just call them Jews.  They're Scotsmen, I believe.&quot;<br />There are numerous other instances, but these already cited should suffice as examples of Hemingway's Jewish stereotyping.  <br />He went after other groups too.  To wit:<br />On Blacks:  &quot;The n  ,  ,  ,  ,  drummer waved at Brett.  He was all lips and teeth.&quot;<br />On gays:  &quot;I wanted to swing on one  .  .  .  .  to shatter that superior, simpering composure.&quot;<br />He didn't quit there either.  He went after the Frenchand, on numerous occasions, showed his disdain for all casual tourists.<br />There is so much of this sort of prejudicial stereotyping throughout the book that it was ruined for me.  It's too bad, because his bull-fight descriptions obviously came from an aficionado but were, for me, tainted by his attitudes.",2000-12-17

Circles, deja vu, and echos reverb throughout.  Characters reflect off one another.  First and last lines are flawless.  As is the rest of the text.  No sentence, or word goes to waste.  Unlike other masterpieces of fiction, even by Hemingway, not a moment in this novel is self indulgent.  The perfect modern work.  <br />Some things to consider:  Is Robert Cohn simply a fool?  Does he really behave as badly as one is led to believe?  Robert Cohn is one of the most misunderstood characters in all of fiction.  As flawed as he is, he is a noble character, the only character who undergoes transition throughout his time in the narrative.  His journey is crucial to the novel, in fact, as crucial as Jake's. Notice that he is missing from the last book.  <br />Brett is also a misunderstood character.  Does she love Jake?  Perhaps, in fact almost definately, but contrary to popular opinion, a case CAN be made that she doesn't.  Her relationship with Jake is one of the saddest in fiction.  When reading the end of the novel, note the deja vu Hemingway creates.  Remember Georgette the prostitute? Reread Jake's encounter with Georgette  earlier in the novel, after finishing TSAR.  Then think about how Brett herself can be linked to prostitution.  This might change your perception of the novels conclusion, though you will find it to be every bit as sad, if not more so.  <br />One reviewer here suggests the novel is about falling out of love.   THis is very possible.  Regardless of whether he still loves the idea of Brett that he had, Jake sees Brett very differently at the end of the novel.  Once again, I beleive Georgette is crucial to this reading of the novel.  There are many possible readings, but don't take things for granted when you read this book.  Especially that the way Jake portrays Brett and Cohn acurratly reflects who they are.  Remember, this is a first person narrator.  This is an extremmely complex book that demands rereadings.

In &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; Hemingway utilizes a simplisitic, humble, more comprehendable method of writing. Which in my opinion is the method that gave this writer his fame. Yet, even though his writing style in this novel is simple, there is a lot if depth and meaning that lies within the words. A lot of significant symbols are captured in this novel.     This novel critically depicts the emotional power that women have over men, whether people believe it or not. Because of this one woman, Brett Ashly, the lives of such men like Jake, Robert Cohn, and Bill drastically change. This novel also relates realisticaly to &quot;real&quot; lifestyles. For instance, there is drinking (alocoholism), partying, and sexual content(namely prostitution)...all explicit aspects of real life. This book relates to me because it's content is so real, there is not the normal love story, where a woman falls in love with a man and the end.

The thing is, everyone is post-modern  now.  But Hemingway was playing that game long before the English majors of  the world had a word to identify the style.      If you are being forced to  read this book for a class, I guess I can sympathize.  But just because you  don't like it, doesn't mean it isn't worth your time.  Even Hemingway's  detractors (and there are a lot of them) will acknowledge his role as a  literary groundbreaker.  After three-quarters of a century of non-stop  imitation (both conscious and otherwise) it is hard to appreciate the  impact that this book had on the literary world.  On the other hand, if you  only want to read books that you find enjoyable, suspenseful, or inspiring  (and nothing wrong with that), I would suggest that you look elsewhere.   Those of you who already know what Hemingway was about, don't like the idea  but order this book anyway...  I cannot imagine whatyou are thinking.",2000-08-27

The scenes involving the fishing and the bullfighting are very evocative, and the  dialogue interesting.  The understatement or non-statement (Hemmingway's  iceberg approach to writing) works very well in this, his first book that  brought him to national attention.  In that regard, the horrors of World  War I constitute those parts of the iceberg that lie beneath the water, and  influence the emptiness of the social life that is  above.  The &quot;what  might have been&quot; conversation between Jake and Brett (who both love  each other, but who both know the hopelessness of that love) at the end of  the book is particularly touching. <br />Notwithstanding the above, none of  the characters have much for the reader to be attracted to. A constant  never-ending stream of alcohol seems to flow through the book.  It's  incredible that people can drink as much as the principal characters in the  book do.  Then there's Brett, the 34 year old woman, who has Jake loving  her (and she loves him), is engaged to Mike, has an affair with Robert Cohn  (who also loves her), and in the end, seemingly out of the blue, takes off  and seduces the 19 year old bullfighter, Pedro Romero.  Try to figure that  out. <br />Also, I want to comment on what I consider to be an  uncomfortable  excess of anti-semitic sentiment in this book.  Consider this exchange  between Jake and Bill about Brett on p. 230 of the paperback Scribner  edition (1954).  <br />--&quot;She hasn't any money with her?&quot;  I asked  --&quot;I shouldn't think so.  She never has any money.  She gets five  hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to  Jews.&quot;   --&quot;I supppose they get it at the source,&quot; said  Bill.  --&quot;Quite.  They're not really Jews.  We just call them Jews.   They're Scotsmen, I believe.&quot;  <br />Of course, the heartof the  anti-semitism in this book is the way the characters relate to Robert Cohn.   Some of it can be chalked up to jealousy, particularly as Cohn had had an  affair with Brett, and Jake, who loves Brett, is sexually crippled because  of his war injuries.  But almost all of the principal characters, not just  Jake, take pleasure in continually deriding Cohn's Jewishness to his face,  to each other, or just in their mental, often alcohol-induced lucubrations.   The references occur all too often throughout the book, e.g., there's  Jake, saying  that Cohn had a &quot;hard, Jewish, stubborn streak,&quot;   p. 10, Bill [on Cohn] at p. 162, &quot;[h]e's got this Jewish superiority  so strong that he thinks the only emotion he'll get out of the fight will  be being bored&quot; and Mike, &quot;Take that sad Jewish face away, p. 177  . . . etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.  I realize that times change.  I don't  believe we should judge books from an earlier generation by today's  standards of political correctness.  Nonetheless, the characters in this  book are often mean-spirited, and excessively anti-semetic without, in my  view, an adequately compensating literary justification (which in the  context of the holocaust to come a mere decade latter, should give pause).   For whatever it's worth, in A Moveable Feast (a description of his life in  Paris in the 1920s), the most generous portrait in that book is to the  renowned poet (though fascist sympathizer) Ezra Pound.   <br />Perhaps, World  War I had gutted the soul, and that explains the Gertrude Stein quote, that  Hemmingway uses to preface the book, &quot;You are all a lost  generation.&quot;  But maybe the excuse is too easy.",2000-07-20

The 1920's is a time of a crisis of beliefs, lack of faith in the world or personal  values, and all the characters do in the book is drink most of the time.  Well, what else can they do? The world they once knew before the war has  been shattered, and Ernest Hemingway uses his own experiences to write a  spare and hard prose about their lives. The &quot;main&quot; characters are  Jake Barnes, Lady Brett Ashley, Robert Cohn, Bill Gorton, Michael, and  other assorted characters. They all live it up in Paris, and then Jake  decides to go to Pamplona to witness the bullfights during a fiesta, and  Jake will be with his aficionado friends of Spain. However, the whole gang  come over and Jake's last &quot;best place&quot; where he feels some kind  of security is ruined as the fiesta &quot;of drunks&quot; gets worse. Since  I've read this book for Engl 111 (intro course to literature), I have  finally &quot;met&quot; Ernest Hemingway and his mind.

There are those who adore Hemmingway for literary and life-style reasons and those who abhor his writing altogether. Whenever I present my mild  appreciation of Hemmingway to members of either extreme, they become irate.  The former, tell me he's a genius, while the latter argue that  a child  could write like Hemmingway. Frankly, they are both wrong.<br />&quot;The Sun  Also Rises&quot; contains much of the fuel that Hemmingway haters consume.  The writing is quite simple and much of the dialog is strained and even a  bit macho. The novel, in their opinion, could be construed as a hundred  plus page promotion of the Hemmingway life style. It's got travel,  brawling, love, conflict, fishing, bullfighting, and a lots of fun  sportsman line stuff. It contains a Hemmingway motif that I've never really  liked, namely discourse of the glamorous yet victimized war hero.  <br />Hemmingway lovers will counter these arguments by pointing out that  simplicity in writing and dialog is not a bad thing, especially when the  author uses it as self-consciously as Hemmingway does. True, the language  is a bit strained and macho, but the story is, after all, narrated by an  adventurous and heartbroken World War I veteran. I can't imagine this  person and his expatriate colleagues engaging in the subtle, serpentine  conversations found in a Henry James novel. As for the travel, the  bullfighting, and the other activities that we have come to associate with  the Hemmingway lifestyle-so what? It's a great travelogue among other  things.<br />I guess my own opinion is largely in favor of Hemmingway although  I agree with a lot of his critics. Hemmingway is a great story teller and  &quot;Sun Also Rises&quot; is an exceptionally good story. Hemmingway's  language is imperfect but certainly adequate. Ultimately, I read literature  to be transformed to another place or state of mind and Hemmingway  certainly accomplishesthat for me.<br />To Hemmingway's critics, I would  argue that one does not have to be subtle, nor write a novel of ideas to be  a great author. To his proponents I would also argue that the man is a good  writer, a great story teller, and a fascinating character in his own right,  but certainly not a genius.<br />I recommend &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; to  anyone interested in a good story, a unique writing style, and an  interesting portrayal of the so called &quot;lost generation&quot;.",2000-02-16

I don't think I had read it before.<br />It's a hard read.  Nothing much happens, and the characters, except for Robert Cohn, are so repellant that it's hard to care  about them.  If you don't care about characters, you don't care what  happens to them.  The only character with any dimension is Robert Cohn, the  idealistic outsider trying to get into the crowd and rebuffed at every  turn.<br />Hemingway's famous short choppy adjective-free style doesn't work  well on dialogue because that's not how most people talk, so it's rather  stilted, which contributes to the sense that you don't really know what the  characters are about.<br />However, in his defense, I must say that his  narrative descriptions are superb.  One would think that descriptions  require adjectives, and here he does use them sparingly.  So his style  works beautifully as he describes the bus trip into Spain, the wonderful  fishing expedition, and the bullfights.  It's in those passages that the  characters involved in them come to life - they are interested in something  outside themselves, something other than when they can have their next  drink, and it humanizes them.  They aren't quite so one-dimensional in  those passages.<br />I know this was Hemingway's first big success, and  probably gave an accurate portrayal of the ex-pat life of that time, but if  this were all I knew of him, I would not be tempted to read others of his  works.

It is true that one must look beyond the surface to get a clear understanding of any book by Hemingway.   It is also true that the language that he used was not flowery, nor overly  eloquent but the meaning revealed within the lines.  It is also true that  the characters are often expatriates; living on the fringe of society and  hedonistic to the max.  All of those elements are visible here, yet  sometimes it might require a magnifying glass to see it.  However, these  are the qualities which make Ernest Hemingway, the seminal writer for a  generation and certainly one of the best.<br />     I propose one hint when  reading &quot;the Sun also Rises.&quot;  Pay close attention to the  relationship between Barnes and Robert Cohn.  Barnes laothes Cohn for being  everything that he is not.  What drives him over the edge (in the inner  sanctum of his own mind and demons) is the success Cohn has insofar as his  relationship with Lady Brett.  Barnes is impotent and this is a crushing  blow to his manhood.  The tragedy here is his inability to consummate a  sexual relationship with her.  It destroys him--yet he is still accepting  of his predicament.  This is what allows this character to maintain  &quot;grace under pressure&quot;-- as Hemingway once coined the  term or  the ability to stand or hold ones ground when all odds are against you.   Certainly this can be a tragic flaw for any of Hemingway's male  characters--the total loss of his virility.  Yet he stands his ground and  never loses it.  He just hates Cohn from a distance and rationalizes that  he (Cohn) is one who cannot do anything just for the sake of doing  it---whether it be drinking, winning the Princeton boxing title, or being  in love with Brett.  It is complicated but one can come away with these  qualities after finishing the novel rather than while reading it.<br />     I  think his friend and sometimes rival, F. Scott Fitzgerald, summed him up  best when he said of Hemingway: &quot;He's the real thing.&quot;",1999-09-26

He won't lay anything out for you in black and white -- you've got to be an active  participant in the book.  If that's not what you want from a book, stay  away.<br />The Sun Also Rises is fantastic.  It has Hemingway's trademark  prose, a portrait of the lost generation, and most of all the saddest love  story ever written.  &quot;There's no plot!&quot; the detractors scream,  but they're wrong.  The plot isn't spelled out the way it is in a John  Grisham novel, but it's definitely there if you pay attention.  <br />Here's a  hint for those who weren't trying very hard: this book is all about Brett  Ashley and Jake.  Throughout the book Hemingway shows Lady Brett following  a very definite pattern.  She meets a man, &quot;falls in love&quot; with  him, sleeps with him, and dumps him.  She isn't some cynical player when  she does this -- she truly believes that she loves these men during her  infatuations.  But she requires physical proof of their love, i.e. sex, and  once she has it, the infatuation dies.  When the book starts we meet her  latest victim, Cohn.  As the book continues we see a similar relationship  unfold with Romero.<br />But then there's Jake!  She met Jake and fell in love  with him, but a war injury makes him incapable of giving her the physical  love she requires.  As a result, poor pathetic Brett never fell out of love  with Jake, and imagines him as the one man who could be the great love of  her life.  For the longest time Jake believes this as well.<  He's seen  what she did to Cohn, and he's had a ringside seat for her affair with  Romero, and now he's finally realized the truth about her.  When she  fantasizes about the great life they could have had together, he knows it's  just wishful thinking.  If they could have made love, she would have dumped  him just like all the others.<br />At it's heart, TheSun Also Rises is a book  about a man falling out of love.<br />Hemingway's prose is a matter of  opinion.  Some people love his sparse verbage, others don't.  If you don't  care for it, try Fitzgerald, an excellent writer with a much fuller  style.<br />One reviewer mentioned that this was one of Hemingway's earliest  works, and for that reason suggested it wasn't worthy of five stars (he  only gave it two).  I think he said Hemingway wasn't yet a mature writer  and was still trying to develop his style.  What a crock -- Hemingway, like  many authors, did his best work early in his career.  Heck, the guy  eventually committed suicide because he couldn't write anything good  anymore.  His more &quot;mature&quot; works are only passable and can't  hold a candle to the earlier stuff.  His prize for &quot;The Old Man and  the Sea&quot; was more of a lifetime achievement award than anything else.   So save all that &quot;maturity and development&quot; folderol for the  black turtleneck gang at the coffee shop.<br />It's a great book, but it will  make you work.  If you want an obvious plot and themes that you don't have  to think about, maybe you'd be happier with Danielle Steele.",1999-09-09

They are staying in Pamplona during the  bull fights so the environment is romantic.  Brett falls in love with a  bull fighter and discards him later in the novel.  But the point is that  the characters, after all they have been through did not advance, or get  anywhere.  Where they began in the novel is where they ended up in the end.   So I guess Hemingway did prove his thesis of a &quot;Lost  Generation.&quot;  A generation in which Brett and Jake belong to.   Hemingway proves that Brett &amp; Jake do have meaningless, pointless lives  all too well.  But if you're into reading and some deep symbolism this is  the book for you.",1999-09-02

In many ways it's a very sentimental novel about Paris, the 1920's, drink, sex, and courage. While the novel begins in Paris, the reader is taken south to the Pyranees that border France and Spain, and then further south still to Pamplona for the running of the bulls. The book's hero Jake cannot consumate his relationship with Lady Brett Ashley because of an unfortunate injury he acquired in the war in Italy, rendering him impotent. Brett is pigheaded, stunning, an attention seeker, and a flirt... this combination drives Jake crazy as she returns his love, but goes out with other men to get the one thing she can't get from him. This tragic scenario is masterfully painted for us by Hemingway from the very beginning of the book. So, the one thing that Jake wants to give to Brett he can't, and this makes him feel inadequate, and creates an ambivalence in her attitudes and behaviour toward him. Jake is the man she loves, he's right for her in every way, yet because of his injury she is driven away from him, and goes out with much lesser suitable men, one in particular is an out and out fool and a nothing compared with Jake. Hemingway makes the reader feel Jake's wistfullness and sentimentally about what could be between Jake and Brett, we also drink up the mood of Paris and Pamplona during the Fiesta... it's hard not to come away from the book with a crush on Lady Brett, a wish that you'd experienced Paris in the 1920's as Hemingway did, and perhaps more than anything else, dying for a drink... in classic Hemingway style, the characters booze their way through the novel from page 2. ***** Highly recommended.",1999-02-24

He has also been called an expatriate, an alcoholic, a traitor and Papa.  He was a man who never forgave his father for committing suicide, yet took his own life in 1961.   <br /> Although being hailed as a great American writer, he spent much of his life living outside the US.  The two seemingly contradictory epigraphs in the beginning of The Sun Also Rises were put together on the page by a seemingly contradictory man.   <br /> Whether he did it intentionally or not, Hemingway wrote The Sun Also Rises in a way that keeps scholars and students in constant speculation as to his theme.  His reference to his friend and mentor, Gertrude Stein's comment on the status of the post World War I society  would make it seem that he is in agreement of her bleak and cynical outlook.   <br /> The lost generation, like the ancient Epicureans were in the constant pursuit of moderate pleasure.  They lived for the day and gave little though to the consequences of their actions, or to the low that usually follows a high.  However, he does not settle for one epigraph.   <br /> In reaching back to quote Ecclesiastes, a second century preacher and philosopher, Hemingway reveals that no matter how gray the world seems, there is a light to guide us.  That light is hope. In his seemingly shallow characters intended to epitomize the lost generation, Hemingway shows - albeit briefly - the even they have traces of compassion and humanity left.   <br /> The narrator, Jake, is a complex character.  Having sustained an injury in the war, Jake is incapable of intimate physical relations with women.  Jake is an authentic person.  He has friends who, although some are shallow and egocentric, care for him and value his friendship.  The fact that he is impotent, however, throws a shadow on his character.   <br /> Although he is seen as one of the more genuine characters, it is conceivable that he would not be so virtuous without his affliction.  Although Jake shows his dark and sardonic side on occasion, he is a testament that there are still people who care in the world.   <br /> The fact that Hemingway made Jake incapable of siring children, is the author's way of not tipping the scale too far in the direction of hope. <br /> Pedro is another character who shows the hope of the novel.  Pedro's naïveté is a refreshing change to the world weary characters representing the lost generation.  All Pedro knows is bullfighting.  It is his world, his life and he is good at it.   Pedro, too, is not a perfect character.  He is seduced by Brett, and as a result , falls in what he thinks to be love with her.  He allows Cohn to provoke him into fighting.  Pedro took his beating and did not let Cohn take his pride.  Pedro is flawed like all men, but he shows with his youthful energy and vision, that there are good people.  It is no coincidence that Pedro is a bullfighter.  He stood tall in his suit of lights, a glamorous spectacle for all to see.  Even in his moments of shame, Pedro managed to hang on to his dignity.   <br /> Although Bill seems to be the logical character to turn to next, it is in Brett that Hemingway gives the most subtle yet poignant glimmer of hope.  Throughout the novel, Brett is seen as an opportunistic, cynical and uncaring woman.   <br /> Completely undeserving of her title-by-marriage.  She shamelessly has an affair with Cohn, then tosses him aside to return to Michael.  She continues her escapades by seducing Pedro, the innocent young bullfighter.  Yet there is something within her that draws Jake in as her would-if-only-could-be lover and maintains him as a trusted friend and confidant.  That alone is not enough to argue for her role as a character of hope.  It is her affair with Pedro that shows her potential.  During the course of their affair, Pedro believes that he is in love with Brett.  Brett realized that she is not in love with Pedro, but with what he represents: youth, strength, courage and prestige.   <br /> Brett's realization that she would hurt Pedro, perhaps irrevocably, and that she must leave him and all he represents, is what makes her a character on the edge.  She is by all rights caught up in the mentality of the lost generation, and even after her epiphany, will be so caught up again, but her enlightenment was there.  She had made the realization and crossed the line from pleasure seeker to enlightened soul.  For one brief shining moment, she thought of the well being of another and not merely of her own.  Brett saw the light and became a symbol of hope.   <br /> Hemingway's novel paints a somewhat bleak picture of things to come in the post World War I years.  His characters spend their time drinking and running from affair to affair.  A shallow existence to be sure.  Yet when in the country, there is less time wasted on pointless dialogue and more time spent on the description and appreciation of the beauty of the wilderness.

Each of the characters lives in a fantasy of their own to cushion them from the realization of how pathetic their existences are. Except for Jake.

These words were spoken about another generation,  a group of young people who, after World War I, were feeling disconnected from the rest of the world.       <br />Many of them were living in Europe, living the &quot;expatriate&quot; life.  That meant they lived from meal to meal on borrowed money trying to develop an artistic lifestyle thousands of miles from everything and everyone they grew up knowing.    <br /> Just a few years ago, Seattle was a kind of Mecca among east coast Generation Xers.  Everyone I went to college with envisioned Seattle as the place where we could be ourselves.  Of course, we hadn't really defined who that was yet, and none of us had been there.  Yet, somehow, we knew that Seattle was the place to be.    <br /> Paris was the place to be for the original lost generation and Ernest Hemingway became one of that city's most celebrated adopted sons.  His semi-autobiographical novel The Sun Also Rises follows a group of young people trying to find themselves after World War I.     <br /> Jake Barnes, the main character, is a veteran with an unfortunate war wound which puts a damper on his dating life.  Lady Brett Ashley is the woman who loves him, and whom he loves, but also the woman he cannot have.  They are surrounded by a cast of painters, writers, editors, drunks, and a bullfighter named Pedro Romero.    <br /> Romero becomes the linchpin of the story.  Jake, Brett, and friends head off to Pamplona, Spain for the running of the bulls and the festival of San Fermin.  Jake is a bit of an aficionado of la corrida de toros and looks forward to initiating his less experienced friends.      <br />He did not anticipate, however, Lady Brett.  Brett is the female equivalent of a womanizer.  When she meets Romero, sparks fly and Jake is put into the uncomfortable position of acting as a go-between for the woman he loves and another man.     <br /> When the novel comes to a close, Jake is still lost, but is closer to finding himself.  The problem is he's not sure he likes himself. Maybe he should go to Seattle, have a mocha, and try to chill out  . . . or whatever.",1997-06-09

THE SUN ALSO RISES is a necessary 'read' as an introduction to understanding the modern novel as much as it is for its literary and entertainment value. This novel 'turned the corner'so to speak, from the flowery, dense-packed novels of the late Victorian period with their reams of description, to the new 'lean' writing that Papa Hemingway introduced.<br /><br />His apprenticeship as a newspaper reporter, reporting from Italy during<br />WW I, and his later work with the Toronto Star becomes evident in his 'reportage' style of literary writing. Every sentence crackles, ensuring that what might otherwise be a rather linear story in fact carries the reader along as it delves into the intricacies, lives, loves and characters of the group of expats searching for their destinies in France and Spain during the 1920's. The novel is best read twice, the first for its entertainment qualities, then, after a passage of time, a second time to answer the question: What is the author seeking to do here? Of course, the bullfight scenes and commentaries are classical. This book is a 'must' for every aspiring creative writer.",2013-04-03
