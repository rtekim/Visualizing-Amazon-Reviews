Along the way he loses his moral compass and develops a taste for power, resorting to bullying, bribery, blackmail - whatever takes - to get what he wants. Willie does manage to help some of his constituents, taxing the wealthy to provide schools and hospitals for the poor, but he also betrays his wife, raises a selfish, self-absorbed son, corrupts good people, and eventually reaps the consequences of his actions. Willie's story is told by Jack Burden, a journalist who signs on to be Willie's right hand man. Thinking of himself as essentially a good guy Jack believes he's 'only doing his job' when he betrays some of his closest friends at Willie's behest. I gave the book 4 stars (rather than 5) because the philosophical rantings of some characters was tedious and incomprehensible (to me).

While Warren’s book is commonly listed as a classic of political literature, on this rereading I discovered a much deeper philosophical vein. I am probably practicing literary criticism & philosophy without a license here, but I believe the book – in addition to prose that verges on poetry – is a profound reflection on human nature. Furthermore, I am not certain that Warren’s view of mankind is very positive. He uses the famous line, “Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud,” initially to convince Jack Burden that some political dirt can be found on Judge Irwin. Judge Irwin was like a father figure for Jack as he was growing up and is believed to be beyond corruption. However, Jack does indeed find that corruption evidence; after he asks Judge Irwin about his finding, Irwin commits suicide. Only afterwards does Warren tell us that the judge was Jack’s father. So, ultimately NO ONE in the novel is “sin free.”",2013-12-10

Perhaps the most astute political novel not written by George Orwell, it tackles universal themes of good and evil, power, greed, jealousy and love through the story of Willie Stark and his Boswell, Jack Burden, who narrates the story and finds out some truths both about himself and life in general along the way.<br /><br />Stark is the governor of an unnamed Southern state (modeled on Huey Long and Louisiana) who had gone into politics to do good and decides that you can only make good out of evil \\""because evil is all there is.\\"" He discovers that evil is not so easily converted. Burden, meanwhile, discovers that human beings are highly flawed creatures.<br /><br />While it sounds like a very cynical novel, All the King's Men is actually a very conservative one, in the traditional sense of accepting the fallen nature of Man. Stark is the prototype of every idealistic politician who sought power to do good things and discovered that power has a way of rechanneling those priorities. Perhaps if the 20th century had fewer idealists, it would also have had far fewer mass graves.<br /><br />All the King's Men came out about a year after that other great post-WWII dissection of corrupted idealism, Orwell's Animal Farm.

Along the way, he is swept up and used by the politician against the established gentry of his youth.  It's a good plot, but be ready for a slow ride.  For Warren is more interested in the details and psychology and back story than getting to the next plot point.  If you slow down and enjoy the hot Southern summer day's pace of the language, though, then the plot is there for the savoring.  If you can't slow down, you probably won't get very far in this book.<br /><br />2) Characters (4 stars) - The story focuses on the rise and metamorphosis of Willie Stark from simple idealist to Machiavelli with Southern wit.  But I found the narrator - Jack - to be just as fascinating in his change from cynicism to just starting to care back to cynicism again.<br /><br />3) Theme (4 stars) - This is a story about innocence lost.  Both Willie's innocence when he does what he must to gain political influence, and Jack's innocence as he faces his childhood's myth again from the vantage point of middle age.<br /><br />4) Voice (5 stars) - Probably the most beautiful prose I have ever read.  Seriously.  Warren has a style of letting descriptions morph into metaphors which morph further into short stories and suddenly you're a page later and it stops and it's like a dream finishing.  Perhaps it could be distracting to some who just want to get on to the next plot point, but for me, I ate it up and asked for seconds.  It's humbling and inspiring to know a human can think and write in such a way.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - The Deep South in the 1930s.  I certainly felt like I was in a different era reading this.  A slower era, but not necessarily a less intelligent one.  The characters' lives are not packed full of information, but they're also not packed full of the distraction of information, which lets the wisdom have time to bubble and boil and pop in the simplest phrases.<br /><br />6) Overall (5 stars) - This is an American treasure on many levels--from the language, to the folksy wisdom, to the deep South swamps and suspenders.

Burden is something of an idealist who has somehow become attached to the political machine of southern Governor Willie Stark, known throughout the story as simply \\""The Boss\\"".  Also playing a prominent part is Burden's relationship to Adam and Anne Stanton, two childhood friends who were the children of a former Governor.<br /><br />The narrator of the story, Burden, seems to wander aimlessly through the events of the book, often as not doing much of the Governor's dirtiest work, while seldom seeming to question the morality or legality of his actions.  There is much talk of good, bad and evil between repeated scenes of political graft, bribery and corruption.<br /><br />Much of the book is fascinating in its portrayal of raw political power and manipulation.  However, far too frequently the author diverts to almost stream of consciousness prose with little or no advancement of the underlying story line.  One hundred pages of such florid drivel could have easily been excised from the novel, resulting in a far more captivating tale.  As it was, I'd immensely enjoy fifty pages of narrative only to be faced with ten pages of garbage that could literally be skimmed over.<br /><br />So, how to rate such a book?

As much as the plot is devoted to Willie Stark, it is more so linked to narrator Jack Burden, his ideologies about the world of politics, campaigning and playing hard ball and dirty politics, being Willie's right hand man, and his coming to terms with the tragic consequences that unfold later. Jack Burden lives essentially in two different worlds, the rural Burden's Landing, which is reminiscent of Jack's past, his family and close friends and past hopes, and the world of Willie Stark, where Jack, even as a dutiful employee, expresses his jadedness and cynicism towards \\""the Boss\\"" and his methods.<br /><br />Warren is the king of lyrical prose;  he has a way of taking long avenues and digressions to get to the point. This can be literally in the form of verbose sentences that cover half a page, or in the form of  single reflections that go on for forty or fifty pages. When this meandering is for effect and purpose, it's pure genius. When it involves the trivial or unnecessary, it's quite cumbersome.  At moments, this novel feels overwritten. There were points that I had to set this novel aside for awhile and pick it back up just because of the daunting nature of the chapters, but then I would read a passage that was a stroke of pure genius, where Warren had such an insightful revelation into Jack's views or life in general, and I was reminded  why I wanted to read it through until the end. For instance, many readers thought the back story of Cass Mastern was unnecessary, but I thought it was a nice touch,  an essential linking point between Jack's story and his uncle's story, as they parallel each other.<br /><br />The dirty politics aspects and its ultimate theme of corruption with unsympathetic characters made All the King's Men difficult to fully enjoy, eventhough the novel ultimately arrives at a moral and point.<br /><br />I'm glad I persevered though, and I won't knock the book's classic status as a political masterpiece, as others seemed to fully enjoy the book.

No, make that three graduate classes, for there's enough in here to provide ample curriculum for Ethics in Politics 320, Rhetoric & Logic 420, and at least a full semester of Modern American Literature.<br /><br />The story is set in the 1930s and is told in first person by Jack Burden, former journalist-turned-aide to Willie Stark, a southern governor in the Huey Long mold: broad, brash, and bold. But now that I've gotten that out of the way you can stop worrying about it, because what this book is really about is Original Sin/corruption/moral compromise. Literally every character in this tale faces some sort of moral/ethical dilemma. A small handful (for instance, the governor's wife Lucy) manage to navigate the morass of existence without falling from grace, but the vast majority slip and fall - some out of a genuine lack of morality (for instance, the assistant governor, Tiny Duffy, a true Tammany Hall villain), but most of them gradually, one ethical compromise yielding inevitably to another, like a Jenga tower from which pieces are systematically removed until the whole thing collapses. I'm not sure whether Penn himself is clear whether this is the result of free will or a manifestation of Original Sin. One of the governor's favorite quotes, repeated often throughout the tale, is that \\""man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud. There is always something [corrupt in their nature]\\"" - suggesting that at least a part of him comes down on the side of Original Sin. But it's hard not to want to kick many of the (largely unsympathetic) characters in the butt every time they wittingly make choices that are obviously going to lead to catastrophe.<br /><br />Students of Ethics in Politics will relish the examination of how Governor Stark's noble motives become gradually corrupted by the realities of the political system in which he operates. Originally convinced to run for office by corrupt politicians counting on him to split the \\""rube\\"" vote so that the state's Political Machine can continue to churn unmolested, Stark eventually turns the tables on his manipulators, but in doing so finds himself resorting to increasingly unethical methods (threats, blackmail) in order to achieve his largely unselfish and well-meaning ends. Which begs the question that seems to arise every time someone like Huey Long - or, more recently, DC Councilman Marion Berry - ends up on trial for corruption, even as thousands of deservedly grateful, devoted constituents picket the courthouse steps: can even the noblest of intentions ever justify ethically questionable means?<br /><br />Meanwhile, students of rhetoric and logic will be kept busy by chapter upon chapter of cascading syllogisms employed in order to justify all sorts of questionable ends. No topic seems too vast or intimidating to escape Penn's scrutiny, from life, death, and fate, to the nature of good, evil, and God. The narrator, Jack Burton, uses these syllogisms as justification for a series of increasingly dubious acts; what's less clear is whether he is self-aware enough to realize the extent to which his syllogisms are laced with sly and intricate fallacies, enough to keep a class of grad students huddled over pints of ale for months, hashing them all out.<br /><br />And, lest students of Modern American Lit feel left out, there's plenty left for them in examining the parallelism between ancient Greek tragedy and Stark's gradual fall from grace (substitute Judge Irwin's fall from grace, or Adam Stanton's fall from grade, or Jack Burden's fall from grace, if you prefer), culminating in a series of climaxes as horrific as they are undoubtedly hubristic. Even the names of the characters in the story - Jack Burden, Tiny Duffy, Willie Stark - are loaded with symbolic and metaphoric relevance. No - English lit students needn't feel slighted; there is more than enough here to keep them churning out papers until final exams week.<br /><br />In other words, this book is stuffed full of juicy, complex content - which makes it a capital book for studying, but perhaps doesn't much contribute to creating a diverting or entertaining reading experience. The characters aren't particularly likeable, the plot is largely introspective rather than event-driven, and - believe me - I'm not spoiling anything by letting it slip that no one lives happily ever after, which can make portions of this tough slogging. Guess I'm saying that while there's plenty of meat here, definitely requires an investment in energy, attention and cognition on the part of the reader in order to appropriately digest it.",2012-04-28

Set in the 1930's, it traces the rise and fall of a dictatorial demagogue loosely based on Huey \\""Kingfish\\"" Long, governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1931. Long was loved by his supporters and hated by his detractors and ultimately assassinated in 1935 after he announced his run for the Democratic nomination for presidency against FDR. Warren was a professor at LSU during Long's rise in politics.<br /><br />What I actually read was the 2001 version taken from Warren's original manuscript, held at Yale University. Noel Polk, a professor of literature from the University of Southern Mississippi, \\""restored\\"" the author's unedited version. There is debate among literary experts regarding Polk's version. And Warren agreed, in fact, participated in the editorial changes back then--he never indicated dissatisfaction with the 1946 publication. The true work, perhaps, is the published version, approved by Warren, vs. the Polk version. Polk claimed that the editorial decisions of 1945-1946 tampered with authenticity and bastardized Warren's first creative words. Well, I'll just leave that argument to the pundits. The restored \\""Willie Talos\\"" version is what I found at the library, so it's what I read. And it was fantastic, as I'm sure the 1946 \\""Willie Stark\\"" version is, since it's the one that has been critically acclaimed for over fifty years.<br /><br />I won't retell the story. It's long, complex, filled with multiple themes--and while Willie may seem to be the protagonist, the book is ultimately about Jack Burden, gopher for Governor Willie Talos. Just who is the protagonist is perhaps an interesting question for literary students (or old guys who like books).  Does Willie or Jack drive the action? Regardless, one must conclude that Jack is the voice of Robert Penn Warren; and it's Jack's voice that is predominant. Jack is intelligent, from a southern genteel upbringing, but he seems to go through the motions, living in the Boss's world of dirty politics and increasing corruption. He just takes orders, appears to lack personal ambition, and is an observer of his world. Jack's got a sardonic wit. He's a realist but inside, he seems to question his own human nature. He's not a particularly happy person.<br /><br />This book is filled with fascinating well-defined characters, richly described--even the minor ones. While it was difficult to be sympathetic with any of them, I could identify with pieces of them, became familiar with them and wanted to learn more about them. A couple times, it struck me that Warren went a bit over-the-top with detail, like his description of Anne Stanton's laugh; it was so ornate, I concluded that only Pulitzer Prize winners must think like that! I particularly like the Cass Mastern episode. Jack did extensive historical research digging into the motives of this Civil War relative. Just why did Cass try so hard to find Phebe, the sold slave? Jack never finds out and in frustration, dropped his PHD work. Penn's writing style, his descriptions, his word choices and sentences, his steady use of creative similes grabbed me. Examples:<br /><br />Jack: \\""She kept on looking at me, not saying anything, with that look which always said, `You've got something I want, something I need, something, I've got to have,' and said too, `I've got something for you, I won't tell you what, not yet, but I've got something for you, too.' The hollow in the cheeks: the hungry business. The glittering eyes: the promising business. And both at the same time. It was quite a trick.\\"" (Italics mine)<br /><br />Jack in an argument: \\""and the absorbent silence sucked up words like blotting paper.\\""<br /><br />Willie: \\""Folks, there's going to be a leetle mite of trouble back in town. Between me and the Legislature-full of hyena-headed, feist-faced, belly-dragging sons of slack-gutted she-wolves.\\"" (It's the voice of a creative cracker. While I'd love to be able say such a thing to somebody sometime, it wouldn't be me).<br /><br />\\""...like the ocean chewing its gums.\\""<br /><br />Jack, cynicism on taking the state bar exam: \\""But maybe it had taken too long. If something takes too long, something happens to you. You become all and the only thing you want and nothing else, for you have paid too much for it, too much in wanting and too much in waiting and too much in getting. In the end, they just ask those crappy little questions.\\""<br /><br />Jack, frustrated with Willie's early speeches on the tax program: \\""Yeah... I heard the speech. But they don't give a damn about that... so it's up to you to give `em something to stir `em up and make `em feel alive again... Tell `em anything. But for Sweet Jesus' sake don't try to improve their minds.\\""<br /><br />I can partly relate to Jack's sensibilities: \\""At the hotel I ate a sandwich and went up to my room, and got the fan turned on and a pitcher of ice water sent up and took off my shoes and shirt and propped myself in a chair with a good book. There is nothing like a good book to put you to sleep with the illusion that life is rich and meaningful.\\"" (But to me, good books do make life rich and meaningful.)<br /><br />Jack: \\""There is a kind of snobbery of failure. It's a club, it's old school... and there is no nasty supercilious twist to a mouth like the twist a drunk gets when he hangs over the bar beside an old pal who has turned out to be a big-shot and who hasn't changed a bit...\\""<br /><br />Jack: \\""`It's a nice night,'I said in, I confess, the voice one reserves for small children, old ladies with ear-trumpets, and idiots.\\""<br /><br />Jack, with the goods on his old mentor Judge Irwin: \\""So I had it after all the months. For nothing is lost, nothing is ever lost. There is always the clue, the cancelled check, the smear of lipstick, the footprint in the canna bed, the condom on the park path, the twitch in the old wound, the baby shoes dipped in bronze, the taint in the blood stream. And all times are one time, and all those dead in the past never lived before our definition gives them life, and out of the shadow their eyes implore us. That is what all of us historical researchers believe. And we love the truth.\\""<br /><br />I loved the philosophical meanderings built into Warren's developing story:<br /><br />Jack Burden: \\""The end of man is knowledge, but there is one thing he can't know.

But listen here, there ain't anything worth doing a man can do and keep his dignity.\\""<br /><br />Jack: \\""One feels incredulity at opening the breaking of a habit, but horror at the violation of a principle.

Willie Stark stands in for Long as the demagoguing governor of Louisiana.<br /><br />The main character and narrator is Jack Burden, a rich boy turned newspaper man turned political fixer.  Much more attention is paid to his story than that of Stark relative to the 2006 movie version.  Characteristic is an aside in no way related to the main story that tells a tragic, horrifying story of Jack's family in the Antebellum South.  We learn that Jack is a failed law student and failed history phd candidate.  But we also learn more about Stark's relationship with his wife and about his son.  All that said, I must say it very closely matches the tone of the movie even though it shares little dialogue and events diverge.<br /><br />All the Kings Men is the sort of book with a very high ratio of words to plot progress.

But if the hero is the person whose actions move events forward, then this novel has two heroes: Willie Stark and Jack Burden. And their lives are inextricably bound. The actions of Jack Burden, as much as the actions of Willie Stark, move events forward. Burden is more of an observer than a participant: to observe and analyze and comment and not act -- that is what he wants. But, in investigating the past at Stark's bequest, trying to find \\""dirt\\"" on Judge Irwin, Jack sets in motion a tragic series of events that lead to more than one loss, more than one death.

While I disagree about this being a \\""the best novel about American Politics\\"", it is inarguably one of the best about Southern American life.<br />There are many kinds of writers: poets, storytellers(novelists), playwrites, and investigative journalists (reporters).

I recommend that you get the originally published Robert Penn Warren edition, in which the main character is \\""Willie Stark\\"", and not this \\""Willie Talos\\"" edition.  In my opinion, the tale of Willie Stark is one of the best books in 20th century literature, from a pure story-craft standpoint, and not to be messed with.     I'll admit I first came upon this book as part of the \\""summer reading list\\"" for a school English class.  There were some truly enjoyable books on that list as well as some that just seemed incomprehensible (\\""The Sound and the Fury\\"", for example) and others where I had very little idea of what the author was getting at.  \\""All the King's Men\\"" was just a knock-your-socks-off novel.  It has interesting characters, a (mostly) believable context, and enough suspense that you're not sure just what might happen next.  The main characters in the book are Willie Stark, a powerful and corrupt state politician in the American pre-war South, and Jack Burden, a journalist from a wealthy background who essentially works for Willie.  As the story begins, Willie hires Jack to find some dirt on a political rival that Willie wants out of the way.  Jack's efforts to do so, and Willie's own hubris, eventually impact the lives of Jack and several people he loves, including the only consistent father figure he ever knew (an elderly judge) and Jack's teenage love.  Jack tells the story of his own life intertwined with Willie's life, leading up to the climactic events where Willie finally falls from grace.  In doing so, Jack shows how both he and Willie started out innocent but were gradually corrupted by the machinations of a system outside their control.     Although Willie's tactics seem brutal, they may also be seen as a way of exerting control over a system that would otherwise crush him and other common people. An outwardly even less powerful person, Willie's secretary Sadie Burke, who is herself from a poor background and is scarred by pock marks, turns out to be the one who pulls the strings that both bring Willie to power and knock him back down.  Sadie is one of the most interesting female characters in 20th-century literature (much more so than her foil, the quiet, retiring, beautiful Southern belle Anne Stanton, who is barely developed) and is as much of a politician as any of the men.      This is a book that you can just enjoy reading from a pure standpoint of reading a political or historical novel, even if you don't want to get too deeply into analyzing it or understanding all the allusions and English-majory stuff.

Excellent in all respects, it is absolutely essential for anyone even remotely interested in American literature, and those attracted to its prime elements will be particularly intrigued. Many of these are nearly always overlooked and often deliberately misrepresented. Like nearly everyone else, all I knew about the book before reading was that it is supposedly a thinly-veiled dramatization of Huey Long's life. It is this, but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it is also far more. A top-tier historical novel and a deeply meaningful work with a wealth of philosophical depth, vivid characters, and general verisimilitude, it is well-rounded and simply masterful.    Let us deal with the Long parallels first. There are many; this is required reading for anyone interested in Long, as it uses much of his biography and delves deeply into his psychology. Far more importantly, it gives profound insight into the people of whom he is an archetype - supremely egotistical and conscienceless but intelligent, extremely able, and undeniably charming. We see how they work and how others fall under their spell. Long is simply fascinating, a true American original and seminal figure; this is a good introduction, hopefully leading readers to find out more, and a perpetually interesting stop for the many still curious about him.    The book goes far beyond this even in immediate aspects. For example, it is an astonishing inside look at American politics just before World War II; it of course focuses on the low and gritty, but this is politics after all. Warren's narrative has that indefinable but all-important air of authenticity, pulling us in immediately and keeping us engrossed. Local and state politics are particularly emphasized, but the basic truths are not only national but eternal. Many have said that politics is corrupt, but few have shown it as vibrantly and memorably as Warren. His novel is also historical in a larger sense, giving a grand panorama of the rural South's last hurrah and even stretching back to the Old South, showing slavery and more. Warren had great insight into the Southern character and Southern culture, showing everything from history to speech to mores. His portrayal is notably unapologetic, non-sentimental, and non-didactic; he shows things as they were, letting us draw conclusions. Unlike so many others in similar situations, he does not force an ideology or even any kind of perspective on us, always letting story take center stage. In addition, the novel conveys a strong sense of what it was like to live in this important era; American politics was being revolutionized, the Depression was in full swing, the Red Scare lingered, and WWII loomed. Few works bring all this so effectively - much less affectingly - to the fore.    Even more importantly, the book has a plethora of meaningful themes explored variously and at great depth. Human fallibility is of course key, and a variety of ethical dilemmas ranging from social to familial are dramatized; the book touches on everything from economic issues to race to gender roles and sexual politics. It also movingly portrays the loss of innocence and adulthood's transition. Perhaps most fundamentally, it delves far into the free will debate and even life's meaning.    Much of this comes via Jack Burden, the first-person narrator, who is the real protagonist, not Long stand-in Willie Stark. The book is in fact a bildungsroman on top of everything else; we see Burden progress from talented but indecisive youth to outwardly successful but inwardly tormented young man to something approaching middle age's hard-won wisdom. The whole story is filtered through his eyes; significant parts deal not at all or only tangentially with Stark, and Burden's narrative goes on well after Stark has faded. Burden is a sort of Everyman, experiencing the alienation, doubt, and despair at the twentieth century human condition's heart. This is a profoundly existentialist work; much thought and history central to the era and earlier pass through it in thought-provoking and highly emotional ways. Warren also uses these concerns to speculate on things as varied as history's role, epistemology, and metaphysics. Simply put, there is something for everyone, and Warren's ability to plausibly put it all in what is ostensibly only a Southern political novel is truly remarkable.    No one interested in American writing can be without this. Hardly anything else Warren wrote is now read, especially not his fiction, but this immortal classic will keep him prominent as long as American literature is read.",2010-04-06

Willies response to the question 'What is good in society?' for example; 'Why thats an easy question Doc.You make it up as you go along!'

Then I had to read it twice to feel like I really had a grip on it. (Yeah, I was that kid.) It was worth it, though, as this is one of the most masterful novels I've ever read.<br /><br />For starters, Robert Penn Warren is great with language; it will come with no surprise that he was also a poet. Some of the passages in this book demand that you stop and admire his skill with the English language, and that's not something I do often. But his knowledge of language is complemented by a knowledge of the world: this isn't one of those dry classics full of long-winded philosophical musings or descriptions of trees (although the former at least is present), but a fascinating story in its own right. It centers on Jack Burden, the right-hand man to governor Willie Stark, who is based on a 1930's governor of Louisiana, Huey Long. There is a fair bit about politics here, with the focus on demagoguery and the corrupting influence of power much more so than specific political issues. But that is balanced by the story of Jack's life, jumping backward and forward in time; to me that enhances the story rather than confusing it, but I won't deny that this novel requires a great deal of concentration.<br /><br />The characterization is excellent, and Warren's depiction of human relationships is nothing if not intense.

In the movie, his name is Willie Stark, which, in fact, was a name tossed around by Warren and his editors before the novel was published -- according to the Editorial Afterward, which is pretty informative.  \\""Stark\\"" is a better name than \\""Talos,\\"" I think.  It's vaguely German (it means \\""strong\\"") and in 1946 that automatically suggested authoritarianism.  But Warren opted for the name of a monster ripped off from Spenser's Faerie Queen.  Okay.<br /><br />It's not the names or the story that I found difficult; it's Warren's prose style.  I'd describe it as \\""wordy.\\""  Sometimes one simile won't do if another can be squeezed in.  And metaphors abound, sometimes spelling out things we can already guess.  \\""[Willie] just sat there, not moving and with his face quiet and pure, but you had the feling that if you listened close enough you would hear the feet tromping inside his head, that something was locked up in there and going back and forth.  Then he said soberly:  \\""Yeah, I know that's what some folks say.\\""  Faulkner in his later work, and Thomas Wolfe, had the same problem.<br /><br />And if I didn't know better, I'd think at times that his style was influenced by nobody less than Raymond Chandler.  Oh, Jack Burden is supposed to be a cynic and all that, but, really.  Anne Stanton is ranting almost incoherently.  Burden quiets her down but it's only for a moment.  \\""And she was off again on the jabber.  I gave her a good shaking.  'Stop it,' I commanded, 'stop it or I'll shake your teeth out.'\\""<br /><br />Burden is more given to introspection than Chandler's Philip Marlowe, but his musings don't always make sense -- not to me anyway.  Throughout the novel, a question recurs:  Does good come out of bad?  How about the other way around?  What does it mean?  Does it mean we can invade totalitarian nations in order to build a democracy there?  In the end, I was able to grasp what came across as the major lesson to be learned.  Willie Stark may do all sorts of immoral things.  He's not just careless about the law and about the feelings of others.  He's positively reckless.  But Adam Stanton, who murders him, is way too good for his own good -- a surgeon who lives in a cramped and dingy apartment and is a workaholic.  Both Willie and Adam are undone by their excess.  (It's a kind of Buddhist message.)<br /><br />The wordiness of the novel wouldn't be so tiresome if Warren the poet had kept his apperceptive apparatus keen, but he seems to nod off once in a while.  A tennis ball simply doesn't \\""flash\\"" in the sunlight.  A large room full of old law books doesn't \\""smell like old cheese.\\""  And the low sun at the end of summer isn't lemon yellow.  It's more likely to be a dull gold after passing through the pollen and dust of the season.<br /><br />Oh, well.  I finished it and was satisfied with the way it was wrapped up, but was left with a sense of disappointment.

TALOS?!?  Yes, I get the classical allusion, but that doesn't mean it's not a terrible name for the character.  He's supposed to be a hardscrabble, down-and-dirty American politician, and you're giving him a highfalutin, European-sounding name like \\""Talos?\\""  As opposed to the perfectly-fitting Stark?  This egregious miscalculation makes me seriously doubt Polk's judgment on all matters relating to this novel.  I stuck with the original.    And the original is enough.  Because really, people.  This novel is badly overwritten as IS.  Almost grotesquely so in parts.  Do we truly need MORE of this?  Warren is very much given to investing events and characters with baroque, pointlessly elaborate verbal curlicues that quickly collapse under their own weight and only serve to gum up the novel and remove whatever narrative momentum it might have had.    The opening is a great example of this: two and a half densely-packed pages describing the highway on which the protagonists are driving.  What does this do?  Does it contribute to the plot?  Does it add any sort of meaningful atmosphere to the proceedings?  No and no.  And it certainly is not sufficiently arresting on its own terms to make up for that.  It's empty, self-indulgent fluff.  All that it does is demonstrate that Warren is truly madly deeply in love with the sound of his own voice.  And if we weren't convinced, he demonstrates it again.  And again.  And BANG.      This isn't a political novel.  Don't let anyone tell you it is.  Everyone always identifies Willie Stark as the central figure--presumably because otherwise, it would be hard to nail it down as being about much of anything--but he is very much a secondary character; we only get a very sketchy idea of who he is or what his appeal to his constituents is, and his corruption, such as it is, is so laughably picayune that you barely raise an eyebrow.  The mechanics of power are barely explored.  \\""The rise and fall of an American dictator!\\"" my copy breathlessly proclaims on the cover.  Yeah, not so much.  There are the seeds of something interesting here, but they never grow into anything.    No, this is about the narrator, Jack Burden.  Forget Willie; forget all the other characters--none of them are more than half-formed; it's a stretch to even call them \\""characters.\\""  This is All Jack All The Time.  Which means an awful lot of windy philosophizing about morality and duty and history, none of which amounts to much of anything.  A deep psychological exploration this is not.    The fact that no one else is defined in any real way also means no one to care about and no drama either.  There is a murder.  It's meant to be the novel's climax.  It's not climactic, because all the people involved are just shadowy puppets.  Nothing they do matters or signifies.    I do admit that I was caught up on occasion.  I liked the Cass Mastern story, and I liked the Judge Irwin plot.  But then, oh lord, I had to slog through the Ballad of Jack and Anne.  I think I'm at least as romantic as the next man, but I defy anyone to claim with a straight face that this long digression is in any way affecting.  It's not.  Anne's not a character (did I mention that there's a fair bit of misogyny here?), and Jack's not an interesting one.  Overall, the interesting-to-mind-numbing ratio here is distressingly low.    I see that most of the negative reviews for the book on this site seem to come from apathetic high school kids.  My normal inclination is to mock such people, but in this case, I have to admit, the apathetic high school kids kinda have a point.  It was painful enough for me, a graduate student who's used to this stuff, to get through--you're gonna force it on teenagers who have no interest in literature?

This American classic and Pulitzer winner is wonderful and absolutely worth reading if you like your books to have depth and girth and that they be truly literary instead of merely entertaining for the plane ride, the beach, et al. Nothing wrong with that, if you do. But be warned: it is, even, I dare say, for its time, way overwritten and the writer's writing, the literary pyrotechnics, stands out in front of the story, often burying it in its spent ordinance and soot.     Yes, Warren's a literal poet, and there are jaw-dropping turns of phrase on nearly every page. The reason I give a 4 and not a 5 is because it is turgid, overwritten, overwrought and purple as hell. There's too much time spent in Jack's head reflecting, thinking and philosophizing for my taste. But these are gorgeous flaws and, in the end, I found the writing too good to worry about the fact that there's too much of it. Also, the novel-within-the-novel regarding Cass Mastern was not needed and really dragged the already slagging story to a halt. The book did not need that background, per se, but it is what it is. It ain't a breathless thriller. It's hundreds of thousands of words of shimmering prose. Tap in and drink it with relish. They just don't make them like this anymore. Why?

At this level, ATKM is a carefully wrought story, more about the tyranny of the past than the bare knuckled compromises of politics, with the character Sadie Burke contrasting with Anne Stanton, Willie Stark contrasting with Adam Stanton and Tiny Duffy, Jack Burden contrasting with Sugar Boy, and so on. But while all of these characters are fully realized, they are also somewhat predictable. It is for this reason that ATKM seems like a melodrama; once you get the characters, their stories fail to surprise.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this novel is well worth reading, primarily because of Robert Penn Warren's fabulous style. I'm no expert. But most authors I read seem to use metaphors and similes to create a quick burst of insight or beauty. Yes, Updike, Chabon, McEwan and maybe a few others create occasional passages of descriptive writing with multiple elements that fit together in amazing extended metaphors. But Warren does this repeatedly, taking an idea and exploring it for 100 words or more. This, in my opinion, explains why ATKM has lasted: much of the novel is very fine poetic prose. Here's one example:<br /><br />\\""In the morning it had stopped raining and there was the sun. I went out and saw the thin pools of water standing on the black ground, like sheets of isinglass. Around the japonicas, the white and red and coral petals, which had been shattered from the blossoms, floated on the blackly gleaming pools.

As a newspaperman he had the opportunity to follow the early political campaign of the idealistic Willie Stark, a farm boy who thought he could make a difference and agreed to run when some powerful men asked him.    Little did Willie know that he was a stooge set up to split the vote and guarantee a win to his opponent.  Little did he know that nobody was listening to his earnest, figure-ridden speeches about how he would make the country a better place.  Jack was there to help pick up the pieces when Willie finally found out what was going on, and he was there to witness Willie's rebirth as a fighter, who promised to come back to campaign on his own for the next election.    Years later Jack is no longer in journalism.  Instead, he is Willie's right-hand man.  He is the one who keeps track of the things Governor Willie Stark needs to get done.  He is the one who digs up dirt on friends and opponents and puts pressure where pressure is needed.  He is essential to the smooth running of Willie's personal and political life, and he is much reviled by many people for his role in the government.      In Jack's mind, though, Willie is a better politician than most.  There is some corruption within his organization, but there is also much more good being accomplished than in past governments.  Jack defends to his friends and himself that such good should and does overshadow the dark parts of his boss.  As this book progresses, we are able to see how decent and moral people can be sucked into a somewhat immoral life, and how those who are immoral to begin with can find places to sneak into an ethical man's world.    I really liked watching the evolution of all of the characters in this book, and the changing relationships among them.  It was interesting to puzzle through Willie's change from idealistic young man to hardened womanizer, or Jack's change from slacker student to dedicated blackmailer.

(Yes he is based on Huey Long, Governor of Louisianna and populist and corupt demagogue)  But Jack Burden, ahhhh Jackie Bird.  There is a dark horse!   Jack comes from privilege, he grew up with the children of a former governor.  He has every advantage, breeding, money, brains, talent and yet he is a rootless soul with no goals.  Then he meets Willie, and despite all of his family and friends horror at Jack's working for such a corrupt and crude politician, Jack perserves.      The end, when he compares his two friends, Adam Staunton and Willie Stark is the first and only time he uses the word friend to describe Willie.  Usually he refers to him as the \\""Boss\\"".  This is a key part of what motivates Jack.      Beyond the character studies of Jack and Willie, this is plain and simple a good story.  It is one that you will devour and will keep you fascinated until the end.  The revelations about Jack's life, the inevitable clashing of the two worlds (Jack's upperclass family/history and the world of Willie Stark) and the sense of place, the south in the 1930s makes for absorbed reading.  I highly recommend this book.  It is worth your time.",2007-06-26

In fact, it's so engrossing that I've started taking it to bed to listen to the way I used to sit up and read in bed. The long sentences are pure poetry, once you just relax and listen.

Many of the points about the character of Willie Stark as portrayed on the screen apply to the book, especially the Crawford portrayal. However, the book gets much more into the grit of what ails Willie and his seemingly endless quest for power and control-when he actually gets his hands on it. Every class and personal resentment seems to come to the fore. An amazing piece of writing. As noted below, the Sean Penn version is a little closer to Warren's intent in that the narrator/ reporter Jack Burden is the real 'anti-hero'of the piece. Why?  He gives legitimacy to Willie's efforts in quarters where Willie cannot go-the old Southern aristoracy that scorned the 'hicks'.     I might also add that one can benefit from a careful reading of this book as a quasi-historical document of what stump-style politics looked like up close and personal- a type of politics that has practically vanished  from the American political scene in the age of mass media and 24/7 'talking heads'. Today, one probably could not get elected to town selectmen with old Willie's style, but such is life.           I have seen both film versions of Robert Penn Warren's classic tale of the rise and fall of a `populist' corrupted politician, Willie Stark, based at least loosely on the political career of 1930's Louisiana Governor Huey Long. America has had no shortage of such politicians who have allegedly championed the cause of the `little people' in their rise to power while on the side lining their pockets and the pockets of their friends. The late Governor of Alabama George  Wallace comes to mind as a more modern example but there have been others, some who did not bother to champion the cause of `little people' or anyone else, for that matter.     The question before us, however, is who is the real Willie Stark. Since the story line is fairly simple and familiar from a glance at today's newspapers or a look at the political landscape it is the believability of the performances in the films that counts here. Broderick Crawford played in the original black and white film version and won an Academy Award for his performance by acting as a initially naïve country bumpkin with a thirst for power to do `good' who is corrupted by power as he goes about the business of governance. Seemingly, all his baser instincts come into play and there is an almost fatalistic sense that he is in for a big fall. Sean Penn in the more recent version seems to be more world-weary about the political process and cynical about what he can do for the `people' and himself when in power. Of the two, Crawford just seems to be more comfortable in his interpretation of the role. Moreover, in the recent version the narrator's story, that of a troubled alcoholic former news reporter hired by Stark as his smooth-tongued flak, takes top-billing and that diminishes Stark's role in all the shenanigans. For my money, although Penn's performance may appeal to today's more politician-averse audience, Crawford wins this duel. View both films and you decide.",2007-04-18

Although I could appreciate the flashes of genius and the beautiful passages which populate the book, I got lost in the weeds of the characters and politics and eventually gave it up as hopeless.<br /><br />I picked it up again this year after reading and enjoying some poetry by Warren. I had the idea that I might be better able to appreciate the book now that I was older. The idea was a good one, as it happens. Either my patience has increased, or I understand the characters better now, or something. In any case, the book really spoke to me this time around.<br /><br />You can find a lot of information about the political side of the novel-- the comparisons between Willie Stark and Huey Long are many and well documented. I have to confess that I was more interested in the intersection between the personal and the political than in the probable historical parallels. There is something really nice about Willie Stark's fall from idealism as highlighted by Jack Burden's simultaneously cynical and romantic narration. Dressed up as a political novel, All The King's Men somehow manages to put the focus squarely on the people involved.<br /><br />Warren is a poet writing prose. This is worth bearing in mind when you pick up the book. The digressions into the thought or the moment are many. Although generally very beautiful, it can often be quite tricky to follow the thread of the plot. If you bear in mind that the digressions are as important as the point, I believe that you will struggle with it a lot less. Nobody will ever accuse the novel of being terse. It is very big and often windy, in the best and grandest possible fashion.<br /><br />I would recommend the book to nearly everybody.

Jack's duties include gathering weapons for use against those enemies, like biblical David before him, by gathering stones with which to fell the Goliaths of a more genteel, if scarcely less corrupt, plutocracy who formerly ran the state.  But it is not the stones themselves that Jack gathers but rather the creepy crawlies living underneath the stones unearthed that will eventually allow Jack to be so successful that tragedy will ensue for all, good and evil alike.    This theme of raking through the muck of bygone days resonates with me as I first read this book as a youth some forty years ago and as I reread it I see my childhood and this book in a different light.  But as I understand more of this book than I did upon first reading, I fear that one need not delve so deeply into the past to see the relevance of this book today and into the future.  Although inspired by Louisiana's Governor Huey Long, one need not look to the thirties to see the type.  Stark rather resembles a certain Arkansas governor of recent vintage whose wife, like Stark, attempted to redeem the family of its sins by providing free health care to the less fortunate.  One need not squint too hard to see in Anne Stanton, that paragon of female nobility whose virtue could not survive an encounter with Willie Stark, the National Organization of Women who were only too willing to overlook the sexual improprieties, lies and corruption of their Willie Stark if only he pretended to respect them in the morning.  Why, even the senator from Massachusetts may be glimpsed as Tom Stark drunkenly drives into a culvert ruining the life of a young lady companion with no consequence to himself, although admittedlyTom had the foresight to avoid plunging the car into water.  Huey Long promised to raise Louisiana up out of the muck but mired it in corruption just as Willie Stark promised to raise a Louisiana-like state only to see it sunk into corruption.  Now we see the results of an additional seventy years of Democratic good old boy (and girl) corruption in Louisiana as it struggles to blame others for its failures of government to the detriment of the very people in pretends to help but, in fact, victimizes.    So off we go into the future as the citizens of Louisiana and elsewhere continue to not only accept but to positively demand a snake oil salesman, well acquainted with his wares due to close family relations, to lead them into the promised land.

My words cannot begin to describe just how good it is, but I shall try... <br /> <br />This book is primarily sold as a political novel.  I think this is somewhat of an inaccurate pitch, because while Willie Stark is certainly a politician,and the book's real main character, Jack Burden, is one of stark's pundits, to limit ATKM to the political realm does it a disservice.  This book is truly about so much more than politics.  Sure, one of the main themes of this book is how politics are present in nearly every aspect of our lives, but this book is also about ideas, the ties that bind, the search for self, the human condition at its best and at its worst, the driving force of passion, and the intricacies of morality.  It has romance, mystery, scandal, suicide, murder, and some fairly awesome speeches.   <br /> <br />Sound dense?  It is.  At nearly 700 pages, ATKM is a true epic, but not one word of it is superfluous.  Warren deftly spins multiple storylines into an intricately tangled web.

He selects and arranges his words so that you feel the full force of their meaning as it resonates within you.

But first I'll say that I enjoyed the story and Warren's punchy writing style.<br /><br />My disappointment stems from the buildup to the book. So many people say that it is a great book, a true landmark realistic examination of political idealism turned to corruption. It's also supposed to be loosely based on Huey Long. But there is precious little in this story about Willie Stark, a.k.a. Huey Long; it's much more about the intellectually cynical Jack Burden, an assistent to Stark, essentially a nobody and someone I don't care about. Jack is a \\""truth-seeker\\"" for Stark; majoring in history at college helped develop his skills at digging up dirt on the people that Stark wants to manipulate. But other than getting paid a good salary, it's unclear why Jack seems to feel such loyalty and devotion to Stark. Perhaps he was mesmerized by Stark's powerful personality like the others?<br /><br />The character of Jack offers up a non-standard version of morality. Jack feels no ethical qualms about digging up dirt on people at the bidding of his employer, Governor Stark, because truth is the highest morality. But if the \\""truth\\"" is used for untruthful ends, shouldn't that compromise Jack's purported integrity? Jack never seems to ask that question.<br /><br />Not only do we never get to see Stark, the young idealist, we never get a good look at the corrupted Stark. Through Jack we learn that Stark occasionally uses bribery or blackmail. We never see Stark as a complete person, on the one hand as an effective, energetic, charismatic, get-things-done leader, and on the other hand as a heavy-handed, hardball-playing politician who bends the law and pushes up against constitutional restrictions.

The book was a revelation.  It's astonishingly good - a great American novel - but not for the reasons I remembered.  If asked, most people would say All the King's Men is about the rise and fall of Willie Stark, a country lawyer who becomes the near-dictatorial governor of a poor southern state.  Willie's story is based fairly closely on the life of Huey Long, the populist governor of Louisiana during the Depression.  Willie is certainly a central character in the story.  In fact, his attempts to bring economic justice to the poor people of his state through the imperfect vehicle of a corrupt legislature have led many critics to call All the King's Men the best novel ever written about American politics.<br /><br />But Willie's career is chronicled by Jack Burden, and ultimately this is not Willie's story, it's Jack's.  Born into privilege, Jack rejects his upper-class background and goes to work for Willie because he believes Willie is trying to do good for the people who have been kept down by Jack's ancestors and childhood associates.  Jack accepts that the means to Willie's ends aren't always pretty or pure.  As Willie's right hand man, Jack spends a lot of time digging up the dirt that Willie uses to bury his political opponents.  During the course of the novel, some of this dirt spatters on Jack in direct and very painful ways.<br /><br />What make the novel astonishing are the workings of Jack's consciousness and the prose that Warren uses to describe that consciousness.  Jack is a classic American type, the cynical idealist.  Jack thinks he can remove himself from his own history, only to find himself lacking the optimism and conviction he needs to fully inhabit the present.  The real struggle in the novel is not Willie's attempt to soar above gutter politics, but Jack's effort to know and accept his own heart.<br /><br />Jack is both a romantic and a wise guy, and Warren's supple vernacular captures the full range of his expression, from soaring perorations on the moral confusion of Southern history to crude jibes at hack politicos.  Jack's insights about the haphazard constructs we assemble into a self are forward looking for 1940s when this novel was written, and give this Depression era story a curiously postmodern feel.  Beyond the tragic and almost gothic machinations of its plot, this novel reveals some fundamental truths about the American character.  Americans are a strange blend of idealism and cynical opportunism.  We're born to believe we can flee our past, right up to the point we run out of land and run out of excuses.

I don't know why I waited so long to read it.  It is high quality fiction, written in an era when important novels were taken seriously.  There is an air of asseveration that pervades the work- it seems understood that this tract will not be taken lightly. I'll not provide a general review; rather, here are a few unexpected points of interest.    The novel provides a good balance between action and mental reflection.  Jack Burden, the prime political hatchet-man for Gov. Willie Stark, is the first person narrator.  He has a good fix on what is happening to him, his friends and family.  He can observe and articulate every gesture and nuance.  He is his own psychiatrist.  However, his ability to understand his condition also loses him respect in the reader's eyes.  Burden does his job well, but his lack of heart and passion destroys his intimacy with the reader.  The mayhem he unleashes hardly costs him a night's sleep. After it is revealed that he is complicit in patricide, I lost all respect for him.  He held neither loyalty to his clan nor to an ideal.  He was just a mercenary with a flair for reportage.  From that point, the book was less enjoyable for me.  I want my narrators to have at least one redeeming grace.    I would have been pleased if the editor had culled 100 pages.  The early relationship between Jack and Anne seems tedious, but perhaps in the 1940s it was hot stuff.  I did enjoy the examination of Jack's Civil War ancestor- his perfidy is a harbinger of Jack's some 70 years later.  I am curious as to how closely the novel tracks Gov. Long of Louisiana.  It seems that Long was charged with improprieties that the fictional Judge Irwin shot himself over.  I wish new editions would address the obvious similarities in a preface.    The interrelationships between the characters is masterfully designed- it's Southern Gothic at its best.  I don't think the most astute reader will predict all the subtilties.  However, much of the prose is very mediocre- not what I'd expect from a poet.  Of course, there are memorable paragraphs and scintillating lines.  Here's one example from Gov.

It is a piece of junk unjustly cadged together with manuscript fragments that one of America's greatest writers never wrote in this form. Despite decades to do so, in a life of over 90 years. A very careful,writer, scholar, and teacher too. This edition is a gratuitous insult to his memory and a dangerous precedent in American letters. The public should not countenance it. It doesn't matter if one paragraph or one sentence only is changed. Indeed one single word can change a whole book, as the recent restoration of Ulysees has proven. But that was justified because of: (1) an copyist's error that persisted for decades; (2) poor Joyce was blind. No such excuse exists here for putting in words that Robert Penn Warren cut out. Any writer knows that cutting is as important as writing. And certainly do not believe the ridiculous lie about the editor supposedly goofing with Warren's intention. For one thing, that was a conversation with a live man, who agreed and thereafter forever let it stand. And who certainly (several Pulitzers and every other literary award this country has to offer) eventually possessed the clout to \\""fix it\\"" if he wanted to. Truth be told, this lie can be used to alter just about any book published in the last 200 years -- and so much easier after you die.

It ranks up there with Mark Twain, Herman Melville, Harper Lee, Truman Capote and all of the other greats. \\""All the King's Men\\"" is a quintessentially American tale of politics, greed, corruption, idealism, friendship, betrayal, family, and just a touch of romance (but not too much -- this is, after all, a very masculine-centered novel). It is a sprawling tale of the political career of Willie Stark and his journey from the innocent do-gooder \\""Cousin Willie\\"" to the jaded, corrupt \\""Boss\\"" who governs the state of Louisiana with an iron fist. After a failed bid for governor where the idealistic young Stark is used as a pawn by one of the other candidates to siphon votes away from his competitor, Stark is crushed and left feeling like a sap. But he comes back and runs again with a new political attitude -- determined that if winning means playing the game that from now on he will outplay everyone else. And he does it, too, maneuvering and bribing and blackmailing his way to the top like a well oiled machine. When he sets his eyes on the Senate, however, his odyssey begins to spin into tragedy. His transformation is narrated by Jack Burden, a reporter who first met Stark when he was toiling thanklessly as county treasurer and later gets a job in his administration at the capital. Burden was, perhaps, once an idealist too but now stumbles cynically through life all too aware of the foibles inherent to human beings (his name, Burden, is quite apt for this position in which he must live). His struggle asks some meaty philosophical questions (can good exist without evil? Is it necessary to do bad things in order to have a good outcome, and is such a thing possible? and more) and thankfully doesn't get too bogged down moralizing the reader (although Warren does dangerously toe the line in a few parts). Reading this book was unique for me because I found myself unable to read it without a pen in hand so I could underline passages and write notes and reactions in the margins of the pages -- agreeing and disagreeing with what was being said. That was great fun, and it was a thrill to feel so involved in a book to be doing that. I do have a few minor complaints, however. I thought that Warren's chronology was slightly jarring as it went back and forth through time and took long detours to get to the point, but since those detours were usually filled with some meaty themes of their own I can forgive them. I thought that Warren's proclivity for repetition got annoying by the end of the book (hitting it zenith when Anne Stanton proclaimed in one flashback \\""Oh, Jackie, Jackie, it's a wonderful night, it's a wonderful night, it's a wonderful night, say it's a wonderful night, Jackie-boy, say it, say it!\\"" on page 425), but since this is only really present in the dialogue -- and mostly in Anne's dialogue at that -- I can forgive this too. I also took offense to Warren's portrayal of women as either manipulative or wishy-washy but always responsible for the downfalls or travails of men. That's a tough one to get by, but since he can be equally critical of men for their own corruptions and failings I guess I won't let it bother me too much. It's very much a product of the time it was written and of the setting it depicts, and you can't necessarily fault it for that. At any rate, on the whole I would definitely recommend this classic.

Jack, a journalist by profession, becomes Willie's friend and righthand man despite their markedly different backgrounds.  Willie is a self-described hick, while Jack was born of wealth and breeding. <br />All the King's Men is about Jack and the complex relationship he has, not just with Willie, but with his parents, his friends, his childhood sweetheart as well as other political operatives.  There is also a fair amount of text devoted to one of Jack's great uncles, a deeply troubled man who died fighting for the Confederacy decades before Jack was ever born. <br />Artfully written using a very detailed and evocative brand of descriptive prose, this engaging novel succeeds in conveying a number of interesting messages.  Prominent among these messages is the idea that mankind is corrupt by nature.

Now having done so (and still not seen the film), I cannot imagine how it would be possible to translate any but the broadest outline of this subtle masterpiece into cinematic terms.<br /><br />For one thing, how could one capture Robert Penn Warren's superb style? Not for nothing was he to be made the first American Poet Laureate; the story is enfolded in broad tracts of rich Southern prose-poetry, capturing the climate, the country, and the lives of the ordinary people who dwell in it. For example, consider this paragraph on page 33:<br /><br />  \\""It looked like those farmhouses you ride by in the country in the middle of the afternoon, with the chickens under the trees and the dog asleep, and you know the only person in the house is the woman who has finished washing up the dishes and has swept the kitchen and has gone upstairs to lie down for half an hour and has pulled off her dress and kicked off her shoes and is lying there on her back on the bed in the shadowy room with her eyes closed and a strand of her hair still matted down on her forehead with the perspiration. She listens to the flies cruising around the room, then she listens to your motor getting big out on the road, then it shrinks off into the distance and she listens to the flies. That was the kind of house it was.\\""<br /><br />I quote this in full partly so that readers may get a sense of the riches that are in store: a style that is leisurely and expansive while remaining utterly straightforward. I quote it also because, like so many descriptions in the book, it captures a place in terms of the people who inhabit it, with a feeling for the rhythm and values of their lives. In that this is a political book at all, the charismatic politician at its center, the populist Willie Stark (loosely based on Louisiana's Huey Long), first derives his strength from just such a grassroots understanding of the ordinary people he represents.<br /><br />But I question whether ALL THE KING'S MEN is a political book, at least in the sense that the movie trailer appears to be marketing it. When the novel opens, Willie Stark is already the Governor of his state, and even in flashbacks there are very few scenes of him campaigning or working up crowds with his oratory. Similarily, although we see him quietly collecting information with which to dissuade his foes or manipulate his allies, any graft or corruption remains mostly beneath the surface, and Stark's descent into demagoguery is nothing compared to what was going on at the same period (the thirties) in Germany or Italy. Warren does paint a very clear picture of old-style machine politics, with Stark at the center of his web, surrounded by a small circle of \\""the boys.\\"" But very little of the drama is played out in the public arena, but rather in the lives and loyalties of a small group of childhood friends from moneyed backgrounds quite different from Stark's own, who nonetheless get drawn into his orbit.<br /><br />Chief among these is the narrator, Jack Burden, who gradually emerges as the principal character in the novel. I quote the passage of description above because it demonstrates Jack's voyeurism. Not only does he see a farmhouse and imagine the woman inside it, but he also writes a little story about her. This characteristic continues throughout the book; Jack's imagined stories are plausible, for he is very perceptive, but they are all things that he sets in motion and watches from the outside. A failed PhD student of history, he first encounters Willie Stark while covering him as a newspaper reporter, and his objective viewpoint, his insight, and his talent for uncovering facts make him very useful to the rising politician.<br /><br />While Jack remains outside the political machine, fascinated but aloof, Willie Stark gradually invades Jack's own circle from his childhood home at Burden's Landing. Chief among these are Adam and Anne Stanton, the children of a former Governor, and Judge Irwin, who served as a moral guidepost and second father to Jack. Before even the first chapter is out, you know that Jack's personal allegiances will be tested. You gradually realize that because Jack is a watcher and not a doer he will fail these tests in many respects, though not utterly.<br /><br />In the end, this book is about Jack's journey to self-knowledge. Willie Stark's story continues to propel the plot, but he fades into the background as a force, remaining more as a touchstone for all that Jack is and is not. In movie terms, the part requires a star performer, but it is not a starring role. Jack, by contrast, is central though anything but a star. His story would be hard to realize on the screen because so much of it is internal: a moral journey played out in memories, long (sometimes overlong) paragraphs of meditation, and occasional episodes of action, brief but brilliantly realized. A true cinematic adaptation of this book would concentrate almost entirely on personal relationships. It might have elements of romance, but it would be neither an action movie nor a thriller. It would be political only in the sense that politics highlights the question of how good intentions may lead to evil ends, and bad means may be necessary to acheive good results.

But it is my story too.""","Power and corruption go hand in hand in Warren's literary gem, set at the zenith of nineteen-thirty's Louisiana state politics. Mirroring the life of the infamous Huey Long, the novel's Willie Stark is ostensibly and outrageously a man of the people, shunning pretensions while appealing to the common man, capturing the attention of a mass audience, speaking in language they can relate to. While Stark cuts his political teeth on the betrayals of the wealthy and powerful, he quickly adapts to the tricks of the trade, a master manipulator and a quick study. Bred of poverty in a nation defined by the Great Depression, Stark is that rare genius who can take the public's pulse while seducing the powerbrokers, out-dealing their schemes with his own instinctive prowess.<br /><br />In a parallel story, Jack Burden shadows Stark's progress, doing the dirty work to maintain Stark's iron-fisted control of Louisiana government, the Governor with an eye to the state senate. An equally complex character, Jack hails from a well-connected family that hides its dysfunction behind the refinements of wealth, often the \\""Boss's\\"" convenient pawn (Stark is never one to waste the talents of those in his employ). Burden comes of age under Stark's tutelage, eventually pushed beyond endurance by the duplicity of his position, especially when forced to confront a long-time family friend with the secrets of the past. Hurtling towards a confrontation of epic proportions, Willie Stark has a date with fate; his attitude subtly altered by recent events, Jack watches dispassionately, clinging to the threads of his tattered integrity, all but physically removed from the once-consuming relationship, a fitting end to a reign of excess and hubris, reality the great leveler.<br /><br />Filled with larger-than-life personalities, the novel exposes the coarse underbelly of state politics, the natural corruption of power and those whose lives are destroyed by the voracious appetite of Stark's ambition. Timeless, filled with the inherent contradictions of the democratic process, the author's scathing indictment of Louisiana politics is a harsh reminder that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Peppered with tragedy and excess, All the King's Men is as relevant today as in its heyday, a compelling contrast of two personalities, Burden stepping aside as the wily politician self-destructs, trapped in a web of his own making.

The first thing a movie script takes away from a novel is the reader's thrill of discovery, of apprehending the psychological detail which fuels characters' motivations.

You could look down the bay, beyond the cove, toward the Gulf, and see the water lifting up into the light as though the horizon had ceased to exist.\\"" <br /> <br />People who go to the film before the novel will have the pleasure of looking at Jude Law as Jack Burden, but if you skip the novel you will miss the self-education of a man, the training of a sentient being.  The novel could have been titled, The Education of Jack Burden, since Burden is the narrator and it is through his consciousness that we experience Willie Stark, a.k.a. Willie Talos. <br /> <br />",2006-07-22

In some ways, the book traces the trajectory of Willie from idealistic country boy to The Boss, but Jack is so present in his account of events and so in control of the narrative flow that it ends up being Jack's story well more than Willie's. And Jack's story is bleak. There are light moments, but they seem pale and washed out compared to the depth of the wounds that Jack, and ultimately all the central characters, carry.    The book is beautifully written, slow, lush, and incredibly rich. The first few pages are among the best openings I've ever read. There are places where it's hard to see where the story is going (including a strange interlude set during the Civil War), but there isn't a lot that seems careless. Warren is a meticulous writer. Although it's hardly a political thriller or a romance, both of these elements peek through in the last half of the book, where the writing thins out a little and the story really takes hold.    As a note of caution: Warren doesn't shy away from some pretty offensive depictions of both African Americans and women. It's an old boys club in the novel, and Jack's first person narrative is deep in the thick of it. My take is that this is less about who Warren is as a writer than it is about who Jack is as a deeply flawed protagonist, but some passages were hard for me to swallow even then.    This is a book to read very slowly, undistracted, in small doses. One of those books that you can flip open to any page after you're done, and see a dozen layers and nuances you missed the first time through.",2006-07-16

Warren's novel is the story of a political strongman, Governor Willie Talos (known as Stark in most editions of the novel).  It describes his rise, the political machinations of his tenure and his ultimate downfall.  Much of this makes for entertaining and salacious gossip for those attracted to the stories of backroom, tactical politicking.  It is especially interesting to see how Willie was before his success: a too-smart, earnest crusader for the mythical 'little man'.  There is certainly a kind of political statement in this novel and Warren pits Willie's demagoguery against Whiggish Republicanism in a famous dinner scene near the middle of the book. <br /> <br />My problem is with the narrator, Jim Burden.  Warren spends some time on his backstory and relates it to the Willie political story through the figure of the judge.  While he makes sense in the Burdens' Landing setting, Burden himself is lost in the political story.  I could understand why he *might* stray from his roots to support Willie, but the novel does not focus enough on this aspect of the story.  It is a timeless theme, of course, and Warren might have developed this angle more.  Instead, the real father background to Burden just comes across as a randomly assigning a debased aspect to his genealogy.   <br /> <br />The edition is nice and Noel Polk does a nice job in the afterward and it is interesting to see the removed beginning to the first chapter.",2005-10-26

The relationships Jack Burden has with his boss, his father, his best friend, and his best friend's sister will surely ring true with many a reader.

But I finally got around to picking this up a month ago, and I have to say it is a fantastic example of the great American Novel.<br /><br />Based on the life and career of Huey Long (governor of Louisiana and major rival to FDR for the presidency before his death), the tale of Willie Stark is one of a good man corrupted by the very political machine that he needed to enact his reforms. We first meet Willie in the full swing of his corruption, but vingettes to the past reveal how innocent and truthful he was back in the beginning. The story is told through the eyes of Jack Burden, Stark's righthand man who does what he's told no matter what. He has a mind of his own, but he sees Stark as a man who can affect positive change. But Stark's own corrupted nature renders that impossible, and everything he touches (including Burden and his family) turns to dust.<br /><br />Robert Penn Warren's book does have some faults: some might want more of Stark's story than is provided, and the Cass Mastern detour is interesting only in retrospect (at the time you're reading it, I challenge you not to count how many pages are left before the chapter is over).<br /><br />There are no real heroes in the piece, simply men and women caught up in the fury of Willie Stark and his desire for glory, and everyone comes to an unfortunate end through contact with him. Jack emerges as complicated and unsure of his own function within the Stark machinery, and Adam Stanton's descent towards his final actions (echoing the real-life assassination of Long by Carl Weiss) is rendered brilliantly. Perhaps the most moving chapter is when Jack relieves his first falling in love with Anne Stanton, in the wake of revelations which force him to reevaluate that summer.<br /><br />Warren doesn't adhere strictly to the Long story: he starts the \\""present day\\"" portion of the book in 1936, well after Huey Long's death in September 1935. And Stark does not meet his end until the end of 1937, while still Governor (Huey Long had gone to the Senate in 1932 but still controlled Louisiana through his goons). Was Long simply the wellspring upon which Warren fashioned his extraordinary tale, or was there more of him in Willie Stark than Warren might have wanted?

He jumps around in time and still keeps the reader enjoying his novel.  It is truly one of the best political masterpieces of all time. Many people hate political books, but this one is interesting enough to hold anyone's attention and at the same time teach you something.  <br /> Warren based this novel on the life of Governor/Senator Huey Long from Louisiana.   Many of the occurrences in Willies life coincided with the occurrences in Huey Long's life.  This is impressive on Warren's part because it shows just how much thought and research he had to put into this novel to come up with the facts and ideas.  <br /> All The King's Men is narrated by a young and nave Jack Burden, the protagonist.  He is from a well-known family in Burden's Landing (named after his ancestors) and who believe that no one can be held accountable for what occurs because of your actions.  Throughout the novel Warren shows how Jack slowly matures while dealing with the tough lessons of life and making decisions for yourself.  An awakening occurs when his boss, Willie Talos, the governor, tells Jack to dig up dirt on Judge Irwin.  The things that he finds cause him to look back and reevaluate his own life and change his beliefs. <br /> Willie Talos's story takes place simultaneously to Jack's.  He starts off as a poor farm boy who just wants to do good for others, but is corrupted by the spotlight of fame when he becomes governor.  As he continues on his political journey the one thing that he despised most, the corruptness of politicians begins to become him.  He used his power to command others around and blackmail them into doing what he wanted.  He gains support by being projected as a common man.   <br /> These two stories are simultaneously occurring and because of this you see many similar characteristics between Jack and Willie.  They are both trying to flee their past.  Willie does not want to be theman that others took advantage of, but a strong and powerful man that no one can tell what to do.  Jack no longer wants to be the nave boy that grew up in Burden's Landing, but a man that can claim that he did something important on his own. While Jack matures through his experience, Willie has hardly any spiritual growth that occurs until it is too late.  While Willie sheds his idealism for the power politicians gain and corruptness that soon follows, Jack keeps it and continues to sees the world through completely different eyes.  Their personalities clash more than once although they work well together and keep the novel interesting.  <br /> I would highly recommend this novel to anyone.  Do not let the size (it is a long one) stop you from reading it.  It is not hard to follow and keeps your attention.  Every time you start to put it down Warren brings up a new point and you get involved again.  This is one of those books that you just cannot put down.

Of course, for a book to be considered a classic most of its reviewers have to have had a favorable opinion of the work and all a new reviewer can do is concur or disagree. In this case, I couldn't possibly agree more with previous reviewers who have written rave reviews of this book.<br /><br />This is not so much the story of Willie Stark, who was Willie Talos in the original manuscript, as it the story of Jack Burden, the man telling the story. It really seems to be the story of a young man and his road to maturity. That young man is Jack Burden and Stark seems to be just a convenient focal point around which Warren weaves his story. The plot is very well laid out and flows very well from beginning to end, which is quite an accomplishment when one considers all of the subplots to be found in this book. As Burden tells his story he often wanders down memory lane, recalling events which his story has recalled. Each subplot builds to it's own climax while also building toward the climax of the main story and the reader is swept along like a barrel on the Niagara River. Just as the reader feels as if he can put the book aside for a while, another subplot begins to ascend through the story and the reader is again swept along unable to pause.

There are several morals and messages to be drawn from this story including thoughts on good and evil and past and future. In addition to the messages though, one has to admire the incredible amount of research Warren had to have done to write this book. Warren of course was alive and well during Huey Long's reign and that had to help him but in all events described his historical accuracy is uncanny. For example, one of the subplots involves Jefferson Davis in a minor way and even in delving in things well beyond his own memories Warren laces the story with many accurate details. In one passage, Warren relates that Davis missed the steamboat that was to carry him on the first leg of his trip to Montgomery to assume the Presidency of the new Confederacy. Warren points out that the boat left Davis Landing and then was halted out in the river while a smaller boat brought the new President out to get on board.

He was the Poet Laureate of the United States and won two Pulitzer Prizes.  After a brief stay in Italy Warren wrote a drama called Proud Flesh where he deals with many issues of political power and moral corruption for that power, also in this drama Warren tried to use the ideas of Louisiana politician Huey long.  After not being satisfied with this piece of work he elaborate his drama into a novel called All the King's Men.  All the King's Men is a book about the lives of southern governor Willie Stark and his right hand man Jack Burden as the live through the depression (1930's) in an unnamed southern state.  <br />The book starts with Willie becoming a noticeable politician after he warns many people that a school building was going to collapse.  No one listens until one day the building dose collapse killing three children.  He then is chosen to run for governor but unknowns to him he is only a dummy candidate to break up the vote.  After he learns this he tells the rural people that the government only thinks of them as \\""dummies\\"" and he drops out. He eventually runs for governor and wins a few years later and wins.  Jack becomes very interested in Willie after covering Willie when Jack was a reporter and eventually Jack becomes Willies right hand man.  Along with being Willies right hand man Jack also uses his skills in research to dig up info on all of Willies enemies.  Along with this the book also focuses on Willie becoming more corrupt when he has more power.  We also see Jack's role as the moral compass in the story.  Even as Willie becomes more and more corrupted jack keeps a steady path of working toward good for the poor.  In addition we see how Jack works toward marrying his childhood sweetheart Anne.  In the end Willie is murdered after all the political corruption gets the better of him and the doctor of a under funded hospital assassinates him.  In a side note Huey Long was also assassinated but only after he went to the senate.<br />After reading both this book and many sites that offered commentaries.  I have found that this was one of the most enjoyable books that I have ever read.  Although as a critical reader I would not recommend this book to the average person.  Personally I am very interested in the inner workings of politics, the West Wing is one of my favorite shows on television.  But for people that are not as interested in politics this book may also be interesting because is dose deal a lot with personal relationship that everyone can relate to.  For example everyone has someone in their life that they view as a moral compass.  <br />In conclusion this was a great book that I would strongly recommend to people that like the workings of politics, but I would still recommend this book to everyone.

The other part of this book I liked is that it was from Jack burden's point of view, this story is from the eyes of a political aide, not from the governer. This gives it a diferent look on what was going on. Jack Burden is basically Stark's best friend,although Jack calles Adam his best friend, he is not. Adam and him are holding onto a relationship that doesn't exist anymore. It is just a memory of what they had in their youth. The age of each of these characters is different then what you may think. Jack is 41-42 years old when he is telling this story, but he is not at all mature. He doesn't understand what death means and still has a slightly perverted outlook on life. Willie Stark's age I could not figure out, but he must have been a good bit older then Jack, beacuse he calles him \\""boy\\"". This is not some thing that would happen in real life. For this to be realistic Stark must have been at least 65 years of age, which I don't belive he was. Anne Stanton was another one whose age was distorted, She is about 37-38, but Jack still thinks of her as the 17 year girl he loved. Before I figured out how old he was through dates, I thought he was maybe mid to early thirty's, I also thought that Stark was about 55 or so. In Jack's eyes he views Adam as a brother as well as a friend, but he views him as a younger brother, he refers in the book about Adam's age \\""around mine\\"", he also states that he alway's wins the verbalarguments and Adam won at sports. Adam is the stero type of the sucessful younger brother who Jack feels has everything he lacks, passion and peace. Which makes it ironic when Adam kills Willie for he doesn't seem to need to( I know that Anne was fooling around Willie, and that Adam was her brother, but it really should have been someone else.

Contrary to popular belief, the central figure here is not the well-meaning Governor who loses his way, but his hard-bitten, ex-newspaperman troubleshooter who is able to justify most any action he is asked to take.<br />Warren presents us with a riveting cast of supporting characters who represent the continuum of moral choices that we, the Body Politic, must make every waking day: The stoic politician's wife, who looks the other way; the Attorney General, who eschews power when it comes with a price; the idealist who throws himself into his profession but commits a crime to honor his sister; his sibling, somewhat isolated in a rarified social setting, choosing to do &quot;good works&quot; but succumbing to temptation; the hard-boiled female pol, for whom &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot;; and, among others, the narrator himself, Jackie Burden, for whom Moral Relativism becomes High Art.<br />This is a story not of people who rule, but of their loyal subjects, and how they drift from their original moorings and hit the shoals, with rationalizations 'a plenty. In the end, Warren may be telling us that while our elected officials are capable of being corrupted during their finite tenure in office, it is the citizenry in any democracy whose quieter, everyday choices richochet from one member of the community to another, oftentimes with unintended and far-reaching consequences - and with only so much time to repair the damage, if indeed that is possible.<br />This is masterful storytelling that forces the reader to consider what unknown ripples he himself may have created in his life.

In truth, though, the political story ultimately yields to the personal story of Jack Burden, a reporter turned right-hand man to Stark and the first-person narrator of the book.<br />Burden's vibrantly crackling, descriptive, often lyrical narrative drives the story throughout, frequently delving into the past--his own and others'--to comment upon the present and, just as frequently, infusing descriptions of events with cutting questions of philosophy and observations of human nature.  Burden's chronicles introduce a variety of utterly realistic and memorable minor characters--his ex-wife; his mother; Stark's chauffeur; a judge; the girlfriend of his youth and her brother, just to name a few--and seldom wane in intensity.<br />The one weakness I noticed was that much of the language and dialogue relies on Depression Era slang that can prove distracting and require a bit of thought to figure out.

But let me simply add my thoughts on this highly acclaimed, and deservedly so, novel. It certainly belongs on any list of great 20th century American novels. From the beautifully constructed plot to the poetic prose, the book is triumph. It tells the story of Willie Stark (Talos in the Warren original and based on the Louisiana governor, Huey Long) -- his political rise and fall, the corruption that is endemic in politics and in man, and the clash of the man of action (Stark) versus the man of the idea, represented in this book by the narrator, Jack Burden. His journey from cynic to admirer to mature observer of Stark's method and madness is in itself fascinating. But even the throw away stuff in this book is great, such as Burden's descriptions of the old men sitting on a park bench, observing the world, almost outside time, or the droll descriptions of the locals who clamor for Willie, and even the interview with the man that Burden believes might be his father, and the crisis of faith he encounters as he explores the history of a Judge he admires and knows better than even he realizes.

I wasn't prepared for such a suspenseful read, but the intrigues, shady dealings and political backstabbing make for quite a thriller.<br />It's loosely based on the career of Huey &quot;Kingfisher&quot; Long, one-time governor of Louisiana.  I didn't know anything about Long before reading this book, but it doesn't matter.  Robert Penn Warren's novel is not about Louisiana politics, but rather about American politics in general and the ease with which political figures can become god like in the eyes of their voters and just as easily fall from their lofty perches.<br />Warren uses stylized, thick prose to conjure images of the dense, sultry Southern landscape that serves as this novel's backdrop.  The swampy, tangled undergrowth mirrors the tangled machinations going on among the politicians and aides that make up the novel's motley cast of characters.  Willie Talos (Stark, depending on the edition you read), takes center stage as the larger-than-life governor, but the story really belongs to Jack Burden, right-hand man to Talos and the novel's moral center.  And Warren creates a bona-fide scene-stealing character in that of Sadie Burke, aide to Talos, who understands what it takes to make it in an environment so dominated by power-hungry men and who more than adequately holds her own.<br />This is a compulsive read.  I didn't have the luxury of being able to sit down and read the whole thing in one sitting, which is probably the best way to approach it, as there are very few ideal stopping points along the way.

Often he would go into detail of the minutest event and then make in-depth analogies. The detail was overdone though, as one might find a Dickenson novel to be, because it is always surprisingly thoughtful and insightful. The descriptions are often of small events and moments in life with striking precision For instance, There is a part where Lucy, Willie's wife, is sitting with a number of other men eating and first Warren describes her as she is \\""watching the jaws work\\"" and hen he likens her face to that of \\""the chief engineer... when he goes down to the engine room at night and the big steel throws are leaping\\"" and it's these parallels which make his writing most enjoyable. <BR>The ending is somewhat happy, though unfortunately it is filled with tragedy; the lives of all the characters intersect in some form and not always pleasant ways.

But this review is about the \\""new, corrected edition\\"" by Mr. Polk, which, I'm afraid, is a literary and scholarly travesty.  Readers will be well advised to stick with the original 1946 text.; the fact that it has been a force in American life for over 50 years, and that in the 43 years before his death Warren never gave any indication he was dissatisfied with it, should be reason enough.  (A cynic would argue that the only reason for the new edition was to extend the copyright.)  <BR>Polk went back to Warren's original typescript draft to restore many of the passages, phrases, and stylistic features that were changed or deleted in the editorial process before publication (and approved by Warren); and he claims that his editorial decisions have created a superior novel.  The first problem is that, except for a very sketchy 10-page essay, Polk gives the reader no help in judging for himself.  A respectable scholarly edition would at the least indicate, at the bottom of each page or the back of the book, each instance in which the first edition text has been changed and where the change came from (the draft was edited by several hands, including Warren's).  A reader who wants to assess Polk's work will have to have both editions in hand and scan page by page, and even then will not know whose decisions Polk has overruled.  Thus Polk puts himself beyond criticism.  <BR>Polk's essay tries to justify his decisions, but his illustrations are merely anecdotal and offer no consistent editorial principles or methodology.  I haven't the space here to go through a critique point by point; suffice it to say, I'm not convinced by any of his examples, including the reversion from Willie Stark to Willie Talos.  Polk seems to be one of those editors who believes that the closer you get to the author's very first words on paper, the better or the more authentic your version will be, sincethen you are closest to the \\""white heat of creativity.\\""  But this is one of the silliest forms of romanticism still in existence.  And I suspect it runs directly again Warren's own philosophy of history.  Polk may think he has restored history, but in fact he has falsified it, for the history was the event of publication.<BR>Polk writes: \\""Many may feel that Warren's at least tacit approval of the [original] editors' changes-indeed, his gratitude for them-should argue against a new edition.  But his `approval' may have come from fatigue, from pressures of one sort or another, from the years of constant work on it.  Indeed, his very closeness to the novel may have prevented him from exercising his own good judgment, and in any case this version indicates that he had written better than he knew.\\"" Ah, but surely Mr. Polk knows?

The reader follows Willie undergo a transformation from a young, naive, idealist politician who despises corruption into a hardened, cynical machine politician who will use any means necessary to aid his poor and disenfranchised constituents - all the while helping himself as well as the cronies of his machine.<br />But this is not entirely about Willie Stark.

Both Jack and Willie believe the paradoxical philosophy that \\""you had to make the good out of the bad because there wasn't anything else to make it out of.\\""  At the end they both undergo an epiphany of sorts as Jack starts a clean new life and rids himself of all the residue of his corruption while Willie states on his deathbed, \\""It might have been different, Jack.

An acting troupe known as \\""The King's Men\\"" have recently been accused of the murder of an Archbishop who was of course opposed religiously to plays and the King's Men's use of magic to do some rather effective impersonations of the local nobility and clergy. The King of course loves the plays, and it's the only reason the King's Men are still around. When the party of PCs ends up in the middle of a King's Men play in the Orb Theatre, the mystery begins. <br />Designed fot 7th-9th level characters, the module isn't overly long and could even be completed in one or two sessions, depending on how good the PCs are at finding clues. The mystery itself isn't that complex as there's plenty of clues to ferret out by both roleplaying or the use of skills. <br />As with the author's previous work Tsar Rising, what makes the module a good one is the characters, the attention to detail, and the opportunity for the DM to have as much fun behind the screen as the PCs do in the game. Since there's several bizzare characters involved as the players race to find those responsible for the death of Archbishop Hezekiah and exonerate the King's Men, the DM is encouraged to ham it up as best they can, and to really work to set the \\""stage\\"" as it were for this adventure. <br />There's plenty of combat for those in your party looking to get involved in a scrap or three, including several new monsters included in the module. Also there's more than ample opportunities to use roleplaying and skills to interact with the people of Hamdon and search for clues and suspects. And of course like any good murder mystery, there's plenty of good twists and turns as the PCs try to sort everything out. Also included are some new magic items, a few maps and some decent artwork, and several real groaner puns. <br />If you're looking for something a bit out of the ordinary, or a murder mystery to test your players, All the Kings Men is worth the price, for as they say, the play's the thing.",2002-08-22

The book focuses not so much on American politics and the myth of the demagogue politician but rather on one man's journey into himself into finding his place in the world. The book also provides the basis for one man's understanding of the meaning of responsibility for his actions.<br />That said, a lot of the critical focus of this novel has been placed on the character of Willie (Stark) Talos the fictional governor who starts out as a simple man of the people and evolves into a Machiavellian powerhouse who demands that the ends justify the means for all his actions. The book has been called the ultimate political novel or even a novel about the rise and fall of an American dictator. This rather general review barely scratches the surface of Penn Warrens attention.<br />In its most basic aspect, this is a novel which deals literally with one of the King's men. In this case that man is Jack Burden. Jack, for the most part, is an observer of the world around him. This is his most basic take on life. He observes and basically floats through his existence as a sort of thinking yes man for his political leader. He will do anything that his boss tells him and he will feel very little, if any responsibility for his actions. This view of life gradually changes through his interaction with Willie (Stark) Talos and the immediate circle of people around the governor. Jack through this novel grows into a responsible person.<br />I called the novel flawed in the title to this review for a few reasons. The first is the narrative style. Jack is a first person narrator and an observer of life. As such everything (and I mean everything) gets described. This has a great tendency to slow the novel almost to a crawl at some points. The flip side of this, however, is that Penn Warren creates prose that almost has the feel of a painting in its description. The novelist forces his reader to view the entire world through thenarrators eyes. There is very little direct narration and ore than a little of Warren's personal philosophy involved in reading this.<br />The second point that has been called a flaw is the placement of the Cass Mastern episode. This however is a centralpart of the novel. It is also the portion of the novel that William Faulker thought to be the best writing of the book. The episode runs nearly fifty pages and contributes nothing to the existing narrative structure. First looks however can be deceiving. This section of the novel provides a model for Burden's eventual change into a more responsible person.<br />On the whole this  was probably one of the most difficult books that I've read in quite a while. At times one wants to scream in frustration but with some patience the careful reader is left with a feeling of great accomplishment and the feeling of having read something truly great and uniquely American.",2002-06-18

Many people are turned off by a book that is ostensibly about a politician, but this book is really about how politics is fused into our lives; it is about how many of the basic activities and achievements in a town, city or country come down to the mentality of one or two individuals; and politics becomes a metaphor for something that intoxicates you to the point of becoming unable to consider the humanity that surrounds you, so that the meaning of what you are doing is disconnected from your ambition to do it. It is also a story about how all of us, as we mature, give up the things that mean so much to us emotionally as we slowly but surely begin to serve what we believe is a better, more intelligent purpose. The narrator, Jackie Burden, has a wonderfully ironic way of expressing himself, where he recognizes that he has been disloyal to a \\""friend of his youth,\\"" yet goes ahead with a dark plan anyway. Mr. Burden once had dreams of being something great, of exploring history for its beauty, he had honorable family friends, but he ended up instead digging up dirt for his \\""boss,\\"" Willie Stark, the politician who transforms himself from a naive small-town speaker into a prominent, powerful figure on the brink of national attention. One of the people he digs up dirt on is one of those honorable people from his youth. But there is poetic justice in the story -- the corruption that engulfs the characters ends their upward rise. The themes of corruption explored in this book are played out again and again in American politics. The book was written in the 1940's, but it \\""predicted\\"" Watergate, the Iran-Contra Affair, the Monica Lewinski scandal, as well as scores of other political games that have been played in the intervening decades.

The problem lies in the utterly self-referencial nature of the narrator, which sometimes obscures the fascination of every other character save himself.  Of course this is meant to be part of the point of the book, but to me it just emphasizes my conviction that Warren tried too hard with this novel.  He had everything working but for some reason decided to blur the facts (perhaps as an intential obscuring of history) in the muddled numbness of someone who has distanced himself from his own life and relegated himself to an observer.<br />Second person narration is a difficult goal to maintain (one inevitably thinks of The Great Gatsby, helped out a great deal by its brief length) and Jack Burden ultimately comes across as a gloomy, arrogant, pompous jerk, so self-obsessed that the legitimicy of the tragedy and greatness of others is numbed, dragged down, trapped in the lowered expectations of his own world view.  This brash imposition of reality is to be commended--as highly praised as anything that has been highly praised in this book.  Jack is miserable and for good reason.  He'd never expected anything of anyone in his life and can be satisfied that no one can disappoint him (until the betrayal of a long since ended romance comes along, but I should be honest--this sub-plot contains most of the parts I found boring and 'self-reflective'--I guess I don't imagine liking the author personally very much--).<br />The prose, clearly, is confidently assured, a guy never struggling with style and language.  Even the characterizations of others is profound, dense with meaning and the full force of graphic realization.  But when he gets to himself, despite Jack's boasts to the contrary, he backs off and grows defensive, merely covering up, seeking not only to prove but to justify every wrong turn he's ever taken in his life.<br />I don't like Jack Burden.

But the themes of All the King's Men are equally poignant.  Jack Burden, the main character, deals with lost love, disgust at the life he's led and still leading, and disillusionment with modern society.  Willie Stark, the demagogic governor, presents themes regarding the nature of power - is it possible to attain power and still remain moral?  Can morality survive as a means, or can man only try to, as Stark says, \\""make the good from the bad?\\""  Is it necessary to pander to corruption to achieve good?

Strongly defined characters and a setting so real you can taste the air provide the foundation for this literary masterpiece, yet the real genius of the book is in Warren's understanding of the reader and his use of style to convey a personal tone in the reading.<br />The main characters in All the King's Men are Jack Burden and Willie Stark. Jack, the narrator, was a reporter before joining Stark's bid for political power. Stark began as a small country lawyer who saw something wrong and tried to change it, but he eventually becomes a politician in the truest sense, so much so that the narrator can only think of Stark as &quot;the Boss,&quot; an ominous title indeed. Accompanying these two men is an array of equally fascinating minor characters such as Sadie, a saucy married woman influential in developing Stark's position as a politician, and Sugar Boy, an Irishman so named for his affinity for sugar. Every character has depth and realism and can stand alone as a fully-developed individual.<br />While the characters are clearly an enjoyable part of the story, the setting is even more compelling. Warren's word choice is superb; he chooses to include and omit just the right combination of words to paint a realistic picture in the reader's mind without becoming too cumbersome. It is a balance few authors are able to achieve with such proficiency and yet another way in which Warren demonstrates his almost supernatural understanding of the reader. The best part is, it only gets better.<br />If characters and setting can be described as masterfully crafted, then Warren's grasp of tone is inexplicable. Simply put, the story truly speaks to the reader and could never have been as effective were it written any other way. Sentence structure, word selection, and dialect coalesce into a tangible atmosphere that projects a strong sense of familiarity onto the reader. The book is hard to put down because of this sense of familiarity.<br />Overall, All the King's Men is a book enjoyable in many more ways than one, with intriguing characters, realistic setting, and a true understanding of the needs of the reader.

This novel is only barely about political process and instead  focuses on the quest of a man to uncover the past and how his discoveries  lead to the undoing of a state of grace.<br />The man (and narrator) is Jack  Burden, who starts out as a local  newspaper reporter in a thinly disguised  Louisiana.  A young,  temperate, idealistic county treasurer named Willie  Stark comes to Burden's attention during a minor scandal.  Stark refuses to  give in to a kickback scheme involving a contract for a schoolhouse  construction project and is promptly ousted from his position.  Burden's  reporting of Stark's honesty starts Stark on a path toward a political  career.  After years of developing himself as an orator and demagogue,  Stark becomes Governor and hires Burden to be a sort of right-hand man in  his administration.<br />During his political rise, Stark transforms from a  naive idealist into a cynical imperialist, as his relationships to his wife  and son grow distant.  He is the manipulative type of man who will slap a  friend reassuringly on the shoulder while browbeating and intimidating  members of his administration (the &quot;king's men&quot;), such as making  them write resignation letters that he personally will date when he wants  to get rid of them.  Especially symbolic is the possum incident at the end  of Chapter 1: The Willie Stark political machine crushes anything that gets  under its wheels. <br />Stark commands Burden, who is a former history student  with experience in research, to dig up dirt on a political dissenter who  happens to be one of Burden's lifelong friends.  In doing so, Burden  uncovers a revelation that shatters not only his own life but the lives of  several people close to him.  The novel ends with the weight of a  Shakespearean tragedy, where the line of responsibility weaves directly and  indirectly through several major characters.<br />Robert Penn Warren writes in  a style that alternates between straight hard dialogue and poetic  philosophical musings.  It's not easy to see where the novel is going after  reading only the first couple of chapters; Warren takes his time unfolding  the story to allow the reader to develop a genuine interest in the  characters and appreciate the wealth of ideas presented.",2000-08-16

Many people are turned off by a book that is ostensibly about a politician, but this book is really about how politics is fused into our lives; it is about how many of the basic activities and achievements in a town, city, or even a country come down to the mentality of just a few individuals; and politics becomes a metaphor for something that intoxicates people to the point that they become unable to consider the humanity that surrounds them, so that the meaning of what they are doing is disconnected from their ambition to do it. It is also a story about how all of us, as we mature, give up the things that mean so much to us emotionally as we slowly but surely begin to serve what we believe is a better, more intelligent purpose. The narrator, Jackie Burden, has a wonderfully ironic way of expressing himself, where he recognizes that he has been disloyal to a \\""friend of his youth,\\"" yet goes ahead with a dark plan anyway. Mr. Burden once had dreams of being something great, of exploring history for its beauty, and he had honorable family friends, but he ended up instead digging up dirt for his \\""boss,\\"" Willie Stark, the politician who transforms himself from a naive small-town speaker into a prominent, powerful figure on the brink of national attention. One of the people he digs up dirt on is one of those honorable people from his youth. But there is poetic justice in the story -- the corruption that engulfs the characters ends their upward rise. The themes of corruption explored in this book are played out again and again in American politics. The book was written in the 1940's, but it metaphorically \\""predicted\\"" Watergate, the Iran-Contra Affair, the Monica Lewinski scandal, as well as scores of other political games that have been played in the intervening decades. Finally, the mainfemale character in this book is one of the most complex, unforgettable people you will ever meet in a novel.<br />As an aside, the recent bestseller, \\""Primary Colors,\\"" has a main character with the name Jack Stanton, which happens to also be the name of one of the main political figures in this book.

I've read it more than a few times, and it has never failed to deliver an emotional punch,  and Warren's poetic prose has never failed to lose its luster.<br />On one  level, of course, &quot;All the King's Men&quot; is a fictionalized account  of the life of Huey Long, the machine politician who rose to state and  national prominence as the iron-fisted governor of Louisiana, a man strong  enough to seriously offer FDR a challenge in the '30s before his (Long's)  assassination. As a hard-nosed political novel, &quot;All the King's  Men&quot; delivers the goods. Warren's Willie Stark develops absolutely  believably from a laughably naive idealist to a ruthless politician who has  convinced himself that the political ends justify the brutal means.<br />But  beyond this, Warren's novel is a profound meditation on the limits of power  and the nature of our understanding of the world. Its narrator, Jack  Burden, is one of the most complex creations in American fiction, a man at  once supremely self-assured and wracked by the most essential of doubts  about himself. On the one hand, Jack, who becomes Willie's number-one  assistant, is as hard edged a realist as his boss. On the other, he is a  wounded romantic, lamenting a long-lost love and the disappearance of a  world that offered the simple pleasures of boyhood and none of the  ambiguities a complex world in which nothing -- politically, socially, or  romantically -- is as it seems.<br />Finally, the novel is a voyage of  self-discovery for Jack, and in this, &quot;All the King's Men&quot;  continues the great tradition in Western literature we trace back to  Oedipus. The novel explores the fundamental theme of self-identity, as  Sophocles did, and it succeeds brilliantly in creating a complex,  multi-layered story that achieves its thematic goal.<br />There is really no  describing the richness of the experience you will find if you read this  novel, but be forewarned that it is a novel that demands much.

My friend has a penchant for reading mysteries and, as long as you don't know the story of Huey Long, this book has a tension I imagine he liked. Probably because his contemporary readers would have associated Willie Stark with Huey Long fairly early, Warren uses a fair amount of foreshadowing to set up the few \\""surprises\\"" that come towards the end of the book; they might not have been surprises to those readers though.<br /><br />Still, whether you tend towards the Long/Stark end of the spectrum or that of Judge Irwin, through his narrator, Jack Burden, Warren is able to create characters who command varying degrees of sympathy...including Jack himself. But it's the humanity of them all that is likely most important to Warren and he lets the reader sympathize while still seeing the often grievous imperfections.<br /><br />Warren also owes a fair debt to William Faulkner, whose influence sometimes appears in the form of longish sentences linked by repetitive articles as Jack delves into his own mind or describes the towns and people he sees. Warren's focus on capturing a particular aspect of any given scene, like describing a woman Jack sees in a mere instant while driving through a town, reveals Warren's poetic bent.
