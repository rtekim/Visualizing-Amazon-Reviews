My decision to reread Mockingbird was somewhat controversial, from a personal standpoint, at least. After beginning this year’s reading challenge with the expectation that I would read only new material, news of actor Jonathan Crombie’s death compelled me to revisit Anne of Green Gables. Having broken my – albeit casual – vow, reading Mockingbird still felt like a well-deserved cheat.<br /><br />Although the upcoming release of Harper Lee‘s second novel, Go Set a Watchman, is a great excuse to relive Scout, Jem, and Dill’s adventures in Maycomb, I didn’t pick up Mockingbird for that reason. I’m tutoring a rising 9th grader in English and mathematics, and Mockingbird was one of the four texts I selected for us to examine. So I dove back into it.<br /><br />Reading about Maycomb is a lot like coming home. Granted, I grew up more than 60 years and 400 miles away from Lee’s home in Monroeville, but the small town politics, racism, and classism are still familiar. I imagine that Scout Finch’s life would have been my life, had my brothers been young enough to play with me in the same capacity as Jem and Dill. She has always been a favorite character, and I hope that, by the time of Watchman, she’s cast off her internalized misogyny.<br /><br />Mockingbird isn’t a book that gets better or worse with age, though experience does afford adults a capacity to access and understand the novel in ways high school freshmen cannot. There are no great revelations to be found, at least not with one measly decade between readings. The solid, humorous prose is still there, and none of the adventures have disappeared. Here is Jem being shot at, and there are Dill’s wild claims, and then, “Hey, Boo.”<br /><br />This, perhaps, makes now – before you read Watchman – the perfect time to reread Mockingbird. Lee’s first novel is the comfortable garment you slip on after a long day. Your back hurts, your feet hurt, and all you want is the comfort and familiarity of books, blankets, and tea in your home. This is a novel to recharge you, to refresh your emotional palette and make room for new arrivals.<br /><br />It’s difficult to imagine talking to an audience that has not read Mockingbird, but I understand that’s entirely possible. If this is you, I strongly encourage you to buy the cheapest copy of this book than you can find. Buy it, and read it, then do whatever you like with it. You can burn it, you can eat it, you can even throw it at me (no hardcovers, please). I care much less about what you do with the book, or even how you feel about it, than I do about the fact that you have read it as an adult. Not much in Mockingbird will have changed, but you’ll be surprised how much you have.ter a long day.

There's a uniquely American aspect to this way of life, and also something appealing and saddening about the people and their lives.  This truly is a wondrous examination of humanity and decency.<br /><br />In spite of the tragedy and prejudice rampant in the town of Maycomb, the actions and beliefs of a few good and decent people begin to make a difference, and it's that sense of hope in humanity that makes this such a touching read for me.  While it's narrated by Scout, the real star is her father, Atticus Finch, who is so gloriously paternal and wise, that I'm sure most everyone wishes they had an Atticus Finch in their life.  But Scout herself is such an integral part of the story.  Seeing the drama through her childhood lenses gives me such a sense of nostalgia, while also highlighting how simple right and wrong can be, when stripped of preconceptions.  That aspect of stripping away prejudice to just seeing the truth makes this such a powerful story.<br /><br />There are many great nuggets of wisdom in this book that are sometimes unexpected glimpses into a real truth of the human condition that it's no wonder this book has endured as a classic, and is still so highly regarded.  The story feels like a series of vignettes at times - especially when Scout gives snapshots of her childhood antics with her brother and their friend Dill, but it all adds up to a momentous portrait of life, and a glimpse of an era that can seem different to modern times in some ways, but in many ways is no different at all.",2015-08-14

Board of Ed,&#34; which opened a new and often violent chapter in the Civil Rights movement. Jean Louise Finch (Scout) has been exposed to &#34;Northerners,&#34; coming home to Alabama from a New York City job. She's no longer a provincial young woman, but still one with the heart of a '50s liberal. And therein lies the rub, going up against the Jim Crow mentality. In the end Jean Louise has to accept her father's membership in the Citizens Council, said to be a buffer between the populace and the Klan. Atticus maintains that he's on the council as a &#34;Watchman,&#34; to monitor what they're up to. It's true that Atticus' character looses some of the heroic luster of &#34;Mockingbird&#34; but it's also a testament of how white people in the south at that time were raised.

Her father Atticus is a well-educated, kind lawyer who honestly answers any questions the children have about life, much to the dismay of his poised, lady-like sister, Alexandra, always at odds with her niece’s tomboy ways. As a result, both children have very adult vocabularies, yet still maintain unique, childish perspectives on the adversities that will befall their small town, especially when their father has to defend a black man in 1930’s small-town Alabama. With many layers of brilliant metaphors, this novel redefines prejudices and contrasts, through the eyes of children, the barriers that ignorant or fearful adults can create. To Kill a Mockingbird will make you reevaluate your beliefs and their roots, and even spur you to look for trinkets that may have been left in knotted trees.<br />For a themed recipe and drink, other recommendations, and discussion questions, visit: http://amandaleitch.hubpages.com/hub/To-Kill-a-Mockingbird-Harper-Lee",2015-08-07

Harper Lee is a wonderful storyteller, with a sharp but warm command of the Southern vernacular suitable to her characters and a terrific eye for the little details that bring her tale to vivid life. She has the great gift of intimacy. Her narrative, told through the peppery voice of her pre-adolescent protagonist, Scout Finch, seems utterly direct, warmly personal, without literary artifice (except for the few occasions when Scout makes observations clearly beyond the scope of a someone so young). Scene for scene, the book is a delight. But I found its moral lessons - the layer of narrative that has made it a staple in schools for so many years - a bit pat. OK, I'm looking at it from the perspective of someone who's lived through the Civil Rights era, the death of Martin Luther King, Jr., the recent spate of police killings of unarmed black men. And it is a story of events set in a much earlier America - the pre-Jim Crow South of the 1930s, as seen through the eyes of a 9-year-old. For me, its shortcoming - what keeps it from becoming a truly great book - is Lee's rendering of her most beloved character, Atticus Finch. Revered by his children,  a struggling, &#34;good&#34; single father, he remains a curiously remote figure. We see nothing of his personal anguish over the death of his wife, and very little of what anguish he presumably feels over the incendiary case he takes on. We don't know his intellectual interests or even anything about his social life or friendships. All Lee shows is his &#34;goodness.&#34; She does this with fine wit. But Atticus remains more an emblem than a man of flesh-and-blood. Perfect for an actor like Lincolnesque Gregory Peck, but not so compelling on the printed page. I'm now 50 pages into &#34;Go Set a Watchman&#34; and finding that what it reveals about Atticus is more interesting, if disturbing, than anything in &#34;Mockingbird.&#34;",2015-07-23

She was hugely disappointed explaining that To Kill a Mockingbird was the one book she loved at school, which subsequently turned her into a reader.

It’s amazing and impressive that given how dated this story is, lengthy and convoluted it still cuts it with teenagers.

Its timeless qualities manage to pull in reader attention as it readily relates to, prejudice, injustice and loyalty; features that children can easily relate to.<br /><br />Harper Lee’s portrayal of the younger Scout and how the adult protagonist’s voice evokes memory strikes a rapport with teenage readers.

I say this after reading the novel for the third time, the second having been 18 years ago. This reading has occurred since the recent publication of its prequel/sequel 'Go Set a Watchman' so I have had the experience of reading them back to back with a fresh comparison.<br /><br />The novel, like the film, has a seemingly random, anecdotal quality to much of it, weaving around the double threads of the curiosity of the children toward Arthur (Boo) Radley and the trial of Tom Robinson. Like any film adapted from a novel, the film 'To Kill a Mockingbird' had to be selective in which anecdotes to leave out and which ones to include.<br /><br />Fifty-five years after its original publication and 53 years after the film version, a summary of the novel seems superfluous so I will proceed on the assumption that everyone has been exposed to the novel, the film or both. Assuming that familiarity, the rest of the review will largely consist of my new perceptions of portions I had forgotten or connections I had not made until this reading.<br /><br />The novel takes place over a span of three years, from 1932 to 1935 and in that time Scout's brother Jem makes a transition from child to adolescent while Scout moves from first to third grade. They are not constant in their perceptions of their small-town world. There is much room to grow and so the revelations do not seem to occur as rapidly as the film version would indicate. Scout has more of an inkling of what the Robinson trial is about as a third grader than she would have had if it occurred at the beginning of the novel. The spooky imagined exploits of childhood boogeyman Boo Radley that consumes the children and their playmate Dill at the beginning has receded into mere curiosity about an extremely reclusive character.<br /><br />I had forgotten, for example, that Aunt Alexandra moves in with the family toward the beginning of the novel because Atticus knows that they need more adult attention than he is able to give them at this time. He probably also feels that they could benefit from a female presence in the house. According to Scout, they already have a female presence—their black housekeeper/cook Calpurnia. She keeps the household running smoothly and does her best to ensure that the children stay out of mischief. She doesn't live with them 24/7 though and she is black. She is also not a blood relation. Alexandra's presence is felt throughout the rest of the novel, although she doesn't strike me as quite as shrewish as she does in 'Go Set a Watchman,' partially because in that novel she treats the adult Jean Louise almost identically to the child Scout.<br /><br />Alexandra's presence in the house does bring Scout closer to Calpurnia, whom she sees as too much of a strict disciplinarian at the beginning of the novel, yet in comparison to Alexandra, she actually takes the trouble to try to understand the child's point of view. As talk of the impending trial of Tom Robinson reaches the children through the taunts of children as well as raving adults such as Mrs. Dubose, Cal's feelings on the matter are not lost on Scout. As she attempts to understand Atticus's willingness to defend a black man and not respond to the racial slurs that are tossed at him, she gets a first-hand look at the other side of the racial fence when she goes with Cal to her own church. Cal defends her decision to bring a white girl to a black church to some of the black counterparts to Mrs. Dubose and Scout respects her for her courage in going against the tide of what is expected in THAT society. Cal's pastor Reverend Sykes welcomes her and this familiarity also informs his easy reception of her, Jem and Dill to the 'colored only' balcony ofthe courthouse for the Robinson trial.<br /><br />I had also forgotten that Atticus's younger brother, Uncle Jack, appears, scolding Scout at a Christmas gathering for using unsuitable language and hitting her cousin for calling Atticus the unmentionable 'n—lover'. When Scout scolds him politely for not giving her a chance to tell her side of the story, he relents and understands why she got so upset.<br /><br />Another character I didn't recall is the white businessman Dolphus Raymond. He lives with a black mistress and has spawned several mulatto children. He is seen by the society of Maycomb as a scandalous, immoral eccentric. Scout understands him a bit more after she is taken out of the courthouse with Dill after Dill's crying fit over the racist treatment of the prosecuting attorney to Tom Robinson, encounters Raymond and learns that the liquid he drinks out of the container within his paper sack is not whiskey, as everyone suspects, but Coca-Cola. Scout asks him why he pretends, to which he says:<br /><br />&#34;I try to give 'em a reason, you see. It helps folks if they can latch onto a reason. When I come to town, which is seldom, if I weave a little and drink out of this sack, folks can say Dolphus Raymond's in the clutches of whiskey—that's why he won't change his ways. He can't help himself, that's why he lives the way he does….It ain't honest but it's mighty helpful to folks. Secretly, Miss Finch, I'm not much of a drinker, but you see they could never, ever understand that I live like I do because that's the way I want to live.&#34;<br /><br />He says he confides in children because they are still young enough to understand him, because they 'cry about the simple hell people give other people without even thinking. Cry about the hell white people give colored folks, without even stopping to think that they're people too.&#34;<br /><br />Another realization I had with this reading is that Atticus is not the sole advocate for equal treatment regardless of race. Their neighbor Miss Maudie Atkinson tells them that there are certain people we hire to do our unpleasant jobs for us and their father is one of them. She is certainly one of the more racially enlightened citizens of the town. As they find out, a white person who believes in treating black people equally must live closeted lives.  They learn that Judge Taylor chose Atticus intentionally to be the defense attorney rather than the man that would ordinarily be chosen. Sheriff Heck Tate must maintain order as a lawman and yet he too knows that Tom is innocent and he is sensitive enough to the reclusive Boo to persuade Atticus to 'let the dead bury the dead'. In this town Atticus and Dolpus Raymond are the most uncloseted of the white non-racists in the town.<br /><br />The novel proceeds in its almost effortless, anecdotal way to reveal steadily stronger moral lessons for both Jem and Scout but particularly for Scout, culminating in the most intense encounter with Bob Ewell and the emergence of Boo Radley. It is easy to see how it earned its classic status. It presents such a clear, articulate and incontrovertible statement regarding racial equality and unequivocal respect for all living things (Jem even adopts a stance of not even crushing insects) that is universal and is why it can still move millions of readers 55 years after its publication. Its success and influence even provided a lesson in tolerance for the real-life model for Atticus, A.C. Lee.",2015-07-20

I confess I just completed my third reading of it.  The first time as a teen, the second as a young adult, and, with the release of Go Set A Watchmen, I decided it was time again.  Now, as a 40+ woman, I wondered if the story would still resonate. As my eyes gleaned over the famous first lines, I was drawn back into sleepy little Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930’s, home of Scout, Jem and Atticus Finch.  Just as before, I trusted young Scout's voice to take me through her coming of age journey.  She was observant, frank and hilarious. But now, I found myself shaking my head and smiling at her sharp observations about the grown ups around her, because, after all, I am one of them, too.  I see people around me who remind of the folk in Maycomb.  I also see the ugly things grown-ups do: hypocrisy, passing judgment, hiding behind religion/alcohol/politics/and all the “isms” and “phobias” …most of us just scared deep down, but most of us, also good. While the story culminates with trial of Tom Robinson, I found my focus had shifted a little throughout re-reading.  Because I already knew the major plot points, I enjoyed the &#34;in between&#34; moments the most—from the deliciously delightful to the heartbreakingly tender.  I chuckled, laughed aloud, and wept--really wept. To Ms. Lee's great credit, I cannot think of another story where words, be it verb, adjective or noun, were more fittingly and economically used.  At its core, the story is an astonishingly astute observation of people, a crisp snapshot in time, lending to its timelessness.  Though Ms. Lee wrote with restraint, each character feels perfectly real and the story complete and thoroughly satisfying. I think it is important to re-read stories like To Kill A Mockingbird.  With age comes understanding of nuance, the ability to see the bigger picture, and most significantly, the power to be the change we wish to see.  Ms. Lee reminds us the value of empathy, the impact of simple kindness, and that courage is not the absence of fear.  Let us listen and do.",2015-07-18
US,24253256,R3ESUO11VHW5NP,0060935464,994527755,To Kill a Mockingbird,Books,5,0,0,N,N,"For Those Who Have Seen The Movie But Never Read The Book","With over six thousand reviews already written here on Amazon for &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34; as of this writing there isn't much I could really add to praising this excellent book by Harper Lee. This is nothing less then an outstanding novel that everyone should read if they have the chance (and you should make every effort to create the chance to read this). But there is one group of people out there who I would like to address and recommend they read TKAM. That would be to those who have seen the movie but never have read the book.<br /><br />The movie itself was excellent and fairly closely follows the novel. But of course as is usually the case with any film made that is based on a best selling book there is a lot that you may read in the novel that will never make it up onto silver screen version. Biggest reason of course is time constraints. Film makers will in general just stick to the main story line of the novel to move things along and leave out any side stories that may be in the book to help keep the budget to make the film down to a reasonable level. Same is true when &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34; was made into a movie.<br /><br />So for anyone who has seen and loves the movie you owe it to yourself to read the book and get the complete story that Harper Lee wrote that was left out of the film. To give a couple of examples. Remember Miss Dubois in the movie? The cranky old lady Jem warns Dill about who supposedly kept a loaded confederate pistol under her blanket. You see that character for a couple of minutes in the movie but there is an interesting side story in the novel about her and Jem that brings a greater understanding about her that you don't get to see in the movie. Another example is how not just the people in the town Maycomb was reacting to Atticus Finch defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping and beating a white girl, but also from other family members and what they say and how they act to his taking the case. Again another element to the story that does not get told in the film. There are some other examples as well but the thing I am trying to say here is that if you have seen the movie but never read the book you need to read it to get the whole story behind Atticus, Scout, Jem, Boo Radley and rest of Maycomb's citizens. It is a beautifully told story that no one should deny themselves reading. I had seen the movie many times in my life before I had a chance to read the book. After I had read it I found I had a better understanding and an even better appreciation of &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34;. The next time I saw the movie after that I saw it in a whole different light and understanding. You may find it will do the same for you.other element to the story that does not get told in the film.

That first quarter is giving us a portrait of the relationship between the narrator, the tough little six-year old girl nicknamed “Scout” - who is about six when the story begins in 1932 or 1933 and about nine when it ends - and her brother Jem, her senior by four years.  Their father is the lawyer Atticus Finch:  a superb creation:  wise, calm, laconic, tolerant, polite and self-controlled - a wonderful role model for his children.  Another stirling character is their black cook-housekeeper Calpurnia.  And we get a picture of the close-knit community in a small Alabama town.<br /><br />Then Atticus takes on the defence of Tom Robinson, a black man who has been falsely accused of having raped a white girl.  The ugly character of the community - with the exception of a few individuals - now comes out, as many people of its members now describe Atticus as a “nigger-lover”.  The book now builds to the climax of the trial and its tragic result for Tom.<br /><br />The children have followed all this intensely, and are shocked by the outcome.  They understand the evil resulting from race prejudice, and see through the unconscious hypocrisy of their teacher extolling American democracy and condemning Hitler for his treatment of the Jews.<br /><br />The tempo slackens a bit after that, but then ends with another dramatic incident as one of the racists took vengeance on the Finches. A sub-plot about a mysterious recluse in the township now also comes into its own.<br /><br />The book is rich in symbolism, humane, perceptive of a girl’s evolving view of the world (and of her gender), Humorous in places and a great tract against racism.",2015-07-17

Young Scout Finch is a wonderful narrator, courageous and inquisitive, and her stories involving brother Jem, father Atticus, a lawyer, and neighbor Dill capture the flavour of depression-era Maycomb Alabama. Her hatred for school, among other genially rebellious attitudes, win over the reader (she believes that if she keeps swearing her father will conclude that she’s learning bad words in school and will let her drop out) and her stories of neighborhood life which focus mainly on the mysterious Radley home where Arthur “Boo” Radley lives but is never seen, create a literary small town that comes alive in the imagination.<br /><br />This first section of school and summer games leads up to the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of assaulting a white woman. Scout’s father is appointed to be his public defender and the trial lays bare the prejudices and racism, as well as the honor and sense of justice, of the people of Maycomb.<br /><br />There are as many ways to enjoy this novel as there are readers, surely. Read it for the Southern culture, the church-going and cooking, the delineation of Southern Womanhood and Scout’s navigation of manners. Or read it for the sad and telling depiction of racism and prejudice, a wonderfully constructed plot which is both humane and devastating. This is a novel with both lighter and darker elements and the way in which they are mixed together is skillful and satisfying, enhanced my many varied characters and symbolism and told through the eyes of a young child forced to confront the ugliness of the world but also learning, outside of school, some important lessons.",2015-07-12

It became a best seller and is taught in schools across our nation. I just finished reading it for the third time—each reading about fifteen years apart—and I can say unequivocally that the novel deserves all the accolades it has ever received. Lee’s message is clear: that we should never “kill” a positive influence in our lives, and that, indeed, most people have hidden qualities that are positive. In making her point, she gives us wonderful, folksy characters who speak truths and entertain, as well. Her central plot point turns on the rape trial of a black man, and the compassion, understanding, and love she shows this character was ground breaking when she published the novel, and it is most definitely ground breaking for her characters to have such attitudes, since they are living in 1930s Alabama. So much praise has been given TKM that I don’t need to add to it. Suffice it to say if you haven’t read this remarkable book, you should pick it up right now.",2015-06-24

Recently, I decided to read this book again prior to reading Lee's &#34;new&#34; book, Go Set A Watchman, which comes out in mid-July -- although I have to admit I was a little concerned that it might not live up to the great memories I have of it. My concern was totally unfounded. To Kill A Mockingbird stands the test of time -- as do all classics; and, in my opinion, To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic.<br /><br />As many of you know, To Kill A Mockingbird is a coming-of-age novel that takes place during a three-year period during the 1930's in a small rural town in Alabama and follows the lives of its main characters -- Scout, her brother, Jem, and their father Atticus. Central to the plot is the arrest and trial of a young black man accused of raping a white woman and Atticus Finch's defense of the black man.<br /><br />For me, To Kill A Mockingbird continues to be one of the most compassionate, funny, wise and, at times, heartbreaking books I have ever read, as it explores such key themes as race, class, justice and the challenges of growing up.<br /><br />I hope this review helps to motivate you to read To Kill A Mockingbird or to re-read it, as I did.

The summer of 8th I was basically FORCED to read it for a grade. At first I was so mad that I had to read this book and refused to do it, my plan was to just spark note the whole book and every chapter in it. But during a long drive to Lake Chelan I decided I would bring the book with me and start reading a few pages. I slowly started to become interested in the book and continued reading it and eventually ended up finishing the story and being very proud that I did.<br /><br />The story was written in the 1930’s, a time with a high level of racism. Once Scout and Jem (two kids of Atticus) discover that their father is representing a black man named Tom Robinson who was accused of raping a white woman, they’re slandered with racial slurs and offensive comments by other people in their community due to Atticus’ role in the situation. After Jem decided to act poorly towards an old lady, he is sentenced to read to her daily for a month while Scout has to deal with her aunt coming to town and tries to make her more of a “girly girl”<br />The thing I liked about the book is that it still applies to things happening now. Sadly, people are still frowned upon for representing a person of color in the court of law and racial slurs are still being thrown around at people for no reason.<br /><br />The rising action of the story is when Mayella Ewell accuses Tom Robinson of raping her. Because the story was written in 1930’s when racism was everywhere and Tom Robinson was a black man, a lot of people started to look down on Atticus’ family and emotionally hurt them. Regardless of what happens during the trial, Atticus continues to defend Tom Robinson and make sure they prove Mayella is lying.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy reading books about racism or racial issues during the great depression that aren’t depressing, also i recommend this book to people who just enjoy reading about mystery’s because in the book all the kids try and figure out the mystery of Boo Radley. Lastly, I would recommend this book to just about anyone entering high school because it shows that many people will have many different opinions about things that have nothing to do with them and they aren’t always the nicest.",2015-06-11

Grand Central Publishing is the publisher, it has 376 pages and was published in 1960. This novel was a best seller, won the Pulizer Prize and recently celebrated its 50 year anniversary. It involves a tomboy nicknamed Scout, her brother, Jem and their kindhearted father, Atticus.<br /><br />Scout Finch, Jem Finch, and their father, Atticus Finch live in a town called Maycomb. Everyone is poor in Maycomb, but Atticus has a bad paying job as a lawyer. The Finch's are better off than the rest of Maycomb county. When Scout and Jem meet a boy named Dill, they act out stories or you could even call them plays, in the neighborhood together. One day, Dill becomes interested with a scary house that Boo Radley lives in. Boo hasn't been outside in years.<br />Scout hates the idea of school, much like some of us, especially after the first day. One evening after school, Scout and Jem found a hole in a tree near the Radley Place, with gifts for them inside of it. Late one night, Scout, Jem and Dill snuck onto Boo's yard where Nathan Radley shot in the air, near them. It scared them to death. Jem loses his pants and when he returns for them, his pants are folded over the fence. They figured Boo did that for them.<br />Even though Maycomb is very racist, Atticus agrees to defend a black citizen named Tom Robinson. A white woman accused him of raping her. Atticus then invites his sister to come live with them. During the trial, the children sat in the &#34;colored&#34; balcony. Atticus then proves that Mayella and Bob Ewell are lying about the rape. Even though they proved it and it seemed like they won, they lost. Tom was then put in prison and shot while trying to escape. Bob Ewell, during the end of the novel, attacks Jem and Scout for revenge over Atticus making a fool of them in court. Boo Radley gets involved, and saves the children and also stabs Bob Ewell, killing him during the attack. He then visits the broken Jem, but returns home after making sure he was okay.<br /><br />The point behind this book is to explore the key themes of racism and also to show courage and bravery are important qualities to show. I believe this book is a great piece of American literature. This is only one of the books that I have been engulfed in, although it had a very slow start. It began very slow, but picked up around part two. This novel captivated me even before part two. Atticus is an ideal father, and Scout, a rambunctious little girl captured my heart. In my honest opinion, &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; is the best book known to man, although it had a slow start. It's hard to read with their accents, but in the end, it is an amazing novel.",2015-05-28

This is why literature is such a large factor of humanities as a whole. Within To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee takes a spin with the plot in various deplorable situations. This calls to attention about what the novel is truly telling and sharing with its readers. To Kill a Mockingbird explores three very different views with three even more different settings and character dynamic. The prejudice every single person is faced with is the overall character conflict throughout the novel. The children of the novel, the situation with Boo Radley, and the case of Atticus are all the different views readers look through and upon.<br /> First off, throughout the novel the children of the tale such as Scout, Gem, and Dill, all are trying to find out where they stand on things in life. All of the children in this novel are exploring their limits and pushing to define and know themselves. This is made very apparent with Scout’s recall and Dill’s extraverting character make up. The children are growing up in the South during a very pro-discrimination era. The Finch children, both Scout and Gem, have a father who is kind, gentle, and fair so their views on the world seem a bit more innocent. Dill and Jem are aware of the hostility and animosity of the town but do not seem to give into it’s ideals. They show the innocence of Bo Radley when he places continual gifts for the children. He is made human by this innocence of the children. By Lee making the statement that no one person is better than another, he ties very nicely into the treatment and discrimination of the townspeople towards African Americans, which is the next criticism that is shown throughout the novel.<br /> Next, the prejudice and hatred that was alive in the South during, well pretty much still to today, but at a much more extreme level. Living as any person during the Great Depression time was hard enough, adding being colored and cast out of society as a person, and life was unbearable. The novel show a trial of a man who is being sentenced to death for “making moves” on a white young women and then beating her senseless. The story unfolds and the author reveals the true nature of the crime. The young lady had thrown herself onto Tom Robinson and her father caught her, eventually resulting in a beating of her lifetime for touching “one of them”. Tom is unfortunately still prosecuted and killed. Atticus feels a sense of right and wrong with both presences live and well, as he did try to exonerate and free the young man with a family left behind. The entire novels shows and explains the racial hatred by slurs and actions, even by the assumption they are not on the same level as white folks - it is all described in the way of Lee’s words. Harper Lee shows the lack of respect and the omission of existence the colored folks deal with from different balconies to bathrooms. The different level of standards are completely seen within the text.<br /> Harper Lee ties this all back into the third view very nicely. This would be the existence of good and evil, the never ending battle of morality. Yes, bad things happen in life - American history is no stranger to this. Although there were people who strictly believed in the the segregation and the social downfall of caste systems, there were people who believed everyone should live happily among one another. Lee shows both of these sides very clearly with the regular townsfolk compared to Atticus and his niche. The children’s innocence and unknown side preference is the big point that ties all the three different views into one. Harper Lee does this very nicely.<br /> The novel To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel that has lasted the ages. It has shown light on the negative parts of history but also how good can prevail evil when people actually act on the good in their hearts. Harper Lee shows great conviction for the good to prevail, no matter the forces of evil out against it. There is mass prejudice among the different ethnicities within the county in Alabama. The characters fight for this innocent way of viewing the segregation and hatred present within the neighborhood. All of this goes on with evil typically prevailing at the battles, but good will win the war it seems in this small Alabama town. Harper Lee does a great job exploring this heinous time of American history to shed light on the good the prevailed ultimately. No one person is better than another.  Atticus fitch couldn’t have said it any better “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . . . until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.”",2015-05-26

This book is #12 on the list, read that same summer. A re-read of my 60 cent Popular Library copy had been long overdue. A few things have changed in that half century... and more than a few things have remained the same. Plus ca change... as the French would say.<br /><br />This was the only work of Harper Lee, though it has recently been announced that after that same half century, a new work will be released in July, 2015, entitled [[ASIN:0062409859 Go Set a Watchman: A Novel]]. I remembered it as a \\""perfect\\"" novel the first time around, read as a teenager. The second time only deepened my appreciation for her achievement. From more than most works, I retained numerous images of that initial reading, reinforced by only one viewing of the movie with Gregory Peck, in the role of Atticus Finch, which must have inspired hundreds if not thousands of students to go to law school.<br /><br />The setting is a small town which is the county seat of Maycomb, in south Alabama. Probably the first time around I didn't understand the reference, when Lee tells us the date, in the following manner: it was shortly after we had been told that we only had to fear fear itself. The story's narrator is \\""Scout\\"" (Jean Louise) Finch, nine-years old as the novel opens. She is a classic \\""tom-boy,\\"" and precocious, as she grabbles with understanding the world around her. Jem is her brother, four years older. Their mother has died, and they are being raised by Atticus, a bit old for a father of the time, well-read, ethical, with a sense of the possible, and that which is not. The kid's other \\""caregiver\\"" is Calpurnia, the black cook and housekeeper, who is considered own \\""family.\\"" And the kids have a friend, Dill, whose real name is Charles Baker Harris, who visits them each summer, from Meridian, Mississippi.<br /><br />It was an era of what we now seem to call \\""free-range\\"" kids. They are always outside, unless it was raining. No electric \\""entertainment\\""; the plays were the ones that the kids produced from their imagination. Lee masterly tells a number of vignettes that successfully conveys the reality of small town southern life during the Great Depression. There is the school scene, and the kid who is too poor to have a lunch, and the others who only attend the first day. There are the holiday visits with Atticus' siblings; there are the old ladies who tend their flowers (and one has her home burn down on the coldest night in the 20th century). There is the dog with rabies, and the \\""crazy neighbor\\"" next door, and so much else, which Lee tells with balance, empathy and insight. She even provides a brief historical sketch of the area since the days of the first settlement by people of European (and African) decent.<br /><br />There is the one dominant theme; what Gunner Myrdal called \\""The American Dilemma.\\"" It is the black-white relationship, during the era of legal, as well as de facto racial segregation.  It is about poor whites, dirt poor whites, so easily called \\""trash,\\"" clinging to their only possible status symbol: the color of their skin, which thereby provides them their one claim to social superiority and a \\""right\\"" to have their story believed. It is about loneliness, sex, and the very rigid social code of the time. Religion and the \\""place\\"" of women in southern society also make their appearances in Lee's beautifully crafted story. It culminates in one of the most memorable courtroom dramas in fiction. Despair and a glimmer of hope for the future, which half a century later, was partially achieved.<br /><br />And it is also about the dangers that \\""free range\\"" kids faced, even in those apparently simpler times, as well as an unlikely denouement that does happen in \\""real\\"" life. Harper Lee hits so many themes, with the perfect pitch of a seasoned novelist, and she did it the first time around. After telling that one inspiring story, for half century, she has remained silent, even reclusive. To Kill a Mockingbird is an essential American novel. 6-stars.clusive.

Yes, the last half of the book, dealing with Tom Robinson and Boo Radley is great, however, it's the first half of the book that is absolutely a drudge on one's reading senses. Establishing the Finch's family history in Maycomb is not needed in as great of detail as it has been done; simply writing a paragraph or two would have sufficed. Instead, the reader is stuck with a copious amount of this type of material, which is quickly becomes overkill.<br /><br />Why this book is taught in high school, I do not understand. It is out of touch with kids today or more likely, kids are out of touch with this type of literature today. This novel should be aimed directly at college students studying history or adults with an interest in history and civil treatment of all people.

I cannot be sure. But one way or another, these characters have been around.

It’s that powerful. I think that is so because these characters exist in every small town and every major city in this country and also inside us.

Whenever you see a complex, perplexing adult world through a child’s eyes, this book exerts its quiet influence.<br /><br />You will begin to wonder if you crack only the first page of Mockingbird: who is Boo Radley? Is he someone perhaps, to fear? You will also likely wonder why the name seems so familiar.<br /><br />I will tell you: it is because the characters of great literature are elemental.

It was an absolutely brilliant reading of a brilliant book with an abundance of messages about human nature and human behavior at its best and at its worst.<br /><br />Early in the thirties, the effects of the Great Depression were raging. Jobs were scarce and money was hard to come by. Poor people found it hard to send their children to school because they were needed to help out on the farm or in other ways to provide for the family. They often went hungry. In the south, race relations were poor and the people of color were poorer. There were few civil rights afforded to blacks. They were oppressed by those who thought of themselves as better. They stood little chance of having a fair trial if accused of a crime or of improving their economic condition. They were at the mercy of whites, and some whites were evil. These were the times, rife with inequities, that this novel takes place.<br /><br />There are several characters that play meaningful roles in the story:<br />1-Atticus Finch is as close as a human being can get to being a saint; he seems near perfect. He is calm, contemplative, kind and compassionate, fair and non-judgmental, and he has no desire whatsoever for retribution even when he has been wronged.  He teaches by setting a good example for others and believes in always doing what is right. He has two children, Jeremy and Jean Louise. He raises them with the same values. His wife has died.<br />Atticus is a lawyer, and he has been appointed to defend a black man who has been accused of rape. Atticus knows it will be an uphill battle to defend him in Alabama, but he would never refuse the case. He believes that Tom Robinson, accused by Bob Ewell, a no-account in town who drinks and abuses his children, is innocent. He is disappointed and saddened by the state of the justice system regarding the treatment and trial of blacks accused of a crime. He vows to do his best, even when some townsfolk object to his defense of a black man whom they would rather see wrongfully punished for daring to touch a white girl, than shame the white man who is lying to protect himself simply because he can, in this white world. A black man simply has less value to them than even a man they know is a lowlife. Their arrogance and blindness propel them to behave this way.<br />2-Scout (Jean Louise), is the younger of the two children. She is the voice of this novel. Her voice, as a young child filled with innocence and wonder, is authentic. She is just entering kindergarten and is suddenly exposed to a world that is sometimes unjust and cruel. Scout is a bit more rambunctious than her older brother Jem. She is also &#34;in love&#34; with her playmate, Dill (Charles), and he, also very young, has professed his love for her. Scout adores Calpurnia.<br />3-Jem, (Jeremy) is more like his father. He is a careful thinker and as the older brother, he cares for and protects Scout who wants to do everything he does, even though he is older. He is not a saint, he is a boy who knows how to play as well as how to toil. Both children have enormous respect for their &#34;older&#34; father whom they call Atticus, not dad, throughout the book.<br />4-Calpurnia is the insightful, black maid/nanny who astutely cares for and helps to raise the Finch children. She is like part of the family. She has basically brought them up as a surrogate parent. She does everything their mother would have done, disciplining them, nourishing them and loving them. She knows how to read and write and speaks differently, in a more educated manner when she is working, than when she is at her home because it wouldn’t do to be “uppity” in her own neighborhood. She is acquainted with the young man that Atticus is defending.  Both children genuinely care for and respect her.<br />5-Boo (Arthur Radley), is a developmentally challenged neighbor who keeps totally to himself and doesn’t speak. He is the neighborhood “freak”, and the children are wary of him. They have never seen him and attribute all sorts of character traits to him and relate stories about the nefarious things he might have done. Is he really a &#34;gentle giant&#34; quietly living his life?<br />6-Scout’s teacher, Miss Caroline, seemed largely unaware of the needs of the poor children or of the problems they faced preventing them from attending school. She resented Scout for knowing how to read before the rest of the class was taught. She seemed unprepared for her job and naïve, at best.<br /><br />Each character played an important role in setting the scene, illustrating the atmosphere that often existed then in small and large towns, everywhere. Harper Lee, using, insight, wit and wisdom, has carefully drawn a picture of the race relations that existed down south with its prejudice and poverty, whites towards blacks and blacks toward whites, albeit in the latter case, with far less power and effect. She has articulated the ignorance and abject hatred that existed there in some quarters. It was widely known that blacks had far fewer advantages and little chance of proving their innocence when accused of a crime. It was a time when a black life was thought to be worth far less than a white life, and some may think that, even today. Even if the jury knew the accused was being framed, in the interest of preserving white superiority, they often convicted him as part of a conspiracy to maintain the status quo. A black man could simply not get away with any accusation a white person made, even though innocent. Their superiority had to be maintained at all costs. Still today, almost six decades since the book was published, the reader will wonder if much has changed, and upon careful reflection will realize, yes, much has truly changed, but some attitudes on both sides, black and white, have not. Still, one can hope that the guileless children, with their pure thoughts and trusting natures, will lead the way.<br /><br />In this sweet narrative, related by Scout, a five year old, frank and open, honest and sincere in her thoughts, questions and spontaneous evaluations of events, the prevailing southern attitudes of the times, come to light.

She seemed unprepared for her job and naïve, at best.<br /><br />Each character played an important role in setting the scene, illustrating the atmosphere that often existed then in small and large towns, everywhere. Harper Lee, using, insight, wit and wisdom, has carefully drawn a picture of the race relations that existed down south with its prejudice and poverty, whites towards blacks and blacks toward whites, albeit in the latter case, with far less power and effect. She has articulated the ignorance and abject hatred that existed there in some quarters. It was widely known that blacks had far fewer advantages and little chance of proving their innocence when accused of a crime. It was a time when a black life was thought to be worth far less than a white life, and some may think that, even today. Even if the jury knew the accused was being framed, in the interest of preserving white superiority, they often convicted him as part of a conspiracy to maintain the status quo. A black man could simply not get away with any accusation a white person made, even though innocent. Their superiority had to be maintained at all costs. Still today, almost six decades since the book was published, the reader will wonder if much has changed, and upon careful reflection will realize, yes, much has trulychanged, but some attitudes on both sides, black and white, have not. Still, one can hope that the guileless children, with their pure thoughts and trusting natures, will lead the way.<br /><br />In this sweet narrative, related by Scout, a five year old, frank and open, honest and sincere in her thoughts, questions and spontaneous evaluations of events, the prevailing southern attitudes of the times, come to light. The class distinctions are apparent and the differences in treatment are very obvious.  The children sometimes have more common sense than the adults. They are kinder and fairer and love without reservations.<br />***“I believe that children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way….” Music and lyrics written by Michael Masser and Linda Creed.",2015-05-18

This book is read in schools across the country, was adapted into an amazingly successful movie that is as highly regarded as the book. This book is not just respected - it is loved.<br /><br />I also hate to admit that it had been nearly 25 years since I had read To Kill a Mockingbird. Although I remembered that I loved the book, I had really forgotten why.<br /><br />So, when I was offered the chance to review this audio version by the publisher for free I jumped it at. It had been such a long time that I needed to remind myself why it was so great.<br /><br />I am not going to waste everyone's time by re-telling the story in detail. Harper Lee creates a wonderfully rich world set in a small town in Alabama during the Great Depression. The story is told from the point of view of young &#34;Scout&#34; Finch. Scout starts as a first grader but the story progresses through several years. She lives with her brother Jem and her father Atticus, an attorney. Her daily life at home is maintained by the African American housekeeper Calpurnia who treats Jem and Scout like they are her own children. Later, her aunt moves in to provide a more permanent feminine role model in the house.<br /><br />In the first part of the book, Scout's world comes to life as Harper Lee takes the time to lay out her world for us. In the second part of the book, this world is interrupted by an outrageous court case in which Atticus is appointed to defend a black man wrongfully accused of raping a white woman. The third part of the book deals with the consequences of that case.<br /><br />But, the book is so much more than that. I grew up in a small town in Indiana and her descriptions of the rhythms of childhood play in the summer felt so true to me that the characters become so real that I felt like I actually knew them in my own childhood.<br /><br />Sissy Spacek's reading of this book is as timeless as the book itself. The decision not to have her actually change voices as she reads the story was a brilliant stroke. Most audiobook readers change voices and make separate voices for each of the characters even if it is told from the point of view of just one of the characters. Spacek keeps the entire story in the voice of Scout because the entire story is told from her point of view. It is her story.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this audiobook. I found myself listening to it whenever I could. I happily rate it 5 stars out of 5.ook is so much more than that.

This book makes you feel like you understand Scout, the narrator, and you feel as if you are living with her and see things from her point of view. It also allows you to see not only how Scout sees the world, but how all children see it. One of the themes in the book is that growing up is losing your innocence; meaning finding out that the world is not good and pure, as many children think it is. Because of reading this book, I can also now take advice from Atticus Finch, the father of the children in the novel. Even as a fictional character, he gives unforgettable advice that all people should follow. From reading this book, I also learned about the ways of society. I learned that no matter what happens, we will always have unfairness and inequality among each other. Although I’ve learned so many other things from this book, the most important thing it taught me is that you have to follow your own moral code, regardless of what others believe.  There are many examples of this, including when Atticus defends Tom Robinson. Personally, there is no doubt in my mind that this is the greatest novel of all time.",2015-04-26

Not many books allow the reader to grow up with the characters and see them realize the truth about the world without making the novel seem short and choppy. Harper Lee managed to let us watch Jem and Scout grow up while making the novel enjoyable and flowing from one event to another seamlessly. This novel does a beautiful job of making the reader view the world differently after reading it and I look forward to reading it many more times throughout my life.",2015-04-23

It went ahead to win the Pulitzer Prize  in 1961 and was later bestowed  the Academy Award as a  -winning film Plethora of plaudits later followed.  Sympathetic , emotional  and profoundly moving , To Kill  a Mockingbird  seethes  to the bases of human  conduct -to blamelessness  and experience, generosity and savagery , love and scorn, puerility  and tenderness. Presently with more than 25 million copies sold in  print and translated  in ten languages  , this territorial story by a youthful Alabama  lady claims all inclusive bids. Harper Lee constantly thought of her  book to be a straightforward love story . Today it is viewed as a gem of American Literature.

The beauty of showing us the story through Scout, is that all of Atticus' moralizing is seen through the glow of childhood, when things are still absolute.

Most remarkable to me was her oh so accurate portrayal of complex social issues as a child may have viewed them.  The innocence and innate wisdom of a child were the necessary elements of redemption, you might say.<br />Striking, too, is the universal appeal of the book's thematic portrayal of innocence, goodness, and wisdom to so many other nationalities as evidenced by the world wide appeal of the book.

In the southern state of Alabama, the Great Depression is still having its effects on daily living. But two kids find joy and amusement in their endless escapades with their friends in between school hours. But this isn't just the story of two kids having fun. It's the story of the prejudice that was so prevalent toward black people at the time and a fear of the unknown. Harper's character development in this story is superb. Every person has their spot in this tale and we're always learning new and interesting facts about them. They become tangible through her descriptions and we warm to the good ones and are disgusted by the bad ones. In the eyes of two youngsters, we are shown the difference between right and wrong and the sense that was seemingly lacking in small town Alabama during that time.

The book looks at prejudice at all levels ; how an 'a la carte' list exists where some prejudices are seen as 'justifiable' or 'understandable' But as Atticus tells us, no one group has a monopoly on good and bad.

This book is focused on the time period of the Great Depression, and is much more than just a book about a man who was wrongly accused.

This book has so many ups and downs that at times you just cannot stop reading while at others it is almost impossible to look at the page.

The book is a decent read for those who enjoy sine childish humor. The novel also teaches about how women were always expected to act feminine, and that African-Americans were always treated with disrespect accurate to the time.

Scout lives a normal life playing like kids do, messing around with the scary neighbor until one day her father Atticus who is a lawyer is assigned to a case defending a black man accused of rape. Once word gets out about the trial Scouts life is no longer normal. I throughly enjoyed the book, I liked the plot, characters, and the perspective. Overall the author did a great job however, he wrote a traditional courtroom drama mixed with a racial tragedy but if you like that kind of stuff then this is a great book for you. Scout the main character changed a lot through the book, she started out as a little kid but she grew up through the trial experiencing many different things. Like Scout I learned a lot, I learned that there was no mercy by people, their nature was innately evil and there was a zero tolerance for blacks and saw a side of their true nature.

As a young schoolgirl","Harper Lee’s novel takes the reader on a journey through the faults of a typical American society during the era of the Great Depression. As a young schoolgirl, Scout spends her time investigating the mysterious Radley house along with her brother Jem and summertime friend Dill. Despite all the evil words that are spoken about the inhabitants of the Radley house, the children want to meet the boy who lives there to find out the truth behind all the rumors. Going against the grain of society and pressures from others, the children discover by the end of the novel that the boy who lives in the house, Boo Radley, is in reality a loving and caring individual who would rather spend his time alone indoors.<br /> During a time of segregation and racism in America, Atticus, Scout and Jem’s father, is a defense lawyer for a black man who is convicted of raping a white woman. Faced with much ridicule, the family is forced to continue on without paying much attention to the people of the community. After a fierce trial that lasted for some time, the ruling decided upon by the all-white jury is telling of the type of society they lived in. The debate of racism and human equality is a theme that is presented a multitude of times throughout the novel.<br /> This novel is a must read if you are looking for something that analyzes and defines the faults in American culture during the Great Depression. Full of surprises and plot-twists, this book is sure to be one you won’t forget.",2015-01-10

Blog reviews often contain links which are not reproduced here, nor will updates or modifications to the blog review be replicated here.  Graphic and children's reviews on the blog typically feature two or three images from the book's interior, which are not reproduced here.<br /><br />Note that I don't really do stars.  To me a book is either worth reading or it isn't.  I can't rate it three-fifths worth reading!  The only reason I've relented and started putting stars up there is to credit the good ones, which were being unfairly uncredited.  So, all you'll ever see from me is a five-star or a one-star (since no stars isn't a rating, unfortunately).<br /><br />I rated this book WORTHY!<br /><br />WARNING!  MAY CONTAIN UNHIDDEN SPOILERS!  PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!<br /><br />I picked up this book because I finally couldn't stand not knowing what the big deal was about a two-kilo mockingbird. I guess I misheard the title...just kidding!<br /><br />Set in the mid 1930's during the &#34;Great Depression&#34; (but written in the late fifties and published in 1960), this story is told from the PoV of Jean Louise Finch, who was known as &#34;Scout&#34;, but it's told in retrospect, by an adult Jean, remembering events years ago. Jean's mother was dead, even back then, and she lived with her father, Atticus, a lawyer, and her older brother, Jeremy, who was known as &#34;Jem&#34;.<br /><br />Harper Lee denied that the novel was autobiographical, but her own father was a lawyer, she had an older bother, she hung out with a new guy in town who lived next door, and there was a boarded-up house nearby about which they made up stories. Many events in this story actually occurred in one way or another, although they were modified for this story.<br /><br />The Finch family lives next door to the reclusive Radley family, and because of this, they make up stories about the Radley's - a family which both scares and intrigues them. During this time, a local black guy, Tom Robinson, is accused of assaulting a white girl - which back then, and especially in the south, was a pretty much an automatic death sentence whether the accused did it or not.<br /><br />Atticus forbids his kids from watching the trial, but they sneak into the 'colored seats' up on the balcony. By some careful legal footwork, Atticus eventually shows the court that Mayella Violet Ewell, the girl accusing Tom, and her father, Robert E Lee Ewall, are lying. It was Bob who beat Mayella, not Tom. Despite this, Tom is found guilty, and is later shot 17 times when he supposedly tries to escape from prison.<br /><br />This story borrows a lot from the real-life Emmett Till case, which was equally messed up, with exaggeration and dissemination on both sides. The sad thing there is that while nothing happened (at least not through the courts) to the accusers in that case, the accused paid heavily for this event - which constituted rudeness at worst and a misunderstanding at best - with his life, in an horrific torture and murder episode in the early hours of one morning - and the accused was only fourteen years old.<br /><br />This story ends in Bob Ewell's death after he launches a cowardly attack upon Jean and Jeremy as they walk home late one night from a school Halloween pageant. Why Atticus even countenanced their being unescorted given the preceding campaign of threats and intimidation which Ewell had launched against Atticus and his home is a mystery and an appalling example of irresponsible parenting.<br /><br />I don't know if I would have enjoyed this had I read it rather than listened to it. It was entertaining to begin with, then got boring, then became entertaining again. Roses Pritchard did a good job or representing the older Scout reminiscing.<br /><br />Thestory isn't a really great story, and some negative reviews I've read call it out correctly in some regards, but to me a story is either worth reading (a five-star) or it isn't (a zero-star represented by a one-star since zero isn't an option). Yes the characters were a bit flat, and yes it was a very black and white story in more than one way, but did it entertain me? Yes!<br /><br />Another complaint I read was that there was no character growth, but to me, character growth is over-rated! I don't need a character to grow in a story (unless they're really awful to begin with in which case growth is a requirement!). All I need is for the characters to be entertaining. Indeed, some stories which have entertained me well are enjoyable in part because the character doesn't change. In this case I neither expected it nor needed it, and I considered this one a worthy read - or more accurately, a worthy listen.",2014-11-16

To Kill A Mockingbird has always been one of my favourite classics of all time. I first read the book back in college, but I've read many excerpts in high school. Reading it again now, at 26 years old, my God the emotional impact it had on me was not one I expected - especially given the fact that I've read this before and pretty much know everything that happens!<br /><br />Rereading it also gives me the opportunity to finally write the review it deserves.<br /><br />Harper Lee created a masterpiece novel, one that is very simple in its form, but very profound in its impact. Told completely from a child's point of view, Scout Finch, we are taken on a journey that could absolutely take your breath away - if you allow it.<br /><br />Scout Finch is quite a special little girl, who does not know how to filter her thoughts, and is quite outspoken and honest. She's also known to get violent if angered. And she usually only gets angry if you insult her or someone she loves. Although this book may be known as a courtroom drama, it's really anything but. Yes, the father, Atticus Finch is a lawyer, a good one at that. And yes, there is a brief section that occurs almost completely in a courtroom, but the importance of this novel is in the events that happen before and after the courtroom scenes.<br /><br />I will admit, reading the first section was a little tiresome, what with descriptions of one summer after the other and how Scout and Jem spent their time and their efforts in trying to lure the mysterious, never-seen Boo Radley out of his home. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the conversations the kids would have with their father, who never shied from telling them the truth as it is, teaching them valuable life lessons in the process.<br /><br />As the story progressed, and the case took precedence in the events of the book, I was absolutely fascinated by the character development that these kids went through, especially Jem as we see him grow up right before our eyes. When Mayella Ewell accuses Tom Robinson of rape, in the eyes of most of the white people of Maycomb, Tom has been tried, convicted and is awaiting execution. Judge Taylor disagrees, and asks Atticus to take Tom's case.<br /><br />The one scene where the kids go looking for their dad at night and find him guarding the prisoner to protect him from mobs that seeks to lynch Tom Robinson at the jail. Scout instinctively runs to her dad to try and save him from the violence of those confused, morally torn apart men and speaks to Walter Cunningham, asking him about his son and trying to be polite like her father taught her to be. Mr. Cunningham displays his human goodness when Scout’s politeness compels him to disperse the men at the jail. That scene brought tears to my eyes and filled me with so much love and admiration for that little girl but also for the father who raised these children.<br /><br />This is such a compelling story full of heart. The ending, although read before, still made me emotional.<br /><br />I love this book, and I cannot recommend it enough.development that these kids went through, especially Jem as we see him grow up right before our eyes.

Scout is a very interesting character and showcases the innocence of a child growing up and experiencing new things. It's also very catchy because it is an older Scout telling the story of her childhood. I think the story has a very good flow and the story keeps us attached. It doesn't quite get too boring and gives us an idea of the period of time and its culture as well. There isn't much racism where I live, and in this period of time too, so it gives a look in the past from a child's eyes which is really interesting. The mystery in the story about Boo also is awesome since we keep wanting to know more and more about him and see him like the kids too. Near the ending where Boo was finally shown was also a nice touch and the ending itself was very nice and simple. The way the story was told also had some flashbacks in between here and there adding on to the nice flow. I really liked this book.",2014-10-19

I believe this lack of discussion was my parents’ attempt to not encourage any form of prejudice in their children while they simultaneously battled the rooted effects of engrained prejudice within themselves. I respect their choices but recognize now how sorely unprepared this parenting style left me when I finally stepped out into the real world and witnessed the turmoil race/prejudice continues to cause in our country. I was naive and had no comprehension of the underlying effects of it. My lack of understanding lead to a lack of compassion. By the time I was part way through high school I had very little patience for “the race card”.<br /><br />Then, like most high schoolers, I was assigned to read and analyze Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mocking Bird. At the time books spoke to me in a way I myself hardly understood. I felt a strong kinship with Scout from the get go and immersed myself in her story. Before long I was surprised at how deeply this book began to effect me. I started to view some of the issues within our society with a drastic new lenses. I had a long way to go but it was a start. Scout had given me the chance I needed to openly discuss and analyze formally taboo topics. I was finally able to process the information I had been given and use it in a manner that helped shape the woman I am today.<br /><br />I like to believe that even if I hadn’t read this book I would have been able to draw similar conclusions through other means.

It is so engaging that the exploits of Scout and Jem and their friend, Dill, are so fresh in my eyes even tho' I have read this novel many times. There were many scenes that touched me. The children's curiosity and innocence uncovered life in Maycomb, a town in Deep South America in the 1930s. There were the Cunningham's insistence, in spite of their poverty, to pay for the help that Scout's and Jem's father had given them. There was Jem's defence of his father in the latter's fight for justice and fairness. The courtroom scene depicted societal divisions in terms of race and economic status but that people regardless of background recognised and respected decent human behaviour. This was so moving when people stood up as Atticus exited from the court after defending Tom. Finally, there was Tom and his reaction when he lost his fight for justice against the accusations of raping a white woman. I find it difficult to find fault in this novel. If I were picky, I'd say that some of the words and therefore, Scout's perception of what she witnessed and felt were sometimes not those of a child.

The story begins with a young girl named Scout telling the story of how her brother Jem broke his arm.  Early on the story focuses on a man named Boo Radley who never seems to come out of his house.  The children, Scout, Jem, and their friend Dill, have thoughts, some scary, of what he is like and why he never comes out.  As the story proceeds Boo appears to be doing some nice things for the children though the reader is never told for sure that it is Boo.  The story then leaves Boo but I never had a doubt that he would come back into the story somewhere though I did not know how.  The story then focuses on the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman.  Scout and Jems’ father, Atticus, is the black man’s lawyer.  The trial part of the story highlights the extent of racial prejudice that existed at this time in a Southern town such as Maycomb.  The trial is viewed through the eyes of the children who can clearly see the injustice associated with the trial because of the racial prejudice in the town.  How can children see the injustice and adults cannot?  The book draws you in with the Boo story in the beginning and then the trial story in the middle.  The end brings the two together.  The story gives the reader a lesson in history but also some life lessons such as not judging people before you know them and, even though there is evil in the world, there is also a wealth of good and sometimes where you don’t expect it.",2014-09-21

By using the perspectives of Scout, Jem, and Dill, Harper Lee is able to bring to light serious social issues using the wit only a child character could get away with and still be sincere. Strangely enough, I find many of the social aspects of this book still relevant today. Sure, we, as a society, would like to think we have moved beyond all these social stigmas...but have we REALLY?? We still encounter people everyday who believe they are &#34; above others&#34; simply because they we born rich or privileged. We still look down our noses at people who utilize the welfare system and we are fully aware that there are those in our society that abuse the welfare system, have no ambition to be anything more, and yet feel they are entitled to many things.

It reads, &#34;Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.&#34;<br /><br />From this point on one is taken on a journey spanning several years.  Although our protagonist grows up quite a bit along the way, never do we venture outside the small Alabama community of Maycomb, where this saga takes place. Scout is a young Alabama girl, a tomboy at that, who does all the things that most tomboys do, along with her brother Jem, four years her senior, and Dill, who professes his love for her.  Meanwhile they all end up in the rafters of the courthouse, watching Jem and Scout's lawyer father defend a black man from an all white jury (we are never told that it is all white, but I am assuming it is), who eventually find the accused guilty of rape of a white woman.<br /><br />The message of this book is many fold, but it is a message about the loss of innocence as seen through the eyes of one 8 year old in a small, Alabama town.  It is also written at a time when America is waking up to the collective cruelties left over from slavery, and the adverse effects of Jim Crow laws.  It takes place in the pre-civil rights South.<br /><br />Academy award presentations to lawyer Atticus Finch for his great speech in front of a packed courthouse, in which he summons the ghost of Thomas Jefferson, who once said (he probably said it many, many times) that &#34;all men are created equal.&#34;  Actually, Atticus argues, not all men are created equal, but as long as they are in his courthouse, they will be treated equally.  The courthouse, he argues, is the great equalizer, reducing all before it to the same common denominator, to the same fair treatment, if you will.<br /><br />This speech of his one must juxtapose with the thoughts of his children who wonder aloud why prosecuting attorneys have to be so rough on the witnesses.  Atticus tells them that that is simply the way lawyers operate.  There is no inner hate, although there surely seems to be when listening to them scream and yell at the witnesses.  Still, Jem and his sister Scout stomp around and stuff their faces in their pillows wondering why, why why?  Why do people have to be so cruel.<br /><br />There is haunted house kung fu, rednecks drinking moonshine, verbal threats, mad dogs, an old woman on morphine, poor black people, poor white people, fussy ladies in corsets sipping tea, colonial mansions with front porches anchored by white columns on both ends, the town hermit, the town haunted house, tobacco chewing good ole boys, but most of all there are three kids discovering the world, not getting into any serious trouble, and in the background is the calm, yet solid, voice of reason, delivered by Atticus himself.

We meet various characters; many will matter for the central drama of the book, but a few matter only for their own stories. We hear a distant storm coming, and we know what, in that time and place, will presumably be coming.<br /><br />The tragedy comes, and we see the people of the town and countryside react - some as you might predict, some not. As events unfold, we see a remarkable characterization of a place, a time, and the individuals who live there, and then.<br /><br />Through it all, we also see our narrator, Scout, start to grow up. We see her older brother grow up a little more. Their father, Atticus Finch, is a model of heroism in a prejudiced small-town – but that understates who he is. The women in town, some of whom we like and some of whom we don’t, help Scout come to understand Atticus as a man of many virtues and keen insight into the human condition.<br /><br />Lee tells the story in Scout’s voice, who is recalling events of her childhood. Jumping back and forth between a child’s discovery and an adult’s wisdom, Lee achieves a rich narrative that touches on many different themes both personal and political. A stunning achievement.",2014-08-24

The class I was to instruct was a Freshmen English class, a subject which is just outside my chosen endorsement of history. Though outside my endorsement, I have always had a passion for literature and was excited at the prospect of teaching the course. My enthusiasm dwindled when I discovered I would be instructing 'To Kill A Mockingbird' (TKAM) and 'Romeo and Juliet', two pieces I was less than thrilled about.<br /><br />So, before stepping into the classroom I took it upon myself to re-read both of these classics, hoping to spark some enthusiasm I could then carry into the classroom. My previous impression of the book vanished within days of picking up a fresh copy and re-reading it. How I ever could have thought this book was boring or irrelevant is beyond me. My only explanation is the depressing conclusion that my high school English teacher squashed the life out of it and killed any joy I may have had in reading it.<br /><br />With this in mind, I set about the task of doing the absolute best I could to not destroy my own students possibility of enjoying the work.<br /><br />TKAM is told from the personal perspective of Miss Jean Louise Finch, or Scout. She is, at the time the narration begins, about 6 years old. However, it becomes clear that the narrative thread is actually being conveyed by a much older Scout, a grown woman who is writing and reflecting on the events of her childhood. This makes for a wonderfully insightful work. We get to see the reasoning and thinking of a child, balanced by the calm reflections of the narrator.<br /><br />Scout, Atticus, Jem, Dill, Boo Radley, and the rest of Maycomb County, Alabama are fully realized and unique characters. It is only as an adult that I appreciated the grittiness, liberality, and childlike love seen in the book. Each chapter is loaded with so many discussion points that I had an absolute blast working through it with the class.<br /><br />As an educator, one of the first chapters struck me the hardest. The poignant observations about institutionalized education killing any sense of inquisitiveness and wonder were on-point and mostly accurate. At one point, Scout is told not to read at home, lest she learn the incorrect way. Her instructor tells her to only learn in class because Scout's father is not a trained educator; he may instruct her wrong. I emphasized this to the class heavily, and was flabbergasted when I discovered that one of the other teachers in the English department had told her own students they were not to read ahead. All reading of TKAM must be done in class.<br /><br />I believe this instructor was well-meaning and likely effective, but lacks the requisite reflectiveness to recognize her own hypocrisy. This anecdote only affirmed the timelessness of Harper Lees book. &#34;Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.&#34;<br /><br />In short, TKAM is an amazing piece of American literature that I did not appreciate as a child, due to my youthfulness and the dull nature of my instructor. As an adult I find it loaded to the brim with beauty and poignant observations. When Scouts eyes slowly filled with tears in the final pages of the book, I found my own doing the same.<br /><br />A great read not to be missed.",2014-08-06

Told from the viewpoint of the main character, Scout Finch, who, with her brother, are raised by their widower father, Atticus Finch, who is a lawyer.  You get a view of all the various types of people who comprise just about any town in this country - poor white trash, blacks, average whites, etc.  And a view of how these widely different folks cohabitate and how they get along.  You see racism, you see double racism, you see a father teaching his children thru his own example that all folk are equal and must be treated fairly and equally, regardless.  And along the way, you are treated to the antics of young Scout & her brother Jem as they traverse the paths of childhood with their pal Dill, and how they deal with the myriad obstacles all youths go through and the lessons they learn along the way.  This novel is gripping and runs the gamut from laughter to thought-provoking occurences, to the &#34;bad side&#34; of life, to the things that scare us and how these kids confronted their fears.  I have probably read this novel 100 times over the years and it never disappoints.  Every reading has been as interesting as if I had never read it before.  It is, without a doubt, a true classic and contains such &#34;lessons in life&#34; that it really should be required reading in high school and college.",2014-06-25

Finding a Kindle version available at long last just made my day.<br /><br />The story itself is a classic tale of an ordinary hero, the quietly honorable and wise Atticus Finch.  For those few who aren't familiar with the plot, the basics can be found in the Editorial Reviews section.  TKAM is a very readable, entertaining story that contributed to the moral compass my parents had already instilled in me.  As such, it has always served as something of a touchstone against which to measure my actions, values and fundamental beliefs by asking the question - with no disrespect intended - what would Atticus do?<br /><br />Lee's uncomplicated storytelling style paints a vivid picture of a small, Southern, Depression-era town.  Anyone who has ever visited or lived in the South can almost physically feel the humid heat conveyed by Lee's lyrical description:<br /><br />\\""Somehow it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer's day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square.  Men's stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning.  Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o'clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.\\""<br /><br />And Lee's sardonic humor shows through again and again, as in this passage:<br /><br />\\""Being Southerners, it was a source of shame to some members of the family that we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the Battle of Hastings.  All we had was Simon Finch, a fur-trapping apothecary from Cornwall whose piety was exceeded only by his stinginess.  In England, Simon was irritated by the persecution of those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more liberal brethren, and as Simon called himself a Methodist, he worked his way across the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica, thence to Mobile and up the Saint Stephens... [He] established a line that ran high to daughters.  Simon lived to an impressive age and died rich.\\""<br /><br />And in this one:<br /><br />\\""When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and began his practice... His first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the Maycomb County jail.  Atticus had urged them to accept the state's generosity in allowing them to plead Guilty to second-degree murder and escape with their lives, but they were Haverfords, in Maycomb County a name synonymous with jack[censored].  The Haverfords had dispatched Maycomb's leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare, were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three witnesses, and insisted that the-son-of-a-[censored]-had-it-coming-to-him was a good enough defense for anybody... so there was nothing much Atticus could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that was probably the beginning of my father's profound distaste for the practice of criminal law.\\""<br /><br />The tale is told through the eyes of Atticus's daughter Jean Louise \\""Scout\\"" Finch, a tomboy who trails after and often butts heads with brother Jem, her elder by four years.  Both children dote on Atticus because he is fair and just and answers their every question honestly in a way their children's minds can comprehend.  Atticus uses their questions as opportunities to teach Scout and Jem how to think through, weigh and apply past lessons already learned, so that their conclusions are their own and not just what they've been told to believe.<br /><br />Even before Tom Robinson's trial teaches them how such a simple concept as equal justice can be a matter of controversy and divisiveness for some, other events occur that help them grasp the bedrock character traits that have made Atticus so unique and almost universally respected, even by those who disagree with him.  For example, after watching the sheriff insist that Atticus be the one to shoot a rabid dog threatening the neighborhood, they learn for the first time that their father was known as Ol' One-Shot.  As another character explains: \\""Why, down at the Landing when he was coming up, if he shot fifteen times and hit fourteen doves he'd complain about wasting ammunition... I think maybe he put his gun down when he realized that God had given him an unfair advantage over most living things.  I guess he decided he wouldn't shoot until he had to, and he had to today.\\""<br /><br />TKAM is a coming of age story that shows Jem and Scout's path from the pure innocence of childhood to the hard realities of the time and place they inhabit, one where a good man can be presumed guilty of a heinous crime he did not commit at the instigation of a bad man who is both self-serving and cowardly. While Atticus is the beacon Jem and Scout follow through these tumultuous events, there are other,  complementary influences that help to shape them, most notably their African-American housekeeper Calpurnia, who teaches them honesty, civility and respect for self and others; and their neighbor Miss Maudie, who provides comfort, sympathy and context for understanding what they're living through.  Through the children's  interactions with Atticus, Calpurnia, Maudie and their father's younger brother Jack in particular one can see the seeds of justice and fairness being planted in Scout's young psyche and already beginning to put off shoots by tale's end.<br /><br />Some other characters, who lack Atticus Finch's native wisdom and ability to walk in another person's shoes, do yet rise to the occasion when circumstances demand it: the unapologetically racist newspaper owner Mr. Underwood who sits at his upstairs window watching the scene outside the jail between Atticus and a small mob intent on delivering their own brand of \\""justice\\"" to the incarcerated Tom Robinson, with his shotgun at the ready in case they try to do Atticus harm; Walter Cunningham, a member of that jailhouse mob who afterwards is more receptive to really hearing the evidence of Tom's innocence, because of Scout's guileless conversation with him when she and Jem unexpectedly and much to Atticus's horror burst onto the scene; the no-nonsense Judge Taylor, who assigns Tom's case to Atticus, knowing it's Tom's only hope for anything like a fair trial; even Augusta, Scout's terror of an aunt who relentlessly tries to mend Scout's tomboyish ways and disapproves of Atticus taking Tom's case but stays with and supports the family from the lead-up to the trial through to its aftermath.<br /><br />Woven throughout is the story of Scout and Jem's friendship with Dill Harris, an odd little kid whose character is loosely based on Lee's childhood friend Truman Capote.  For all intents and purposes, Dill was emotionally abandoned by his divorced parents and has just begun spending summers with his aunt in Maycomb as the story opens.  The three kids spend the halcyon summer days re-enacting their favorite stories and trying to catch glimpses of Boo Radley, a mysterious neighbor transformed by their overactive imaginations into a bloodthirsty, night-stalking monster.<br /><br />TKAM's denouement ties all these story threads up together into a soul-satisfying conclusion that reaffirms the underlying moral of the story, that it's a sin to kill a mockingbird because mockingbirds cause no harm and do nothing but bring joy to the world with their song.",2014-06-22

There are shops that sell books in the English language but I found a copy in my friends house and borrowed it 'cause I was in the mood to read a book and had heard the title and recognized it as a &#34;classic&#34;.<br /><br />Now I don't generally like to spoil the story for anyone. I feel like the less you know about a story, when you start, the better. The author didn't write the story with the assumption that you had a summary of it before you began reading. She would like to be the first to introduce you to every little aspect of this story so I'll not discuss plots. Besides, if great books have something in common, it's not the stories that they tell, but rather the depth of the characters within them. Great books manage to introduce the essence of each character in a way that makes you feel like you know them and care about everything that happens to them. When the story ends, it feels like you have just lost a dear friend. You want to follow them and know more about them but you can't.<br /><br />Harper Lee, was a tomboy much like the character of Scout in the story. In fact there are a lot of autobiographical elements in the book. Apparently &#34;Scout's friend Dill was inspired by Lee's childhood friend and neighbor, Truman Capote, while Lee, in turn, is the model for a character in Capote's first novel, Other Voices, Other Rooms.  While Lee has downplayed autobiographical parallels in the book, Truman Capote, mentioning the character Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, described details he considered biographical: &#34;In my original version of Other Voices, Other Rooms I had that same man living in the house that used to leave things in the trees, and then I took that out. He was a real man, and he lived just down the road from us. We used to go and get those things out of the trees. Everything she wrote about it is absolutely true. But you see, Itake the same thing and transfer it into some Gothic dream, done in an entirely different way.&#34;<br /><br />What I discovered in the pages of this book was adventure, inspiration and friendship. Yes friendship… It was like meeting and developing a close friendships with the characters, and I am influenced by these characters, just as, in life, you get influenced sometimes by your friends or family. This happens very rarely to me, and I'm jealous of anyone who has not yet read this book. I'm jealous because of the surprise and awe that they still have waiting for them when they eventually get round to opening the pages of &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34;.",2014-06-20

[...]    I first read To Kill A Mockingbird in high school and have always been entranced by the title. I picked up the book this time with the intention of finally getting to the bottom of the mockingbird imagery.    It was this line on page of 119 of my edition that sparked my interest:    \\""...but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\""    Harper explains through Miss Maudie:  \\""Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't end up in people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird\\"" (119).    Scout, looking back on her childhood as a full-grown adult, realizes that many of her memories were painted in pure black and white before Atticus's famous case. Atticus was right, Dill was her fiancee, and Boo Radley was scary. As Scout grows, the colors begin to blend together into shades of grey, but one motif continues to rise above them all: innocence.    For Scout, innocence is something she's never had to consider until the case. There was right, wrong, black and white. Innocence itself shifts the book from these two primary colors into something much murkier, causing Scout to finally examine things from all angles, including her own beliefs and the culture around her. The mockingbird, to me, is a symbol of innocence. They don't do anything but \\""sing their hearts out,\\"" which is seen as a innocent and heartwarming pastime (119). Other birds may ruin, disorder, or corrupt, but the mockingbird does none of these things and therefore remains above others.    As to who the mockingbird directly represents, I couldn't say for certain. One this read, the mockingbird imagery doesn't fit one particular character - it brought out the pure white, the innocent, in a few different characters and occasionally highlighted the darkness in others.    Sometimes I read these novels again and feel like nothing has changed from myfirst read in high school/college/whenever. I had forgotten the poignancy of To Kill A Mockingbird. Just in my quick read, I've found a few moments where I have to sit the book down and just think about the magic and profoundness of the book I've just read.

The way Lee depicts the life of a Southern family during the Depression is truly amazing.

The book takes us three years into the life of scout which is punctuated by the arrest and trial of a black man accused of rape on a white woman. Although a big part of the book is the trial, Harper covers many themes which defined Scout's life.

The book shows the “small-town-story” with the mystery of the town shut in and the story being told by a young girl. The story is told without the biases that older narrators can bring, making the story seem pure and innocent. The tension between the characters that is captured in the pages of To Kill a Mockingbird keeps readers interested in every character’s next move, whether it is curiosity surrounding Boo Radley or about the Tom Robinson case. The story keeps you guessing with every turn of a page.<br /> There were many characters in To Kill a Mockingbird, but only some of them are present throughout the entire story and the drama of the book. As the plot unfolds, Scout, the main character and narrator, begins to develop her personality and begins to understand more about what is happening around her. She begins to form her own opinions on things that are happening in the town. Jem, Scout’s older brother, begins to mature and would rather spend time alone than with Scout, which kind of throws a wrench in their relationship that had been really close before. Atticus, the children’s father, is also present throughout most of the story. Atticus is a lawyer and is cool and collected whenever confronted with a problem, even those he has as a single father. The personalities of these characters intermingle together to give the story a plot that keeps you turning pages.<br /> The plot of this novel is pretty suspenseful from beginning to end. With the mysterious “Boo” Radley living next door to Jem and Scout, they are almost always trying to devise a plan to catch a glimpse of this town shut-in. Meanwhile, the court case that Atticus is assigned to darkens the corners of the book and is a classic black vs. white case. It draws a lot of attention to the Finch family that is quite unwanted. This case keeps the story interesting, especially from Scout’s point of view because she is so young and only understands part of what is actually taking place. The racial tension that is the base of this court case really begins to bother the children.<br /> The racial tension makes things really intense during the court case, especially the way that the children react to the treatment of blacks. The children are raised in a society where there is no respect for blacks, but they find out how repulsive the way that some white people treat blacks really is. That makes Scout’s point of view really interesting because she sees things that not all of the people in the story notice or even care about.<br /> In conclusion, To Kill a Mockingbird is a really good book and should be read by anyone who wants to understand how racial tension that actually was present in the south in the 1930’s. If I were to rate this book, I would give it a 4.5 out of 5, the only thing that I don’t like about the entire story was how hard it was to understand the old-time-drawl at the beginning of the story, but I really loved the story and the scenes that were brought to the attention of the readers. The theme, plot, and characters intertwine in a delicate web that makes a book into a page turning story that should be devoured by everyone.<br /><br />Jocalyn",2014-03-13

This encourages children to push all their chips into the pot on doing something just once and hoping it to be a cash cow for the rest of their lives. Lee never wrote another book and because it is clear breeding in this nation continues, she can always expect to sell 250,000 copies a year, thus ensuring a robust return. Our special and unique children will learn that they really must only do something well once to reap the rewards. (Most will even be issued a special ribbon just for having read a book.)<br /><br />Second, we must always remind teens that white people are racists. Always. This is very important. Even if the white person is performing CPR on someone who identifies as a minority, that white person is racist. And this book will teach that. Though Atticus Finch defended Tom Robinson, we all know that the case was lost because Atticus was white. If Robinson had had Johnnie Cochran, he would have walked. A white public defender just isn't going to go that extra mile to clear him. He was too busy being a parent or being spat upon to concern himself with a defense. Racism.<br /><br />And finally, teens should have to read this novel, or see the movie as reading is no longer encouraged as reading can impact the self-esteem of those who do not read so well, to learn that engaging with crazy people is a good thing. Yes, all people should be sure to get involved with recluses. Because nothing pleases the borderline sociopathic more than having visitors. And when that person goes bats*** and stabs a lawyer, we will ignore it because... really... a lawyer... does anyone miss John Edwards? So, kids, be sure to get to know your local recluse.

She describes the dramatic events that take place in little Maycomb, all the while sounding exactly like the child she is, keeping the reader laughing at her simple logic. There are so many aspects that make this novel great but I believe it was Harper Lee deciding to use the point of view of a child that MADE this novel what is continues to be today. Scout is not yet tainted by an adult’s judgement and as so sees things more clearly than any adult would. For example, she more or less brings to light her teacher’s hypocrisy when her teacher says that Hitler is wrong for discriminating against Jews when the teacher in fact indulges in her own prejudices against blacks. What I love is that we truly grow with Scout; through her innocent, easy days to the days where she realized that humanity has a great capacity for evil, however she never once loses her spirit and through this we see that humanity can combat evils with simple kindness. (There are countless great scenes with Scout but my favorite would have to be when she stops a mob of men intending to hurt her father simply by showing them kindness).<br /><br />Atticus– I consider Atticus the main character of the novel even though it is not told from his point of view, proof of this is Lee who was originally going to title the novel Atticus but then changed her mind. We needed Scout’s perspective to give us child’s logic, but it was Atticus that showed us the depths of humanity. We saw a good man struggle but all the while trying the best that he could. He is the type of man who actually lives by his morals instead of just saying that he does, “he acts the same way he does out in public as he does in his home.” We watch as Atticus does only right, his friends (and even certain family members) turn on him. Everything he does, he does with the intent of making his children proud. “Before Jem looks at anyone elsehe looks at me, and I’ve tried to live so I can look squarely back at him.” It’s because of Atticus that Jem and Scout grew up with clarity and compassion. Oddly enough his children don’t idolize him in the beginning of the novel because he is different from other fathers, but by the end they realize that it is this difference that makes him heroic. Atticus is the person we all strive to be.<br /><br />Jem– Scout being too young to fully absorb the injustice that plays through this novel, Jem reveals the heart-break of childhood when one discovers that justice does not always prevail. In the beginning of the novel Jem’s world is innocent and fun but as the trial plays out evil is introduced into his world and he is forced to face that sometimes you can’t win against it. It’s a tough lesson to learn and Jem changes because of it, stopping Scout from killing a roly poly because it has done nothing to harm her. He is starting to cling to the mockingbird theory, trying to stop evil when he can. The hardest part for me to read was the trial because Jem was so sure and excited for justice to prevail and when it didn’t (even though we saw this through Scout’s eyes) the reader’s heart broke with Jem’s.<br /><br />Review of the Story:<br /><br />The story is… well, it’s so much more than a story. It is a window to humanity. It paints a portrait of the stark reality of our world in the point of view of a child, which is nothing but accurate. Lee’s story is timeless. It’s a tale that all can connect too because the ugly truth about humans is we NEED social outcasts. There will always be discrimination whether it be based on race, sexual orientation or gender but Lee’s novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, shows us that we must do our best in spite of this downfall of humanity. We must fight these evils even if we can’t beat them. To Kill a Mockingbird can be described in so many words: quiet, truthful and genius.<br /><br />Review of the Writing:<br /><br />Harper Lee’s writing is one than any could take in, chew and stir around. She writes so that her meaning is clear though in the context many complex devices lie. For example, symbolism. I found three mockingbird (please tell me if you found more).<br /><br />Tom Robinson– He was innocent and not only that but he bestowed acts of kindness on his accuser on a regular basis<br />Boo Radley– An intelligent child broken (but not all the way) by a cruel father<br />Jem Finch– An innocent who had his world shatter because of the injustice of the trial.<br />She is a brilliant writer adding to her talented aura by not publishing another novel.<br /><br />Rating:<br /><br />People don’t call To Kill a Mockingbird the novel of the century for nothing. Harper Lee wrote the novel that can sum up humanity in three hundred or so pages. She talked about harsh truths and good morals all the while keeping us laughing. (I love the part where Jem claims the Egyptians gave us a whole lot of important stuff– like toilet paper). My only wish is that Harper Lee had published another novel.",2014-02-17

Narrated by a 6-8 year old girl named Jean Louise Finch (called Scout) who scorns the idea of ever becoming a lady--the story depicts a child's gradual awareness of racial tension and stubborn bigotry in the deep South.  She and her older brother, Jem, experience the usual round of kids' fantasies and pranks, Us-against-Grown-Ups mentality in Part One--which serves as a detailed backdrop for the dramatic courtroom confrontations in Part Two.<br /><br />With deliberate casualness the naive narrator menrions an upcoming legal case whose Black defendant will be represented by Scout's quietly dignified father, Atticus. Over the ensuing months she becomes aware that the town and even her extended family are appalled by the calm tenacity of this local lawyer--a man of surprising principle. How can he have sunk so low as to defend with sincere pride a mere Black man against the serious charges leveled by a White (trash) family?<br /><br />Scout comes to admire her middle-aged fathe,r for she is impressed by his morality as both a caring parent and as a trustworthy role model of a human being--sworn to uphold the law. Alone against the entire white community Atticus commands respect in a packed courtroom (\\""stand up, child,--yo father's passin..\\""). She realizes that he is magnificient in his own quiet way and fearlessly rises to defend an innocent Black man with patience, logic and cool conviciton under legal duress. Truly, he is a father to be justly proud of! Defying the court of (warped) public opinion Atticus demonstrates convincing tenacity--sure to yield a NOT GUILTY verdict. But the wheels of Mississippi justice are warped and rusted. An enduring read which offers poignant human truths for all ages.",2014-02-07

Its enriching content really speaks to the reader, and tells a great story. It's honestly one of the best books I've ever read.<br />  For me, this book symbolizes the power of not giving up. Of fighting for what you believe to be right. Standing up for others around you. This book tells the story of a family, with a father as an attorney, defending a man, who is believed to be guilty of doing a crime, which he didn't do. Something that really drew me in was towards the end of the book, when Scout about how nice people were, and Atticus replied that &#34;Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.&#34; It shows the generosity some their family gave to others.<br />  At first, when I started reading this book, I honestly didn't like it as much. I thought the first chapter was boring and didn't have enough detail to draw me in to read the rest of the book. As I continued to read though, I started liking the book more, because each chapter became more interesting than the rest. Throughout the story, the plot wasn't the same.

Many great quotes that I have used are spoken by Atticus, Atticus is such a virtuous man that spreads his wisdom and morals to his children and the community. The false conviction and untimely death of Tom Robinson definitely was the climax in the novel and it actually made me really depressed that an innocent man can go to jail because of his colour, even though there was no incriminating evidence. But, Lee wanted to get the reader emotional over Tom to provoke the idea that these kind of convictions happened and unfortunately still happen.

If you have never read To Kill a Mockingbird, go ahead and crack it open.  Set in 1935, in the fictional town of Macomb, Alabama, Harper Lee writes of people and family, of prejudice against blacks, of judgment and justice, of lost innocence, and of heroes.<br /><br />Harper Lee uses the voice of young Scout Finch to tell this story and Scout’s observations, which are sometimes naïve and always smart, give us an insider’s view into the complicated relationships that exist between blacks and whites, between the poor and the poorer, and between the educated, the illiterate and the ignorant.<br /><br />Like many other readers, I love Atticus Finch’s character.  He’s wise and humble and kind and hides nothing from Scout and her older brother Jem.  He treats them as adults and they have a maturity beyond their years because of it.<br /><br />Besides Atticus, Scout and Jem, there are many characters to like for their wisdom and kindness – Calpurnia, Boo Radley, Miss Maudie Atkinson, for example.  There are many to dislike because they are prejudiced or ignorant – Mr. Avery, Mrs. Merriweather, Miss Stephanie Crawford, Aunt Alexandra.  And there is one to hate, Bob Ewell, whose accuses a young black man, Tom Robinson, of raping his daughter and whose own hatred towards blacks and most of the town of Macomb takes this story into the courtroom.<br /><br />Here’s my advice if you’re in high school and you’re reading this for the first time.  Take the time to know what’s going on.  Use a guide to keep track of the characters.  Go back and re-read what you didn’t get the first time.  Why?  Because once you get the frame of the story in your head, you will start to understand the meaning of Harper Lee’s words and you will discover how invested you’ve become in these characters.  Once you reach that point, you will find yourself reacting to them as if they were real people, and you will discover that their events and actions in this book cross over from fiction to reality.  That’s great writing!e.  Why?

Mainly, we get to know various characters of a poor little Alabama town during the Depression, their peculiar rituals and class and racial prejudices, and their sometimes redeeming acts of generosity. In this, it is more like Mark Twain's Adventures of Tom Sawyer, another child's-eye view of a southern small town told as a series of anecdotes, than like Twain's later and more tightly structured Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.<br /><br />Scout's most piquant observations of hypocrisy, neurosis, arrogance, or cowardice are of the white folks she knows best. But she also reports with fascination the courage and kindness of a few individuals, including especially her father Atticus Finch, a neighbor woman, Maudie, and the Finches' black maid Calpurnia. A particularly beautiful moment is Scout's visit with Calpurnia to her First Purchase AME Church, a revelation to this protected white girl of black devotion and dignity and a whole community close by but separate from the little white hamlet.<br /><br />The book is best remembered for one episode that is expanded to extend over several chapters and which is a pleasing, though historically misleading fable: the trial of a black laborer accused of rape of a poor white woman, and his defense by Scout's father Atticus. Sadly, nothing like the judicial fairness of the Maycomb judge, the opportunity of the defendant to legal defense and serious cross-examination of the plaintiff ever happened or could happen in Alabama in the 1930s in a black-on-white rape case. What Harper Lee evidently had in mind when she wrote it was the famous Scottsboro Boys trial in 1933, where no such judicial niceties occurred. But there were defense attorneys — mostly northerners — who, a bit like Atticus Finch in the novel, made the effort, often at the risk of their own lives.<br /><br />But it is the voice that saves this and all the stories in the book. You have to love this tomboy when she tells you in a hurt voice that, when she tried to hold her big brother back from some dangerous adventure, &#34;Jem told me I was being a girl…&#34; Or when she observes, back in her white church, &#34;the Impurity of Women doctrine that seemed to preoccupy all clergymen.&#34;n the novel, made the effort, often at the risk of their own lives.<br /><br />But it is the voice that saves this and all the stories in the book.

I thought I was reading a book about children, but it turned out I was reading a fancy children's book.  Perhaps I've lost my youthful innocence but I found the first hundred-plus pages of the book to be an absolute bore.  And then Scout and Jem build a snowman.  And then Scout and Jem go to school.  And then Scout and Jem play a make-believe game with Dill.  And then they find some treasures in a tree.  And then they go to school again.  Writers are often motivated by childhood nostalgia, and that's well and good, but like eating an entire bag of Halloween candy in one sitting, there comes a point of gross overindulgence.<br /><br />I think it's worth mentioning that I don't find anything wrong with employing a juvenile narrator.  Two of my favorite books, The Catcher in the Rye and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, are of course narrated by adolescents.  The reason I find those classics so much more successful than To Kill a Mockingbird is because Salinger and Twain told their stories with the language native to a young person while limiting their observations to those that Holden Caulfield and Huckleberry Finn were likely to have.  Harper Lee, on the other hand, seemed to want it both ways.  She wanted the voice and perspective of a 1st person child narrator and 3rd person omniscience whenever she felt she needed it.  In my opinion that doesn't work.  A writer must choose one or the other.<br /><br />Halfway through the book we at last stumble upon the meat of the story, and it's really quite juicy.  Truth be told, I thoroughly enjoyed the trial scene, but afterwards the story seemed to just fizzle away again.  For me the denouement was as tedious and predictable as a sultry summer day in Alabama.  I'm being harsh.  Boo Radley!  Can you ever believe it???<br /><br />Like millions of readers throughout the years, my copy of To Kill a Mockingbird declares it to be a \\""timeless classic\\"".  Despite my criticism I look at those words and I begin to doubt myself.  Certainly something is wrong with me.  My tastes are boorish.  My imagination has atrophied.  I am ignorant of greatness.  I open the book again, read half a page and set it back down.

Harper Lee's courtroom drama has been an inspiration to some of my favorite writers of legal fiction, like Mark Gimenez and John Grisham.  But the bulk of the novel is life in small town America, race relations in the South, and learning about class and wealth and poverty, all through the eyes of a little girl.<br /><br />This is perhaps a story that could only be told from the perspective of a child.  As Scout and her brother Jem grow up, watching their father stand as a voice of reason and justice in a world of unreasonable injustice, we are reminded of what we lose as the innocence of youth slowly wears away.  Atticus is what we should aim to be: fair, patience, selfless, and humble.<br /><br />I was delighted that Elliot will be reading this for freshman English later this year.  I have enjoyed getting to know the story again.  Even as the racist attitudes of the South in the early 20th century seem more and more dated, we don't have to read the news or even listen to our neighbors very long to realize that Harper Lee's story is as important and powerful as ever.",2013-10-29

Harper Lee's famous work discusses two important times in our history: the significance of the Civil Rights movement told through the lens of the injustice of Depression Era Jim Crow laws.  Jem's search for justice mirrors the search for justice our country has sought since its founding.  Lee provocatively highlights injustice on many levels: between the young and the old, the black and the white, the rich and the poor.<br /><br />As an English teacher, I believe \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" provides us with an opportunity to open dialogue with students about justice, privilege and discrimination.  It gives us a chance to help students come to their own understandings about fairness in our country.  As a reader, I believe \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" tells a compelling story in an artful way that gets at the most basic reasons why we read: to be entertained, to think, to consider our values and belief systems.<br /><br />With this book, Harper Lee has done it all.  She has challenged a country with a history of injustice to become just.  She has led us through the coming of age experience.  She has entertained us.  She has introduced us to the words and ways of the South.  She has created a piece of literature that will forever have a place of importance in our country.<br /><br />Maybe she didn't teach me how to kill a mockingbird...she did so much more.",2013-10-09

The varying threads of the extended family, the central trial and its fallout, Dill, Boo Radley, Miss Maudie's fire, a rabid dog were all given a fair amount of time and the right amount of detail.

I'm sure you've all read this one by now, right?  If you haven't, you need to drop what you're doing and go read it right now.  Like many others, I first read To Kill a Mockingbird in high school.  I vaguely remember enjoying the story back then but I was at an age where I didn't really appreciate books the way I do now.  I am now proud to have a copy in my own personal library and was pleased to find this audio edition at my local library.  This is the kind of book you can enjoy again and again.<br /><br />Every time I pick up To Kill a Mockingbird again, it's like coming home to family.  I sympathize with Atticus Finch, a single father, who struggles to bring up his children in a world full of hatred and prejudice.  I look on as a proud father as Jem strives to become the kind of man his father is.  I can only shake my head and laugh at the antics of Scout.  And my heart leaps for joy every time Boo Radley comes to the rescue.  Harper Lee's amazing characters are as alive today as they were 50 years ago.<br /><br />Written in 1960, To Kill A Mockingbird discusses many topics that are as valuable to us today as they were fifty years ago, and I'm not just talking about racism here, I'm talking about basic human dignity: having respect for yourself and for others.  What I like most about Harper Lee's classic is the intimate snapshot it gives us of life in the post-depression era south.  Not the kind of stuff you'd find in a history book, but the actual daily lives of the people.  Harper Lee captured it beautifully.<br /><br />To Kill A Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1961, and is still part of the curriculum in many schools, as it was in my own.<br /><br />I can't imagine a better voice for Scout Finch than Sissy Spacek.  Spacek's mild southern accent fits the audiobook very well, naturally, since the story takes place in the south.  Also, Scout Finch can be rather sassy at times, and Sissy Spacek portrayed the part very well.  If you want to hear more audiobooks narrated by Sissy Spacek, check out Stephen King's Carrie.<br /><br />If you went to school anytime in the last fifty years, you've probably already read To Kill A Mockingbird.

Four years of advanced English in high school and it was the one book I read out of the 4 books per year assigned. Then in college it was yet assigned again and I enjoyed the book yet again.<br />There is so much to learn from this book. I get something new everytime I pick it up and thoroughly enjoy the story everytime. Every character in this book are wonderfully written. I even took the time to watch a documentary about the book and the movie. Found it interesting that the character Dill is based off of Truman Capote who was childhood friends with Harper Lee.<br />Atticus is full of knowledge that he passes on to his children such as: don't judge a person unless you step into their shoes and walk around in them and it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because they don't harm anyone but sing beautiful songs. I always see Tom Robinson as that mockingbird because he hasn't done anything wrong.<br />My favorite part is in front of the jailhouse when the lynching mob comes for Robinson and Atticus is sitting there waiting for them. It is the innocence of childhood that stops the mob from proceeding with Scout saying Ain't you Walter's pa...could you say hey to him. That little bit of her acknowledging his boy in such a positive light is enough for him to turn to the others and say they should leave and go home.<br />I have to purchase another copy as my copy is so worn that 3/4 of the pages have fallen out making it difficult to read anymore and I want to enjoy it again.",2013-07-10

What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.<br /><br />This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events.

For some of us, such as myself, we've read it more than once. With 3 years in between visits with Scout, Atticus, and Tom Robinson, I understood a lot more when I met them the second time. At the awkward stage-rich age of twelve and seventh grade, I still didn't really understand what rape was, and why it was such a huge deal that Mayella was white and Tom was black. But now, with new historical and social knowledge, I understand that blacks and whites just didn't date or even really communicate  with each other for that matter. The 1920 American South's society just didn't accept that.<br /> Reading this book again now, and watching a film on the author has lead me to believe that Harper Lee, the author of To Kill A Mockingbird, and the daughter of a lawyer in her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, gently based this book off her own experiences. It is a commonly known fact that Dill is based off her childhood friend turned famous author, Truman Capote. It is supposed, although not confirmed, that Scout is actually Harper Lee. Lee no longer grants interviews, and is almost like Boo Radley, the mysterious shut in that lives down the street from the Finch family.<br /> In To Kill A Mockingbird, Atticus is given the difficult task of defending a black man, Tom Robinson, in court. Robinson was accused of raping a white trash woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus, described as a man who was born to \\""do our unpleasant jobs,\\"" does everything he can to defend Tom, but still loses because of the biased, racist jury. Although he could have won the appeal, he never got the chance, and Tom was murdered. Innocent, young-minded me didn't understand why anyone would just dislike someone or choose them to be guilty of a crime they didn't commit. To be quite honest, seventh grade me just thought I was smarter than the jury. In a sense, I was like Scout, the unbiased narrator.<br /> In the end, although remaining innocent, Scout has done a fair amount of growing up. She endures much teasing in school, is forced to become a \\""lady\\"" by her Aunt Alexandra, is impacted by two deaths one after another, and is even almost murdered herself. When I was a child of her age, the most exciting thing that had ever happened to me was when I escaped from preschool and crossed Buford Road, while holding my dear friend Ben hostage... Which is still fairly exciting for a three year old, but it was completely incomparable to Scout. I can understand why Scout had the maturity of a teenage at the age of 8 or 9, and I praise Harper Lee for this. With the amount of hardships Scout had been through... It really causes a child to grow up faster. When I read that Phoebe Lou Adams had written, \\""It is impossible, being told in first person by a six year old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult.\\"" I definitely have to disagree on this one. Scout is a very mature young girl, with more horrific experiences than the average adult. She also, as an adult, is recalling the events of her childhood. So obviously an adult would have the prose style of an adult. Duh. Even her first grade teacher, a beautiful, bitter, rule stickler of a young woman, scolds Scout for being educated.<br /> Reading To Kill a Mockingbird again as a 15 year old has really helped me understand Harper Lee's award-winning novel much more. This book, which as sold over 30 million copies in the fifty years it has been in print, is a novel that will influence the lives of readers for many generations to come. I hope my children have the chance to read it more than once in their school career just as I did; once in middle school, and once in high school, just so they can extract all of the valuable life lessons from it at each stage in their development.",2013-05-20

It takes place in a small town in Alabama named Maycomb during the Great Depression. It's based over a three year period of eight year old girl's life. Scout is the narrator of the story. She lives with her father Atticus, her older brother Jem, and their African American cook Calpurnia.<br /> The book begins with Jem and Scout meeting Dill for the first time. He had come to stay with his aunt during the summer until school had started again. The children have many adventures together but their biggest is their obsession with mysterious neighbor Boo Radley. Everyone was afraid of the Radley house so the children would make games of it. After Atticus would sternly suggest that they leave him alone they became more secretive about their attempts to get Boo to come out. While the children are engulfed in their own activities and adventures, Atticus is assigned to defend Tom Robinson in his case. Tom Robinson was and African American being accused of raping Mayella Ewell a young white woman.<br /> As the trial goes on the children seem to forget about Boo for awhile and focus more on the Tom Robinson Case. Once the jury had made their verdict on the case Jem and Scout realized that no everyone had been raised with the same morals as them. After the trial everything seems to go back to normal accept for the constant threats to Atticus for defending and African American. The story ends with Jem and Scout being attacked by the same man that had been threatening Atticus. Boo Radley save the children's lives and all was well again.<br /> My opinion of the story is that it is a must read novel. There are a lot of life lessons to be learned by this novel as well as self morals. If you have to be snatched up by a book in the first paragraph or chapter to be able to read it keep in mind when you start reading because for me it took a few chapters until it got interesting.

Despite its sweetness and naïvet&eacute;, I must say I'm disappointed.<br /><br />I don't think there's a lot of point writing an extensive review at this time.  I'll just say that I'd expected this to be fine literature, when it's more accurate to say it's a fine story for 14 or 15 year-olds; or rather, it would have been back when it was first published in 1960.  Because of the old rumor that it was really a Truman Capote book I expected more.  Clearly this is not a Truman Capote book, and it's difficult to see how it might be mistaken for one.  Unfortunately this novel is nothing but predictable, and worse, it's purple, with unbelievable deaths which are far too convenient for the story's credibility.<br /><br />I might point out that we barely know the black characters in this book at all.<br /><br />Almost certainly this novel tells us far more about those who made it a best-seller in the early 60s than it does about either its subject matter or about Harper Lee.  Perhaps it can be seen as playing a role in advance of the Civil Rights Movement akin to that played by UNCLE TOM'S CABIN before the Civil War.  Worth reading?  I suppose so.  A classic?

I recently read it for the third time and it would be in my top 20 of all-time favorite books.  Atticus Finch is about as fine a man as one would ever find in American literature.  There are some fine people in this book:  Scout, Jem, Miss Maudie, Tom Robinson, Judge Taylor, Underwood, Boo and more.  There is humor, history, family, values and much more.  I was impressed with the white working poor.  Poor farmers who would not accept relief.  Tom Robinson was a married man with a family.  He worked hard and was a credit to the human race.  The Walter Cunninghams and Tom Robinsons of today's world would all be on welfare.  Back then men had a sense of personal pride.  They scraped by (even during the Great Depression) and did not look for handouts.  Today those type of men have become like Robert Ewell.  No count and shiftless and expecting handouts as somehow they are entitled.  All the participants of the Occupy Wall St crowd should read this book but I suppose they'd be too busy living in the &#34;world&#34; of their ipads.  There is so much human dignity in this book.  It is the only book Harper Lee ever published and she hit a home run.  Miss Lee will be 87 next month and spends a great deal of time in her native Monroeville (&#34;Maycomb&#34;), Alabama.

Everyone loves different books for different reasons, and I loved this one because of the way it places you in a child's mind. A child who's mind is being stretched by the things going on around her, a mind that is struggling to make sense of the world. How on earth does Harper Lee capture us with a story about a lazy small town? How does she fascinate us with the everyday? I think that the voice that tells her story is the magic key. Scout doesn't have any prejudices yet; she is being molded by those around her. She argues with them and puzzles about them and finally makes up her mind about them. She carefully watches all that is happening, and though she only discerns half of it, the older reader can pick up on all the rest. Sometimes, though, Scout is the wiser. She reaches straight through to ways of seeing things we would have never found, and says things we never would have dared to say, because we understand all the implications, but she does not.<br /><br />I was reluctant to read this book, I must admit. I mean, the title doesn't sound all that appealing, even if you know it isn't really about killing mockingbirds. In fact, I think that made it even worse, because then I asked, \\""Well then, what is it about?\\"" and the back of the book (I have the Warner Books edition) didn't tell me much, and all my Mom said was, \\""It's about prejudices in the south.\\"" Well, I felt I had already read enough about that, but the more books I read with that all-encompassing description, the more I find that there is more to that topic than I ever imagined. We are a very diverse people, on this planet, and we all seem to have a different way of looking at things, a different way of saying things, a different community of thought that shapes us. For another thing, this book is about more than one kind of prejudice, so even if, after that, you still feel that you have read plenty of material on black discrimination, that's still no excuse to not read this book. History books tell you the story from the point of politicians. This tells you the story from the point of the people who lived during that time in their own small town, only distantly affected by those all-important matters. It tells you what people thought back then, which is every bit as important, I believe, as the events themselves.<br /><br />I can understand the vague descriptions on the book covers. I'm not sure that I could do better. I also understand why everyone says you should read it, and I heartily agree with them. You really should not miss out on this one. I don't think you need a big study guide to accompany it; if the author thought it needed that, she would have written one herself. Just sit down in a comfortable spot and read it. That's what Lee intended. That's how you'll enjoy it the most. When you're done, see if your view of things hasn't changed just a little bit. Maybe you'll smile every time you see a mockingbird. Maybe you'll stop and think every time too. That's what I do.

It's set in Maycomb County, Alabama, and is the story of Jean Louise \\""Scout\\"", who is seven years old at the beginning of the story. Her brother Jem is a few years older than her and her father Atticus is a lawyer. To Kill a Mockingbird is the story of Scout's adventures, also of a pivotal trial between Tom Robinson, a black man, and the Ewells, a \\""white trash\\"" family. Atticus is defending Tom Robinson, causing much controversy, and much taunting for his children. Also that year, Jem and Scout begin a long fascination with the mysterious Boo Radley, who is supposedly crazy, and is shut up in the house.<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird is definitely one of my favorite novels. The subject matter is really gripping and I love the writing. Scout narrates in an amazing voice; very compelling. Much like Margaret Mitchell, Harper Lee is a Southern writer, and only wrote one novel (though she is still alive). I wish she wrote more.<br /><br />One of my favorite sequences is probably the trial. Atticus is so brilliant; he builds up a big case for Tom Robinson, and yet racial prejudice prevails, despite the fact that there was no concrete evidence that Tom committed the crime. It's really sad, but one of the most riveting parts of the novel. Even if, like me, you knew what was going to happen, you still couldn't put the book down. And for Scout and particularly Jem, who are so sure that Tom will be acquitted, it's a huge blow.<br /><br />I love the characters as well; Scout is inquisitive and fearless, and I like Atticus a lot too. To Kill a Mockingbird is an amazing American classic, and I would highly recommend it.

It is a literary classic on many levels. The book was a landmark work written in the context of the burgeoning civil rights movement. Harper Lee was a born and bred Southerner and she provided detailed descriptions of what is was like to grow up in the South. Her analysis was not autobiographical, but she clearly explained the peculiar mores, religion, academic institutions, and social norms of the era. Her detailed descriptions had a great deal of authenticity.<br /><br />She described the pervasive institutional racism of 1930's Maycomb County, Alabama. Tom Robinson, a black man, was falsely accused of raping a white girl, Mayella Ewell. Atticus Finch was the lawyer who defended Robinson at the trial. Robinson was convicted despite spurious evidence and contradictory, inaccurate testimony on the part of the defendants. Scout and Jem finch were Tom's children. The story is written from Scout's perspective. She was a young grade school girl who came of age. Scout and her brother were forced to learn the sad reality of inequality and racism of the time.<br /><br />Lee was a talented wordsmith who described the setting and characters with intricate details. She was able to maintain suspense throughout the novel, especially regarding the recluse neighbor Arthur \\""Boo\\"" Radley. The story was always coherent and even minor characters in the book were memorable.<br /><br />In short, this book was a masterpiece of the highest order. It is a compelling tale from a narrative perspective. The social implications of the book are as relevant in the present day as when it was written. This is a tale about how children come to the realization that the world is not always fair and there are people who are victims of discrimination and violence.

But teaching it to my students gave me the chance to explore the novel all over again and to remind myself just how masterful it truly is. What almost everyone remembers about the novel is the trial at the heart of it, and that's for good reason; it's still infuriating, disheartening, and effective, even all these years after the book's publication. But there's so much more to the novel; after all, the whole first half of the book is more about life in Maycomb, from the perils of the first day of school to the difficulties of navigating the complex social strata that make up the town (from middle class to the working poor to the white trash, from the whites to the blacks, from the foot-washing Baptists to the more moderate Baptists elsewhere in town). More than that, though, To Kill a Mockingbird immerses you in the perspective of a young girl who is only just beginning to understand the world, and that choice - to let Scout tell the tale, instead of the rapidly maturing Jem or the wise and thoughtful Atticus - is what really makes To Kill a Mockingbird so remarkable. Without Scout's narration, the novel could easily become any other novel about a Southern town, and the trial just another book about racism as perceived by the white folks who were almost entirely unaffected by it. But in letting Scout tell the story, it becomes a way of exploring the complexities of the world through the eyes of someone who understands none of them - and even more importantly, accepts none of them. That dramatic irony between what we know and what Scout knows makes the book even richer to explore, as we begin to realize that so much of what we take for granted flies in the face of the way we raise our children and expect them to live. If that sounds heavy-handed and moralizing, well, that's me, and not the book; in fact, To Kill a Mockingbird soars by telling its story without ever resorting to preaching, hectoring, or belaboring its points. Instead, it simply shows us a young girl who is forced to look at the uglier side of human nature, only to see that there may be more good in people than we think. It's a book that's rich in humanity, life, characterization, language, and so much more, and it's a tragedy that Harper Lee never wrote anything else in her life.

Heck, none can.  Like most people, I was introduced to this classic while in high school; it was one of the few books I was \\""force fed\\"" that I ended up enjoying immensely.  Over the years I've returned to this inspiring tale about growing up in the Depression South--a place that could be downright ugly and archaic, if not for the innocent point of view of 9-year-old Scout Finch.  To Scout, life pretty much consists of trailing big brother Jem and Dill Harris--who spends summers in Maycomb with his aunt--in their adventures \\""outing\\"" the local boogey man, Boo Radley.  The harsh realities of intense segregation are lost on Scout; she's just a tomboy living in a small town with Jem and her attorney father, Atticus.  It's not until Atticus agrees to defend a young black man accused of raping a white woman that Scout discovers a disquieting truth about her town. . .about the culture of racial prejudice.  And Scout and Jem even become victims of this ugliness, until they are saved by a most unlikely hero.<br /><br />My goodness, can Ms. Lee write.  Her prose is simple and direct--with this author less is definitely more--but her passages, descriptions, observations, and dialogues are mesmerizing.  From a spinster neighbor showing Scout her bridge work, to the courtroom loft of African-Americans rising to their feet in tribute to Atticus, Lee's story brings Maycomb and its people to rich, dynamic life.  Atticus Finch is a literary icon, and rightly so; a gentle, patient, and loving father to his motherless children, Atticus never does things because they are expedient, he does things because they are right, and because, as he tells Scout, he could never hold his head high if he didn't do the right thing.  This is a character who flows through the narrative leading by example in the eyes of his children--in the eyes of the reader.

It has been over twenty years since I had read Harper Lee's classic and only novel. The small, Alabama town of Maycomb is in the grips of the Great Depression. Jim Crow is alive and well doing its worse by oppressing African-Americans. The story is seen through the eyes of tomboy Scout Finch. It highlights her growth from a six-to-nine-year-old girl. Ms. Lee created a protagonist who still had a child's innocence about the world around her. She isn't just confused about the illogical nature of prejudice but also by many of the social norms of small town America. Scout's dad, the now iconic Atticus Finch, is a poor, 50ish, intelligent lawyer of reason and high morals struggling to raise his daughter and their 13-year-old son Jem. He fortunately has the help of an intelligent black maid named Calpurnia. The climax of the story finds Atticus defending Tom Robinson, an African-American accused of assaulting a white woman.<br /><br />Ms. Lee, who was born in Alabama, clearly expresses her disdain for many of the South's cultural mores. The story not only shows the actual manner in which blacks were treated, but ridicules the Southern obsession with family lineage and how your place in society is based purely on which hoo hoo you popped out of during birth. The story has some wonderfully colorful and highly believable characters. It harkens back to a tougher, simpler time and how most of these folks tried to live god-fearing, decent lives, but don't have the intelligence or courage to treat blacks as human beings; let alone equals. The N-word is appropriately used quite frequently in the book due to the nature of the times and location of the novel.<br /><br />Ms. Lee's book is a well-written story that deserves its wide readership. It is also still very relevant in 2012. It would've been inconceivable to 1930 Southerners that less than eighty years later an African-American would be elected President of the United States. The reelection of President Obama just occurred two days ago and some of the very vulgar stereotypes expressed about him (especially on such mediums as Twitter) shows racism is still very much alive and well throughout America.

How could I have waited so long?  But reading it was one of those odd experiences that made me glad I did wait, just so that I could have the great joy that comes with a first reading of a masterpiece.  Indeed, one of the reasons the film is so good is because the filmmakers had such strong material to work with (though it is not hard to think of films that have made a hash out of excellent originals).  This book is wonderful, and the film's fidelity to the book (language, story, feeling) only makes me appreciate the film more than I already did.  But forget the film; this is a book to be savored for its own sake.  There is not a misstep from beginning to end.  It's so powerful it actually brought tears to my eyes in places.  Lee's straightforward telling of an overtly simple story effectively lays bare both the innocence of a Southern childhood and the deep prejudices of the South in which that childhood was lived.  It's Lee's own innocence, her own childhood, and her own South in many ways, since the story, while not necessarily autobiographical, mirrors her childhood in many ways.  There is much in the novel that transcends the specifics of the plot itself.  One of its most powerful messages, delivered repeatedly by the wise and tolerant lawyer-father Atticus Finch, is that you must stand in another person's shoes for a while before you judge that person (and then you just might find that you can't judge them at all).  Contained in the consoling words from Atticus to Jem in the aftermath of the trial that is the centerpiece of the plot is one of the most generous indictments of injustice you will ever read.  (\\""Those are twelve reasonable men in everyday life, Tom's jury, but you saw something come between them and reason. . . .  There's something in our world that makes men lose their heads--they couldn't be fair if theytried.\\"")  And that's what this book is: generous.

At the time, I had no idea what it was about, nor could I have ever imagined how much this book would come to mean to me. Like other classics of literature, it is still as resonant today as ever.<br /><br />The plot is fairly well-known, but if you aren't aware of it, \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" is a coming-of-age story. Scout Finch is a young girl growing up in a small Alabama town during the Great Depression. She spends much of her free time playing with her older brother, Jem, and, during the summer, a neighbor's nephew, Dill. One summer day the three children get the idea to try and get a reclusive neighbor, Boo Radley, to come outside. It becomes a near-obsession for them, but despite their best efforts, Boo remains unseen.<br /><br />The Finch children are raised by their father, Atticus, a widower and a prominent lawyer in the town. He's an unconventional parent at best; his children call him by his first name, and he doesn't seem as concerned with appearances as other parents. However, he is trying to instill in Scout and Jem a sense of honesty and integrity, and this becomes evident when he is assigned to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman.<br /><br />Though many educators (my high school English teacher included) have focused on the racism aspect of the story, upon re-reading it many times since, I don't think that is the main focus of the novel. Yes, it is a huge part, but it's almost the backdrop for the events contained therein. This is a story of that moment where the innocence of childhood is lost. It's about the realization that the world is a complicated, sometimes ugly, place. Adults are not infallible, and parents are not granted superpowers. Courage can take curious forms, and those who may seem to be dull can actually be the heroes of a town. Life exists not in simple black and white, but in varying shades of gray. And not every decision that is made by society is necessarily a good one.<br /><br />Fifty years after its original publication, \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" is as heartwarming and heartbreaking as ever.

When I asked him who Walter Cunningham was, he replied, of course that he was a character in \\""To Kill A Mockingbird.\\""  I decided to pick up the novel again not only to find out more about Walter Cunningham but to reacquaint myself with this Pulitzer Prize winning book by Harper Lee.  Not surprising I found that I was drawn not only to the characters but to the style of writing.  I couldn't believe that this required book of highschoolers could be so enjoyable to read.  Atticus Finch, the small town lawyer of a small Alabama town is a very quiet, understated, scholarly looking man who is widowed with a small daughter, Scout, and a son Jem. The other member of the household is the African American maid Calpurnia who is more like a mother to Scout and Jem.  They also have a summer friend, called Dill.  Then there is a recluse neighbor named Boo Radley.  Mainly the story deals with Atticus defending a black man who is accused of raping a white young woman.  Naturally there is an outcry in the community and threats which prompt Atticus to sit at the door of the jail with a rifle holding off a gang of folks only too happy to lynch up a black man.  One of the men happens to be the father of Walter Cunningham who is kind of a poor, \\""white trash\\"" type of kid who Scout also picks a fight with in school because the teacher has singled him out for not bringing his lunch and offers to give him some money for lunch.  Only Scout tells the teacher that Cunninghams don't accept money from anyone, and incurs the wrath of the teacher for being insubordinate. Walter goes home with the Finch kids for lunch and this is where he does his syrup thing, pouring it all over the meat and potatoes thus getting more grief from Scout who brings this to everyone's attention.  This shouldn't be a big deal but Atticus and Calpurnia take her aside and scold her for not respecting other people's ways no matter how strange they might be.  This theme of respect for human beings also applies to Boo Radley who is  harassed by the Finch kids and their friend, Dill, but in Boo's own manner he tries to communicate with them in various ways.  Even though this book deals a lot with the racial tensions of the South during the 1930s there is a lot more in the pursuit of not only justice for everyone, but also recognizing people for who they are and knowing that everyone has a contribution to make.  This all becomes very evident towards the end of the story when Scout and Jem really find out who really cares for their welfare and safety and who their friends really are!",2011-12-22

Set in the 1930s, it is written from the point of view of a young girl, the daughter of defense lawyer Atticus Finch.  As his daughter, she is exposed to the case of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of beating and sexually assaulting a white girl.  Atticus is determined to defend this man, though it goes against everything that most of the people in their little town in Alabama believe.  To Kill a Mockingbird tells the story of this girl's upbringing in the small town, and the moral crisis that shook it to its very core.  The themes of this book - for there are more than one theme - are diverse and complex.  The easiest to find is the theme of growing up and understanding the `grown up' world.  As the children see the case unfold, and hear the verdict, they face the realities of the 1930s.  The deeper message, however, is told in part by the title - it is a sin to kill a mockingbird.  One character explained this perfectly when she said, \\""Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy...that's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\""  Throughout the book, there are metaphorical mockingbirds, Tom Robinson being the most obvious.  These people have brought nothing but goodness to the world, yet are persecuted, or \\""killed\\"" by the society they are trapped within.

I even own the movie on DVD and have seen my own cousins perform this play at her high school about 4 1/2 years ago.<br /><br />This book may not be for everyone. One reason is because of the pace.

Oh and as long as there is no greek tragedy sequence that makes me want to poke my own eyes out and ring my own brain through some bleach to get the images out of my head (MacBeth!

This book came highly recommended by a friend of mine, and looking down my Goodreads friends list, everyone has rated it 5 stars. And now I know why.  At first, I wasn't enjoying it. I found it hard to get into. I couldn't relate to the culture (temporally or geographically), and was having a bit of difficulty translating the \\""Southern\\"" dialect. But, I soon overcame those obstacles, and then I couldn't put it down.  This entire story is told through the eyes of a child, and I think that's part of what makes it so captivating. This is a child who is raised by a single father and an older brother, and she begins the story in innocence, climbing trees and playing in the mud and catching bugs. Over the course of about a year, she starts school, and her father (a lawyer) takes a case to defend a black man who is falsely accused of raping a white woman. The other white people in her little town, even though they are \\""reasonable folks,\\"" do not approve, and she and her family are subjected to the insults, alienation, and threats that accompany racism.  Sometimes, we don't realize how ridiculous something truly is until we see it through innocent eyes. The children witness the entire case from start to finish, and are traumatized by the behavior of the people around them. These are people they have known all of their lives -- why are they suddenly losing their minds over skin color?  One of the most moving parts of the story, to me, is when the little girl's teacher is talking about Hitler's persecution of the Jews... and she readily makes the connection to the white people's persecution of the black people. It is in moments like these that children are forced to grow up and see the world for what it is.  Even though this story is rather bittersweet, it is beautifully told. It is a story of class warfare, social injustice, and being called upon to do the right thing, even when it seems like the whole world is against you.",2011-11-03

The first time we find out \\""it is a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\"" This is part of the culture that existed in this small, depression era southern town.  Many people lived by truisms, many of which were not good.  The second time it is used, it is too close to the end to mention.<br /><br />Atticus, the town lawyer,  is understanding  to the truisms, but lives by his own code, one that is far more honorable than we can imagine.  The story is told in first person by Scout, the daughter of Atticus.  Like the popular movie, \\""Christmas Story\\"" the narration, although done by a child, it is not child-like.<br />We grow up together with Scout and her older brother Jem over a period of three years.  We get to know their neighbors. While the characters are memorable,  they are nowhere near the quirky level of modern day characters.  Except, for Atticus, the characters are very realistic. Atticus is exceeding patient  and understanding. At one point he tells his children it is wrong to \\""hate Hitler.\\"" He accepts people as they are with all their faults, even those who threaten him.  Gandhi could have taken lessons from him.<br /><br />While the book centers around Scout and Jem, it runs with a semi-subplot as two life events occupy their young lives.  The first is their fascination with a shut-in neighbor, Boo Radley.  They take to wild speculation about him and have a desire just to see the legendary man. The second event is the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of rape by a white woman. Atticus defends him to the dismay and even hatred of many of the town folks.<br /><br />Race relations is part of the story. Much of the hard hitting aspects of the injustices are overshadowed by the rest of the story.

One of the endearing elements in this work is the marvelous description of a small town in the 1930s during the depression and its people who are viewed through a magnifying glass. Throughout the book, there is a consciousness of how one behaved in a small town back then and the way one behaved was central to who one was.<br /><br />In short, the story is pure truth and the impact of the raw language used as in the case of the \\""N\\"" word which was an acceptable way of speaking in those days might give offense to today's readers.<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of a child, nicknamed Scout who serves as narrator but as an adult looking back. Scout is a girl and a tomboy who speaks with her fists and is curious about the world around her. Her father named Atticus Finch, whom she addresses by his first name, is a soft spoken very dignified attorney who has earned the respect of the town not only by his reputation but also for being kindhearted when he accepts payment from clients in kind as he understands they cannot afford to pay him in cash.<br /><br />The story's structure centers on the town courthouse where Atticus defends Tom Robinson, a black work hand who has been accused of rape by the daughter of his employer. The story is both dramatic and powerful when one considers the courage is took to write what is was like to be in a black person's skin from the point of view of a white person. And the fact that it was published at the beginning of the civil rights movement. There is an understanding of the nature of the harshness of humankind exemplified through legalized segregation which is an amplification of the south in the 1930s without being judgmental about it. We know the injustice that is being created against Tom Robinson as there is no proof that he committed a crime but only the prejudices of the townsfolk that formulate the opinion that he is guilty and seal his fate.<br /><br />There are many characters is this classic story. One in particular is Boo Radley, Scout's next door neighbor whom she has never seen and through invented tales by her friends and neighbors she comes to view Boo as a menacing phantom capable of murder.

That is no small feat for a book to accomplish. To speak to people the world over, for over 50 years, means that there is something very universal in this text.<br />We are all the mockingbirds of the title, and anyone who has reached the age of majority knows the feelings that the loss of innocence, and the harsh light of reality can create in a person. Harper Lee wrote a novel that captured the essence of that most universal of experiences, and I for one am moved by it every time.<br />I won't rehash plot points, but I will give you some reasons why you should read, and then reread, this text.<br />The first reason is for the beautiful depiction of imaginative childhood. The narrator, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill embody most of the traits of childhood, and their creative games, and thought processes are a joy to behold. The voice of Scout (the narrator) is a pitch perfect recreation of childhood and childish impulses.<br />Another reason is a pretty simple one actually. The character of Atticus Finch is one of the noblest literary creations ever written. I want to be like him, and there are not many characters in literature I can, or would, say that about. The fact that being like Atticus is possible makes him even more endearing to me.  He is someone who is noble in every sense of the word, and serves as an inspiration for so many reasons. He is a good father, a decent and empathetic man, and a person who tries to see the good in almost anything. The fact that there are so few Atticus Finches in real life makes him seem all the more desirable to me. It is very obvious as you read this text that Ms. Lee loves this character.<br />There are numerous other reasons why this is a stellar work of genius, not least of which is the wonderful plotting of the novel, the excellent and fleshed out supporting characters (these people are real to me) and the message that Lee find numerous ways to reiterate throughout the book.<br />Ms. Lee has created a pastoral version of the Depression era south, and even though there is vicious bigotry and hatred depicted in the novel, Ms. Lee (through her characters) does not give up on them, or us. We and the world can be better. We just need to remind ourselves to walk in other people's shoes once in a while.nd the message that Lee find numerous ways to reiterate throughout the book.

Jean Louise Finch (Scout), her brother Jem, and their friend Dill experience many tough situations to learn from that they don't understand as kids, but as they get a little older their dad explains it and it makes sense to them. The kids, along with many others are faced with racism throughout the book and it has a major impact on their lives.    I enjoyed the way Harper Lee wrote most of the book. She used outstanding details and imagery to describe the characters and scenes. I found the way she wrote the courtroom scene very detailed. I could feel the intense emotions flying back and forth between Atticus and Mr. Gilmer as they argued the facts of Tom Robinson's case. Mrs. Lee showed both, Atticus' and Mr. Gilmer's personalities with that one scene alone by how she described their facial expressions and emotions. It showed how calm Atticus is, opposed to how angry, and determined to defeat Atticus Mr. Gilmer is. Most of the novel was very strong.   The book started off a little slow and gradually got more exciting. The author took a while to introduce the characters and their personalities. It took me some time to get in to the book before it pulled me in. The author spent a lot of time on the introduction to make sure she thoroughly described the setting and characters to make it clear to the reader what was going on.

Anyway, I wanted to read the book again because it was an intriguing book and the subject matter was race relations in the old south. Author Harper Lee never wrote another novel as successful as this one but if one had to write an only novel in ones lifetime, this was the kind of book to write.     It was painful to read the old practices of the old south because racial prejudice was so prevalent back then that confronting it was not advisable. The story of the Finch family and the perspective from Scout and Jem's point of view makes the story so inspiring and touching because it represented the hope of better race relations based on what they had witnessed in the court room.  The young children of Atticus Finch were the epitome of hope in raising the hood over the ignorant blind rage of bigotry.     There are other characters in the novel worth reading about. If you live in the southern part of the United States, some of these people are very familiar to you. They are your uncles,aunts, cousins, neighbors and acquaintances. They are as familiar as sunrise. The character of Boo Radley and the Radley family was enough to make you keep reading. The climactic end was so satisfying.    Learn from the book - and study other people. It will help you with a better understanding of who you are as a person with prejudice, even if you believe that you have none. We all have prejudices - it's just the way it is. The key is to learn about them and try to unlearn them, especially when it comes to dealing with other people other than yourself.",2010-09-30

The protagonist is Scout Finch, the motherless tomboy, daughter of a small-town lawyer. Their neighbors are all independently wealthy spinsters, except for a man named Radley, who lives with his mentally-ill brother Arthur (known as \\""Boo\\"") who we never see. Then there are the \\""poor\\"" people of the South; an honest dirt farmer named Cunnigham, and a notoriously filthy cracker named Ewell. Early in the story, Atticus Finch informs his daughter that the Cunninghams are poor, but repectable. The Ewells, however, have disgusting habits, and he warns her to stay away from them.    In some ways, To Kill a Mockngbird is a cautionary tale. Scout learns that friends, family, and neighbors can't always be trusted, and you can't \\""judge the book by the cover\\"" when dealing with the people close to you. Take for instance the Cunninghams; the father may be \\""honest and respectable\\"", yet he keeps his son out of school to work on the farm. Though Bill Cunningham believes in hard work, he doesn't believe in education, and his son will most likely end up illiterate. Another flaw of the Cunninghams is that they are easily swayed by conservative (and racist) whites who try to lynch a prisoner. Scout foils the lynching, but I won't reveal how.

Most of my teachers let me read whatever they wanted, and the few that assigned anything to me took the path of the-most-boring-is-best. I therefore was made to read \\""1984\\"", which was over my 14-year-old head, and \\""Silas Marner\\"", which the whole class thought was boring and badly written. In the last few years I've been slowly catching up with those classics I should have read when I was younger. I tried Scott Fitzgerald (and decided after \\""The Great Gatsby\\""--which I liked--not to venture any further), \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" which I expected to hate and liked anyway, \\""A Confederacy of Dunces\\"" which had me rolling in the aisles, and even Jane Austen, who I enjoyed a great deal more than I expected. Now I turn to \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"". It's one of those books that everyone but me has apparently read. So I guess it's time I caught up with everyone else.    Janet Louise \\""Scout\\"" Finch is a little girl, during the events of the story. I got the impression that the author was imagining Scout as a slightly older girl, writing this story down for posterity. She has an older brother, and the two of them live with their father, a lawyer, in a small town in Alabama. Their mother's dead. In the summer, a cousin named Dill visits them and the three of them play together. Supposedly, Dill is based on Harper Lee's real childhood friend, Truman Capote, but that's neither here nor there. They are the typical rural children of the era, playing in the street, and spreading rumors and innuendo about their neighbors. At the end of the block there's a strange family with a reclusive son who's in his thirties, but never leaves the house or says anything to anyone, named Boo Radley.    Scout knows her father's a lawyer, and has knowledge of a few things with regards to laws, but she's never really experienced a trial or anything. A third of the way into the book, when you're wondering if it's ever going to really have a plot, kids start tocall Scout's father a n----r-lover. Ms. Lee doesn't bother with the hyphens. It turns out that what they're referring to is the fact that Scout's dad, whose name is Atticus Finch, has been assigned to defend a local black man who has been accused of raping a white woman. In Alabama in the 1930's, this is a capitol offense, and he'll surely be executed if he's convicted.    So of course there's the obligatory lynch mob (one of the strongest scenes in the book) where Atticus faces down the less-than-brilliant citizens of the town, followed by the courtroom scene that's rather short, given that the trial of course only takes one day. I won't give away the ending, but the author confronts the obvious issues of racism and class in the 1930's south with a great deal more subtlety and nuance than I expected, and the ending, if a bit surprising, is also very satisfying.    I do have one negative thing to say about this book: it killed the career of what could have been a great novelist. At least that's my opinion. Most any author wants to think the book they're working on is better than the last one they wrote, and this thing won pretty much every award it could, short of the Nobel Prize for literature. It's one of the best-loved books of the last century. It's my belief that this success was a double-edged sword: on the one hand the acclaim was probably pretty heady, but on the other hand, how do you top something as successful as this? It's almost inevitable that a second book wouldn't win another Pulitzer. Anything less would be a step down.    Nevertheless, this is a wonderful book, truly great, and I recommend it highly.",2010-08-28

In this book, there's an exemplar of what a good religious-Christian person is in Atticus Finch. For anyone who thinks this book is solely about racism, which I did prior to having read it or even having seen the movie-adaptation, would be a gross oversimplification of the novel. It's an exploration in morality and Lee uses a very powerful vehicle: Children. Children learn through, what most call growing up, socialization and the social norms and understandings guiding everyday life. Here, Lee focuses on primary agents, notably the family. You see a stark contrast within the Finch family between Atticus and his \\""proper\\"" sister Alexandra. The morality each shares is different. Therefore, it stands to reason that children will think in very different moral terms.    Using children is powerful because in many ways, they are a tabula rosa.  However, if you have an extraordinary person like an Atticus Finch teaching morality, then you realize that the social word is full of immorality and illogicalness. This is what Harper Lee points out with the problems of Social Inequality, of a pseudo-Caste system, and of racism. Both Jem and Scout see and come into conflict with these ideas in major and minor things: Who is acceptable to bring home to dinner all the way to institutional racism within the legal system. These are norms and values most people accept in the town. However, she implicitly points out that that everyone is a product of some environment and some way of learning: As Atticus tells Scout and Jem to put themselves in others skin before they act... They understand why some people act the way they do, such as poor Boo Radley. What this does is point that there is both good and evil in people but if you got to know them... you'd see the good.

Scout's attorney father, Atticus, is defending a black man accused of raping a young white woman in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama. The story is set years before the civil rights movement began, and the plot is a catalyst for a novel that is so much more than a scathing commentary on racism in the deep south.

Most of the book relates charming, but not particularly unusual, adventures of a little girl, her older brother and a neighbor boy who comes to visit every summer. Most of these adventures are slight and unresolved. Scout brings a poor classmate home for lunch, and he shocks her by pouring molasses over all his food, whereupon the colored mail reprimands Scout for being a bad host. Scout and her brother are given BB rifles for Christmas, and while they are excited to receive them, they don't seem to do much with them. The main point to the airguns is that they give their father the opportunity to say that they shouldn't shoot mockingbirds. Scout chafes when her aunt moves in and tries to force her to wear pink dresses and be ladylike. Scout's brother loses his temper and destroys all the camellias in the yard of the ancient neighborhood scold, and his punishment is to read to the old lady every afternoon until she dies.<br /><br />The main plot thread concerns the recluse down the street, Arthur \\""Boo\\"" Radley. Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill conceive assorted methods to tease Boo out of the house, but they never succeed. At the end of the book, Boo seems to save their lives by rescuing Scout and Jem from a murderous ne'er-do-well.<br /><br />In the middle of the book there are a few rather sensationalistic chapters involving a rape accusation made by the ne'er-do-well and his daughter against a crippled young negro man who lives nearby. This gives Scout and Jem's father the opportunity to act noble and plead the case of this pathetic fellow in the courtroom. However, it is never clear whether there really was a rape attempt. Upon first reading it, I thought the poor-white girl's father had beaten the girl up and perhaps had sex with her, then tried to conceal it by blaming it on the crippled negro. Another reading is that the girl had lusted after the negro, and got caught embracing him. In either case, there was no need to make an accusation of rape: the girl was not pregnant; even if she had been, the child would not be mixed-race; and as the poor-white girl was socially isolated she did not stand to lose status by having been caught with the negro. The accusation of criminal assault, then, lacks coherence. Its only purpose within the structure of the narrative is to provide a reason why the ne'er-do-well would attempt to kill Scout and her brother.<br /><br />However, this sensationalism does add a cheap gravitas to the novel, which otherwise would be little more than a string of loosely connected episodes about growing up in the small-town South. It appears this episode was added to the book for precisely this purpose. It certainly does not reflect any real-life event in Harper Lee's own childhood. Significantly, the rape case was made central to the movie version, and most synopses of the novel emphasize this episode out of all proportion to its actual weight within the book. The episode really speaks to Northern biases about the Deep South in the 1950s, rather than tell us anything about Alabama life in the 30s.the crippled negro.

Unfortunately, you never write another one. How could Harper Lee have possibly followed this up? Anything she wrote after \\""To Kill A Mockingbird\\"" would have been anticlimax. So on the strength of one book, Harper Lee will be forever remembered for writing one of the greatest books of the contemporary American literature.<br /><br />I picked up this book late one night the year it was first published, after my mom had been raving about the book for weeks, trying to get me to read it. Well, what the heck, the late movie was boring that evening... next thing I knew, it was two o'clock in the morning and I had just turned the final page on what was the most magical reading experience of my entire life.<br /><br />From the opening line, \\""When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow...\\"" Lee hooks the reader with a deceptively simple story of a Southern family and a Southern town caught up in a cataclysmic moral crisis, and keeps us enthralled till the very last word. Lee's writing style is that of the storyteller who mesmerizes her audience telling a tale so simple, yet so compelling, that you never want it to end. Her narrator is Scout Finch, a delightfully devilish little tomboy who sees her world through the all-observant eyes of childhood. Scout is one of the most enchanting characters in modern American fiction. She's bright, funny, totally real; there's nothing contrived about her. She's someone we all knew in first or second grade, or wished we'd known. Scout lives with her brother Jem, four years her senior, her lawyer father Atticus, and their housekeeper Calpurnia, in a sleepy Alabama town where everybody knows or is related to everybody else. Lee spends the first half of the book drawing us into the life of the town and the Finch family, Scout's hilarious and problematic adjustment to first grade, and brings us into the mystery surrounding the notorious-yet-never-seen Boo Radley. The second half of the book is about the moral crisis that tears the town apart.<br /><br />Lee has a way of saying a lot by saying very little, and her laconic statement that the people of Maycomb had recently been told they had nothing to fear but fear itself sets the time squarely in 1933, the depths of the Great Depression. Times were bad for most people in small Southern towns; they were especially bad for poor whites and all blacks. In 1933 the South was rigidly segregated down every possible line, and a white woman's false accusation of rape was enough to get a black man hanged. When Mayella Ewell accuses Tom Robinson of rape, in the eyes of most of the white populace, Tom has been tried, convicted and is awaiting execution. Judge Taylor disagrees, and asks Atticus to take Tom's case.<br /><br />In Atticus Finch, Lee created what would eventually grow to be the best-loved character in all American fiction. Atticus is a loving but not a doting father, an able lawyer, and an individual of towering integrity. He takes Tom's case because he knows Mayella's accusation is full of holes, and he believes Tom is as deserving of good legal representation as anyone else. Atticus knows better than anyone else how his decision to take the case will affect his children, but as he explains to Scout, who wonders how Atticus can be right if everybody else thinks he's wrong, if he didn't take the case, he could never hold his head up in front of his children again.<br /><br />Atticus knows he's fighting a losing battle, but deep inside himself he believes he may lose a battle but win a bigger war. The chapters describing Tom Robinson's trial and Atticus's defense are some of the most powerful in American fiction. On of the most moving passages in the book is at the end of the trial when the town's black minister tells Scout to \\""Stand up. Your father's passin'.\\""<br /><br />Along with Scout and Atticus Finch, Lee created a host of other memorable characters. Jem is the perfect big brother for Scout, sometimes protective, sometimes antagonistic, always encouraging. Lee only needs to pen a few details about Calpurnia to bring her vividly to life: \\""She was all angles and bones; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard.\\"" Calpurnia isn't the stereotypical Mammy of Tara; she's a no-nonsense maid and housekeeper who dishes out ample amounts of love and old-fashioned discipline in equal doses. And Miss Maudie Atkinson is a delightful creation; funny, ditzy, and wise all at once. Anyone would want her for their next-door neighbor.<br /><br />The two major villains, Bob Ewell and his daughter Mayella, are compelling characters in their own right. Bob Ewell is quintessential white trash, spending the family's relief money on moonshine while his children go hungry. But poor Mayella is as much victim as villain; we can't help but feel for her, ostracized and isolated, knowing only her father's physical violence and sexual abuse; her attempted seduction of Tom Robinson is a desperate cry for love and affection. But, as Lee reminds us, it's all for naught. Tom Robinson was dead the minute Mayella, caught in the act of attempted seduction by her father, opened her mouth and screamed.<br /><br />After the highlight of the trial, the book might have slid into anticlimax, but it's Lee's genius that she keeps the tension heightened after the trial and its denouement, through Ewell's drunken, insane attack on Atticus through his children, and their rescue by Boo Radley. And after everything she, her family, and the town have been through, what has Scout learned from all this? Pretty much what Atticus set out to teach her all along: that you can't get to know a person until you put on his shoes and walk around in them.<br /><br />I turned the final page of \\""To Kill A Mockingbird\\"", unbelieving that it had come to an end. I opened the front cover and immediately started reading it over again from page one. At two o'clock in the morning.  The book had that much of an effect on me.

I had to force myself NOT to read ahead, it was so interesting!

They all tied in to the central theme of the story.   When I first started reading, I could not understand what the heck \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" meant. Even when I cam across that quote halfway through the book, I didn't get it. When I was done, however, I could understand the symbol perfectly. I also enjoyed how the very first sentence in the book, about Jem's elbow, is explained almost at the very end.  I want to mention that I have a friend who never reads anything, ever. She hates books and reading with a passion. She had to read TKAM for the same reason as me, for English class. Her class read it before mine, and when she was done, she told me she loved it. I think that just proves how excellent the book is: if SHE loves it, it's got to be good!  My one complaint is that we had to do so much work on it. We had to write Jane Shaffers, we had to complete reading guides, we had to do quickwrites, we had to take excessive notes.

Atticus Finch is the father and he is an attorney in the small southern town of Maycomb, Alabama.  Atticus has two children; a son named Jeremy age 10 who is nicknamed Jem and a daughter age six named Jean Louise who is called Scout.  Jem and Scout's mother died when Scout was only two years old.  They have a housekeeper and cook named Calpurnia.  The story is narrated by Scout.  It tells of their life in Maycomb and about the summer they meet a boy next door staying with his aunt.  This boy is 7 years old and is named Dill.  The children quickly become friends and spend most of their time together playing.  There is an obsession with the children of a nearby neighbor named Boo Radley.  Legend said that Boo had done bad things as a child and had stabbed his father in the leg with a pair of scissors at one point.  Many people have never seen Boo, including Jem, Scout and Dill.

Over the course of about two years, the kids make mischief, learn life lessons, and try to get their reclusive neighbor, Boo Radley, to come out of his house. With believable characters, an excellent use of accents and satire, and a surprise ending that will leave you guessing, it's a wonderful novel that I recommend to anyone that can read",2010-04-01

This is Harper Lee's classic novel that came out in the early 60s and is now required reading in many school districts.    The story itself is reasonably entertaining fiction while at the same time examining themes such as overt racism, humaneness, fatherly love/protection, and childhood innocence. My main gripes with this book are that it doesn't really examine any of those themes on a any sort of profound level. The themes come up, sure, but Lee fails to deliver any kind of meaningful statement on any of them insofar as I can tell (unless you qualify things like 'racism is bad').    In addition, the language used in the book is clearly dated, which is distracting. Part of this is because of the book's examination of flagrant racism as it was in the 1960s and prior. Much of (though not all) that has significantly abated since then.    Bottom line: Good novel that makes for fairly easy reading. Just don't expect profundity from it.",2010-03-27

It faces the alarming but true problems of childhood and the prejudice of the justice system in 1930's. Harper Lee's novel is not only groundbreaking, but also heartwarming, mysterious, and disturbing in the way it shows the discrimination in the Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's.   The novel's setting and characters are brilliant due to Harper Lee's background knowledge on the many subjects covered in the book. Lee was, like Scout (the protagonist of the book a.k.a. Jean Finch) a girl living in small town Alabama in 1930's experiencing racism, with a father (Amasa Lee to Atticus Finch) who is a lawyer. Lee effectively uses her knowledge to her advantage.   To Kill a Mockingbird is a first person narrative from the child's eyes of Jean (mostly referred to \\""Scout\\"") as Finch, a poor girl who spends her time with her older brother Jem Finch. One of the main points of the book is that her knowledge of bad in the world increases throughout the book, which I found fascinating. The novel is about their life growing up, and the evil in the world, including their father's case as defending an innocent African American by the name of Tom Robinson who is accused of sexually abusing Mayella Ewell.   The title, To Kill a Mockingbird, alone is excellent symbol shone throughout the book. It symbolizes the fight against good and evil. \\""Mockingbird\\"" is a symbol for good, so the title symbolizes the many events in the story where something beautiful is killed. I do not want to mention an example though, for I do not want to spoil for those who have not read it.   Lee intelligently decides to show the story through the eyes of a child, and with this smart choice, we get to experience the horrors of racism in an interesting, effective, way. For the child's increasing knowledge of the evil in the world is amazing. The book accurately depicts the mind of a child so precise readingthe book felt like being a small child again and learning about the world.   Normally, this paragraph I would have reserved for the cons of the book, but I have sat thinking long enough to realize that the book has none, other than the fact that I sometimes (very, very occasionally) dozed off, but that can be blamed on my attention which is equivalent to a small stone, and not the book. This is no doubt the most interested I have been when reading a book in 2 years.   To Kill a Mockingbird is an excellent classic tale of humor, evil, innocence, discrimination, and more. Harper Lee's setting, story, and characters all extremely real feeling and fascinating. I highly recommend this book.    -James",2010-03-01

It had a profound effect upon me. Growing up in Utah where everyone was pretty White I hadn't really thought about racism, I mean, I knew it existed, but I'd never been exposed to it either personally or in literature. So when I read this novel it allowed me to enter that world where it exists (I know it exists everywhere), but where it actually brought me into a world that dealt with it culturally as part of daily life. I remember while reading how appalled I was at the ignorance and hatefulness of these characters. I remember feeling akin to Scout and her brother and friend during their summer excursions and wondering who Boo was. I remember feeling injustice and sorrow and a desire to do my part to make the world better.<br /><br />So once again I feel a classic is a story that gets me thinking about the world, my own prejudices and how I am pulled out of my comfort zone. To Kill a Mockingbird is just such a story. It is beautifully told through the eyes of a small girl and allowed me to see the events in a different view.<br /><br />I was very surprised that this movie came out in 1962 since the Civil Rights Movement was still in its infancy. All of the actors did a superb job, especially Gregory Peck as Atticus and Robert Duvall as Boo Radley. The book is usually better, but I still felt the impact of the story in movie form.

Written by Harper Lee, who attended Huntington College, University of Alabama, and also spent a year as an exchange student at Oxford University in England, this is her only published novel. This book was published by J.B. Lippincott in 1960 and consists of 323 pages. \\""To Kill A Mockingbird\\"" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and made into a major motion picture.                                    The setting takes place in a ficticious town named Maycomb, Alabama from 1933 to 1935. The main character and also the narrorator of the story is a young girl named Jean Louise Finch, but everyone calls her Scout. She is telling the story as an adult, but about her childhood. Another main character in the story is Scout's older brother, Jeremy Finch, Jem for short. Atticus is the father of Scout and Jem, an attorney, and Maycomb's state legislative representative. Then there is Dill, a boy who comes to stay with his aunt, the Finch's neighbor Miss Rachel, every summer.                                    The plot of the story is that Atticus agrees to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, accused of raping nineteen year old Mayella Ewell, which causes Scout and Jem to be tormented at school because people think their father is disgracing the town. Another part to the plot is that Jem, Dill, and Scout are constantly trying to get Arthur (Boo) Radley to come out of his house. The story was that Boo got into alot of trouble when he was a teenager, and he hadn't come outside since because his father kept him locked up.                                    The climax is when Bob Ewell, Mayella Ewell's father, tries to hurt Jem and Scout in the field behind their school Halloween night, but Boo Radley comes out and saves them, killing Bob in the process. Later, the town sherriff, Mr.Tate, states that while attacking the children, Bob Ewell stumbled into his own knife, accidently stabbing himself in the soft spot between his ribs. Mr. Tate does this to protect Arthur Radley. The theme of \\""To Kill A Mockingbird\\"" is social class. I believe this is the theme because in the story it talks about how the people of Maycomb County despise the Ewells and the way they lived, and the Ewells despised colored people. But yet in court, a colored man had never been found not guilty against a white man, and that wasn't about to change.                                    This book is an amazing book because it shows very strong opinions and veiws on racism. It is a book with very strong vocabulary, which makes it a great book for any high school or college student.",2010-01-26

The narrator is young Scout Finch, a six-year-old white girl who lives with her brother Jem and attorney father Atticus.  They live a fairly normal small-town Alabama life of school, playmates, and fearful fascination with a reclusive neighbor.  Things heat up when Atticus is assigned to defend a black man named Tom Robinson who is accused of raping a young white woman.  A man of principle, Atticus takes the job despite angry reactions from neighbors and potential danger. As the trial unfolds in the segregated courtroom (blacks in the balcony), it becomes clear that Robinson is innocent.  Equally clear is that the alleged victim (a friendless young white woman) made a pass at Robinson, her roughneck father saw it, beat his daughter in a rage, and then pressed false charges against Robinson.  Thus the story examines taboo subjects of interracial sex and white womanhood, plus social isolation, family violence, even drug addition.  Remember this book arrived in 1960, when certain subjects went undiscussed and the still-segregated South had poll tests and openly racist lawmakers.  As one might expect, Robinson stands little chance with the all-white jury, but hope may exist via appeal.  The story thus continues in riveting fashion, with varying plot lines and climaxes.             Author Harper Lee (born 1926) based her story on childhood events and neighbors from her native Monroeville, Alabama.  To her surprise the book became a bestseller and was soon adapted into the powerful 1962 film.  And the book still inspires censorship and controversy a half century later.  Some say it portrays blacks as unrealistically timid, others say it's unfair to white southerners or wrong to use rape for controversy.  Ever more reason to read it.

It is a book about two children trying to grow up in an extremely racist town. At a young age their troubles are somewhat childish, but as they grow up they learn what real fear, courage, and prejudice is. First, people should read this book because it teaches a strong life lesson. It shows that everyone deserves to be treated the same no matter what they are. Second, people should read this book because everybody can relate to the events in it. Everybody has gone through growing up and leaning things that you never knew existed. Lastly, people should read this book because it keeps the readers attention the entire time. I will admit that the first twelve chapters are a little slow but one the reader gets further into the story it is almost like you cant put the book down. In conclusion, To Kill a Mockingbird takes place in a small town in the 1930's.  Everybody should read this book for countless reasons. It will keep the readers attention the whole way through. :)",2009-10-20

Narrated by 6-8 year old Jean Louise Finch--who scorns the idea of becoming a lady--the story depicts a child's gradual awareness of racial tension and bigotry in the deep South. She and her older brother, Jem, experience the usual round of kids' fantasies and pranks, Us-against-Adults mentality in Part One, which serves as an extensive background for the dramatic and fatal confrontations in Part Two. With a visiting neighbor boy, Dill, the siblings are obsessed with luring out a reclusive man in a spooky house next door, Mr. Arthur \\""Boo\\"" Radley.      With deliberate casualness the author mentions an upcoming legal case whose Black defendant will be represented by Scout's quietly dignified father, Atticus. Over the ensuing months she becomes aware that the town and even her extended family are disgusted with the calm tenacity of this man of principle--who  has sunk so low as to be proud to defend a mere Black against a White (trash) family. Scout comes to admire her 50-year-old father for more than his patience and his cool marksmanship under duress.  She is amazed by his morality as both as a caring parent and as a trustworthy role model of a human being.  Alone against the entire white community Atticus commands respect in the packed courtroom and in the court of public opinion. An enduring read for all ages.",2009-09-30

Tension, prejudices, and inequities are everywhere and Ms. Lee makes sure we see it in its full glory (e.g., educated vs. undereducated, rich vs. poor, wood's folk vs. town's folk, black vs. white, sick vs. healthy, the shy and reclusive vs. the curiosity of a child's mind, etc.).  We all live with these forces in our lives and our surroundings and let them exist without pause.  Atticus tried to stand in the middle and wear the shoes of the individuals on each side, guided by his belief that intrinsic good exist in most if not all.  He believed all of us just needed to understand the other's side to make it work.  Beautiful concept but a position that proves nearly tragic in Atticus' life.

To Kill a Mockingbird has become, in 21st century America, one of those books that kids all read when they're in their early teens; it gets discussed either as literature or as social commentary or as a coming-of-age story (and without a doubt it stands brilliantly as all three!), and then everybody just moves on. After all, a lot has happened since this book was first published in the first half of the 20th century, and our problems with race in this country have moved on.     Haven't they? Well, reading Stockton's excellent first novel, set in Jackson, Missippi in the early 1960's (the time of my own childhood), caused me to think yet again about the perpetual and on-going issues of race, class, education, poverty, life expectations, and all the other tightly interwoven issues that we continue to grapple with even now, with The United States' first African-American president in the White House. The public struggles, as well as whatever issues we find in our most private examination of our own preconceptions of each other, are very much still with us, even as we have worked to correct so many of the most blatant wrongs. The issues may present themselves wearing different guises, but they are far from being resolved; these questions are at the very core of the American psyche.     Read both To Kill a Mockingbird and The Help, and give yourself a little time to think when you do so.

Scout is only eight years old and the Great Depression is ongoing in Maycomb, Alabama.  Her father, Atticus, is a pivotal man in their town as he is the fairest lawyer in town.  Spacek does all the voices of these remarkable characters and they come even more alive for us.  The Finches are fortunate in this town as they are making it through the Depression in genteel if not affluent fashion.  The town is made of people like the Finches; and then what would be known today as poor white trash; and finally the blacks who still have decades to wait for racial equality to appear.  However, small town America provides certain basics in the 1930s. No one starves or is homeless yet vivid inequalities exist.  Also, disabilities are kept in your own home, shuttered up so that other people can't see your differences.  Boo Radley is one of these different, disabled people and Scout is fascinated by him as the Radleys live on her street. Boo will come to intersect with a terrible legal injustice which occurs in the town, a rape trial with a black man as the defendant and a poor white trash girl as the accuser.  Atticus Finch is the black man's lawyer.  But this novel is about so much more than a trial.  Lee and Spacek nail the universal frailties and strengths of all of us as human beings in her novel. Those haven't changed one iota between the Great Depression and present day. I enjoyed the movie and the novel when I was a kid and I did not revisit the work until recently as this audiobook.  It was a wonderful way to experience it all again in a new medium.

So, to read it again (possibly) in middle age was an absolute revelation.  What a wonderful book.  What a totally captivating story.<br /><br />Set in semi-rural Alabama in the years following the Great Depression, \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" covers the events of a small town and some of its underlying tensions.  These are largely of a racial nature where poor and scarcely literate whites seem to have an innate hatred of blacks.  Thus, we see the trial of Tom Robinson, an honest but poor black man, who is unfairly convicted of the rape of Mayella Ewell, the eldest daughter of a family of white trash.  This is a sad case of bad triumphing over good.<br /><br />However, the story has more to offer.  Some degree of justice does prevail in the end.  Yet, the book is more than a linear plot.  It tells the story of the town brilliantly.  The reader is entranced by the characters.  We can see the wisdom of Atticus Finch, the town's lawyer; the violent ignorance of Bob Ewell, the father of Mayella; and the natural curiosity of Jem and Scout, the two children of Atticus.

Atticus Finch, an attorney, is a widower raising two children, Scout and Jem.  The book is told from Scout's viewpoint.  She is a precocious girl about 10 years old.  The Finches have a full-time housekeeper, a black woman who is much like a surrogate mother to them.<br /><br />Maycomb, Alabama is very stratified at this time.

Atticus Finch decides to represent him and this creates all kinds of challenges for the family from the white community.  The black community is very thankful towards Atticus and his family.  Scout and Jem have to deal with their own struggles in school due to the stratification of the town and the many families that are angry at Atticus for taking the case.<br /><br />The story unfolds beautifully.  There is a wonderful cast of characters living on the Finches' street that we get to meet through Scout's eyes.

We also get to view the trial through Scout's eyes.<br /><br />I recommend this book for everyone starting in high school.

All the Atticus', Scout's, Jem's, Tom Robinson's, Calpurnia's, Mrs. Dubose's, Heck Tate's, Boo Radley's, Mr. Cunningham's, and even the Bob Ewell's.  Atticus was the perfect example of this, getting to know people as individuals and not as a member of a group.  He helped Scout and Jem to see Mrs. Dubose not just as an angry old lady who shouts terrible things to them, but as a woman with an addiction trying her hardest to overcome it (and does).  Scout innocently helped the mob outside the jail (or at least Mr. Cunningham) to view Atticus as a man with children instead of just someone trying to stop them from getting to Tom.<br /><br />In respecting all people, Atticus was respected by almost all (obviously not Bob Ewell), even though they may not agree with his choices.<br /><br />I read it with three of my children.  I got a little nervous about the book choice when I remembered what the trial was about, but knowing the message of the book isn't rooted in the rape, I went for it, sometimes reading it as such, sometimes replacing \\""rape\\"" for \\""hurt\\"" (because of some of their ages and understanding).

US,30407148,R115YJSEEEIORH,0446310786,994527755,To Kill a Mockingbird,Books,4,1,1,N,N,"Reply to ""Silent Minority"" Reviewer Who Gave It Only One Star","Really, history texts are \\""more entertaining\\"" than this book?    Now this reviewer has something that can be used as a good talking point about the book \\""To Kill a Mockingbird,\\"" but rather than saying it-he/she would rather bury their point in sarcasm. As many of you know, students have trouble learning by reading only textbooks. It's safe to say, textbooks can be dry, fact-laden, and lack the appeal necessary to engage a student who finds flipping their pencil around more interesting. Given the sarcasm, this reviewer knows that history books are generally considered \\""not entertaining\\"" and uses a tongue-and-cheek approach to say that Lee's \\""To Kill a Mocking Bird\\"" is less entertaining than what is already established as `low entertainment.'    My question is why? Why not say what you mean? Why the sarcasm? Why not suggest a resource or piece of fiction that portrays history better? But perhaps this reviewer can't. Perhaps their sarcasm is a tactic to hide their misreading of an important piece of literature.    Yes, Harper Lee's book does contain stereotypes, but let's take it further. Let's see Lee's book as a spring board to question the use of stereotypes at all?    Instead of dismissing a novel written in the late 50's (published in 1960) along side a late 70's television show (Goodtimes aired between 1974-1979), why not use this to question the case a television show duplicated the same stereotypes of a book twenty years its predecessor? Or how is it that such stereotypes are still used in fiction and film in our current times? This reviewer dismisses a book like \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" rather that seeing that it can be used to talk about the human condition (no matter how unfortunate this condition may be) that things outside individual perceptions are generalized and used, (often commercialized) that then perpetuate the misunderstanding of others to the demise of everyone, but in particular to minorities?    This reviewer writes that \\""Simply put, this is a novel about racism written for people who received their knowledge about racism from this book!\\"" What I think this person wants to say is that instead of standing against racism, this book serves to perpetuate it. But how can this reviewer not take in consideration the time period in which the book was written (which was the same decade Lucile Ball could not say the word \\""pregnant\\"" on television). But this reviewer fails to recognize that this book does not only show us prejudice thinking but calls it to question and provides us with the opportunity to talk about it. And this dialogue begins from where the book starts-from the point of view of children.    So reviewer, how is this book an \\""insult to intelligent readers\\"" when readers you speak of sit some 50 years after its making? Isn't this book history itself? If you peal back its coming of age story, we get a first hand look at what at the time (as sad it as it maybe to us now) were controversial ideas? The situation where a man can be guilty simply because of the color of his skin puts to question how these notions have been embedded in our culture. This can be used to start a dialogue of how far we have or have not come. Instead of judging it, let's learn from it and put our contemporary egos aside to look at what is between the lines in this text.    For example, this reviewer calls to attention that the stereotypical use of minorities being saved by \\""archetypal\\"" \\""perfect\\"" white man and calls it a fault of the book. But isn't the fault of prejudice times the book is set in? Could Lee have created an African American lawyer character to do the saving of an innocent African American man on trial during the 50's? Sadly, no. Lee was using examples of what were available at the time to bring to question how others are condemned because of something as arbitrary as the color of a person's skin.    This is our shared history. I am not proud of it, but it is where we have evolved from. But when I read a review like thisone I question that very evolution. We have the privilege of being somewhere else in time, we know better. Should they have known better then? I say \\""yes,\\"" because I live now. Did others at the time see what we see now? Sure, there have been people throughout history who have fought to the point of loss of life for the equality of all. Those people were visionaries. Lee in writing \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" does represent a piece of that visionary notion that says, \\""There is something wrong with condemning a person not by their actions but by who they are that others do not know.\\"" You seem say how dare she call this to question by using stereotypes? When really there wasn't enough integration of people to see differently. Going by the publication history of this book, people where finally coming around to question how they believed.    So yes, this book contains the dangerous notions that have been used to justify not only supremacy but also hate and horrible crimes against others. But it also exposes the idea of how tyrannical popular belief can be. Use extreme care when relegating a book of this magnitude to the pile of the unreadable because you can't get over the time period in which it represents. To say something is racists when it shows racism is to dangerously stop the conversation that such literature brings.    So let's use the luxury of being forward in time (and it is a luxury as those who will be 50 years a head of us will have), we can peer into the systems at work in this book, and learn to not repeat the mistakes. Use it to question our notion of humanity by what others had to endure.    As Scout in the novel says, \\""when you really see them,\\"" I think this reviewer failed to \\""really\\"" see Harper Lee and this book. He/she claims to be an intelligent reader, but somehow does not understand that time-stamped literature show us ourselves and sometimes (dear, I say often) that side of us is not a pleasant one. Let's question the book, not dismiss it as something that perpetuates it unless it is in the hands of a person who chooses to use it as a perpetuation. Because in actuality, it's the times we stand juxtaposed against not the literary products thereof.    Classical literature helps us do this by getting inside, seeing the composite faces and lives of who they were.    So please drop the sarcasm and say what you mean. Then a great conversation and learning, learning about who we are-where we've been and where we're going-can really begin.",2009-02-25

Kids can be cruel, and as the Finch children soon learn, their classmates, oftentimes following their parents' lead, tease them mercilessly about their father's willingness to take on the case. An assortment of well-developed characters, both friends and foes of the Finches, round out the cast, including their young friend Charles \\""Dill\\"" Thomas (the relative of a neighbor) and the secret but significant younger son of a neighbor, Arthur \\""Boo\\"" Radley, who is said to have stabbed one of his parents with a knife one day (a scenario reenacted repeatedly by the three children). Although the dialogue includes (perhaps a dozen instances of the) use of the \\""n\\"" word, it's the means to an end. The overlying theme of To Kill a Mockingbird is that no matter what the consequences, racism must not be tolerated. Perfectly plotted and filled with well-developed characters every one, this meaningful-messaged story is one of my all-time favorite classics. Also good: In Cold Blood by Truman Capote, Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, and The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara.",2009-01-18

The concept of rape in this story is necessary, given that it takes place in the south during times of racial injustice.  Not many people see past the crime and ignore the purpose it serves in the story. The point of this story doesn't have much to do with rape, but the prejudice that comes with the accusation.    Another strong point in the story is towards the end, Scout questions her teacher when she condemns Hitler for the Holocaust, but at the same time discriminates against African-Americans.  Harper Lee, I believe, put that in there to point out the hypocrasy of racists.    This is a must read and I'd recommend it to everyone.

Seeing the world through the eyes of an eight year old may sound dumb, and not a great way to spend you time. On the contrary, the memories that you had as a chold growing up emerge from a long sleep and you start to remember your adventure. Remember the haunted mansion down the street? the old man who murdered his wife? Well, this story talks about those stories, and more. It talks about matters that even most adults don't approach in the modern world. The setting is in the depths of the Great Depression, and it takes place in little Maycomb County, Alabama. The story weaves in and out of race, caste systems, and everyday life alongside fun in an \\""in-depth\\"" story. This book has much more depth than when first read. Many chapters that seem random aren't that strange for they all have a meaning. I personally loved this book. I read it at school and it brought so much fun while reading it. It also brought the thrill of watching a trial through the eyes of a child. We as the readers are made to think in this book, but not so much that it's hard. Because our lives have progressed so much we see that her world is very different from ours right now. But similarities are still there. A couple of chapters in this book represent how even though something looks like it has been uprooted from our world (ex: racism), to get it to go away, you have to dig it up from it's roots. One major theme in this story is Roots and History. It even has a little tale of puppy love! (Remember those first crushes?). I realize that I make it sound bad, but that is because in class we do tend to overthink everything. That's why if you're an intellectual reader or just someone who likes books or to pass time, no matter what genre you like, this book will appeal to you. Buy this book or borrow it from a library or a friend and read it, because it will touch your heart as a great book and warm your heart as a humanbeing. The movie though...

To Kill a Mockingbird is among the best books I've ever read.      For those that haven't read this, or haven't seen the film version with Gregory Peck, which is also outstanding, To Kill a Mockingbird is about the Finch family.  Atticus Finch is a lawyer and widower in a small Alabama town during the Great Depression.  He has two children:  Jem, an 11-year old boy, and Scout, an 8-year old girl.  Their lives are turned upside down when Atticus is appointed to represent Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman.  The story is told from Scout's perspective.    While the story is framed around social and racial issues in the South, it's really about much more than that:  primarily, it's a story about growing up.  The Robinson case makes the transitions that Jem and Scout go through much more dramatic, but they experience the same kind of wonder and confusion that all of us experience as we move from childhood to young adulthood.      Atticus is exactly the kind of person we aspire to be:  honest, caring, understanding, moral, and unflappable.  You sort of get the impression of Atticus as the last righteous man.  Atticus lives his philosophy:  \\""The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience\\"" (p. 120).  In short, Atticus is the emodiment of human dignity--not just for himself, but for others too.  If you aren't moved by his closing argument in the Robinson trial, you may be in a coma.    I thought it was odd, and somewhat revealing hearing the kids, especially Scout, describe their father:  \\""Atticus was feeble:  he was nearly fifty.  When Jem and I asked him why he was so old, he said he got started late, which we felt reflected upon his abilities and manliness....Our father didn't do anything.  He worked in an office, not in a drugstore.  Atticus didn't drive a dump truck for the county, he was not thesheriff, he did not farm, work in a garage, or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of anyone.\\""  Ouch.  But this is Scout with a child's perspective; her growing maturity changes the way both she and Jem see their father.    Harper Lee never wrote another novel; she grew up with and remained a close friend of Truman Capote's until his death.  Harper Lee and Gregory Peck also remained close friends until his demise; Peck's grandson was named Harper in her honor.      To Kill a Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize for a reason:  it's a masterpiece.  Its warmth, compassion, comedy, and tragedy are rendered with such humanity that it honestly blew me away.  I can't recommend it enough.  Read it today.",2008-12-03
US,36348634,R12QLG4XOK5QTC,0060935464,994527755,To Kill a Mockingbird,Books,4,1,3,N,N,"Race and Class in the Deep South","It is perhaps appropriate that this was the first book I read after the election of America's first black President. My real reason for re-reading it, however, was for the purposes of comparison with Faulkner's \\""Intruder in the Dust\\"", which deals with a similar theme. Indeed, I recently came across an allegation that Harper Lee's novel was essentially a plagiarism of Faulkner's.     The book is set in Maycomb County, Alabama, during the depression era of the 1930s. It is a first-person narrative told through the eyes of Jean Louise Finch who, for some reason, goes by the nickname Scout. Although she is only a child at the time of the events described, the narrative voice is that of the adult Jean Louise looking back at her childhood from some point in the future. The action of \\""Intruder in the Dust\\"" is set over a few days and tells the story of one single incident, the murder of Vinson Gowrie; \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" is set over a period of about two years and essentially tells the story of Jean Louise's childhood between the ages of six and eight, although it concentrates on one crucial incident. The main characters, apart from Jean Louise herself, are her brother Jem and their friend Dill (another unexplained nickname; his real name is Charles).       Jean Louise and Jem are the children of Atticus Finch, a widowed lawyer. The book's central incident is the trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, for the alleged rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell; Atticus is Robinson's defence attorney. Like Faulkner, Lee uses a classic thriller plot- the fight to prove the innocence of a man wrongly accused- to explore racism in America's Deep South. Although Robinson is clearly innocent of the charge, the all-white jury nevertheless vote to convict him, largely because to admit that a white woman, even one as sluttish as Mayella, was capable of making false accusations would force them to abandon their cherished ideas about the purity of Southern womanhood.      Harper Lee's concerns are wider than just the race issue. The book also has a lot to say about attitudes to social class among the white community, contrasting affluent middle-class families like the Finches with the likes of the Ewells, who can quite literally be classified as poor white trash. The family live in a shack next to the town's rubbish dump, where Mayella's father Bob earns his living as a scavenger. A favourite saying of the liberal, tolerant Atticus, who believes that most people, when you get to know them, are essentially kind, is that you should never judge a man until you have stood in his shoes and walked around in them. (At times the tone seemed quite preachy, as though Harper Lee were writing an extended sermon on tolerance).     Atticus applies this principle of non-judgementalism not only to racial issues but also to various acquaintances whom his children dislike or disapprove of for one reason or another. He applies it to Boo Radley, a simple-minded and reclusive, but inwardly kindly, neighbour, to the cantankerous old Mrs Dubose and to the Cunninghams, another poor white family but one who have retained a greater dignity and self-respect than the Ewells. The title of the book refers to a saying of Atticus that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because they never do any harm, but it is a phrase which also refers to his philosophy of life. At various times several characters in the book- Robinson, Boo Radley, the children- can be seen as \\""mockingbirds\\"", harmless creatures in need of protection.     One problem with the book is that Lee never really explores the tension between Atticus's liberal philosophy of life, and the problem of human evil as exemplified in the book by Bob Ewell, who is neither misjudged nor misunderstood but just plain wicked. Not only does he give perjured evidence in the hope of getting an innocent man sent to the gallows, and encourages his daughter to do the same, he also makes a vicious and cowardly attack on Atticus's children. Trying to stand in such a man's shoes would not, I feel, be a very productive exercise.           My other criticism of the book would be that it explores the question of racism from an exclusively white perspective, albeit a liberal one. For a number of reasons I think that \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" is a better book than \\""Intruder in the Dust\\"", the most important being that Harper Lee's prose style is much more fluent and readable than Faulkner's often impenetrable sentences. Nevertheless, Faulkner creates, in Lucas Beauchamp, a black character who is much more well-rounded than any of those in Lee's book. Tom Robinson is little more than a plot device; the most prominent black character is Calpurnia, the Finch family's maid, who is that common literary stereotype, the faithful black servant. The book would have been better if Lee had given us a black perspective on the events she describes.                     Those criticisms apart, I found this an excellent book, with a number vividly drawn characters, especially the spirited, loveable young Jean Louise and her father, who was memorably played by Gregory Peck in the brilliant film adaptation. Despite the limitations of his world view Atticus is an admirable character, who shows, in his defence of Robinson, not only great moral courage but also great physical courage as well. The immense improvement which has taken place in race relations in America since 1960 is owed, in part, to men like Atticus Finch, and also to women like Harper Lee who were prepared to confront the endemic racist attitudes of their society.",2008-11-21

The story is a mixture of many elements including a mysterious neighbor named Boo Radley, various coming of age issues regarding Scout and her brother Jem, and her father, Atticus, defending a black man accused of raping a white woman.  As the story is set in Alabama in the 1930s, the rape case is particularly incendiary.    To Kill a Mockingbird is such a classic piece of American literature that most people read it in high school.  I somehow missed that experience and curiosity prompted me to pick it up and give it a try.  While there were a few descriptions of rural southern life that ran on a bit long for my taste, the novel was well worth reading.  For sheer entertainment value, I enjoyed the Boo Radley subplot the most as it is both mildly suspenseful and immensely interesting.      Of course, the novel is most famous for the rape trial and this is also compelling in a fairly horrifying and very sad way.  Harper Lee paints a vivid portrait of the extent to which African Americans were relegated to a status far below even second class in that place and time.  Atticus Finch does a masterful job of defending the accused, but he knows that the all-white jury has practically cast their votes before ever entering the courtyard.  The author uses the narrative voice of the children to highlight the blatant injustices and the outrage that any decent person would feel as a result.  The technique is highly effective if not exactly subtle.    To Kill a Mockingbird is easy to recommend.  The story is interesting, the characters substantial, and the subject is still relevant today.

The main points apply here as well.      This film is an excellent black and white adaptation of Harper Lee's book of the same name. The acting, particularly by Gregory Peck (and a cameo by a young Robert Duval as Boo Radley), brings out all the pathos, bathos and grit of small town Southern life in the 1930's. The story itself is an unusual combination, narrated by Peck's film daughter (and presumably Lee herself), of a stage of the coming of age story that we are fairly familiar with and the question of race and sex in the Deep South (and not only there) with which we were (at the time of the film's debut in 1962) only vaguely familiar. That dramatic tension, muted as it was by the cinematic and social conventions of the time, nevertheless made a strong statement about the underlying tensions of this society at a time when the Southern black civil rights struggle movement was coming in focus in the national consciousness.    The name Atticus Finch (Peck's role) as the liberal (for that southern locale) lawyer committed to the rule of law had a certain currency in the 1960's as a symbol for those southern whites who saw that Jim Crow had to go. Here Finch is the appointed lawyer for a black man accused of raping a white women of low origin- the classic `white trash' depicted in many a film and novel. Finch earnestly, no, passionately in his understated manner, attempts to defend this man, a brave act in itself under the circumstances.     Needless to say an all white jury of that black man's `peers' nevertheless convicts him out of hand. In the end the black man tries to escape and is killed in the process. In an earlier scenario Finch is pressed into guard duty at the jailhouse in order to head off a posse of `white trash' elements who are bend on doing `justice' their way- hanging himfrom a lynching tree. On a mere false accusation of a white woman this black man is doomed whichever way he turns. Sound familiar?    The other part of the story concerns the reactions by Finch's motherless son and tomboyish daughter to the realities of social life, Southern style. That part is in some ways, particularly when the children watch the trial from the \\""Negro\\"" balcony section of the courtroom, the least successful of the film. What is entirely believable and gives some relief from the travesty that is unfolding are the pranks, pitfalls and antics of the kids. The tensions between brother and sister, the protective role of the older brother, the attempt by the sister to assert her own identity, the sense of adventure and mystery of what lies beyond the immediate household that is the hallmark of youth all get a work out here. But in the end it is the quiet dignity of solid old Atticus and the bewildered dignity of a doomed black man that hold this whole thing together. Bravo Peck. Kudos to Harper Lee.",2008-05-27

The trio's escapades are set against the background of a black man in their community, Tom Robinson, being tried for raping a white woman.  Scout's father Atticus acts as a lawyer for the trial, bringing Scout and Jem ridicule from their peers.  Throughout the novel, Lee conveys a feminist message.

The main character of the book is a five year old girl nicknamed Scout and she tells the story from her point of view.  Scout and her brother Jem, live with their father, Atticus Finch, who is a prominent lawyer in town.  In the summer, Scout and Jem become fascinated with a recluse neighbor, Boo Radley.    Life is dramatically changed when their father, Atticus, takes on a controversial case.  A white woman, Mayella Ewell, accuses an innocent black man named Tom Robinson of raping her.  It is obvious that he is innocent as the trial goes on due to Atticus' questioning.  Nonetheless, in a small southern town still full of prejudice, the all white jury finds Tom Robinson guilty.  Due to Atticus taking on the case, his family and children are faced with many threats and scorn from the angry white people in Maycomb.  Atticus stands constant in his conviction to fight racial inequality and teaches this good to Scout and Jem.  Near the end Tom Robinson is shot as he attempted to escape from jail.  This is a hard lesson for Scout and Jem to learn as they feel the injustice of Robinson's position.  Mayella's evil father, Bob Ewell vows revenge on the Finch's since Atticus made him appear a fool during the trial.  The book ends with him attacking Scout and Jem on their way home from a school play.  The children are saved by their recluse neighbor, Boo Radley.  Boo stabs Bob Ewell and is luckily saved from punishment by the police officer who claims that he saw Bob Ewell fall on his own knife.  The Finch children, Scout and Jem grow up during the entire process of the trial.  They are faced with many examples of evil and good in people and lose their innocence through thetrial.    Address negative aspects of the book:  One of the main themes of this book is forgiveness.  Atticus always forgives people for their evil traits.  For example, Atticus is able to forgive people for being racist and chose to admire them instead for their positive traits, such as courage or love.  While I think it is good that Atticus teaches readers forgiveness, I think that it can be frustrating.  Some people and acts do not necessarily deserve forgiveness, like the character Bob Ewell.  I think that it is important to make sure that the seriousness of the racism in the south during those times is not taken lightly and forgiven, but remembered for the giant mistake it was.    Your appraisal of the book:  I would definitely recommend reading this book.  When I read this book in fourth grade, it changed my life.  Being able to discuss such serious issues and get new viewpoints and a history lesson at the same time is an amazing part of this book.  I think this book should be read by every student in America.  We can only learn from our mistakes in history by discussing them and learning about them in literary works.  This is a perfect book that can address that lesson for students today.

Aside from being enormously important, it is also an excellent read. Every middle-schooler should read  this book.    Lee's novel takes place in small-town Alabama during the Great Depression.    The narrator is Scout Fitch, the daughter of Atticus Fitch who is a local attorney.   Atticus is assigned to defend a local black, Tom Robinson, man who has been charged with raping a white woman.  Much of the town disagrees with Atticus' decision to defend Robinson, and vehemently taunts Scout for his father's actions.   Atticus is able to prove Robinson's innocence, but Robinson is convicted of the crime anyway. Robinson is later killed while trying to escape from prison.  The alleged victim's father, Bob Ewell, is humiliated by the trial and menaces Atticus' family.  In the end, Ewell attacks Scout and then dies in the confusion of the attack, probably killed by Fitch's mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley, who the children in the community have been fascinated by for years.     This incredible piece of literature broaches many important topics in our    society:  racial tensions and race relations(especially in the South), injustice in the legal system, class, sex crimes and the importance of courage and integrity.   The book deals extensively with these issues, but is still very light-hearted and humorous.     Above all else, To Kill A Mockingbird, is a poignant reminder to all who read it about the importance of humanity and good will towards all.  The book is one of my favorites because it reminds me of what is good and just in this world, and can be, even in our darkest hours of moral ambiguity.  It is a reminder that there are always people out there, in the face of impossible odds and situations, striving to do what is right and just.    I treasure this book and hope everyone reading this review will buy a copy and read it.  It will better your soul!",2008-05-11

Lee  Date: 1960   Reading Level: 8th Grade Reading Level   Number of Pages: 281 Pages   Genre: Fiction         To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper E. Lee deals with issues such as, racism, innocence and empathy. Scout Finch and her brother Jem live in a small town in Alabama where they become obsessed with Boo Radley. Boo leaves present under a tree that Scout and Finch continue to visit until Boo's brother fills the hole with cement. At the same time as this story develops Attacus Finch (Scout's father) decided to defend Tom Robinson who is a black man who is accused of raping a white female. Racial tensions then develop in the story.  Scout is then picked on at school and is forced to deal with racial issues at a young age. Tom Rabinson is later falsely convicted of the crime by an all white jury and tries to escape from jail and is shot dead. Later in the novel Tom Robinison's accuser is embarrassed because Attacus embarrasses him in the courtroom and harasses Jem and Scout when Boo comes to their rescue.    As a current teacher I firmly believe that this book should be read at the end of middle school. It is a fantastic novel that teachers young adults some very important lessons. It is a coming of age novel that provides very valuable lessons at a middle school age. The book provides characters that are very relatable and the reader develops strong feelings for the character. This is a book that should be read by people of all ages. This book is typically read by freshmen in high school, however, I strongly believe that this book can do a great amount of good if read at a middle school level. The books issues and themes are so prevalent to a middle school world. To see Jem and Scout grow up throughout the novel just as many young middle schoolers are.    The only negative aspect of this book for middle schoolers is that the characters in the beginning of the novel may be hard to relate to.Scout is too young and Atticus may be too old. However, I believe that the issues that are handled in the book are issues that typical teenagers care about. I have found that issues like racism always spark debate in the middle school classroom.  Another problem with this novel is that despite the 8th grade reading levels it deals with a complicated plot and takes in-depth analysis to fully understand all of its meaning which may make it hard for a middle schooler to fully comprehend.",2008-05-09

Such a book exists in Harper Lee's masterful 1960 novel, one of the most revered pieces of fiction this country has ever produced. Set in rural, Depression-era Alabama, it is a classic coming-of-age story about a precocious nine-year old tomboy named Scout. What she experiences is palpable in the virulent racism surrounding the persecution of Tom Robinson, a black man unjustly accused of raping Mayella, the abused white daughter of an unrepentant bigot, Bob Ewell. Representing Tom in court is Atticus Finch, Scout's father and the moral compass of the story.<br /><br />The plot moves toward a deepening exploration of the intractable conflict between tolerance and ignorance and how the pre-existing environment of hatred and mistrust makes innocent people guilty by pure circumstance. Scout embodies these themes within her own journey toward womanhood and her questions of what society expects of her. Through the travails of Tom and the town's outcast, Boo Radley, and primarily through her father's example, Scout recognizes how innate goodness can exist even in the direst circumstances. Likely because the story is semi-autobiographical, Lee is able to vividly capture the rural south and the pervasive mindset during the Depression with spellbinding accuracy. Yet for all that, the book's lasting legacy has more to do with Lee's particular lierary gift in bringing a genuine universality to her themes.<br /><br />Other characters weave in and out of the story - including Dill, Scout's wannabe boyfriend and the Truman Capote doppelganger - and each plays a key role in shaping the novel's core conflicts. I have to say that the author's particular literary strengths come to the fore in her empathetic depictions of the evolving relationships between these characters, for example, Scout and her father Atticus, Scout and her brother Jem, the children and Boo. Nothing seems extraneous in the story Lee tells, no small feat for a 336-page novel. She brings intense emotion to her prose, especially in describing the uncontrollable fury created by racial hatred and false accusations, for instance, in the lynch mob scene before the trial and in the vengeful attack on the children. The timing of the book's original 1960 publication turned out to be prescient, as the Civil Rights movement was just becoming national in scope thanks to the efforts of Martin Luther King and his brethren.

To Kill A Mockingbird was a striking statement made by Nelle Harper Lee, an Alabama native whose father was for most of his life a typical Southerner with typical Southern attitudes towards African Americans, According to Lee, this novel, her only one, is to remain a snapshot of the South, as it was during her youth, on the verge of it's first reluctant steps away from the shadows of its past.     Part One of the book is purely expository. All of the characters and the tenor of Maycomb, Alabama are thoroughly established.

If you're looking for the gritting truth, set at a Southern pace (i.e. slow), where things are never quite what they seem on the surface (i.e. small towns), and good does not always prevail (i.e. what ever happened to Dill and why did it have to happen to Tom), then I recommend this American classic.    I've read a few of the reviews and was actually surprised that some didn't like it. While I understand that nothing appeals to all audiences, it was still a shock to me. And the reason for that is that when you love something, it's hard to see why other's don't.    A small percentage of reviewers said that nothing happened and the characters are one-dimensional. While this feedback is obviously valid for those who made it, I have to disagree. The women in the town (esp the Auntie and Miss Maudie) were perfect examples of complex characters living through a very changing (and challenging) time. If you read a bit below the surface, I believe the average reader should be able to pick that up.    Jem was another example of a complex character. We watched him cross that threshold from a little boy to a young man. To me this was proven by his periods of quietness and his behaviors.    Because the story was written to reflect, as closely as possible, true life during a particularly period in American culture, it may seem a bit slow to those accustomed to and prefer contemporary/speculative fiction.     I was born in the South and therefore found the dialogue to be quite accurate of how we spoke during my childhood. This helped me to relate to it and build more of a bond to the characters.    Every now and again, I find (as I get older -- not sure how relevant that is for the younger audiences)  you want to read a book that stays with you. You're not in the mood for a Stephen King (tho he is a master story teller). Instead you want something slower, something with a little more meaning to it so that you when you put it down, you have to sit in silence and reflect on what you've read and why you liked it so much.    This is not a book that I would've read in high school (cliff notes was my preferred method). Unfortunately I did not have the patience nor the maturity (that adjective is reflective of me only) to understand how good people can make bad decisions and still not be bad people.

Surely it has all been said before in analyzing Ms. Lee's sole published novel, a surprisingly autobiographical recounting of small town Southern justice at the dawn of the pre-civil rights era - the strong sense of tradition and place, the parallelism between Tom Robinson and Boo Radley, the alternating flashes of humor and tragedy, the implicit pleas for social justice.     A work that stands as revelatory for high school freshmen necessarily loses some of that power on later rereading. However, the directness and simplicity of Harper Lee's writing, her ear for the Southern voice and eye for the telling detail, and her remarkable ability to realize memorable characters continue to impress even the mature reader. Atticus Finch stands as an archetype of the righteous but humble man seeking to serve justice and the common good, whatever the cost. Scout is the eternal tomboy, the adventurous young soul grappling with the implications of racial prejudice and injustice while experiencing and conquering her own version in Arthur (Boo) Radley. Boo himself stands as the \\""unknown other,\\"" the feared immigrant or differently colored whom, as Atticus says, we can never know until we put ourselves in their skin. Then there's Dill, the summer neighbor so clearly modeled on the author's own childhood neighbor and lifelong friend, Truman Capote. These are joined by an entire townfull of supporting characters, each memorable and each an archetype in his or her own right.     Lee's master stroke as a writer was to view the events surrounding Mayella Ewell's alleged rape and Tom Robinson's trial through the eyes of a child just emerging into adolescence. Scout struggles to interpret the lives, actions, and attitudes of those around her through the lens of naïve childhood, yet her budding adolescence places her on a cusp. One day she is beating up boys and catching frogs, the next day she's being groomed for Southern womanhood. Nevertheless, Scout forces us through her questions and reactions to confront the inherent irrationality in racial and class prejudices. If it's a sin to kill a mockingbird, as the story's underlying proverb asserts, then who is Harper Lee's mockingbird? At one level, the answer is obviously Tom Robinson, seconded by Boo Radley. Yet perhaps the true mockingbird, sinfully slaughtered, is indeed that very childhood innocence, forever destined to suffer that tragic fate at the hands of incipient adulthood.     To a far greater extent than one might imagine, Harper Lee drew much of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD's material from her own life. The lawyerly and reserved father, the small town life (hers was Monroeville, AL), the deceased mother (hers was emotionally distant and psychologically troubled), the scarily unseen neighbor's grown son, the cranky, busybody neighbor, the oddly effete childhood friend - these and numerous other story elements came from Ms. Lee's direct family and childhood experiences. Ms. Lee even borrowed the theme for Jem and Scout's climactic school pageant, \\""Ad Astra Per Aspera,\\"" from Kansas's state motto, a little fact she picked up there while assisting Truman Capote with his research for IN COLD BLOOD. I highly recommend as a companion piece to this novel Charles Shields's MOCKINGBIRD: A PORTRAIT OF HARPER LEE.",2008-02-14

It is a story of the most important time in people's lives; when morals are made, when lessons are learned, when lasting friendships are born and time takes forever and then is forever gone--childhood.    This thoroughly heartwarming tale chronicles the struggles, strengths and weaknesses of Atticus Finch, small town Alabama lawyer and widowed father of two in the 1930's.  It delves into the spiritual and moral dilemmas aroused by fear and prejudice. As he defends a young black man accused of a crime against a white woman, it becomes as much a trial of fatherhood as a test of justice.      The story is seen through the eyes of a 9 year old girl, Scout.  She and her older brother, Jem, have critical issues of their own to deal with.  Scout wants to get out of having to go to school, so she takes up cussing, hoping her father will assume she's learned these new words at school and immediately withdraw her.  Another time, Scout and Jem build a snowman that looks exactly like their next door neighbor.  When the offended neighbor complains, Atticus tells them that a snowman is not supposed to be a caricature of a real person.  Jem replies, \\""It's not a caricature.

Although he possesses no superhuman power or abilities, he possesses characteristics few others have.  Not only intelligent, respected, and calm, but he also is humble and just.    Lee sets her story during the 1930s in Maycomb, Alabama from the perspective of young Scout recounting her story of growing up with her brother Jem and their father Atticus.  Over the course of the novel, Scout develops from a naïve innocent girl to maturity and acknowledging the evil in the world.    Deeply rooted within this town is severe racial prejudice.  Atticus exemplifies his justice by defending a black man, Tom Robinson, in a lopsided courtcase about raping a white woman.  Subject to the town's attacks, Atticus persistently determines to defend his client, and ultimately proves Robinson innocent.  Yet the biased jury thinks otherwise and still convicts him, despite the indisputable evidence.    The mockingbird signifies the innocent in the story, which in the end is tarnished by humanity's evil.  The two most prominent representations are Boo Radley and Tom Robinson.  Boo Radley is distorted by society to nothing but a myth, but as the story progresses, the children discover more about him. Culminating down to the conclusion where Scout finally meets him in person, she realizes him to be truly good and acknowledges him as a human, quelling all theories she had of him before.  Tom Robinson, on the other hand, is ruined by the white jury, despite Atticus' sufficient proof to show his innocence.  Convicted and sentenced to jail, he attempts to make his escape and is shot and killed in the process, capturing the book's title.    The story is not too difficult of a read, but the meaning is extremely insightful, containing profound commentary about good and evil, bravery, and innocence.  In essence,I have never read a book as good as this one.  It should be on everyone's top 1 list of greatest books of all time.  Period.  If it is not, something is seriously wrong.

The novel takes place in a small fictional southern town called Maycomb, Alabama set during the depression. A family lives there that consists of a widowed father, Atticus Finch, an older brother, Jem Finch, and a younger girl named Scout Finch. The father is a lawyer and he takes on a case about an African American man who has supposedly raped a white girl. Not to give away the ending I have to stop my summary there.

I was pleased to find that my local library offered an unabridged reading by Roses Prichard (an actress with a Ph.D. in Communications from the University of Southern California) for Books on Tape.<br /><br />In the first 15 seconds, I knew I had made a winning choice.  Roses Prichard turns Scout (Jean Louise) Finch into a girl you'll feel like you've known all your life.  Take the time to find this wonderful recording:  You'll discover more in this book than you've ever thought could be in a book describing the thoughts and experiences of a five- to eight-year-old narrator.<br /><br />Jem and Scout Finch are the only children of Atticus Finch, a highly principled lawyer in the small Southern town of Macomb, Alabama, whose wife died young of a heart attack. Unlike many novelists who cram their story into a few hours or days, Harper Lee showed the good sense to give us the family history and to let the children grow up over a few years before entering the heart of her tale. It's good story-telling and is great for character development.<br /><br />Jem is five years older than Scout but tolerates her company as long as she doesn't start acting like a girl.  That's fine with Scout who prefers overalls to dresses any day.  As Jem grows older, he finds himself taking on the role of protector as well.<br /><br />The children acquire a summer friend, Dill, and decide they want to meet the reclusive Arthur (Boo) Radley, a neighbor who always stays indoors.  They have many adventures that will remind you of Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher in Injun Joe's cave.<br /><br />The book is written in pre-Civil-Rights-era Alabama when consciousness of the bad things done to African Americans wasn't very well developed among those who weren't African Americans.  The only people in the story who seemed to appreciate the full horror of discrimination are those who are honestly trying to live the Christian life.  But even many practicing Christians proved to be blind to their African American neighbors' needs and concerns.<br /><br />Harper Lee does a fine job of skewering all of those who are hypocrites on the subject of race.  She even takes an appropriate shot at northerners who avoid the company of African Americans.<br /><br />In a way, this book was The Uncle Tom's Cabin of the Civil Rights Movement, developing the consciousness that helped to change some attitudes towards African Americans.<br /><br />The story also features lots of insights into Southern \\""justice\\"" of the day -- inside the court, in the jury box, in jail, and in prison.  To bring the evils of the attitudes to bear, Harper Lee tells us that it's wrong to kill a mockingbird . . . they only sing for us to enjoy and don't do any harm.  By the end of the book, some of those in Macomb begin to feel that way about harmless human beings who do good, as well.<br /><br />You can learn more about Southern culture and attitudes in the early 1960s by reading this book than by studying a dozen nonfiction texts.  Harper Lee got it right.  One of the lightning rods for racial tension in those days was unwarranted sexual fear of African-American males.  That theme is fully developed through having an African-American be accused of raping a white woman.<br /><br />But what I think makes this book timeless is its focus on what it means to be a good person . . . the story of Atticus Finch and his struggles with being both a good man and a good father.<br /><br />But years from now you won't forget Scout:  She's one of the great heroines in American literature and an important prototype ofwhat the next generation should have become in loving other people.<br /><br />Appreciate the untapped potential all around you!preciate the untapped potential all around you!",2007-12-18

Harper Lee creates a time and place where each character is flawed and fallible, yet her work lifts the reader to a more noble and lovely view of our world. Atticus Finch is a believably moral man with lofty principles, yet we see his hesitations and stumblings as a father and public defender. Scout, Atticus' daughter, and Jem, his son, act out in youthful fits of rage and misunderstanding, yet the deep love and unbounded admiration they feel for their father is heartwarming.     The fact that Lee weaves threads of race and human rights and class distinction so skillfully into this tale is partly why I believe this book is such a beloved classic. Atticus is a single white father raising his two children with the help of a black housekeeper in Alabama during the 1930s. As Lee unfolds the family's story, we as readers are allowed to step back in time and possibly begin to understand what life may have been like from the perspective of young and old, black and white, and the poor and privileged. In the latter half of the book, Atticus is called upon to legally defend a black man for allegedly raping a white woman, and the trials he and his family suffer as a result make this book sing with conflict and weighty moral decisions.    Furthermore, I very much liked Lee's folksy and funny and frequently beautiful language and her skill in penning creative and insightful sentences of high literary value.

A very enlightening read, the colorful narration painted a truthful picture of rural and prejudiced life in the South during 30's.  It's unfortunate that Harper Lee only wrote one book, as I'm sure she could have regaled us with many such portraits of unfamiliar faces and mores from long ago.  Ms. Lee must have been thrilled to have her book come to life upon the big screen, especially with such superb acting by legendary thespian, Gregory Peck.

The first half of the story centres around the flow of life for Scout and her brother Jem, painting a picture of a childhood idyll.

The freedom of a child's mind to observe what IS without judgment or malice gives this story it's power.

Through the eyes of an innocent 8-year-old girl, we can vividly see the lives of all people living in the south.  Lee makes sure that this novel does not strictly focus on segregation de facto; in other words, Lee shifts the novel away from typical stories of segregation in public areas and private vicinities.  What I particularly loved about this novel is the way Lee moves towards society's psychological response to plights facing African Americans at the time period. <br /> <br /> The plot's narrator, Scout, informs the reader of the south's complexity in many forms.  From a hypocritical northern teacher, to the racism that destroyed an innocent man, Scout asks the reader to release all shallow misinterpretations of the south and judge it from a more complex viewpoint.  The novel's hero is by far Atticus Finch, who even today has come to represent all that is just and right in our nation's justice system.  Lee also utilizes his strength to portray what Scout sees as true strength in society.  Finch is the archetypal man who, despite all the negative influences surrounding him, he manages to come up on top on a moral ground against the small town.   <br /> <br /> Yet of course, the novel's true theme revolves around society's negative judgment on social outcasts and how these judgments reflect the nature of society itself.  Scout illustrates two victims of society: Boo Radley and Tom Robinson.  Boo Radley is a recluse who is the subject of town legends that depict him as a typical monster.  This envokes fear within the children, who must eventually learn how to accept and understand people from all backgrounds despite what others spread.  This idea is tested in a more major form, as Tom Robinson, a black man, is put on trial for raping a young white woman.  Reoccuring themes of acceptance and understanding truly take form when Atticus Finch represents Robinson, despite hostile behavior of the town. <br /> <br /> Lee's writing is beautiful as it is simple, yet at the same time it is simply powerful as it brilliantly portrays the way humanity struggles to release prejudice.  I urge everyone whose schools that were too misguide to assign this book to read it in their spare time for they too will be inspired.  <br />",2007-06-11

Her father, Atticus Finch, is a very dedicated lawyer facing a very hard case ahead of him--a rape case that takes their town of Maycomb by storm.  This book takes a keen look at racism and integrity in a small town.<br /><br />This book is so wonderful and I am so glad that it still lives on as a great novel, in the hearts and eyes of a whole new generation of readers.",2007-06-01

Although she studied law, she became increasingly interested in writing, and in the 1950s she created a series of semi-fictional, semi-autobiographical writings about the events of her childhood.  Over time, these writings developed into a novel, and she completed TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in 1959.  Published in 1960, the book not only proved an instant bestseller but received every critical accolade available, including the Pulitzer Prize.  It also proved controversial, and almost fifty years later the American Library Association continues to list it as one of the most frequently challenged and banned books in both the United States and abroad.<br /><br />Told in the form of an extended flashback, the novel unfolds in a series of scenes in which Lee seems intent upon evoking the small challenges and quiet charms of childhood in a small, Depression era southern town.  We are introduced to Scout, our tomboy narrator, and her brother Jem and their playmate Dill, and we join in their summer games: climbing to the treehouse, rolling in a tire, and most particularly their fascination with \\""Boo\\"" Radley, a mysterious recluse of unsavory past who has long been a focus of town gossip.<br /><br />Written with remarkable simplicity, it is a charming, often comical tale--but as the story extends it comes to focus not so much upon Scout and Jem as upon their father Atticus Finch, a noted local attorney who is suddenly appointed to defend a black man accused of the vicious rape of a white woman.  And Atticus Finch is a man of rare integrity, quietly but firmly determined to bring the facts of the case to light.  In doing so, he places himself and his children at storm center of a controversy that threatens to tear both his family and community apart and which ends in violence and death.<br /><br />In 1960, with the United States of America embroiled in the Civil Rights movement, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was considered a political statement.  It proved a lightening rod for controversy, and in truth the novel still speaks to us of the evils of racism.  If this were all, it would be a novel of historical interest and little more.  But that is not the case.<br /><br />The two threads of the story--the children's fascination with Boo Radley and Atticus Finch's defense of Tom Robinson--are not separate portions; they interweave and ultimately dovetail into a seamless whole, remarkable in narrative, brilliant in clarity, to create a portrait of social bigotry counterbalanced by deep humanity, at times monstrous, at times deeply beautiful as only perfect honesty can be.  The characters spring to vivid life; the events unfold with a mixture of the unexpected and inevitable.  There is pain, there is suffering, but there is growth as well, and as the children grow in knowledge and understanding so too does the reader.  It is a remarkable work, not only capturing the texture of life in a small southern town, but bringing its events to a universal level that transcends time and place and touches something that speaks to the best in all of us.<br /><br />Since the novel's publication, Harper Lee has become almost as much a recluse as Boo Radley, seldom appearing in public, even more rarely speaking or writing for publication.  She has never again created a work of this length.  Even so, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD places her at the forefront of American authors.  This is a great novel.

Nowadays, it seems to only mean \\""more than ten years old\\""; quality doesn't come into the equation at all.  Take, for example, the cable channel American Movie Classics, which typically features movies that are forgettable regardless of age.  I prefer the classic definition of \\""classic\\"", one that means something that is not only really good but withstands the test of time. <br /> <br />Put another way, look at the Da Vinci Code.  A decent book and a phenomenal best-seller, but will people still be reading it decades from now?  Only time will tell.  Time, however, has already told on Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, and it is clearly, by any use of the word, a classic.  Although forty-seven years old, it is still as good as ever. <br /> <br />Set in the town of Maycomb, Alabama during the Depression, To Kill a Mockingbird tells the tale of the Finch family:  widower father Atticus, young son Jem and younger daughter (and narrator) Scout.  Atticus, an attorney, has been appointed to represent Tom Robinson, accused of raping a 19-year-old girl named Mayall Ewell.  Since Tom is black and Mayall is white, guilt is assumed by most of the town and the trial a mere formality.  The truth plays little part. <br /> <br />Maycomb is a stratified society.  There are the \\""respectable\\"" people, who - with or without money - are considered the aristocrats of the community.  The Finches fit into this category.  There are the poorer white people, from the poor-yet-proud Cunninghams to the \\""trashy\\"" Ewells.  At the bottom are the blacks.  Though Atticus refuses to participate in this classism (and tries to lead his children to do the same), he is pragmatic enough to acknowledge its existence. <br /> <br />This novel may have the trial of Tom Robinson as its centerpiece, but there is plenty more going on as we take a tour of an impoverished town in the Deep South.  With this book, Lee has written one of the Great American Novels.  And while some great authors are not easily readable (for example, Faulkner), Harper Lee holds the reader from the beginning to end.   <br /> <br />Has there been any author who has written something so great in his or her only effort?  Yes, there are authors like Margaret Mitchell who wrote Gone With the Wind (which has a far more romantic version of the Old South), but her career was cut short by an early death; Lee is still around and still has no other books published.  The one book she wrote, however, is considered one of the greatest novels ever written.  It is a true classic. <br />",2007-04-07

I had to think about what I could possibly add to the mix - and I hope this review isn't too repetitious.<br /><br />I just finished re-reading the novel a few days ago (after nearly 40 years!) and am still feeling an emotionally charged afterglow. It is a combination of warm regard for the characters and a somewhat homesick yearning to return to the roots of the book - Maycomb, AL, and know the people better.<br /><br />As I thought about what might be affecting me so strongly it occurred to me that Harper Lee, I think, may have written a novel with character archetypes so strong and compelling that a person is wrapped up in it as if the story is their own. And not only that. Although the book has a great plot, story line, drama, suspense, mystery, social conscience, etc. It is really only about one thing. Love. It is written with love and it illustrates love in a world where those illustrations are like oases in a hot, dry desert.<br /><br />The character of Atticus Finch, for example, is an exemplary model of a loving father, neighbor, friend and shows this quality not only in the way he treats others, but even in the way he thinks about others. Yet, he also exhibits unquestionable strength and courage.<br /><br />I take away from this novel (and hope others will too) a model of behavior that I would like to emulate - or at least to aspire to.<br /><br />So, if you have a chance, drink this refreshing story and quench that thirst for knowledge of what it means to love.

I first read the book as a freshman in high school and fell in love with the story almost immediately.  Harper Lee didn't just create a cast of unforgettable full-rounded characters, including Scout, Jem, Atticus, Dill, and Boo Bradley that have become a part of a cultural conscious, but she also wove a memorable tale that exposed the evils of racism, as well as other societal ills from child abuse to the flaws of our public education system.<br /><br />The story takes place during the Great Depression in Maycomb, Alabama and is told from the perspective of Jean Louis Finch, aka Scout.  Scout has an older brother named Jem.  Their mother is deceased and they call their father by his first name, Atticus.  He is a lawyer and a respected citizen of the community.  The Finch family undergoes some difficult challenges when Atticus is selected as the defense attorney for a young black man named Tom Robinson who is accused of raping a poor, white woman.  The case rocks the community and becomes somewhat sensational and changes the lives of everyone involved with it.<br /><br />Having reread TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, I was once again touched by the beautiful simplicity of the novel.  The characters are authentic and drawn from real life.  The novel is set in the Depression, but the characters could have come from any small town in America.  Having lived and been raised in a small town I notice many similarities between the place of my youth and the town of Maycomb, Alabama as Scout describes it.  That doesn't mean that people raised in an urban setting will be unable to relate to the novel, because they can and often do.  The novel has a universal message and story.  That's why it's a classic and is a book that all Americans should read at least once in their lives.",2007-03-01

Growing up in the scorching heat of Maycomb County, Alabama, may be hard for Scout, her headstrong brother Jem, and their wise friend from Meridian, Mississippi, Dill, but throughout the story the kids have many good times. <br />  <br />In the small town, everybody knows a little about each family except for the Radleys. Even though the Radleys live close to the Finches, all the kids ever hear about them was deranged rumors of their child, Boo. Dill was especially interested in trying to find out who Boo Radley really was. The kids invent a lot of stories about Boo, but will they ever get to see him? <br /> <br />Scout and Jem's father, Atticus Finch, was my favorite character in this story. The voice of knowledge and reason came from Atticus, who was a role model not only to me, but also to his son Jem. Atticus was a lawyer for the town who believed that no matter what race, there should be an equality within a courthouse, which will be proven when Tom Robinson, a black man who was accused of raping a white girl. Atticus has to muster all his strength to win this case because the jury and the whole town against him. Will Atticus ring true or will racial injustice win this case, read To Kill a Mockingbird to find out.  <br /> <br />Racial injustice was huge in this book, being in 1935 slavery is abolished but not all of the white people respect black people yet and sometimes took advantage of the black people's nice intentions. The black people were the scapegoat of many of the white people's misfortune when they didn't know whom to blame. Even in the court, where the color of your skin shouldn't matter, there is a big bias with black people. Hopefully Atticus's loyalty to Tom Robinson will bring a wind of change to the community of Maycomb County. <br /> <br />In a town where everything is changing, even Jem and Scout as they get older and hit puberty, a line is crossed in Tom Robinson's court case, but by whom? To Kill a Mockingbird sends every reader back in time so they can witness how far we have come from the 1930's and how racist our country was then. Harper Lee does an excellent job at describing even the minute details in an eight year olds life.

She discusses her views on a very important topic, racism. Scout is a curious girl who along with her brother, Jem, is fixated on her neighbor, Boo Radley. Boo is a strange man who has spent almost all of his life inside his house and never comes outdoors. Scout unsuccessfully tries to meet Boo Radley many times. <br /> Atticus Finch, Scout's father, represents moral values and justice in this story. Atticus is chosen to defend Tom Robinson, a black man, in a trial where Tom was accused of raping a white woman. Atticus does what is right and accepts this challenge and puts his whole heart into this case. He knew it would be very hard for him to persuade an all white jury not to convict this black man of rape, but he does not let this stop him. This appeal was not just a simple rape trial it exemplified racism in the world of the 1930's. Atticus does more than expected, he tries not only to win his case but break a barrier between whites and blacks. <br /> This is a timeless novel that will always be viewed as one of the greatest story ever written. It symbolized hope for many and also symbolized an end to world of racism. <br />",2006-12-20

A young girl and two boys are seen in the yard of a brick house playing a kind of role-playing game.  One is swinging a pair of scissors around while the others are laughing and trying to avoid him.  Suddenly a call is heard, and the children put down their things to greet a coming man.  Scout Finch runs up to her father, Atticus, and hugs him. <br /> <br /> The book, To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, takes place in Northern Alabama, in the city of Maycomb.  People in Maycomb live by an unwritten caste system of insiders and outsiders.  They live almost alone and separate from the rest of the world, with few visitors, and an absence of commuting.  Segregation funs free, and the community lets one woman's claim cause the trial of another, Tom Robinson, just for the color if his skin. <br /> <br /> The story is seen through the eyes of a young impressionable girl, Scout Finch.  Growing up, Scout sees prejudice all around her and is brought up to accept it by her community.  However, her father, Atticus Finch, and her brother Jem are always there nudging her in the direction of equality when she fall astray. <br /> <br /> The main theme in this story is the tortures of prejudice and the striving for equality.  The emotions of prejudice ring clear not just between blacks and whites but inside the races as well.  There are strict social classes so that no matter where one turns, prejudice is staring right back at one's face. <br /> <br /> The story is based around the life of Scout Finch in the town of Maycomb in 1935.  For years, her brother, her friend Dill, and Scout dreamt of the almost legendary Boo Radley and of meeting him.  Their summers were spent dreaming of Boo, until their livers were shattered by the highly public trial of Tom Robinson.  In the coming months, Scout faces torment of all kinds, all because of her father defending Tom. <br /> <br /> All in all, I thought this was a book that most teenagers and adults could enjoy.   Seeing the world through the eyes of a child again really spoke to me in many ways.  Scout is so young and virtually unaffected by all the racism in her world, it takes me back to my experiences at her age.  If you want a classic novel that you won't be able to put down, then I highly recommend Harper Lee's masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird.",2006-12-19

She shows how poverty, racism and growing up in a small city in Alabama was like.      The character that the book follows is Scout a young white girl who would rather wear overalls and play in the mud than wear a dress and sit all day.  Her view on life is so precise that you would think a little girl was writting the book.  She is the reason why this book is a page turner.      In the book, Scout's best friends are her brother Jem and Dill. Jem starts off hanging out with Scout but as he grows older and gets into sports they drift apart a little bit.  Dill is a 7 year old boy who looks like he's younger.  Dill only comes to Maycomb in the summer to spend time with his Aunt Rachel.      The kids summers and stories revolve around Boo Radley who the kids think is a crazy man locked up in the Radley place and only comes out at night.  Only a few people have been lucky enough to have seen Boo.  The funny and \\""intellegent\\"" ways the kids come up with plans to get Boo to come out are what keeps this book alive.      Scout and Jem's father Atticus is a very respected lawyer who has been appointed to defend a black man of a horrible crime.  Their family goes through a very rough time before and during the trial with all the names that Scout and Jem hear kids calling their dad.  Atticus makes sure that they dont let the other kids get the best of them and to not get angry and upset.      The man Atticus is defending is an innocent black man named Tom Robinson.  Even though Atticus knows he's innocent he has a hard time convincing the all white jury of that.  He tells the jury not to look at this as a black vs. white trial but a man vs. man trial and to give Tom Robinson every chance he has at a fair trial.  He tells them to look deep inside their hearts and to see what is right.    In \\""To Kill A Mockingbird\\"" Atticus gives one of the most inspiring speeches I have ever read.  To see what the jury decides and what happens to all the characters I highly recommend reading this book.",2006-12-17

First, Spacek is an excellent reader who has a unique way of giving every character a unique voice--both sexes, and all ages, races, and social classes. She even manages to project the feistiness and naivte of the young narrator (\\""Scout\\"" Finch, who is about 7 years old through most of the novel) without being as annoying as the character most likely was to the adults she interacted with. Spacek's warmth and sensitive reading were essential in communicating that MOCKINGBIRD is a novel about how a community understands itself: the silences it keeps and the things it will and won't tolerate. Although I read the book many years ago and enjoyed it then, what struck me as especially interesting upon hearing it anew is that Harper Lee has done something very unique, she has presented us with a dual coming-of-age story. At the same time that Scout is facing some hard realities as she reaches what theologicans used to call \\""the age of reason,\\"" her brother Jim is moving from childhood to adolescence (at one point he proudly displays a single chest hair), a time of troubling ambiguity. This dual perspective of reason and sexuality proves to be the perfect lens through which to observe the key events of the story, the ugliness of racism and the trumped-up charges of rape that Atticus Finch, the children's father, is called to address in his role as court-appointed lawyer for an accused black man. At times the novel veers toward preachy, and I'm sure some readers/listeners will find it heavy-handed.

It should give you the impression that I absolutely love this book like you wouldn't believe.  Yep.  That's right.}<br /><br />My earlier review of the book amounted to little more than \\""rah rah rah, go read this!\\"" Now let me go into some more detail. The story is excellent on many levels, and it's a bit more complex than a retelling of the plot would indicate. \\""Black man accused of raping white girl in the Depression era.\\"" That's the court case that drives some of Harper Lee's novel. Gregory Peck won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of attorney Atticus Finch, one of literature's most memorable characters. And yet, in the novel, Atticus isn't the main character. This book is about his daughter Scout and his son Jem. Scout is our narrator, and what we see (and don't see) comes from her.<br /><br />So how did this translate to the big screen? Quite well. The child actors, both newcomers, were excellent in their roles. Ditto on the boy who portrayed Dill, whose part was far larger in the novel but which is good in the film as well. The book had a large number of plots and subplots, so the filmmakers had to strip some away to make it work as a movie. They chose well. The results are still as complex and multi-textured as life itself.<br /><br />I watched this maybe a month after reading it, so I remembered 90% of what would happen, along with much of what was deleted. I doubt the movie could have been done much better than it was, and I'll watch it again. I'm aware of all the \\""deep dark Southern secrets\\"" from the novel, those that were in the film and those that weren't. I got a strong sense that the actors were equally aware, and that's cool. Nobody could fit them all into a film that lasts under 2 hours, so they only chose the most relevant. This is how it should be. I very love this film, as we say in China, and it'll probably be in my DVD collection until I die.<br /><br />Oh, and this is purely coincidental.

There are chunk of generation who are Mockingbird-free who is now about 50 to 60years old, well educated, well read, good speller but missed timing to read this book as young adult because it was not around or school didn't assigned it on them. These people grow up and know once how to appriciate good books, it is kinda hard to go back to pick up this book in first time in their lives. So naturally, if you are not an English major--means you can't write-- and an adult and read this book and able to appriciate it, chances are you are kinda person who won't read more complicated books anyway or your kid had to read it so you just did (my case) or watched movie first and got interested in or, you are an immigrant (my case) ---so we can't spell.  It have been four years since I read it first time and back then, I was reading only chicklits and books my kid was reading because that's about I could have understood. Now I can see through how much struggle for the author to make this book publishable with help from editor and agent. How come Atticus, that perfect dad, let kids go alone in the dark to Halloween pagent and aunt Alexandra, the gossip, would not wanted to accompany them knowing whole town is at the school? because otherwise Bob could not have chance to attack kids so whole climax won't come about. Scout does pre- show for the family and go so far to explain once she got to the show, that ladies too tired from decorating were not there, to justify her aunt's absence. I hate myself even thinking about all these while I was re-reading but could not help it. It moved me to my guts the first time I read it when I did not know any better (or worse)   It is sad as many kids love this book in this review pages, some kids just plain hate it. You have to be young and flexisible to hitby the chord but you have to be mature enough to understand the deeper message.

However, I was not one of those students. It was not on my reading list, much to my regret now. I just finished reading the book and enjoyed it thoroughly. I love Scout's charming point of view and her descriptions of childhood summers make me wish for times past. Justice, or lack of it, is made so real when looked at from the perspective of Scout and her brother Jem. And the dynamic between the kids and the mysterious Boo Radley is just plain cool in the book. <br /> <br />The movie is great too. A classic. The way some of the scenes are portrayed is dead on. I also love how Scout's narration in the book is carried into the movie. It's great to hear Harper Lee's narrative spoken. The charm of Scout's childhood is effectively portrayed visually in the film. I do like the book better for the simple reason that it portrays so much more than the movie ever could. The \\""relationship\\"" between the kids and Boo Radley is included in the movie but more fully developed in the book. Because the movie just can't handle it fully, it ends up as a sidestory to the trial instead of a developed storyline all its own as in the book. The movie also couldn't include some of the additional charm of the book - like the storyline with Mrs. Dubose; how the kids feel about Atticus and the Finch family; visiting Calpurnia's church; or how Aunt Alexandra, surprisingly enough, began to have an effect on the lady Scout would become. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong though, I really did enjoy the movie. The character portrayals were great - especially Scout and Atticus.  But I must say (at the risk of sounding like the girl that I am) that the best part about the movie to me was that it brought the book to life so effectively that in parts I was somewhat emotional. It is a powerful story of childhood and race and justice (or injustice) that cannot be ignored. It speaks to so many in book or filmform. Awesome! Enjoy both!",2006-08-09

Such a book exists in Harper Lee's masterful 1960 novel, one of the most revered pieces of fiction this country has ever produced. Set in rural, Depression-era Alabama, it is a classic coming-of-age story about a precocious nine-year old tomboy named Scout. What she experiences is palpable in the virulent racism surrounding the persecution of Tom Robinson, a black man unjustly accused of raping Mayella, the abused white daughter of an unrepentant bigot, Bob Ewell. Representing Tom in court is Atticus Finch, Scout's father and the moral compass of the story.<br /><br />The plot moves toward a deepening exploration of the intractable conflict between tolerance and ignorance and how the pre-existing environment of hatred and mistrust makes innocent people guilty by pure circumstance. Scout embodies these themes within her own journey toward womanhood and her questions of what society expects of her. Through the travails of Tom and the town's outcast, Boo Radley, and primarily through her father's example, Scout recognizes how innate goodness can exist even in the direst circumstances. Likely because the story is semi-autobiographical, Lee is able to vividly capture the rural south and the pervasive mindset during the Depression with spellbinding accuracy. Yet for all that, the book's lasting legacy has more to do with Lee's particular lierary gift in bringing a genuine universality to her themes.<br /><br />Other characters weave in and out of the story - including Dill, Scout's wannabe boyfriend and the Truman Capote doppelganger - and each plays a key role in shaping the novel's core conflicts. I have to say that the author's particular literary strengths come to the fore in her empathetic depictions of the evolving relationships between these characters, for example, Scout and her father Atticus, Scout and her brother Jem, the children and Boo. Nothing seems extraneous in the story Lee tells, no small feat for a 336-page novel. She brings intense emotion to her prose, especially in describing the uncontrollable fury created by racial hatred and false accusations, for instance, in the lynch mob scene before the trial and in the vengeful attack on the children. The timing of the book's original 1960 publication turned out to be prescient, as the Civil Rights movement was just becoming national in scope thanks to the efforts of Martin Luther King and his brethren.

The first and foremost thing is if I can relate to it at all. No matter how farfetched the situations are, if the characters feel real or I can some how believe what's happening, what they're feeling then the book has achieved a great amount: that's the first sign of a good book. The second sign is the ending. If the ending blows me away and I'll be sitting with the last sentence, mouth ajar for a few minutes I know I've read a good book. The last thing is what it's about: if it feels like fluff  or like the author didn't have much of a reason to write the novel other than money then it's hard to read. If the book is expressing a huge feeling that the writer's desperate to get out or if the novel's bringing something of importance to our attention however, then it's worth reading. \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" had all these traits. <br /> <br />When I first opened Harper Lee's only novel I wondered about it for the first few pages. Jean Louise Finch, the narrator of the novel, was giving the reader a historical timeline of her family, which didn't attract my attention and I was worried I wouldn't like it, but as soon as the story began I couldn't put it down. I have to admit I'm a very slow reader and even with short books that I love, Old Man and the Sea for example (a circa 100 page novella), it takes me about a week or two to get through. I read \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" in around 3 days. I'm not bragging or anything I'm just displaying it's grip. It's not a fast moving novel, it actually is slower and it just talks about normal life; but I couldn't leave the characters for too long because I developed such a strong bond with them instantaneously.  <br /> <br />I can't really go too far into the ending of the book because I don't want to give anything away but I must saythat about two pages before the end my heart was twisting, not because it was sad (although it was in a way), because it was so powerful... so good.  <br /> <br />Now I don't think it's any surprise that \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" has important values tied to it. But I found that most all of the main messages of the book tie back to everyone being selfish and misunderstanding each other. There are numerous occasions of prejudice and you get the chance to see almost every character misunderstand and judge another. <br /> <br />The book really connected with me and I would suggest it to people who like books that show real human beings and tell coming of age stories that have much more meaning to them than cheesy TV movies. I can understand people not liking this book however, for its slowness but I didn't find it slow at all: I could hardly put it down.

But it was a week ago (4 years later), when I finished reading it for the second time, that I fully appreciated its brilliance. <br /> To my great joy, the author, Harper Lee is alive! In fact, she celebrated her 80th anniversary in April. So, besides planning to write to her to express my gratitude for her masterpiece, I intend to make her a belated birthday present. Now if I help you feel an urge to read To Kill a Mockingbird, moreover, if you really get round to reading it, I believe she'd be glad to have this present from you. <br /> Let me begin by mentioning that Harper Lee is said to consider her book as a simple love story. I don't know if she was serious really. If she wasn't joking, then what she meant by a love story was something quite different from the dictionary definition, because To Kill a Mockingbird is far from being a story about a romantic relationship. However, if we define a love story as a story about pure love and care for each other, a story about deep affection for our family, about concern for those we believe deserve our respect and trust, then it is the most touching and moving love story I have ever read. <br /> The plot covers just a few years, which, however, seem like a long time because during that time the two protagonists - Scout and her elder brother Jem - learn their crucial lessons about life. In this sense, the book could rightfully be defined as a bildungsroman. The story is told by Scout who looks back on her childhood with greater understanding than when she was little. In fact, judging by the way she relates those days, back then she only relied on her intuition to grasp what was happening and what she was being told. Actually, this was exactly what helped her see things more clearly. As a Mr. Raymond told her and her friend Dill one day, `...you are children and you can understand it.'  <br /> To cite Mr. Raymond again, the book is about \\""the simple hell people give other people - without even thinking...the hell white people give colored folks, without even stopping to think they're people, too.\\"" But it is not just a story about racial segregation and severe discrimination. Scout tells us about the way her father and the cook Calpurnia bring them up. Thus, To Kill a Mockingbird could also be considered a handbook for raising a child. I myself reckon that it has already influenced the way I would treat a child of mine. And this is another reason why I am grateful to Harper Lee. The approach of Atticus (the children's father) to Scout and Jem is definitely one to be admired. Every other thing he says or does is worth quoting as an example to follow. One of the very first lessons he teaches Scout is one of empathy:  <br /> \\""First of all,' he said, \\""if you can learn a simple trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view - \\"" <br /> \\""Sir?\\"" <br /> \\"" - until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.\\"" <br /> Ironically, this very first lesson plays a major role in her understanding of matters, events and controversy that would otherwise be above her comprehension. Ironically, I say, because very few people in the small town in Alabama where she lives were taught that same lesson. <br />        Despite all the bitterness in it, To Kill a Mockingbird is also a fun read, sometimes even hilarious. What mainly contributes to this effect is Scout's perspective of her family, the townsfolk, and everything she witnesses. Were these accounts not a child's ones, they would often sound as sarcastic remarks...for Scout's forthrightness. <br />        To conclude, I regard this novel as an unquestionable masterpiece. To be honest, I cannot wait to read it again. What is peculiar about it is the fact that as much as the plot involves the reader, and as poignant as the climax is, I don't think there is a real climax. The suspense and the emotional intensity built up from the very first page don't really leave us after the alleged climax, but even grow stronger. And what resonates with us is that \\""it is a sin to kill a mockingbird\\"".",2006-06-08

Scout, a young girl, her brother Jem, and Atticus Finch are a family that lives in the early 1900's in a small town called Maycomb. It's a racist town that discriminates against black people. Their father takes on a trial of defending a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been tried with rape. He feels that is morally right, and that it would be a sin to not do it, just like killing a mockingbird, one of the most harmless animals on earth. My reaction to the Novel was that I feel like we all live life in the way that we shouldn't. We should use the sang \\""It's a Sin to kill a mockingbird\\"". To me, it's a way of expressing how we should treat each other. We should all help each other out, even in the worst possible situations. We should help someone, even if the people around us will hate us for it. It would be something that would be right to do and it would be a nice thing for our life. It also makes me take life a little bit slower. We shouldn't rush through things just to get it done, and we shouldn't rush through it so we don't have to experience the pain/sorrow. We should all help each other. I recommend this because we could all learn something from it. How it can help us later and now in life. How we can help people in need. It's a very good book that anyone would enjoy. It will take you to a place that you would least expect to read about in the active life we live today. It would teach us true meanings about life. Anyone can read it, and they will probably like it. I didn't want to read it at first, and it thought it would be boring.

Scout lives in the small town of Maycomb in Alabama. The novel examines her life and how she responds to large-scale issues and small, petty problems in her own life. This novel is more of a slice of life, with the main narrative problem and solution not coming until the end. <br /> <br />Scout Finch is 8 years old when the story begins. She spends most of her time acting out stories with her brother Jem and their beloved friend Dill. The trio also has a fascination with Boo Radley, a man who has evolved into an urban legend. The three make it their goal to make him leave his house. The book focuses on Scout's small worldview for the first half or so, how all she cares about is making Boo Radley come out and acting out plays in the summer. That all changes when her father, Atticus, decides to defend a young black man accused of rape. As racial issues and prejudices broaden Scout's view of things, we can only go along for the ride. <br /> <br />This is a true masterpiece, with excellent characters like Atticus and Dill, along with the youthful innocence of Scout. \\""To Kill A Mockingbird\\"" is a classic, a read that truly depicts life in a way I had never experienced before.",2006-06-03

The main conflict in the book was about Atticus trying to win a rape trial including a black guy.  <br /> The book was very exciting to read. I thought it was exciting because the trial kept going back and fourth and I never knew who was going to win. I was not able to feel in the book because the time period was way off and I couldn't make many connections to the book. The main conflict was very interesting because I never knew who was going to win the trial and it always kept me guessing. I thought that characters in the book were very realistic because the author explained them perfect and made them face real life situations. I thought that the ending was a bit disappointing, but it was what I was expecting. I wasn't so happy with the ending because the person that won in the trial wasn't the one I wanted to win.  <br /> The author wrote with a narrative southern voice. The author's voice was southern like the characters. The author uses vocabulary in a very interesting way. He uses difficult words through out the book but they aren't to difficult that you can't understanding them. I think the author wrote in a very unique way. It was really unique when the author talked in a southern voice like the characters did. The author also explained everything so perfect which made the book one hundred times better. The author used a lot of dialogue in this book. The author had to use a lot of dialogue because of the trial and there were a ton of people talking at different times. I thought that this author wrote this book perfect. He explained everything perfectly for me and I always knew what was happening. <br /> I would give this book an eight out of ten. I give it this rating because I am not very satisfied with the ending but it was overall a great book. I recommend this book to kids thirteen and older because they will understand it a whole lot better. I also recommend this book to people who want a very good book that is challenging.  <br /> Overall I thought that this was a great book. I really thought the author did a good job writing this book and I am looking forward to other books written by him. I think the greatest thing about this book is how the author always keeps you guessing through the trial and never gave away who was going to win during the book. Something I didn't mention in previous sections was that Atticus' kids were afraid of the neighbor's house because he never came out and they never saw him and they thought he was like a mass murderer or something. The neighbor was overall a great guy and the kids noticed that during the book.

It is an interesting and touching story about two kids growing up in Maycomb, Alabama during the great depression in the 1930's. It was a time with racism and discrimination. The whole town turns on Atticus Finch, the father of Scout and Jem, because he was the attorney for a black man named Tom Robinson. Tom was accused of raping a young white girl, because he is black. Even though he was innocent, no one in the town believed him but Atticus.  <br />The story is told through the eyes of Scout Finch, a six-year-old tomboy who was dragged into this racial battle with her father and brother. Her and her brother Jem became friends with Dill. Dill lived with his aunt in Maycomb over the summer and they became very mischievous and discovered their neighbor who hasn't been seen outside of his house since he got in trouble with the law at a young age. His name is Arthur Radley, or more known as Boo Radley, and the children became fascinated with him. They tell scary and mysterious stories about Boo. Their main goal is to get a peek at Boo, but then they started communicating with him by notes and objects left in an old tree.  <br />The trail brings out the towns ugly side, but Lee also has many offsets, like the elderly lady that tried to overcome her morphine problem before she died.

Atticus explains to Scout how she needs to get into other peoples skin if she wants to understand the way they liveor feel about something. Atticus's words are very heartfelt throughout the whole story. He is an unforgettable character, and impressed me many times while reading the book. He is a great father, and he stood up for what he believed in, even though the whole town was against him. He never gave up through the hard times that he was having with not only the trial. <br /> It is a very rough and soft story about class, justice, race, and growing up.

US,10806434,RZC9NBN4BQSV0,0446310786,994527755,To Kill a Mockingbird,Books,5,2,5,N,N,"Why I Love This Book","Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird, written in 1960, is a work that I feel has literary value and is worth examining.  It is a story of a father, Atticus Finch, in small-town Maycomb, Alabama during the depression who is raising his two children on his own.  Jem is the older brother who is constantly initiating explorations, and Scout is the tomboyish younger sister who helps him stir up trouble.  Their mother died when they were small children, and Calpurnia was a black woman who kept house and watched over the children while Atticus was working as a lawyer.  It has many subplots, but the mainly the novel is about a legal case in which Atticus is fighting a battle he knows he can't win.  He is defending a black man, Tom Robinson, that he knows is not guilty of the murder of a white man.  As racism was still common during the depression, Tom Robinson was essentially automatically guilty, but Atticus decides to fight for him regardless. <br />After reading this piece three times, I have come upon and changed many opinions concerning it.  The first time I read this novel, I didn't like it at all.  I didn't understand how a book could be titled To Kill a Mockingbird and only mention mockingbirds three times in its duration.  Reading it a second time with newly acquired maturity and comprehension, the title made more sense to me, making the reading experience less frustrating.  As a ninth grade honors English student, I was finally forced to take the book for more than its face value and truly appreciate all it had to offer.  The development of characters is exquisite, the uses of metaphors are intense, and the underlying theme of the novel was one that kept me coming back to further understand it. <br />     Harper Lee spends a great deal of time describing new characters in this novel.  Although the specific details of the physical appearances, backgrounds, and mannerisms of each character might seem to some as redundant and a waste of good page space, I feel it really enriched the experience for me.  When I know that Calpurnia was \\""all angles and bones; she was nearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard ,\\"" I can create an image in my mind.  I no longer picture a simple, black housekeeper; I see a woman who works with dedication and vigor.  I can imagine her standing in my own kitchen, squinting out the window at my brother and me causing trouble.  I feel that this descriptive mental image further ties me into the story.   <br />     The mockingbird is a simply a \\""common grayish bird, especially of the southern U.S. that is remarkable for its exact imitations of the notes of other birds ,\\"" until it is used in this novel.  It then takes on a much deeper meaning as a contextual symbol.  In this novel, the use of symbolism as a metaphoric method is extremely prevalent.  Mockingbirds represent innocence.  When their uncle gives Scout and Jem air rifles, Atticus tells them they can shoot as many bluebirds as they want, but reminds them that, \\""...it is a sin to kill a mockingbird. \\""  This is because mockingbirds do one thing, and that is make music that people enjoy, as opposed to doing destructive things, like other birds.  To kill a mockingbird would be to kill an innocent creature, which is mirrored in Atticus' case with the innocent Tom Robinson.  This symbolism really made me interact with what I was reading, because it was a lesson I firmly believed in and was taught as I was growing up.  When a literary piece captures my beliefs or thoughts or feelings like that, it really connects me on a deeper level that makes the experience much more intense because it is personal. <br />     Atticus also teaches his children that they can \\""never really understand a person until you consider things from his point-of-view... \\"" This theme is not only something I can also relate to, but it is used in a repetitive, but not redundant, way in the novel.  Harper Lee provides examples of this so discreetly that it takes a great deal of focus to pick them out.  When a mob is threatening Atticus for his defense of Tom Robinson, Scout picks a man out of the crowd and talks to him about his child that is her age.  This made him back down from the mob's threats, because she put the man into her father's position, as a parent who was teaching right and wrong.  This need for heightened concentration on the text really made the book thrilling above its existing entertainment on the basic level.  When I had to give the extra attention to the small, seemingly unimportant events in the novel, it made the story come to life and provided me with a desire to delve further into what Harper Lee had hidden in this book for me to discover.   <br />     To Kill a Mockingbird is a literary work that has had an impact on my life in many ways.  I was encouraged to follow the lessons my parents had instilled in me during my childhood, including being understanding of other people and the challenges in their lives and recognizing, valuing and respecting innocence.  I really interacted with the characters and metaphors in a story for the first time while reading a novel.  I learned that novels can be much more complex than we take them to be, but sometimes it takes patience and focus to find out what the author is trying to tell us.  It was the first book I ever examined at a deeper level, and it is still the book I have spent the most time digging into and contemplating.  For this reason, I can say I truly liked this novel. <br />",2006-03-30
US,51341166,R3RYAPF2Y11QW1,0060935464,994527755,To Kill a Mockingbird,Books,5,4,6,N,N,"Conscience is the one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule","One of the most unforgettable stories of all time, To Kill A Mockingbird becomes a landmark novel in American literature since its publication in 1960. It is a novel of a lawyer, Atticus, in the deep south defending a black man Tom Robinson charged with the rape of a white girl. Nine-years-old Jean Louise Atticus, from whom her father always shelters and whom neighbors often deems too young to understand the racial struggle, narrates the story. She does it with a stark manner and equanimity of an adult who is savvy of the law. Her perspective is unbridled of the biased and disapproving voices of the town, of which nobody does even one thing to help Tom Robinson, let alone risking one's own life to defend a black man who in the secret courts of men's hearts have no case. That simply being a black yields a disadvantage in the jury's deliberation let alone a black man who is allegedly convicted of an act of felony against a white person. Tom Robinson is dead as the girl opens her mouth and rains charges on him. <br /> <br />A child's narration cuts to the core of hypocrisy: some of the most religious people turn their blind eye to an innocent black man who in the absence of any corroborative evidence is indicted on a capital charge and is on the trial of his life. Jean Louise's voice of the narrative might be hesitant, dubious, and questioning, she packs the novel with intimate voice of conversation, of people living and sorting out their lives and the whole racial entangle. Atticus therefore bears a formidable task to not only defend Tom Robinson but also to rebuff, with a righteous indignation, the inveterate discrimination against the blacks. He thrives to protect the children from absorbing the human ugliness: Why can't people get along with each other? Who do people get out of their way to despise one another? What really scares me is such racial labeling still exists now but in a subtler manner that no longer makes people feel broken. In the recent Katrina news coverage, the media labeled a black woman who waded through the hip-deep water hurling supplies out of a store a looter. Racial labeling pervades people like babies born with basic instincts: it renders a stereotype that is culpable of perception that is laden with judgment. <br /> <br />Atticus knows that Tom Robinson's case, though it is as simple as black and white that it should never have come to trial, is something that dives right into the essence of a man's conscience. Conscience is the one thing that does not abide by the majority rule. It transcends all racial difference and confronts the intimacy of one's heart. That is the reason he wishes his children to embrace some \\""ugly things\\"" that are concomitant of his defending a black man - for all he does is to abide by his conscience and to come clear of it. It is never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name, especially when one is defending a good cause against mendacious testimony. It just shows how poor and piteous people are when they with maddening superiority thrive to label and call name at others. <br /> <br />To Kill A Mockingbird vehemently condemns those who recklessly bend the law at the expense of the innocent's life for the satisfaction of one's supremacy. It also satirizes self-righteous people who rave madly when anything involving a black person occurs. Every page of the novel reminds us that the fight for equality is yet over: it radiates a wave of racial tension and menacing undertow of conflict. <br />",2006-03-25

Reading was more of a drudgery than it was an enjoyment. Then, I entered my freshman year and God's providence placed me under the guidance of an English teacher named Mrs. Lemke. She had an uncanny ability of matching students up with just the right reading assignments. A few weeks into my freshman year, after she had gotten to know her students, she assigned me two books, WATERSHIP DOWN and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, to read and report on. When I learned that one was about rabbits and the other, a little girl, I was furious. The least she could have done would be to give me westerns or war stories. Eventually, I conceded to the fact that the two books would have to be read and so began my journey into a life long love of books.  I credit those two books with totally changing my outlook or reading for the sake of enjoyment. What a brilliant teacher Mrs. Lemke proved to be and I thank God for putting her in my life.<br /><br />That was over 30 years ago and I would venture to say, I have read Harper Lee's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD probably 15 times.  It's one of those rare volumes that you just have to take down off the shelf, dust it off and re-acquaint yourself with its brilliant narrative. I just consider it a travesty that Harper Lee wrote only this one single masterpiece. She had such a way of luring the reader into a love affair with her subjects.<br /><br />The story of Atticus Finch and his two children, Jem and Scout, or Jean Louise as she so detested being called, encompasses so many of life's lessons and virtues. We read as the children struggle with their father's identity, racial tension, social differences and a neighbor shrouded in mystery and myth. We romantically consider their world \\""simpler times\\"", but to these two children and there good friend, Dill, they seemed anything but simple. And the portrait of their father, Atticus, is so magnificently portrayed by the author as a bastion of virtue. There should be a little bit of Atticus Finch in all of us.<br /><br />These days, I don't read much fiction, but this old favorite comes down every couple of years to be enjoyed over and over, and I can honestly say, with each reading, I enjoy it as much as ever.

Atticus Finch is the PERFECT man, therefore unrealistic, but hey it's a fictional story. Of course, there is no secret Lee modeled the characters in Mockingbird after real people in her life in Alabama. Lee is obviously Scout, her brother is Jem, and their childhood buddy Dill is Truman Capote. <br /> <br />Even though much is made about the rape trial, this is really the backdrop story to Scout's, Jem's and Dill's plan to make the town recluse, Boo Radley, come out of his house. This sounds trivial, but Lee makes it work. It's actually interesting despite the fact nothing eventful happens until the end. One thing that bothers me is that Dill was not there when the \\""big thing\\"" happened. Seems like Lee could have had it occur in another part of the season when Dill would be in Maycomb considering his invested interest for the previous two years. Other than this small nit-pick, Mockingbird is a warm, great, uncomplicatedly written, yet very complicated book. It's not complicated because of any great complexity. It's complicated because of the senselessness of racism and the seemingly helplessness of those who try to be fair. <br /> <br />",2006-03-10

It is a book that teaches the coexistence of good and evil of society with a very unpredictable story.  The story starts out as simple as just three kids trying to get a mysterious neighbor by the name of Boo Radley out of his house.  The story soon changes to the main characters trying to clear an innocent black man, Tom Robinson, who was framed for a crime and will be sentenced to death.  At this point, the story with Boo Radley is almost completely ignored.  You then wonder what the point of the beginning was.  But soon after the outcome of the court trial of Tom Robinson, you then wonder where the story is really going.  When you arrive at the ending, everything will all come together.  This is one of those books that gives more than just one scenario but leaves you hanging before they can be concluded.  The ending of the book then closes any open ends of the story and brings you to the lesson that the book is really trying to teach.

The story is told through the nostalgic eyes of Scout Finch, who describes her days as a young school girl living with her brother Jem and father Atticus Finch, a widowed attorney and very humane and courageous man.  Scout is a combination of still-innocent school girl and analytical thinker, and as she is puzzled by the cruelties and irrational feelings of certain adults.  The story centers on several themes, the most notable of which is Tom Robinson's trial.  Robinson is a black laborer falsely accused of raping a white woman.  Atticus Finch is appointed his public defender, and during the course of the trial Robinson's innocence becomes obvious to Scout and Jem (and to the reader).  But will evidence clearing a black man be enough to persuade the all-white jury in Alabama during the segregation era?   <br /> <br />This moving narrative was made into an equally good 1962 movie starring Gregory Peck and Mary Badham.

The story takes place in Maycomb County, a fictional town in Alabama. Scout and Jem are two innocent children who think that the world, along with everything inside it, is good. However, their perspective changed gradually with their father, Atticus, who was to defend Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. <br /> <br />At the beginning of the story, we get a peek of children's imagination and curiosity as they try to get Boo Radley to come of the house. Eventually, as the Tom Robinson trial begins, they began to see how cruel people can be towards others. The children eventually become more mature as they realize that adults, although mostly good, still have their blind spots like everyone else. <br /> <br />Family is an important aspect of this story. From the conversations between Atticus and his children, one can tell immediately how great a father Atticus is. He is not only wise and humble, but caring as well. By teaching the children to stand up for what they believe even if others would despise them for it, Atticus wanted them to be righteous just like him. By defending Tom, he is setting a good example for Scout and Jem to follow. <br /> <br />This novel contains many morals that one can unveil by carefully reading the book. Harper has a talent for capturing the reader's attention the moment they started reading the book. Throughout the novel, the reader's heart follows the plot of the story going up and down.

Harper Lee has just actually drawn out the entire book by using descriptive scenes, Southern dialogues, and a variety of mood. She also vividly described the 1930s typical town environment that mingles with the Great Depression. Harper Lee has placed herself in a 6 year-old child's feet, giving the readers a funny and enjoyable perspective of what a little girl would think of reality and the cruel world. <br /> <br />  The story begins when Scout (the narrator and the major character) introduces and brings us back to her past during the year where her brother broke his arm.  The book portrays Scout as a child who is advanced her age. Her behavior and actions are barely like a girl, but more like a carefree boy. Instead of crying and screaming when she is upset, she punches people. During the story, many conflicts happen. Scout and his friends try to force a spooky and notorious man out of his house. They later also witness the case where his father defends an African American who is accused of raping a white girl. This case hits disturbing waves in the town, causing his father's reputation to go down.  <br /> <br />  Even though this book is nearly 300 pages, it becomes very short when one starts reading.

Having just finished the unabridged audio version of it, I can safely say that both are worth investing your time in.  Written from the point of view of a lawyer's daughter looking back on three years in her childhood, it is very obvious that author Harper Lee drew much of her book from her own life, and her descriptions of both the people and places are probably not just derived from thin air.  In fact, Gregory Peck's performance of Atticus Finch reminded her so much of her father, that she cried on the set of the film!<br /><br />True, this is a story about the cruelties of injustice and prejudice--very anger provoking and often managing to stereotype characters that really probably existed in Lee's world--but it also speaks about the common human condition we all share no matter where we are:  our collective human lack of infallibility.  With some wit, wisdom, and innocence that gives way to grace through the comprehension of human imperfection, we see the lives of Scout, Jem, and Dill unfold in the middle of controversy that need not exist if it weren't for the small minded logic that far too many people possess.  Innocence dies in the face of cruelty--like killing a mockingbird.  This is the reason the children are never the same after witnessing the unfair trial of Tom Robinson and, as one of them observed about Boo Radley, the town recluse, he hid in his house because he wanted to, and sometimes we want to do the same.<br /><br />Our hero Atticus Finch is a bit unbelievable in his overabundance of goodness, but he sets a great role model for his children, and I believe that Harper Lee idolized her father enough that she wrote the book to immortalize and place him on a pedestal.  We all have blind worship for at least one person in our lives, but I think the real purpose of Lee's novel was to stress integrity, honor, and graciousness in all walks of life.

To Kill a Mockingbird, written by Harper Lee, is a perfect example to prove even with an outstanding defense in court, we cannot ever be sure how a case will turn out. Jean Louise Finch (referred to as Scout in the book) is the main character in this story. Her problems are not the most complicated, but she was considered young to start going through them: watching Atticus, her father, try to protect an African American man who was accused of raping a white girl and more simple- lessons about life. Scout faced difficult feelings for being a \\""young girl\\"". She would become angry at life and anything else in it when she did not understand something or when it was not fair. That is how life is, right? Sharing some of the same problems with Scout are other characters Jem, her older brother by four years; Charles Baker Harris (Dill), Scout's boyfriend who was introduced early in the book; Atticus, her father and an excellent lawyer; Calpurnia, the African American housekeeper in charge of the children due to their mother's death while Scout was two; and Aunt Alexandria, a mean sister of Atticus that tries to teach Scout how to become lady-like.  <br /> <br /> Throughout the tale, Scout learns how to live the \\""civil\\"" way from her Aunt Alexandria. Scout was completely stubborn with her ideas because whatever she saw, she took in, would then comprehend it, and finally form her own opinion.

This realistic fiction's theme in my opinion, we have to live life for ourselves because no one can live it for us.

In light of both the education I have received since I last read the book and my experience with the wonderful students I wok with on a daily basis, I now realize that I missed much of the book's significance and wisdom my first time around.  <br />Whether you grow up in the suburbs, the country, or in an urban metropolis, the lessons of love, race, class, justice, and personal growth contained within the pages of To Kill a Mockingbird are invaluable to an individual's growth and development as a citizen of a our diverse democracy. The story narrates the events that occurred in the lives of a sister and brother, Scout and Jem Finch, over a time period of three years. Told through the viewpoint of an innocent child, Scout, the tale brings to life a town's struggle with racism. The book also brilliantly exposes the complex varieties of good and evil that exist within each of us.  <br />In Lee's tale, Scout's father and brilliant lawyer, Atticus Finch, defends a black man, Tom Robinson, wrongly accused of raping a white woman. Atticus's pursuit for honesty and truth demonstrates to all the importance of standing up and fighting for what is right. Without the individuals like Atticus Finch that have lived throughout our nation's history, we would not have the freedom we often take for granted.  <br />This novel is essential to the education of all children.

From the prose, to the characters, plot and sub-plots, it is an utterly enchanting book. Atticus Finch is one of my most beloved characters in all of literature. I find the book excruciatingly gentle and pure, due in part to the corruption of the main plot contrasted with the tender setting. Kids don't know any better, as Jem and Scout represent, that they are not supposed to like others for the color of their skin or the cloths that they wear. Only the adults infect the world with hatred, even though Scout's got some bad temper; it, too, is simple anger. As with all great stories there is an overwhelming sense of suspense about Boo Radley, the town and even the fact that Atticus is the best shot in the county. Although the gentleness of the setting and some of the characters,e.g Scout, Jem and Dill, there is yet an over arching sense of tragedy that hangs over the book. It almost seems that Scout is recounting, through the narration, an unimaginably horrible time of her life that only recently healed enough to recount. And yet the summer days with Dill and Jem are told with misty nostalgia of a better time and place, that could neverlast, but that is for grown-ups. Race is one of the main issues that faces America still, that dare to live up to the words \\""that all men are created equal.\\"" Just as pertinent today as when the Jim Crow laws were still in effect. Childhood is a time of innocence and forgiveness; where adulthood is hard and unjust.

Sadly Harper Lee has had no other novels published since To Kill a Mockingbird. I first read To Kill a Mockingbird at school nearly three decades ago and since that time I must have read it at least once each year.

Jean Louise, or \\""Scout\\"" as everyone else calls her, has a mind of her own and is a tomboy that prefers overalls over dresses. Her older brother Jem is her best friend, along with Dill, a kid who visits the neighborhood every summer. These three kids spend their time questioning The Radley House. The run down house stands just a few doors down away from the Finch Household. Who knows what secrets are behind those closed doors? All they know about this mysterious house is that Arthur \\""Boo\\"" Radley hasn't been seen since before they could remember. During the time of the Great Depression, Scout faces the racism that comes with living in an African American community and it's hard effects that is has on her home. <br />          One day, Scout and Jem's father, Atticus, who is a lawyer, is assigned to defend an African American. Tom Robinson is being charged for supposedly raping a young white woman. After that, nothing seems to be the same. The two siblings are ridiculed at school, and must face the town's people who think that what their father is doing is wrong. Young adult readers may or may not enjoy this classic novel.

Back then in the 1930s, blacks were treated badly just for the color of their skin. Nobody cared about them. As for the whites, some found it hard to live that kind of lifestyle, just like the main characters, Jem and Scout, two siblings living at this time. They live in the town of Maycomb, Alabama. The town seems very boring and desolate. It also seems like they are stuck in a bubble, not able to get out of the town. <br /> <br />The book is narrated by a young girl named Scout who lives during the time when blacks and whites were segregated. Her father is a lawyer and he is often made fun of because he defends black people. Later in the book, he has to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who is charged for the crime of rape of a poor white girl, Mayella Ewell. <br /> <br />Atticus is the father of Jem and Scout. He raises him with their cook, Calpurnia. Atticus teaches Scout everything. He tells her, \\""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.\\"" She remembers this especially in the end of the book. Atticus says a lot of important things such as \\""There's a lot of ugly things in this world, son. I wish I could keep 'em all away from you. That's never possible.\\"" He really cares about his children and he wants them to grow up right. <br /> <br />One summer, Jem and Scout meet their next door neighbor's nephew, Dill, who comes over every summer. They become amused with the house down the street, the Radley's. They want to see the son who is believed to have stabbed his father with scissors, Arthur \\""Boo\\"" Radley. They have a silent relationship with Boo because of the presents Boo gives them in the knothole of a tree near the Radley house. The presents that he gave them included chewed up gum and figures that looked like them. It was really odd. <br /> <br />When I finished the book and took time to understand the meaning of why it is a sin to kill a mockingbird it all came to me and I liked the book. The book very harsh with racial discrimination, but it is really funny that the children of Maycomb County care more about the blacks than the adults. There are some fun and interesting parts besides the harsh comments, but mainly it focuses on how the past really was. I am still very happy to have been born in the time that I was. You must read this book because it will make you understand the past a little bit better and you will learn from the mistakes people back then made.",2005-10-11
US,16224155,RWT32R464NFQU,0446310786,994527755,To Kill a Mockingbird,Books,5,6,8,N,N,"Amazing","I had to read this novel for my Advanced Placement English class. It was actually something which I loved. Incredible... Harper Lee's novel is a timeless telling of a battle with morality and ethics during the Depression. Major events include Scout and Jem's developments as human beings, with the senses of justice, morality, and self that are integral to the personal psyche; Tom Robinson's accusation, trial, and death, as well as experiences with and the aftermath of these events; and Bob Ewell's hell-bent campaign of revenge against discreditors, along with Atticus' eternally optimistic, comforting presence. <br />SCOUT <br />Scout Finch begins her journey in To Kill A Mockingbird as a naive, childish, innocent 5-year-old who is dependent upon those who surround her: Jem, Atticus, and others. When we leave her, she has become more mature, contemplative, and significantly independent in mental areas. Although she still needs Atticus and Jem, Scout's realization of injustice and her ability to \\""climb into [a person's] skin and walk around in it\\"" (30) effectively fulfills the moral ambition which Harper Lee had set for the character. <br />JEM <br />Jeremy Finch begins the novel as much more mature than his younger sister. However, his journey is no less dramatic. Jem's major developments are in the areas of justice and morals. He was deeply immersed in the trial of Tom Robinson, whose verdict and human loss corrupted his new, inexperienced morals. Via Atticus and the good ol' time, the reader is confident that Jem's pysche will recover. <br />ATTICUS <br />Scout and Jem are highly dependent upon their father, who is the basis upon which they are able to morally and mentally develop. Atticus himself, as the foundation, is unwavering. He does not develop so much as details are revealed about him via circumstances that develop the others. If Bob Ewell is the Devil in the novel, Atticus is the always-good Christ figure. <br /> <br />LOSS OF INNOCENCE <br />The main theme, which is so deeply entwined in the novel that it is the source of the title, is the loss of innocence theme. In chapter 10, Atticus, the eternal voice of reason and conscience, tells Scout that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird. This is reaffirmed on several occasions. The theme involves a \\""mockingbird,\\"" or a completely innocent, uncorrupted person, being somehow damaged and hurt by an evil force that casuses them to lose their joy. Mockingbirds in the novel include Dill, Scout (who is able to maintain her optimism), and Jem (who is perhaps not so lucky), as well as Tom Robinson. However, the greatest example of all is that of Arthur \\""Boo\\"" Radley, an energetic, enigmatic boy who was damaged psychologically by an abusive, neglectful father to the point of exile and withdrawal into himself. <br />RACISM <br />There are many who consider To Kill A Mockingbird's discussion of racism to be taboo and thus have challenged the book. However, the trial of Tom Robinson, an event so central to the novel, is governed by Depression-era Southern prejudice, which includes use of the N-word to provide authenticity. THe message of the book is one of denouncing racism, and is thus integral to the development of anti-prejudice beliefs in the reader's psyche, not to mention for Jem and Scout. <br />CRITIQUE OF ORTHODOX EDUCATION <br />Harper Lee shows her dislike for orthodox education in two main events. First, Miss Caroline's methods of teaching are shown to be ineffective and encourage Scout to not read until she's supposed to be able to. Atticus, who Lee has established as the voice of right, tells Scout to keep reading, which shows favor for individual development. The second event is the current events sequence, during which Lee claims the objectives of forced public speaking are useless. She is clearly in opposition to the apparent advantages of \\""being singled out [and made] more than ever anxious to return to the Group\\"" (243) and the theory that the general populace is more important than one person. This may be part of the reason that To Kill A Mockingbird reflects the very individual developments of Scout and Jem. <br />OPTIMISM VS. PESSIMISM <br />The novel itself is littered with negative, pessimistic events. The greatest of these is undoubtedly racism, and the townspeople's collective inability to identify and deal with their own prejudice. Countering these events are such things as a three-hour jury deliberation and protection of life by an unexpected hero. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This is certainly true of the novel: Boo Radley will kill them, Boo Radley saves their lives. Maycomb is racist, Scout and Jem are able to use that to develop their morals. However, there are no existences of Maycomb that are so completely different from each other than the existences of Bob Ewell and Atticus Finch. If Bob Ewell wears red horns, Atticus wears a halo, and it is his unceasing presence that comforts his children. Atticus protects justice, innocence, and goodness, and it is no coincidence that in the end it is Bob who is dead and Atticus who thrives. VERDICT: Optimism. <br />PERSONAL OPINION <br />It is quite rare that I enjoy examining and dissecting a novel when forced to. TO Kill A Mockingbird is one of those rare books. I enjoyed it as a novel, which has eternally been my main objective. I also very much liked reading into the various morals of the story and learning about the theories and philosophies that Lee had presented. <br />As a novel, I found it to be controversial, stimulating, educational and well-written. While I admire Atticus for his parenting, sense of justice, morality, disregard for absolute propriety, and optimism without naivete, I found his character to be flawed but a little too Christlike. The same applies to Bob Ewell: nobody is that entirely evil, and for Lee to portray him as such was unrealistic. All in all, though, it was an interesting read. <br /> <br />There has been much discussion about the use of the N-word, especially by people on this board, including one named D.Thill. While I understand the desire to protect young children from offensive language, perhaps parents such as this person should take into account the maturity it takes to read this novel and to comprehend the objectives behind the use of the word. It provides authenticity; for Lee to not include it would not be honoring her own artistic vision. It has nothing to do with a lack of vocabulary. Perhaps such an individual should review their own grammatical abilities and comprehension in order to then understand Lee's brilliance.  <br /> <br />The discussion over whether or not the morals of this novel are relevant nowadays ... it's dispicable. I am in an AP English class. Clearly, the Canadian AP board considers this novel to be important. Whether or not the Americans are too offended by a telling of their own sordid history remains to be seen. Not discredting Faulkner or other incredible authors, To Kill A Mockingbird deserves just as much.  <br />Children are not stupid; especially in a society such as today's, exposing them to a piece of classic literature that deals with the controversial events is perhaps the best thing that could be done. Perhaps people would rather children learn about these things from TV or movies, where the messages so clearly outlined in this novel may be distorted.",2005-10-07

It begins, \\""When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.... When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident.\\"" Right off the bat we are made aware that we are about to read of  past events monumental enough to make the participants dwell on them decades later. There is the suggestion that there's more than meets the eye in what's about to unfold, so you'd better pay attention. And, there's the hint of violence in the mentioning of the broken arm. Was it really an accident? We'll have to read to find out.    Often it is said that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is told through the eyes of a child. This is not strictly true. The narrator of the novel is the now-grown daughter of Atticus Finch, nicknamed \\""Scout\\"" in her youth, recalling events from her childhood, albeit in extended passages evoking the point of view of her childhood. This seemingly simple device is a sophisticated one that allows the author a lot of freedom and power to tell the story. The younger Scout's disarming innocence serves as a vehicle for a more direct description of people and events -- after all, a child sees and hears well enough, but she doesn't understand -- allowing Lee to show rather than merely tell about people and events. And, when it suits the author, the adult Scout can address the reader more directly. This slight of hand with the point of view is, I believe, instrumental in creating a novel where the characters seem to come to life and leap off the pages. It's always a delight when writing so technically well-thought-out remains so easy to read. Small wonder that adults should love the book so much and urge middle school students to read it. It is an approachable masterpiece.    Some readers may complain that the novel takes its time getting around to what is considered its pivotal element, the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. I cannot see how Lee could have possibly told her story otherwise. We start with the children, who make up their own games and stories and more or less invent their own world as much as possible. Then the adult world gradually intrudes on Scout, her brother Jem, and their peculiar friend Dill Harris. Without being immersed in the children's Eden first, we cannot really understand the point of view of the narrator, who is telling the tale of her loss of innocence.  Much is made of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD as an indictment of racism. Certainly an awareness of and sensitivity to racial injustice informs the novel throughout, but I think it is really a tale of paradise lost, which happens to be told in the setting of racial conflict. This is the source I think of the novel's melancholy universality, for regardless whether you grew up in Alabama or in Zimbabwe, there comes a time in your life when you realize that the world isn't a very nice place, but there are still some things worth fighting for, and it's often surprising and inspiring just who the real heroes turn out to be.",2005-08-16

It may well be one of the five greatest books ever published in English (my other candidates are the King James Bible, anything by Shakespeare, MOBY DICK, and HUCKLEBERRY FINN).<br /><br />Written in 1960, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD at first seems to be a young girl's first-person reminiscence of childhood in a sleepy Depression-era Southern town. Author Harper Lee has steadfastly denied that the book is formally autobiographical, though many autobiographic elements clearly exist (the character of Dill is the author Truman Capote in childhood, a lifelong friend of Miss Lee's).<br /><br />The children spend much of the first half of the book whiling away their time at imaginative games and summer daydreams. Their waking world is peopled by a curiously colorful collection of neighbors who range from the sublime (Mrs. Dubose, a cantankerous Confederate widow quietly addicted to morphine) to the ridiculous (Miss Stephanie Crawford, the town's indefatigable gossip). Their waking nightmare consists of Boo Radley, a mysterious neighbor who they have never seen. The children construct elaborate fantasies of Boo, but as they grow older their deliciously terrifying imaginings of the man within the house at the end of the block become overshadowed by more frightening realities in the outside world.<br /><br />The children (narrator Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend, Dill) become unjaded observers of the daily drama of ordinary human life when their father, Atticus Finch, the town attorney, is assigned to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. The town becomes quietly inflamed as the submerged flotsam of prejudice floats to the surface of the residents' collective consciousness.<br /><br />Scout, Jem and Dill, along with their lifelong friends and neighbors, are forced to confront issues of justice, injustice, and their own identities, first as Southerners, second as Americans, but lastly and most importantly, as human beings who have the power to choose.<br /><br />Generations of young reviewers have attacked this book as \\""boring\\"" and essentially incomprehensible. It is neither. However, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD has suffered the fate of being consigned to that seventh circle of hell known as \\""the assigned reading list\\"" in most high schools. As a classroom project this book can be impenetrable. I recall being forced to endure TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in my Junior year, and being unable to truly appreciate it at age 16.

In fact, it usually takes about one week to finish one book for me. This novel contains humorous and serious aspects that made me not want to put it down. The strongest point of this novel is the distinct characters that are in it and the way it is written.    My favorite character, Atticus, the father of Jem and Scout, is a very attractive character in that he is not biased, intelligent, and open-minded. Unlike other characters in this novel, he is the only Caucasian who tried to prove Tom Robinson's innocence. In the section where he cares and worries about his children, I was truly impressed by him. Atticus reminds me of my warm-hearted father. My father never admonishes me but gently explains what I did wrong. He is like Atticus. In my eyes, Atticus is the ideal father figure. I also liked the other major characters in the novel, especially Jem and Scout.  Other characters such as Boo Radley, Calpurnia, Dubose, Dill and Cunningham also make this novel outstanding  The way this story is explained and expanded throughout from Scout's point-of-view makes this novel more special. From a pure and nave perspective, Scout sees the world and interprets it in her own way. I think this is a good aspect of this novel.   It is not a surprise that this novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.

The segregation, enforced by Jim Crow law, allowed the hatred and ignoring between African Americans and Whites to be formed.

This is very true: the first chapters of the novel were a little random and hard to follow, but the book really developed and by the end I could hardly set the book aside.  As stated by one of the reviews posted on Amazon.com, every character in Lee's novel has great dimension.  Lee has an extraordinary talent of showing off the way society was run back then by the nature and actions of her characters.  Her inventive characters, such as the mysterious Boo Radley, the kind hearted Atticus, and even the weird Mr. Dolphus Raymond, really display the town's feeling toward abnormal people, especially African Americans, in 1930's Alabama. <br />All of the characters seemed very realistic and natural, like you're reading an interesting biography.  Lee's main character and narrator is Scout, who is said to behave similarly to the way Harper Lee acted as a child (Biblio.com).  You can tell Lee really knew her little narrator well just by the actions Scout would take and the questions and remarks she would make. In the last few pages of the novel, Scout stands on the porch of Boo Radley, the man whom she has been deathly afraid of for years and years, and she brings herself to look at her neighborhood from Boo's perspective.  She brings up the past and remembers her and Jem fearfully sprinting back and fourth in front of the Radley Place.  It was clever the way that Lee pulled fourth this bit of maturity from eight-year-old Scout.  Jem wasn't necessarily my favorite character, but I really enjoyed watching him grow up through the eyes of his little sister.  Atticus was a perfect role to have in this novel.  I loved to keep reading and see what his responseswould be to Scout's questions.  Dill was quite a wonder.  I loved the line, \\""beautiful things floated around in his head\\"" because it really displayed his character. <br />When Atticus is chosen to defend Tom Robinson, a whole new story begins.  Now the reader, along with Jem and Scout, are introduced to the nastier side of Maycomb.  Racism is exposed everywhere, and it seems that only Atticus is going to stand up for what is right.  Scout is very confused at how the strict and upright ladies forming a missionary society with her aunt can try so hard to help others and then discriminate against the black citizens of Maycomb.  Scout's teacher, Miss Gates, tells the class America is a democracy.  According to Miss Gates, democracy is, \\""Equal rights for all, special privileges for none.\\""  Scout wonders at the way Miss Gates can encourage democracy and still be totally against her father for defending a black man.  Isn't America a democracy... why are whites allowed special privileges?  However, Lee expertly is able to demonstrate a good side to even some of the worst people, such as the bravery and strong will seen in the evil Mrs. Dubose as she breaks free of her morphine addiction (Amazon.com).  In the end, Scout finally realizes that even the cruelest people have a hidden kindness in their hearts (Amazon.com). <br />Of all the reviews that I searched for of To Kill a Mockingbird, not a single one had any sort of negativity.  To Kill a Mockingbird was the only book that Harper Lee has ever published, and with this one book she has won a Pultzer prize and her book has been made into an Oscar winning film (Biblio.com).  Overall, Lee was brilliant in the way she was able to lead us through the tough era of the Depression, full of racism and merciless judgments and hateful rumors, behind the eyes of a young girl with a strong heart...much like her father.",2005-05-03

I wish I hadn't lived so much of my life without it in my mind, informing how I look at others and what I think my place in the world is, because I think this book does change how one sees good and its role in the lives of those hurt by the cruelty of humanity.<br /><br />TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the story of young Scout, who starts the book out remembering her life at the age of 6. Her brother, Jem, is 10, and their summer neighbor, Dill, is 7 (\\""I'm little but I'm old,\\"" he says.) (Interestingly, the character of Dill is based on Truman Capote, whom Harper Lee knew as a child.) Their father, Atticus Finch is an attorney, and their mother, who died when Scout was 2, figures not at all in the story. The family has a black maid, Calpurnia. Various neighbors are also mentioned: Miss Rachel, Dill's aunt; Miss Maudie; Miss Stephanie; Mrs. Dubose; and, of course, the Radley family, in the spooky house the children had to pass on their way to school. The novel begins with Dill's first summer in Maycomb, the small Alabama town that is the setting for this novel. Dill, Jem and Scout fixate on getting \\""Boo\\"" Radley to come out of his house. Boo is a mysterious man, about whom the neighbors trade stories and with whom the children like to scare themselves. Atticus takes a dim view of the children using Boo and his life for various entertainments and chides them whenever he finds them engaged in one of their attempts to catch a glimpse of him.<br /><br />The summer ends and Dill goes back to his family and the Finch children go to school, Scout for the first time. Her teacher discovers that Scout can read and tells her that her father's been teaching her all wrong and that she is not allowed to read at home any more with Atticus. Scout also gets in trouble the first day of school for standing up and explaining to the teacher why Walter Cunningham cannot accept a quarter from the teacher to go have lunch in town (he didn't bring lunch with him). Scout explains that Walter can't borrow a quarter because \\""he's a Cunningham.\\"" When that is insufficient information for the teacher, Scout says, \\""The Cunninghams never took anything they can't pay back--no church baskets and no scrip stamps. They never took anything off of anybody, they get along on what they have. They don't have much, but they get along on it. ... You're shamin' him, Miss Caroline. Walter hasn't got a quarter at home to bring you, and you can't use any stovewood\\"" (which is how they paid Atticus Finch for some legal work he had done for them). Miss Caroline smacks Scout's hand with a ruler; Scout tries to fight Walter in the schoolyard, and then Jem invites him home for lunch. Later Atticus promises Scout that even though she must attend school, he will still read with her every night. And so we get the tone of the father-daughter relationship, practical, loving, guidance and, more than anything, acceptance of Scout for who she is. Atticus also shows over the course of the novel the need to live up to the love his children have for him in his professional and personal life.<br /><br />Soon Atticus is engaged in a legal case that engenders criticism in the town. He has been appointed to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who was accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus's \\""mistake\\"" is that he actually means to defend the man. Scout and Jem hear criticism from their friends, but Atticus instructs them never to fight over it with other children, to hold their heads up high. He tells Scout that he could never tell her to do anything again if he walked away from this responsibility. The children watch the trial and the outcome, and the reader sees that like Boo Radley, Tom Robinson is one of the people hurt by the cold world and the evil that exists in humanity. Atticus strives to help his children understand and not be brought low by such cruelty like the hermit Boo and the convicted Tom.<br /><br />Even with the verdict going his way, the father of the alleged rape victim, Mr. Ewell, vows to get revenge on Atticus for making him and his daughter look foolish on the witness stand.<br /><br />I won't go into the climax of the book, but wanted to note that what I love about it is the love that is shown by Atticus in his behavior toward his children, his client and the people he lives with in the town. Even when Ewell spits in his face, he maintains his dignity and seems to believe that Ewell needed to make the threat to carry on his life in Maycomb. Atticus is a kind of Christ figure of the Maycomb community. The children's neighbor Miss Maudie says nearly as much to their aunt, \\""Whether Maycomb knows it or not, we're paying the highest tribute we can pay a man. We trust him to do right. It's that simple.\\"" -- this even while others are vilifying him for the work he did for Tom Robinson.<br /><br />As Scout grows, her capacity to to understand grows, too, and her fascination with Boo Radley changes into a kind of longing to meet this man, who never goes outside and has no friends. She wants to meet him and say \\""hey\\"" to him and ask him how his day is. Her capability to love and be kind is growing, and she wants to share it.<br /><br />The ending of the book is the apotheosis of Scout's growing capability to live, understand and treat others with dignity, and we also see the ongoing example of Atticus to do right, along with other townspeople who want to protect the weakest and smallest among them. It is truly one of the most moving chapters I've read in my life. (I tear up just thinking about it!)<br /><br />The novel itself is charmingly written, the voice is of an older Scout who maintains her independence and zeal for life, but who understands more than the 6-year-old Scout did at the beginning of the narrative. The story flows smoothly, and the plot is engaging. If you haven't read this, you need to.d the convicted Tom.  <br />  <br />Even with the verdict going his way, the father of the alleged rape victim, Mr. Ewell, vows to get revenge on Atticus for making him and his daughter look foolish on the witness stand. <br />  <br />I won't go into the climax of the book, but wanted to note that what I love about it is the love that is shown by Atticus in his behavior toward his children, his client and the people he lives with in the town.

Through Scout's tomboy eyes, we get a glimpse of societal customs, children's games, weather superstitions and a privileged's child's race observations all emulsified in the tastes and smells of the Deep South. The rich descriptions of the world around the narrator is in my view the novel's main strenght.<br /><br />That said, I must admit I was quite surprised at how one-dimensional and predictable the main characters were, and the main race issue is largely a mixture of the tiresome \\""Uncle Tom\\"" phenomenon and white liberal smugness. I was quite dismayed that the black folks were portrayed as little more than good-natured simpletons with just the right amount of \\""colored wisdom\\"", while the enlightened white minority (who, if you are a white reader, you are to identify yourself with) are the good and noble characters in an evil and prejudiced world.<br />Furthermore, for good measure, the rednecks are given all the convenient charcteristics of being the truly evil representation of the white race, closely followed by the stereotypical white gossiping Ladies who \\""sip their tea and eat their dainties\\"" and busy themselves with charity work while reiterating every cliched racial hypocracy imaginable.<br /><br />In my view, if Harper Lee had dared to infuse her characters with more realistic humanity and depth beyond Good and Evil, this would have been a more compelling and honest story about race relations. As the story stands, the white reader gets his white guilt assuaged by being able to identify himself with the saint, while the black reader gets little more than the charitable handout to feel good about himself simply because he belongs to a repressed group of good people. I am not quite sure which race should feel more insulted...<br /><br />That said, I still enjoyed other parts of the book. The children's fascination and impatient curiosity with the mysterious neighbor is delightful reading (even though this very person predictably ends up a hero). The narrator's notions of first love also feels genuine and compelling as does the close realtionship between the narrator and her older protective brother.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommended the book as a look into the adolescent culture of the rural South; however, I would stick to the history books when it comes to learning about the true nature of the extreme racism that polluted the area during this time period.ding (even though this very person predictably ends up a hero).

Russel Lee Career Technology Center in Ohio, and I often look for books that I can find much interest in just by reading a review often located online.  I feel as if I can understand and find interestand info much concerning a book if I read peer reports on it initially, and I am here to add to the numbers. I have found much interest in the timeless novel To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee.  I originally chose this book due to I have heard discussion circulating all over about it, so I wanted to see what it was about. <br /> <br />If you wish to learn and understand how the southern United States operated in the post Civil War Era you can take a look at a small Alabama town of Maycomb where life appears to be always tranquil but you could not be farther from the truth.  As Harper Lee depicts it, Maycomb is a town quiet to the unseeing eye, but upon closer inspection you will see that anything from innocent child meddling to a town family with a history of misfortune and bad demeanor.  As every town has its own \\""ghost story,\\"" Maycomb has a story of a man by the name of Boo Radley.  This name is legend to the children Jem and Scout Finch who are locals neighboring the Radley house.  Throughout the story, these two, with the summerly assistance of their newly acquired friend Dill, attempt to make contact or witness Boo just to influence their curiosity and build their character.  Throughout the course of the story you will hear much of the father, Atticus Finch, being a well known and repected lawyer and seat of the Maycomb County Council, is appointed and must defend a negro man, Tom Robinson, who is accused  of beating and raping Ms. Mayella Ewell. <br /> <br />So if you are interested in the post Civil-War Era involving partial racism and seeming duress, or to witness exploits of children in their seemingly innocent curiosity, or even a court case where sparks and bullets seem to constantly fly, then this is a story for you.   <br /> <br />I would like to take note for future readers that this story contains some harsh language as well as demeaning references to the negro race as well as acts not often seen in everyday life.

Scout started her story at age seven, but the narrator Scout, in my opinion, is a grown-up Scout, and this story is like a flashback, but we'll never know, because the story never told us. That's why this book is a classical tale, because it allows you to think about the what is happening, what makes it happen, and what might happen.<br /><br />I give it a four star because I did enjoy, but not fully, because of my English teacher forcing us to read.

Since its publication date in 1960, this novel has lost none of its popularity.  Atticus Finch, a lawyer, is the narrator's father.  Maycomb is a tired old town.  The family lives on the main residential street.      When Scout is six and her brother Jem is ten, a playmate, Dill, age seven, appears.  He is visiting his aunt for the summer.  Calpurnia, a servant, structures the children's days.  The children are fascinated by the Radley place.  I will not disclose the plot importance of the Radley connection in order to preserve the suspense for the reader.  The description of an Alabama childhood during the Great Depression is priceless.  It is no wonder this one book author could not repeat her achievement when, on the first try, she produced a masterpiece.      At school Jem and Scout are subject to a progressive, John Dewey-style education.  (Amusingly, Jem confuses the new plan with the Dewey decimal system.)  Atticus has to teach Scout the meaning of compromise as she attempts to understand and participate in the confusing world of the first grade. Scout thinks that laughter is coming from the Radley house.  The children believe that Arthur \\""Boo\\"" Radley, a former resident of the insane asylum,  lives in the house.  They ask a neighbor, Miss Maudie, if Boo is dead, and she says no.  Atticus tells the children to stop tormenting the man.      The children start to find chewing gum in a knot in a tree on the Radley property.  Later they find a watch and a spelling bee medal in the knot hole, and still later the hole is filled with cement by somebody. Scout hears from a relative that her best friend Dill just gets passed around and does not have a home.  (Truman Capote claimed that he was the model for Dill, and indeed, circumstances of his childhood match the attributes of the character.) In one scene there is a deserted waiting street and a mad dog.  Calpurnia has an alert telephoned to everyone through  Maycomb's telephone operator.  Since the Radleys do not have a telephone, she yells in the direction of the Radley house for the Radleys to stay indoors, too.  In the evolution of this episode, Scout learns that Atticus is a crack shot.      There is a caste system in Maycomb.  Scout's father is handling an unpopular case.  Someone is accused of rape and Scout does not know of what the factors in the crime are.   Atticus sits in front of the jail guarding the life of his client.  A mob went to his yard earlier.  Atticus has a crowd of sullen people surrounding him at the jail.  Scout's conversation with one of the members of the crowd causes the crowd to disperse.  Atticus later cautions the children that a mob in every little southern town is always made up of people, regular people. The trial attracts  numerous spectators.  When the jury convicts an innocent man, Scout and Jem and Dill are shocked.  The man dies in a jail break.      A wonderful feature of the book is that the story is told from a child's perspective.  In addition, the rich oral culture of the region is evident in the book's pages.",2004-11-19

Most importantly, we must follow our conscience and do what we know is right no matter the possible cost. That takes a great deal of courage and most of us have at one time or another failed in this respect. Harper Lee's Atticus Finch on the other hand was more than up to the task even though most of the town and his family were against him. Lee makes no effort to hide the fact that often there will be consequences for those who take a stand and those consequences will not always be pleasant.<br /><br />Atticus Finch is not the main character of this story however. The main characters are Atticus' son Jem and his daughter Scout who tells the story. I advise that you forget looking for the moral implications of the story for they are evident and it is much easier to enjoy this book if you just read it and don't try to dissect it.  Jem (Jeremy) and Scout (Jean Louise) are probably the most interesting literary children since Tom and Huck and some of their adventures will remind the reader of Twain's creations. In short, this book is just plain fun to read and I regret terribly having waited so long to read it!<br /><br />During most of the story the children's adventures tend to revolve around the Radley house and it's most sinister occupant, Boo (Arthur) Radley. Boo is a recluse that hasn't been spotted out of his house by a reliable source in many years and of course the rumor mill in a small town has turned him into a monster that eats raw squirrels. In the end, the Boo Radley story line presents the reader with yet another moral lesson but the trail that leads to this lesson takes many interesting twists and turns.<br /><br />One will also find a very good description of the twentieth century South in Lee's work. From sleeping on the porch in the Summertime to watching the old men loaf around the courthouse I can honestly say I have been there and done that. Class distinction has always been very important in the South and Harper Lee works hard to bring that distinction out. Thankfully African-Americans are currently judged on their merit and not their race so that they fall into the caste system all up and down the ladder. In the 1930s though things were much different. The three lowest rungs on the ladder were poor white trash (the Cunninghams) and low down white trash (the Ewells), with blacks at the bottom. The significance of this being that at that point in time even the lowest whites would be believed over any African-American.<br /><br />Atticus Finch was for his time and place a fairly odd bird and thank God that there really were Finches out there to look out for the mockingbirds of the world.Class distinction has always been very important in the South and Harper Lee works hard to bring that distinction out.

The youngest Finch, Scout, is the main character and narrator of the story.  You see and feel the whole story through the eyes of the daughter of Atticus Finch, who is representing the accused Tom Robinson.  Tom Robinson, a crippled Negro, has been accused of the rape and abuse of young Mayella Ewell. <br /> Scout tells the story of her adventures with her brother Jem and their neighbors nephew Dill.  The three children were very frightened, but also curious about their other neighbors, the Radleys.  It was said that Boo Radley was crazy, stabbed his own father, and was chained up in the house.  Their adventures include a visit beyond the gate of the Radleys, putting on skits of what they thought was going on in the Radley home, and trying to stick a note on Boo's window to find any means of communication possible.  All along, the children were assuming that Boo was dangerous and crazy.  Little did they know, in the end he would be the one to save their lives. <br /> While the children were fascinating about Boo, Atticus was being criticized and even his children were being threatened, all because he was defending a black man.  Atticus was a smart man with strong beliefs, determined to set a good example for his children and the people in his community.  Tom was falsely charged guilty because, unfortunately, the community he lived in was still filled with racism.  Even though Atticus had promised Tom that he would find justice and bring fairness to the town, Tom's inability to trust Atticus's sure word led to a frantic panic, and then death. <br /> Both stories tie in together.  Atticus once said in the book that you never knew a person until you put on their shoes and walked around in them a little bit.  The children were judging Boo Radley without having ever seen him before, and definitely never got to know him atall.  Tom Robinson was being judged by the jury and town because he was black.  Nobody knew who he was, and just stereotyped him to be a bad, scary man who raped and abused Mayella, even if he did have a cripple left hand. <br />",2004-11-08

The setting is in a small town in Alabama called Maycomb County. The main characters are Atticus Finch, a lawyer, Jean Louise (Scout) Finch, and Jem Finch.  Scout and Jem , Atticus's two young children, start out as ages 6 and 10 at the beginning of the book, slowly growing older as the book progresses. In the first half, Jem, Scout and their friend Dill have small adventures during the summers when Dill visits. Dill has a fascination with Boo Radley, a neighbor of the Finch's. He lives in a house with his brother and never comes out, to the town's knowledge. The trio tries several times to make him come outside with no success. Eventually they move on to other things.  <br /> In the middle of the book, the trial comes around and Atticus Finch is selected to defend Tom Robinson, the accused black man. Scout learns what a \\""n_____-lover\\"" is after repeatedly hearing herself and her father called one. The first time a young boy calls her a n_____-lover at school, she promptly starts a fight with him, even though she hadn't known  the definition of it yet. After a stern lecture from her father, she promises not to fight with anyone ever again. She breaks that promise when she goes to her aunt's house on Thanksgiving and is taunted by her second cousin. Atticus faces problems around town before the trial. Mobs seek to hurt him while Atticus is guarding Tom's jail cell door late at night. The group of angry men recede after Scout, Jem and Dill come running up to Atticus and Scout has a friendly, somewhat one-sided converation with Mr. Cunningham, one of the men in the mob.  <br /> I enjoyed this book because it portrayed the image of what the black people had to go through in the South, even after the Civil War and slavery had long passed. They were always second-rate and treated very poorly. I would recommend this book to any middle school to high school student. <br />",2004-10-26

Her single father, Atticus, is a well-respected attorney.  Readers are taken through a period of three years in the lives of the children and their neighbors.

Tom Robinson, a black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman. As the children watch their father take a stand, they learn lessons which can only be taught by example.

This book talks about how strong people feel about racism back in the days, and it is still strong today, but the only difference is that back then people was racist to African Americans, but nowadays there's racism toward Whites, Blacks, Asians, Arabs, etc.  That's what I like about this book, it is talking about something that existed back then that is still existing today, so we can see how Jem and Scout is feeling when an innocent man is pleaded guilty and guilty man is free.  This also shows how 2 kids perspective on African American people could change in one event.  I could relate to this because I use to think African American people were bad since the movies and shows portrayed them as bad people, but when I met my first black friend in middle school my whole perspective on African American people changed. <br /> I recommend this book to anybody who is interested in seeing how 2 kids could change their whole perspective about racism in one event.  They knew that other humans are treating a human being the wrong way just because of their skin color.  I think this book could relate to anybody because everybody meets another person who is not their own race before and probably treated them the wrong way because they were different, but after a while their attitude towards them changed because they were able to get to know them, and realize that they are not really that different from each other. <br />",2004-10-24

The book surrounds itself towards a society that has different opinions concerns people of different classes and races maybe because the story surrounds itself in the south.  The novel describes a family named Finch, which is lead by a father Atticus who tries to teach his children the right way to think. The daughter and son, Scout and Jem, are basically children born to learn through a society that doesn't seem too kindly towards African Americans. It shows the life of Scout from her friends like Boo Radley, which describes his home almost as a Haunted House, to her days in school with a teacher who has a negative attitude towards her. The teacher basically believes that she is almost like a showoff and that her learning is a sort of a distraction towards the class. This sense leads to a trial that deals with a case involving Atticus Finch. It basically shows a black man named Tom Robinson who was accused of raping a girl named Mayaella Ewell. Even though in some parts of the trial where Mr. Robinson was known to be innocent, the white panel named the man guilty. The ending shows a situation where even under certain situations; a black man cannot be victories under white power. <br /> <br />I believe this book a gives a good piece of information on just how the lifestyle is in the south or a white dominated society. The people seem to be lacking equality and don't really tend to have a sense of pity towards Africans. The people avoid interpersonal communication, which is necessary in a development of a society. This communication basically gives equality to all classes by providing conversations to each person.  If every is talked to and involved equality then racism and class difference wouldn't need to be a major problem in the southern society. Some of my favorite parts would have to be when they imagine the Radley's house as mysterious andfrightening. Especially when the children were spying on the Radley's and they arrived at there house in fear while Jem forgot that he left his pants on the fence. Another scene which is more touching than funny is when they execute Tom Robinson. A person could almost feel the pain of Atticus Finch when he feels that he has died and all the work he has done to help the man went to waste. This book touches a person in many levels and explores many different controversial subjects by describing it in a situation of a Lawyer and his family. I believe people who are interested in a book who like adventures, drama, and comedy while being told a lesson on racism should read it. <br />",2004-10-24

One of the major themes of the novel revolves around the meaning of courage.  Jean Louise \\""Scout\\"" Finch is growing up in the 1930's in a small Alabama town.  Her single father, Atticus, is a well-respected attorney.  Readers are taken through a period of three years in the lives of the children and their neighbors. A fire, a rabid dog and stories of Boo Radley fill the otherwise slow days of Scout, Jem and their friend, Dill.   The children are focused mostly on Boo and trying to catch a glimpse of him. Atticus is annoyed with their fascination with Boo, but finds himself in the middle of a rape trial which will challenge the soul of the town.  Tom Robinson, a black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman. As the children watch their father take a stand, they learn lessons which can only be taught by example. This is a powerful story of growing up.  It is easy to be drawn into the book as it explores the message of true courage and standing up for what you believe. I recommend this book to all. <br />BIBLIO: October 11, 1998, Warner Books; Reissue edition, Middle-High School, $ 6.99 <br />REVIEWER: Katie Gordon <br />FORMAT: Novel <br />ISBN: 0446310786 <br />",2004-10-21

Every year I would hear her talk about 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and how wonderful of a book it was. I always thought she was saying 'Tequila Mockingbird', so I never really understood. It wasn't until my 7th grade year, when I was assigned to read this book, did I 1) realize how right my mother was and 2) what the actual name of the book was. I have to say, I was quite apprehensive to read it, due to the fact that the title seemed like the whole book was going to be about killing a mockingbird. I guess I judged a book by it's cover, which is mainly what this beautifully written book is about. <br /> <br />Scout Finch (Jean Louise Finch was her birth name) is a young girl growing up with her older brother, Jem, and her lawyer-dad, Atticus. As the only girl around the house, besides their African American help, Calpurnia, Scout is an entergetic tomboy. With their new friend, Dill from Meridian, Mississippi, Jem and Scout go on many adventures, mainly including the town-mystery, Boo Radley. <br /> <br />This book is not just about a young girl becoming a young lady, it's about her having to realize that not all of society is as understanding to change or different people as she and her family were. The case of Tom Robinson (an African American man accused of raping a white woman) had a huge effect on Scout's life.  <br /> <br />I don't want to give away too much of this book, so I believe I will stop there. All I can say is that Harper Lee, a friend of my grandfather, really hit the spot with this one. This has always been and will always continue to be my favorite book of all time. <br />",2004-10-12

The story is narrated by a girl named Jean Louise Finch, also known as Scout.  The Finch family lives in a town called Maycomb, Alabama during the Great Depression.  Scout's father Atticus is a lawyer in town.  In the story Atticus Finch has chosen to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman.  This is a very serious crime in these times especially because Maycomb is a very racist town.  The Finch family knows that Robinson is innocent, but the tricky part is getting the rest of the town to believe it too.   <br /> <br /> At the trial, Scout and her older brother Jem sit in the colored section of the court to prove that there is no difference between black people and white people.  The book is a very good book about racism during the Great Depression.  One family takes matters into their own hands to try and solve the nation's problem and let everyone know that everyone is equal.  The family encounters many problems because the rest of the community is not willing to listen to them.  The rest of the community feels that Atticus is wrong in choosing to defend this man. <br />  <br /> Another character in the book is Boo Radley.  Boo lives in a big, creepy house on the corner of the street and no one has ever seen him come out.  Throughout the book Scout and her brother, Jem, have many encounters with Boo.  While they still think he is really creepy, they also realize that he is a person just like you and me. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite books.  The book is narrated by Scout, a child.  I always admired the innocence of a child.  Scout looks at Robinson and doesn't see a black man but instead she sees a man who is being wrongly accused.  When she looks at Boo she see a normal man.  I think this is a book everyone should read.  So many times we judge people without getting to know them.  That is what the book is really about. <br />",2004-10-12

She won the Pulitzer Prize with \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" - her only novel - which was first published in 1960.  <br /> <br />The story is set in 1930s Maycomb, Alabama, and is told by Scout Finch. In it, she looks back to her childhood, between the ages of six and nine years. A lively, intelligent and fiercely loyal child, she has one older brother called Jem, whose main interest is football. Despite an age difference of nearly four years, the siblings are clearly very close. Their mother died when Scout was two and they have been brought up by their father, Atticus - who proves to be a man you can't help admiring. Calpurnia, their housekeeper, seems to have been a great help to Atticus in raising the children. At times, Scout seems to have seen her as something of an adversary, though they become much closer as time goes on. Among their neighbours are the mysterious Radleys - Mr. Arthur, better known as Boo Radley, hasn't been seen outside for many years. He has become something of a legend that inspires a certain amount of fear among the children. Another neighbour, Miss Maudie, is an entirely different proposition - a very likeable character, she proves to be a very good friend to the children and one of Maycomb's more admirable residents.  <br /> <br />Another of the children's friends in Chet Baker Harris, a boy from Mississippi who is better known as Dill. He spends his summer with his Aunt Rachel, another of Scout's neighbours. Dill is the driving force behind one of the book's major themes : the quest to make Boo Radley come outside. The other theme, however, is a lot more serious - it deals with a court case where a black man has been charged with raping a white woman, on very flimsy evidence. The attitude of many of the townsfolk to the man in question, and to the black community in general, confuse the children greatly. The consequences of these attitudes have a direct impact on the Finch family, given that Atticus has been appointed the defence attorney.  <br /> <br />I tend to be very suspicious of a book if it's referred to as a 'classic' - too many of those I've read (or been forced to read) have been far too tedious. \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"", however, is what a classic should be - superbly written, with an excellent story and featuring characters you genuinely care about. Its screen adaptation is also widely regarded as a classic, leading to an Oscar for Gregory Peck, who played Atticus. Neither the book, nor the film, should be missed.",2004-09-17

I saw the title and (in the self-righteous way only the very young have) pointed out how awful it was to have a book about killing mockingbirds.  I believe she commented that the book made that very point.    Ten years later I read the book myself.  And have done so several times since.  Once I read it while I was traveling in Germany, and was touched all the more since it is such a quintessentially American book.  A striking juxtaposition to read about the rural south of the 1930's while staying in the modern Berlin of the 1990's.    I grew up in the middle of California's San Joaquin valley - a flat expanse of fertile agricultural land.  We lived on the edge of the country-side with a cotton field bordering our backyard.  There were no sidewalks.  The summer days were hot and the heat carried over long into the evening.  And the kids of the neighborhood had a freedom to roam that would not be even considered today.  There was a house down the street that we were sure was inhabited by witches.  We braved it on Halloween, but threw away the candy lest it be tainted.    Harper Lee portrayed childhood in such an adept way that the games, fantasies and structure of imagination the children built are as familiar to a California girl today as they are to a child in Alabama in the middle of the depression.  I could identify with everything those children did, thought and said.  It is through a child's eye that the far more serious subject matter of the book is related.    So many things have stuck with me over the years.  Not just the central tragedy of Tom Robinson and the Ewell's. The familiarity of a school pageant.  The struggle to adapt to teachers who don't understand the cultural nuances of the class.  A heroic effort to overcome addiction as a matter of self and principle.  Sultry summer evenings.  Walking like an Egyptian.  The price one pays to learn and acquire values.  Trying to make Boo Radley come out.  Dill.  Calpurnia.  And, of course, Atticus.

Note though the story is told from the perspective of a young white middle class kid who would not have had much contact except through the help and so the characterizations all fit true to form.<br />So read it for what it is, and when it was written and don't judge it by what you know now. In '61 life was still pretty segregated in the South and so this was a very radical book.<br />For modern readers, Atticus role as a parent was decades ahead of its time. In the 00's you'll find fathers with this outlook but in the 60's it was very rare. One can explain this from the stoies perspective because Atticus wife's death forced him to change.<br />Anyway I like this book a lot. It's right up there with Faulkner's Light in the Forest.",2004-07-01

I was a teenager and liked it well enough, but it made no great impression upon me. I was more moved by the film it inspired. Thirty years later I reread the book and was amazed at how much I missed, what a wonderfully subtle, understated, humorous, and hardbreakingly humane book this is! Even more astonishing to me was my retrospective realization that this book was decades ahead of its time. Its treatments of class, race, gender, sexual abuse of children, and religious hypocrisy embody a level of sophistication that, I suspect, those who lionized the book upon its publication did not fully understand. The film based upon the novel, for all its merit, fails in many respects to take seriously Lee's incisive treatment of these subjects -- indeed, it trivialized much of it. Harper Lee writes like a dream. She wastes almost no effort. Her desciptions of the town of Maycomb, Alabama (the fictitious location of the novel's plots and subplots), its folk and folklore are always engaging and well constructed. More important, they lay bare the hidden, ugly realities of history and class-structure that shape the life of the town. Like Mark Twain at his best, Harper Lee refuses to let her painful recognition of human ugliness in all its forms turn into bitterness. It is always tempered by her humor and humanity. True, she refuses to accept injustice and cruelty, especially those codified into the fabric of social life. Still, the wonder of this novel is the even more important refusal it embodies: the refusal to hate those whose blindness contributes to and perpetuates those forms of injustice and cruelty. Lee's decision to employ the innocent perspective of a bright, fiesty, motherless young girl helps to keep the novel's tone from being strident and accusatory. The author, in her wisdom, prefers to gently awaken her reader to a deeper appreciation of the difficulties and importance of acting decently in an imperfectworld.",2004-06-27

Lee's novel is narrated through the eyes of 8 year-old wise-beyond-her-years Scout Finch, a keen and extraordinarily observant child.<br />The horizons of TO KILL... don't end at the explorations and explanations of racism in the South.  Other themes include growing up and emotions involved, how people avoid what they do not understand, and friendships - how they evolve and blossom.  One of Scout's close friends is dimunitive Dill, a \\""Beautiful Child\\"" contest winner (a.k.a. Charles Baker Harris) who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt over the summers.  Compelled by mere curiosity, together, he and Scout plot to lure hermit and town bogeyman Boo Radley out into the open.  Peculiar myths and legends surround his very existence, courtesy of the gossip mongers of Maycomb.<br />Lee demonstrates the true ugliness of racism. Racism, we see, is what causes a small Southern town to do a complete turn around.  Scout, with the innocent heart of a child, balances out the misunderstandings.  Atticus Finch, Scout's father, who is always known as \\""Atticus,\\"" is chosen to represent a black man who supposedly raped Mayella Ewell, a white farmer's daughter.  This is truly what opens the reader's eyes to the evils of the town.  Despite this, Scout Finch still adamantly believes that people are essentially good overall, \\""once you get to see them.\\""  Obviously, this isn't all true - Scout is mind-blowingly bright yet still exhibits realistic childlike qualities, her naivete being one of them.<br />Atticus can truly be regarded for his extreme heroism.  Despite a cruel and uncaring town, he stood up for what he believed in, what he knew in his heart was right.  He's possesses great wisdom, a heart of gold, great understanding, and considerable kindness.  He treats his children, Jem and Scout, like they are mature adults.  This is probably one of the main reasons why Scout is so keenly and constantly aware of her surroundings, as well as a reason for her innate intellect.  <br />One of the best plot twists in TO KILL... involves a newfound hero that neither Jem and Scout, nor the reader, could have ever predicted would be so brazen and courageous.  Boo Radley is one of the novel's pivotal characters, yet he doesn't appear all that much in the story.  When Scout and company first discuss him and his myths, they speak of him as if he's some kind of hideous monster.  In reality, he is as kind and caring as Atticus and has just as much hero potential, which finally rises to the surface towards the end of the novel for the reader (and Harper's characters) to see.<br />TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is laced with humor, yet it finds a comfortable balance between being both comedic and serious in the subject matter Harper chose to tackle.  It also manages to be sentimental and heartbreaking, yet never even comes close to being borderline mushy and overly sappy.  It's an inspirational tale regarded by generation after generation as a classic - a tale of respect for all human life in a society in which incessant misunderstandings are present within its people.  Look at the world we live in today.  Consider the mindset of various individuals and groups.  I ask you, what person can't relate to this enlightening, eye-opening book?",2004-06-21

From the beginning of the book we realizes that the Finches are among the intelligent and &quot;well-brought-up-folk&quot; in society, and with their name comes certain expectations. &quot;Scout&quot; is expected to act more like a lady and less like a tomboy. Jem is expected to act like a gentleman, and Atticus Finch, a lawyer and there father is expected to raise his children up to act like the lady and the gentlemen that they are.

Scout is always being pressured into being lady like and not to play with the boys and what they do. That is not what Scout is like though, she likes she be with her brother and his friend and do what he wants do to. She doesn't like to be with other girls have tea parties. She is one very unique girl. I can relate to her in this way, because nobody wants to be girly all the time. Sometimes you have to be different from other people. Nobody wants to sit up straight all the time and be nice and pretty. Being different isn't bad all the time.   Both Jem and Scout have to deal with having no mother and living with only their father and their caretaker. They are very different characters but that is what makes them so interesting. This book has a clear lesson, that we should treat every person with the same amount of respect. We shouldn't treat people of a different race differently.

Jem was worried after his father had an incident with Mr. Ewall, the father of the girl who was raped.

He had to take it out on somebody and I rather it be me than that housefull of children out there.&quot; (pg. 211) This really showed that Atticus is not afraid to stand up for what he believes in.  He risks his family and reputation for one man.  The part that I thought was very significant, happened towards the end.  Scout said, &quot;Naw, Jem, I think there's just one kind of folks. Folks.&quot; (pg. 227) This shows that Scout is a better person than the rest of her community to stand up for what she thinks is right.  She thought that whites and blacks were equal.

Boo is not treated poorly because of his skin color, but because he is considered an &quot;outkast&quot;. Throughout the novel Scout has to learn to recognize racism, and to realize that society's views of people are not always correct.

However, as the novel progresses, she starts to think of Boo Radley as a human being, instead of a form of entertainment.<BR>Another roll in this novel was played by scoical standings. The importance of social standings constantlt understand the ignorance  of the townspeople. I believe that the quote said by Atticus in Chapter 10 page 109, &quot;Remember, it's a sin to kill a mockingbird,&quot; shows that Atticus wants his children to understand that people should be given their privacy, and not discussed throughout the town because of their short comings.<BR>Other than the lessons in this book, another great aspect of it is the setting. The town is introduced in Chapter 1 on page 2, as &quot;An old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it.&quot; I believe that this quote was the perfect way to describe Maycomb. It shows that at first, the town is innocent, like Scout, but also foreshadows that the town, and Scout will develope into a more comlex exisctence. Anoher important part of this book was the characters. The characters were well developed and were very complex. I felt like the Finches were a real life family, one that I could truly understand, and one that over the course of the novel I actually grew to care about.<BR>If you enjoyed reading To Kill A Mockingbird, then I would recommend the book I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, by Maya Angelou. The plot about racism is similar and the styles of writing are equally intriguing.",2004-05-19

This book is packed with lessons and morals, has great character development, and leaves a lasting impression on the reader.  <BR>    One of the reasons I enjoyed this novel is because I admired the character Atticus, for his good character and strong convictions.  He was presented with defending an African American man in an extremely segregated town, and although it was guaranteed he would lose no matter how convincing his trial was, he still took it on as if he had a fair chance of winning, and put up an amazing argument.  I also loved how he put his heart into his trial, and really stood up for his belief against prejiduce.  Even with practically the whole town believing themsleves superior to people of other colors, Atticus had good morals, and fought for what was just.  <BR>   Scout was another character I particularly liked, because she was rambunctious, stubborn and independant.  She demonstrated how a young girl can really make a difference and have an impact on peoples lives.  Gem also showed unique character changes as he went through adolescence throughout the novel.  His personailty starting off soft and kind and then trasnforming to tough and boyish was an example of great character development, and amusing as well.  <BR>   Overall this book taught me so much about standing up for what you believe in and the realities of prejiduce.  I also learned from Boo Radley that you cannot judge a person until you know them.  The trial also intrigued me because I have an interest in law.  The only reason I would not give it 5 stars is because some parts were slow and uninteresting, where it was hard for me to read on.

By the end of the first chapter I didn't want to put it down.  The characters, the conflicts, settings, descriptions -- somehow I felt as though I could not only picture it all, but that it had happened in my childhood neighborhood and that I had even witnessed some of the events, perhaps even participated!  I'm sure that if I read it again today, I'd have a different reaction to it, seeing some of its flaws, like the lack of moral ambiguity demonstrated by some of the characters.  For instance, Atticus is a one-dimensional saint.  Tolerant, patient, understanding, unassuming and overflowing with integrity -- he's the father everyone wishes they could point to proudly, at least looking back from adulthood.  No, he doesn't play football with Jem, but even Jem comes to realize Atticus is different somehow, better than everyone around him.  Atticus never says anything even remotely questionable.  Does he have a single flaw?  Not unless you look under the surface.  <br />Lee and most readers (me included) gloss over the fact that Atticus has to be chosen to take the Tom Robinson case.  Herein lies a crack in his shield of integrity -- and I don't think Lee intended for us to see that crack.  I don't think even she knew it's there when she wrote it.  If Atticus really did have so much integrity, he'd have volunteered to take the case.  But given that it's the 1930s, no white lawyer would have done this.  Not only was he guaranteed to lose, but he's guaranteed to lose with dishonor, even outright physical danger.  It wouldn't have been believeable even for Atticus to volunteer.  Still, if he had volunteered, how much more moral courage would he have shown?  How much more grief would he have had to endure from his neighbors and relatives?  I think Lee missed an opportunity there.  But she also needed to have shown some of Atticus's flaws.  Didn't he ever lose his temper with Scout?  Didn't he ever do something hecould have apologized for?  No, Atticus is a superman.<br />Nevertheless, the first time you read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; the story and its telling are so good, the characters, their emotions and conflicts so universal, that you are completely distracted from any literary analysis.  And that's what any good story does well, it makes you lose yourself in it.  Given that criteria, &quot;Mockingbird&quot; succeeds in the extreme.  10 stars out of 5!",2004-04-22

I give this book a five star.  I think this book is about children's curiosity and harsh reality of racism.  The book is narrated by a young girl named Jean Louise Finch, who is usually called Scout.  She has an older brother named Jem Finch and a dad named Atticus Finch.  In the first part of the story, Jem and Scout are curious about Boo Radley.  Boo Radley is a very mysterious man and both Jem and Scout have never seen him before, but have heard things about him, mostly bad.  The story then goes on to talk about Tom Robinson, a poor black man accused of raping Mayella Ewell.  Atticus, who is a lawyer, will defend Tom Robinson throughout the book in any way he can, but fails.  Tom is convicted for something he did not do, mainly because of his color.  The trial will deeply affect Jem and Scout's lives forever; and they will also realize, at a young age, the cruelty that comes with racism.  <br />I would have to say that I get into and love reading books that deals with racial issues.

The author, Harper Lee, wrote this book as if it was 8-year-old Scout Finch telling the story. This makes the story more emotional to the readers because it tells about the hard times of growing up, going to school, and dealing with life.  <br /> The story starts off as everything going pretty well in this little Alabama town with her brother Jem Finch, who is a couple years older then her, her father, Atticus Finch, who is a lawyer, and their maid, Calpurnica.  In the summer one year a boy named Dill Harris was visiting with his Aunt Stephanie, and met up with Jem and Scout and from that summer on Dill would come and stay with them.  Down the street from the Finch's there was a old house, which the Radley family used to live in.  The people said now that only the father of the family, Boo Radley lived there and he was crazy.  Each summer the children would try to make him come out of the house or atleast get a little look at him.  They never got this wish, but they still believed that he was in there, and alive.<br /> As the story continues, the children's father, Atticus, is appointed by the judge to represent a black man, Tom Robinson,  in court. The people said that Robinson raped a girl named, Mayella. Her father said that he saw Robinson do it, but with Mayella and her father testifying they came out with differnet sides of the story.<br /> The book To Kill A Mockingbird, I think, is a very good book. It tells about racism, how hurtful people can be, how loving others can be, and how no matter what someone says or does to you, that you can never stop believing in what you think is right just because someone else tells you to.

The author, Harper Lee, takes readers to the roots of human behavior:  kindness &amp; cruelty, love &amp; hatred.<BR>   The story takes place in a small Alabama county.

It is also understandable that Harper Lee did not write any other novel after this one; she had already created a perfect one and there was no real room to improve! The aspect I loved most about this book is how it shows that when children are allowed to think by themselves, without being prejudiced by the opinion of the adults, they see everything crystal clear.<br />Lee has created a literary masterpiece with so many remarkable aspects that one feels threatened to comment on them for fear of leaving out important ones; I will try nonetheless to point out at least a couple of them. The story revolves around the experiences of Scout, who is the one telling the story. She is a little girl whose father is assigned as the defense attorney of a black young man falsely accused of raping a white girl. The main lesson the book disseminates and the one that is easiest to grasp is that racism is destructive and has no reason to exist in our society. If you consider that the book was written in 1960, this is not a minor point, but on the contrary it is a very powerful statement. Even nowadays, we have a long way to go towards accepting that someone's skin color is completely irrelevant. Although this problem has been reduced considerably other forms of discrimination still exist and should be eradicated.<br />It is uplifting to see a father like Atticus Finch, who is raising two kids by himself, after losing his wife, and is doing a splendid job at it. Not only he differs from the norm at the time because he never hits his children, but he also tries not to influence their ideas of what is wrong and right. Instead of promoting hatred in Scout and Jem against the people that are racist and unfair, he tries to teach them tolerance to understand that these individuals are acting mostly out of fear. Throughout the story one can observe how the two siblings go from considering Atticus an old man who could not play football with other dads to seeing him as a hero with outstanding values. Jem describes this perfectly: &quot;Atticus is a gentleman, just like me&quot;.<br />I can understand why this book has been selected as part of the required readings in high school, and also why a lot of kids, finding it difficult to read, do not particularly enjoy it. To those of you that have a bitter recollection of this book and are now adults, I urge you to reread it and I guarantee that you will see clearly that it was worth it. If you are reading the book for high school, try to understand what the society was like in 1960 and you will enjoy this chore a lot more. Finally, I just have to say that I feel privileged for having read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, even though nobody ever forced me to do so.stand that these individuals are acting mostly out of fear.

It had never occurred to me that a book written almost half a century ago could actually be entertaining, but To Kill A Mockingbird was an exception. I was intrigued by this powerful piece of literature that had touched the lives of millions of readers. After having enjoyed the book, I went out and rented the Academy-Award winning film that was also considered a classic. Could the film really capture the book in all of its essence? I had never seen a film that had actually been better that the book, but I gave it a try. Overall, the film had been exceptionally good and had captured some very important and meaningful parts in a stunning and excellent manner. It had brought the action and emotion to life. Yet, as one would expect, the book was still superior to and more entertaining than the film.<br /> I have never liked the fact that filmmakers usually must exclude some small parts of the book save time, but normally I just let it go and enjoy the movie in all of its brilliance. I could have done the same when viewing To Kill A Mockingbird the film, but the filmmakers had cut out some outstanding parts that had great significance in the book. I was annoyed that they had cut so many parts. For example, in the book, Miss Maudie's house catches fire and an old fire truck, killed by the cold, is pushed from town by a group of men. All the men of Maycomb bring Miss Maudie's furniture out of the house and onto a yard across the street as the flames devour Miss Maudie's home. In the midst of all of this emergency, as Scout and Jem watch in awe, Boo Radley comes up behind Scout and puts a blanket around her without her even knowing it until later that night when Atticus sees it. Still, Scout and Jem are not convinced that Boo Radley could ever be a kind person, let alone a friend of theirs. This part shows Jem and Scout still not being able to see the real Boo Radley, both physically and mentally. <br /> The film also did not include many of the small details that illustrate the fact that Jem and Scout are growing up. The book shows some evidence that Scout and Dill are \\""engaged\\"" and are to be married when the time comes. However, the film only portrays the two as being merely friends. Also, the film gives no mention of Aunt Alexandra, Atticus' sister, who wants Scout to become more of a sophisticated young woman and takes action when she invites Scout to a tea party that is only took part in by the mature and experienced women of Maycomb. Alexandra also has some arguments with Atticus about not to letting Scout \\""run wild\\"". The latter parts of the book suggest that Jem is becoming a young man. He becomes slightly grouchy and less kind to Scout and begins to grow hair under his arms. The film disregards these details that contributed so much to the meaning and quality of the book. The book suggests that, during Mr. Gilmer's (Mr. Ewell's lawyer's) cross-examination of Tom Robinson, Scout and Jem take Dill out of the courtroom when Dill starts to cry because he is disgusted by Mr. Gilmer's arrogant attitude toward Tom Robinson. The three children begin to realize the hatred and inhumanity of the world they live in. The film completely ignores the fact that Scout is trying to deal with all the problems of the growing up and maturing of herself and others in the book.<br /> To Kill A Mockingbird the film had never really matched intensity that the book had so often portrayed. The film never touched the core of all human behavior and dignity. However, I was not disappointed or surprised that the film had never reached the level of passion and heartrending that the book had. A film can never reach that level of authenticity and heart. It will only try and fail. Today, To Kill A Mockingbird may be, to some, a book too old and dull to find enjoyment in, but that, in any circumstance, will never be true with an enduring masterpiece such as this.",2004-02-13

The book's setting is a small town in Alabama, and the action behind Scout's tale is her father's determination, as a lawyer, liberal, and honest man, to defend a Negro accused of raping a white girl.  The most important theme of To Kill a Mockingbird is the book's exploration of the moral nature of human beings-that is, whether people are essentially good or essentially evil. The novel approaches this question by dramatizing Scout's and Jem's transition from a perspective of childhood innocence, in which they assume that people are good because they have never seen evil, to a more adult perspective, in which they have confronted evil and must incorporate it into their understanding of the world. As a result of this portrayal of the transition from innocence to experience, one of the book's important subthemes involves the threat that hatred, prejudice, and ignorance pose to the innocent: people such as Tom Robinson and Boo Radley are not prepared for the evil that they encounter, and, as a result, they are destroyed. Even Jem is victimized to an extent by his discovery of the evil of racism during and after the trial. Whereas Scout is able to maintain her basic faith in human nature despite Tom's conviction, Jem's faith in justice and in humanity is badly damaged, and he retreats into a state of disillusionment.<br /> The moral voice of To Kill a Mockingbird is Atticus Finch, who has experienced and understood evil without losing his faith in the human capacity for goodness. Atticus understands that, rather than being simply creatures of good or creatures of evil, most people have both good and bad qualities. The important thing is to appreciate the good qualities and understand the bad qualities by treating others with sympathy and trying to see life from their perspective. He tries to teach this ultimate moral lesson to Jem and Scout to show them that it is possible to live with conscience without losing hope or becoming cynical. In this way, Atticus is able to admire Mrs. Dubose's  courage even while deploring her racism. Scout's progress as a character in the novel is defined by her gradual development toward understanding Atticus's lessons. There is a maturity in Scouts observation as she finds contradiction in Mrs. Faust's intolerable racist manners towards blacks, but utmost compassion towards Jews massacre by Hitler.",2004-02-10

I was at that stage where you almost remember what happens, but don't quite, so the story is just as engrossing the second time. This time, I was struck by the mockingbird analogy more than ever. It is a beautiful metaphor and actually applies to many of the characters in the book: not just Boo Radley, but Tom Robinson and Jem too. When you think about that the whole way through, it gives the book a whole new depth and meaning that is not immediately evident on the surface. I think before, when I read the line &quot;it's a sin to kill a mockingbird&quot; I fell into that trap of thinking &quot;oh good, that's the title of the book mentioned at last&quot;. It's easy to attribute the metaphor solely to Boo Radley because of Scout's (very insightful) comment at the end of the book &quot;it'd be kinda like shooting a mockingbird,wouldn't it?&quot;, but I think that is just scratching the surface of this wonderfully written novel.

It is the perfect description of how the white people living in the south treated the blacks in the 1930's. In school we learn about the slaves and the Civil War, and what goes on in that time period of American History. However we are not really exposed to the time period that follows, the fact is that we still treated blacks badly. Within the contents of this book about a little girl growing up in a very judgemental town we not only learn about how the blacks were treated but we also learn how judge some one. Which we really can't do until we walk around in their shoes. <BR>     When one takes the time to sit down and think about what is going on the fact that not a lot has changed since then. We make up stories about something or someone that we don't know, or are afraid of like Boo Radley. Then we frown down apon those who we think are unclean in our society like the Eweles. Then there are the people who we judge too qickly because of their unfasionalble clothes or the color of their skin like the Tom Robinson's of the world. When we decide to look closer we see that most of the Tom Robinsons of the world are just trying to get along like everyone else. People like Boo Radley are also trying to get by, but remain in the shadows, like the kid in the back of the class who doesn't say anything for the fear that everyone will laugh at him. Then the Eweles who we think to be unclean, but there is always the idea that we raise the standards all the time to what is fit in society.

In every neighborhood, you have the mean old lady whose house you hate to walk by (Mrs. Dubose) and the character no-one really knows, they never leave their home and speculation arises as to their activities (Boo Radley). I'd have to say my favorite character is Atticus. He does his best raising his two children after his wife dies at a young age. He tells his kids the truth and doesn't sugar coat things for them. He talked to them like they were his equal, not below him as many parents do. He teaches his children that just because every one else says or does something that doesn't mean that it is ok. The best part is his closing argument at Tom Robinson's trial. Atticus was a kind and patient man. No matter the color of your skin or your social status, he treated everyone with love and respect.",2004-01-23

The story is full of interesting, lovable characters. The narrator is Scout a bright, bold, young girl who lived with her older brother Jem and their lawyer father, Atticus.<br />Respectable Atticus was a gentleman who raised the two children with the help from Calpurina, the day cook. Against some of the prevalent social senses, he taught them the principles and values he lived by. <br />With Dill around during the summer, things were more interesting. They had the hermit neighbor who remained the mysterious subject of the children's acts of curiosity. Their interaction with other neighbors like Ms Maudie and Mrs Dubose was always capped with lessons to learn.<br />And there was a case of a black man Atticus defended against the charge of raping a white girl.  Atticus' integrity and the people's classic prejudices were demonstrated in events related to the case.<br />The storyline and language are awesome. Narrations by children are always interesting in the way curiosity, frankness, and innocence do. And the book is full with values we adults could always relearn.

Thank God for whatever teacher it was who made us read it. I am currently a practicing lawyer, and I have to admit that I was influenced in part to become an attorney by none other than Atticus Finch.<br />The book is such a fantastic examination of people's prejudices, fears, and hatreds, no doubt far more scholarly people than myself have examined it and analyzed it to pieces. But it does expose so many raw nerves for so many people: the pettiness of bigotry by whites against blacks during the depression, the fear of the unknown in the person of Boo Radley, the sheer injustice of the all-white jury convicting Tom Robinson...and through it all, we are treated to the quiet dignity of Atticus Finch.<br />The story is essentially told through the eyes of Scout, an intelligent but often guileless young girl who is frankly confused by the prejudice that rears its ugly head when Tom Robinson, a black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman, the daughter of a violent drunk white farmer.<br />Scout's love for her father is apparent throughout the book, particularly when she watches him remain quietly courageous in the face of ever growing town anger at the prospect of Atticus defending Robinson. But there is not necessarily a happy ending here. The story is bittersweet, Atticus does not save the day for Robinson, but Scout is rescued from potential harm from an unexpected corner and learns that one should never judge anyone by appearances alone.<br />A true, timeless classic which I have re-read several times over the years.

Bob Ewell, Boo Radley, Tom Robinson and Scout were all main characters. Bob Ewell is a mean, racist man who accuses Tom of raping his daughter. Boo Radley is a retarded, crazy person, so the children fear him. Tom Robinson is a black man who is trying to survive in the town with racism problems. Scout is the young girl who tells the story of what happens in her town. Bob has problems with Tom, so he said that he saw Tom rape his daughter. Scout has problems with Boo because she wanted to be friends and he didn't.

Atticus is a man who took up the challenge of a new type of legal case. He, a white man, is willing to defend a black man.

The majority of the townspeople are very prejudiced and closed-minded, but one exception to this trend is Atticus Finch. He is a white, middle-class lawyer who defends a black man, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a white woman. The trial causes a great controversy among the townspeople and reveals the true opinions and values of the citizens of Maycomb, Alabama.<BR>     Lee uses the characters in his book to convey different views on the topic of discrimination.  Specifically, he uses Finch's children, Jem and Scout, to show an innocent and naive perspective on the topic. The children have a hard time understanding why a man is being persecuted because he is of a different race. Jem and Scout's thoughts continue to play a significant role throughout the book to represent the idealistic views. Mayella Ewell, the woman who accuses Tom Robinson of raping her, is used by Lee to show the white race's common view of the black race during the 1930's.  Ewell is willing to have a man put to death just to save her reputation.  Her act of indiscretion points out the views of how black men were rarely viewed as human beings and certainly were not treated as if they were human beings. <BR>     In my opinion, Lee does a wonderful job in expressing his views through the use of his diverse characters. The language that he uses in his book really makes the words jump off the page. Also, the lessons learned in this book are applicable to everyday life. He brings you along for a most influential ride filled with love, hate, anger, and such starvation for wanting to know what is going to happen next in the story, that you just cannot put the book down. After reading this book, I appreciated the struggles of the black race more than ever, and I really respect all they had to go through.",2003-11-07

The story takes place in the Deep South and is told through the innocent eyes of an eight-year-old girl called Scout. Her father is a lawyer who is verbally harassed by an entire town because he decided to defend an innocent black man accused of raping a white young woman. To kill a Mockingbird moved me to both laughter and tears as I read how Scout learns about life from watching her own father stand up and fight for what is right, exposing and challenging an entire town in it's unfairness and ignorance. Harper Lee, the author, is luminous. It is no wonder that this book shook the standards of our nation for the time it was written.

Lee portrayed the literary device theme, very well.  You should put yourself in other people's shoes so that you don't prejudge them explains what the theme of this is.  Within theme, a major topic is where the central character and narrator of this book, Jean Louise Finch, also known as Scout changed from an immature girl in overalls, to a mature, young lady. <BR>Many characters affected this change, among those would be her older brother Jeremy Atticus Finch, better known as Jem. Scout looked up to Jem and followed in his footsteps. For example, when Jem and Dill Harris were planning to go to Boo Radly's house to place a note on the window Scout insisted that she tag along. Jem also tried to keep her safe like in the end when he tried to stop Bob Ewell from hurting her, even though it would only redirect the attack to him.  <BR> Another character that affected Scout would be her Aunt Alexandre, a person that Scout did not favor much throughout the book. Her Aunt desperately attempted to turn Scout into a young lady. Alexandre always contradicted what Atticus said, and never agreed with his ways of raising children. when Aunt Alexandre had a party for her friends, and Scout tried to impress the women by being extremely polite. Normally, Scout would be wearing overalls and she would speak her mind rather than think of how she'd make other people feel if she was rude. Atticus wouldn't have minded that so much, but it would have driven her Aunt up the walls. Aurther &quot;Boo&quot; Radly is also another character with a great influence on Scout. He taught her to not judge people before you actually know them. Throughout the entire story, Scout and Jem would continuously try to get a glance at Boo. They harassed him on a near daily basis just to try and see him. Through all this, Boo left gifts for them in a hole in an old, dead tree, and in the end he saved their lives from Mr. Ewell. An example ofhow they harassed him was putting on plays that were supposed to be about him and the Radly family, but an example of his kindness was putting a blanket around Scout one night when she and Jem were watching Mrs. Maudie's house burn down. <BR> The final character that had a major influence on the life of Scout was Calpurnia, the Finch's cook. Calpurnia, a black, strong-willed woman taught Scout to not be prejudice by taking two white children (Scout and Jem) to her all black church. While Jem was going through his maturing stage, he often left Scout out because he didn't want her around. Whenever he did this Calpurnia was there for Scout, and open-heartedly invited her to help in the kitchen. This helped to make Scout feel wanted. The most significant symbol in the novel appears in the title - the mockingbird. It is a sin to kill a mockingbird because all they do is go about their own way singing and not making trouble for anyone. The mockingbird symbolizes how people try to mind their own business, but society won't let them. Dill Harris would be a symbol of the mockingbird, because he is a victim of society. Dill was repeatedly shipped from relative to relative because his mother didn't want him around. He ran away because he finally realized that he was unwanted by his own family. <BR>Boo Radly is also a symbol of the mockingbird because he locked himself up in his house and doesn't bother anyone, but society judges him with no reason. People would blame things on him and Jem and Scout would harass him, and all because he just goes about his own business. <BR> Tom Robinson, an innocent black man, is also a symbol of the mockingbird because he was judged by society when he was blamed for a crime that everyone knew he didn't commit. He was trying to be nice, and help Mayella Ewell whenever he was asked to, and for this she made him out to be guilty of a great crime, and even when Atticus proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that he was innocent, he was found guilty.A quote to support the theme of you should put yourself in other people's shoes so that you don't prejudge them is from Atticus Finch, &quot;You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.&quot; In the case of Tom Robinson, prejudice plays around the trial.  In this trial Bob Ewell blamed Tom for the rape of his daughter Mayella. This trial was a trial of black against white.  Prejudice was one of the largest problems of judging.  Though judging is a huge problem then and now it will never be solved.  This book is based on reality and therefore is interesting.",2003-11-07

I can't believe that it's taken me so long to get around to reading this - it truly is a classic that deserves to be read, that's enjoyable and is still an easy read.<br />&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; takes place in the deep South during the depression. Told from the viewpoint of Scout Finch, a young tomboy growing up in Maycomb, Alabama, we get an account of her early life full of strange characters such as the enigmatic Boo Radley, woven with a classic courtroom drama equal to any that Grisham or Turow have produced.<br />Harper Lee has breathed such life and vitality into every character in this tale. Jem and Scout, the son and daughter of Atticus Finch a local lawyer and state senator, represent the liberal town viewpoint, the growing awareness of racial inequality and the touchpoint for the tensions of country versus town that appear even within the school. Aunt Alexandra gives us an insight into the southern hostess, gentile yet savage, forward thinking when it comes to Africa highlighting the racial inequalities they take for granted in their own town.<br />This book was written at the beginning of the highly charged atmosphere of the late 50s, early 60s. Racial inequality was being challenged in the courts, in the schools and on the streets. The combination of this intensity combined with the drama set in 1930s makes this one of the true classics of American life in the South.

The story is told rather wonderfully from the point of view of Scout, a naive and hot-headed young girl with a nose for a fight, who wanders among many stories, from the eccentric Radleys, to playground fights, to wondering why her father continues to defend that man everyone seems so intent on lynching.<br />&quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is a wonderful story. It's sweet and poignant and principled without ever being schmaltzy or loaded with sentiment. Among the strongest points, in my opinion, are the little conversations Atticus has with others explaining why he's doing what he's doing, the court sequences, and the subplot with Arthur Radley.

The story starts off in a town called Maycomb. The characters are Jem and Scount Finch along with their father, Atticus Finich. Atticus is an attorney and he is defending an african-american man, Tom Robinson, because he is acused of raping a white girl, Mayella Ewell. Jem and Scout are the two kids that try to get Boo Radley out of his house. Boo is supposedly a big, tall monster-child. Jem and Scout meet a new kid from the block, Dil, who is visiting for the summer. He dared Jem to touch the side of the Radley house. Jem does it and they never messed with the Radleys til Dil came back next summer. When he comes back, they are wiser, so they decide to go to the Radley house at night. When they do Nathan Radley, Boo's brother, scares they off with a shot of his shotgun. When they run off over the wire fence, Jems pants got stuck on it. When he came back to get in the next night Jem went back and tried getting his pants back, and he found the rip stitched up and ready for him to get it. It was the work of Boo Radley. They find that Boo isnt a bad person, but they he is friendly. <BR>  I would really recommed this book if you like reading race-related books. This book also has mischif in it when Scout and Jem try to get Boo to come out. I thought this book was really good because I like the whole jist of the book.

When a young man is accused of the rape of a white woman, Atticus agrees, amidst tremendous controversy, to defend the accused in the town's court of law. During the lead up to the case Scout and Jem have to tolerate racial slurs and insults because of their fathers role.

The book is written in Scouts perspective giving you an insight to her views of life. Other characters include Dill, a young boy that spends summers with Jem and Scout, Bob Ewell a nasty lazy drunkard whose daughter is the accuser from Atticus's case and Boo Radley.

When a novel breaks into my top ten, it's a big event.  When a novel contends for my number one spot, it's an earth-shaking event in my world of books.

I think readers are often too young when they read this book for the first time to fully appreciate all its merits.  It's not a difficult read, and the moral lessons are so obvious and impressive that young readers do appreciate the book, and I feel it is good that they read it.  But other features, such as the fine and subtle nuances of the relations among the children, and between the children and the adults, are not fully appreciated by the younger readers.

The story is told through the eyes of Jean Louise Finch (also known as Scout), and, as a child of only eight, she shares (in looking back) her ideas of family life and the rich history of Maycomb. <br />Harper Lees depiction of 1930s South racial prejudice is a powerful one. Atticus Finch is clearly the hero of the novel,  defending a black man on trial for raping a white woman.  A widowed father, he teaches Jem (his son) and Scout lessons in life, one of the most paramount being to walk in anothers shoes to understand life from their viewpoint. Jem and Scout take many of these lessons in stride and try to impress upon themselves being civilized and respectful all of society. <br />Another aspect of the novel is the mystery surrounding Boo Radley and his spooky house.  Boo Radley represents all the bad rumors of the Maycomb community, and yet, most of these are unjustifiable. Scout, Jem and their friend Dill are obsessed with discovering exactly who Boo is. <br />Although the novel is primarily small town in nature, the themes encompass everything we deal with today as a society, namely discrimination and prejudice. Through the trial of Tom Robinson, we see Atticus worthy of great respect for standing up to the ideas of a narrowed-minded community. The Finch family also must deal with the man whose daughter is the alleged victim in the case, Bob Ewell. (Bob Ewell represents the ignorance of a small town). <br />Perhaps what makes the book timeless is not only its theme in the general sense, but the final speech by Atticus during the closing arguments. This oration is built up over a long trial, and it is worthy of the time it takes to get there. (Although, I think Gregory Peck made this scene come to life more in the movie). <br />A reader may frown atthe many tidbits of detail given to establishing the Southern way of life, especially in the initial chapters, but the book progresses to a point where the reader wants to know the fate of Tom Robinson, Atticus and the rest of the Finches. This book is a classic because it delves into modern topics, a central issues that certainly we all must come to terms with: discrimination and lack of equality.",2003-07-24

Then again, I don't think that the people in my Alabama hometown have changed their mind much about black people since the 1930s when this book was set. The parents of my classmates would have wanted to censor this book for its cuss words and references to sex. Small town Alabama has changed a lot since this book was written in many ways but not at all in others. To quote from the book: \\""You're not gonna change any of them by talkin' right, they've got to want to learn themselves, and when they don't want to learn there's nothing you can do but keep your mouth shut or talk their language.\\"" My personal choice was to keep my mouth shut and to get out of there!<br />Harper Lee paints a portrait of small town Alabama with its varying social classes. Below even the class that lives on the outskirts of the city dump is the class of the black people in the town. To Kill A Mockingbird is a story told from the viewpoint of children who had not been tainted with this social phobia and who had learned from their father, Aticus, to view each of these groups equally. Still, their curiosity about these different groups lead them beyond their own imaginations into the real world as they encounter people from each of these social classes. They invite a boy home for lunch who has no lunch of his own, they visit a black church with their housekeeper when their father is away on business, and they try to make contact with the next door neighbor who hasn't been seen for 20 years.<br />Then the children are unexpectedly plunged into world of intolerance where the town's adults live when a black man is accused of a crime he didn't commit. Their father is appointed as the black man's lawyer and the children hide in the balcony to witness the trial first-hand. They are shocked and dismayed by the townspeople's inability to see past the man's skin color to aquit him for his alleged crime. In response to the children's reaction, their black housekeeper says, \\""They've done it before and they'll do it again and when they do it -- seems that only the children weep.\\"" How amazingly profound!<br />What a wonderful book!lack housekeeper says, \\""They've done it before and they'll do it again and when they do it -- seems that only the children weep.\\"" How amazingly profound!<br />What a wonderful book!",2003-07-13

But I'm glad I waited. I don't think I would have enjoyed or appreciated it nearly as much in my youth. What a treat! <br />The book starts slowly, but draws the reader in by the end of the first chapter. Without exception, the characters are intriguing. Scout, the young girl who narrates the story, is a particularly compelling and sympathetic character. Author Harper Lee gives her a youthful perspective without patronizing. <br />The story is enlightening and entertaining. It accomplishes these dual feats with minimal moralizing. A few passages did make me cringe, such as the \\""enlightened\\"" neighbor's there-but-for-the-grace-of-God thankfulness that she wasn't born black. But I suspect those passages reflect the views of the period, and are as instructive as the story itself.<br />No need to say the writing is masterful; the Pulitzer Prize gives away that little secret. I particularly enjoyed the scene in which Atticus Finch is called out to confront a rabid dog.

In it, we meet the best and worst America has to offer.  We learn that while most Americans are good people \\""when you really see them\\"", we unconsciously inflict the most damage upon those who never hurt us.<br />The central plot in Ms. Lee's tale involves the trial of Tom Robinson, but the book is half over by the time we reach this point.  Instead, Ms. Lee paints a picture of a sleepy, shabby Alabama town where locals are poor, have little to do, and spend a great deal of time worrying about the activities of their neighbors.  We see the town through the eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, children of the attorney Atticus Finch.  Slowly we see a world where people want to do the right thing, but lack the courage of their convictions.  We see how unjustly the town's African American citizens are treated by the majority of the townfolk, by the contrastingly decent and fair treatment of these citizens by Atticus.  We learn that Atticus is the man in the town who does what no one else has the heart to do--whether it is shooting a rabid dog or defending Tom Robinson in an unwinnable case.  He does it all without boasting, and without the expectation of reward.<br />I read recently that Atticus Finch had been voted the #1 hero in American cinematography by a majority of Americans voting.  I work as a lawyer, and a majority of my classmates ran off to join a big firm and get as rich as possible as soon as they graduated.  Yet we idealize this simple, humble man who believed in doing the right thing before making a fast buck.  In this time of Enron and secret terrorism tribunals--both of which make a mockery of our legal system--it is important to remember the lessons taught by Atticus Finch:  never cheat a man with less education, for anyone who does so is trash; never judge someone, for you don't know what it is like to walk in their shoes; never shoot a mockingbird, for all they ever do is make beautiful music for the rest of us.",2003-06-09

The action behind scout's tale is her father's determination as a lawyer and a liberal to defend a black man accused of raping a white girl, although he did not do it.  The books' setting is in a realistic racist and segregated town in Alabama in the 1930's.  The author does a wonderful job making each character distinct and different.  This book brings to surface the idea of how unfair and cruel society can be and how racism can affect so many lives, in ways we cannot imagine.  The reader gets to see how the family grows both together and apart and also how it copes with its day-to-day lives.  The Novel deals with such issues as racism, neighborhood togetherness and the bonds that either grow or are lost between parents and children.  I am proud to say that this is my favorite book.  This novel is a must for all growing children.",2003-05-29

The story is told through the eyes of the little girl Scout.  She tells the story about her hometown and the happenings in it.  The reader learns about racism of which her father is the defense attorney for a black man accused of rape.

This book not only captured and held my interest, but I was also able to relate to and understand a lot of what the characters were going through.  I felt as if I could relate to this book because it highlighted and gave a realistic description of human nature and behavior.  <BR> One aspect of human nature that is shown in this book is how as people we are born innocent and blind to most of the wrongdoing in the world.  As time goes by, we are subjected to different people and situations and our so called rose-colored glasses become darkened.  The characters Scout and Jem illustrate this best.  As young children, they assume that everyone is good and no harm can come to them because they have never really come into contact with evil in their lives yet.  However, as the story progresses, they see, for the first time, prejudice, hatred and the overall ignorance of human beings.  In addition to this, the children got to experience the effect that these things can have on people, specifically how they can ruin and destroy many lives.  Usually, when hearing about racism or prejudice, we hear the more factual side of how people are affected, such as what rights they are being denied.  I enjoyed this book because it gave me insight on how people are really affected, how they feel, and how their lives are changed as a result of the injustices.  <BR> Despite the fact that this novel highlighted the evil nature of human beings, the author did not neglect to show that there is good in humans as well.  The good nature of humans is represented in this book primarily through Atticus Finch.  He is the father of Jem and Scout and a fairly well off lawyer in Maycomb.  Throughout his life, Atticus has seen the capability of humans to be evil, yet somehow he has not become cynical or lost his faith in the human race.  He understands that people are both good and bad, and Atticus does not look uponpeople with judgement.  He, instead, tries to see and understand the reasons that people are the way they are.

Jean is a little girl who lives with her older brother of 5 years, Jeremy Finch(aka Jem) and her father Atticus Finch in a little town in Maycomb county. The novel's main theme is basically the lessons one learns growing up. This theme is centered a lot around the trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, of supposedly raping a white woman. Atticus is the lawyer given the job of defending Robinson and with this heated trial occurring, Scout and Jem have to deal with a lot of oppossition and derision from many of their prejudiced neighbors. But, this story has so much more dealing with just the general complexities of growing up. <br />I think my favorite thing about the novel was the characters.

It is told by the daughter, Scout.  Scout and her brother, Jem, are very close because they are both very curious kids.  They get all their information on what's going on with the trial by snooping around and talking to gossips from town.  Basically the story is about what the family goes through because of the trial, considering that back then most people automatically believed the white girl.  The town was not very supportive of Atticus 'choosing' to defend a black man.  The Finch family goes through a great deal of pain and strife because of this.<BR>    Because of reading this book, I feel more enlightened on the black/white issues of days gone by.

Their father, Atticus, is a well-respected lawyer who is assigned to the case of Tom Robinson. Tom Robinson is an African-American man who is unjustly charged with committing a crime against Mayella Ewell, a white woman. Although Tom Robinson's case is predictably lost because of the racial and prejudicial beliefs that existed at the time, Atticus feels obligated to accept Tom Robinson's case. Atticus Finch is a strong person who is well ahead of the times, who believes in Tom and who wishes to help him as much as possible. He also wants to set an example to his children against the prejudicial beliefs that they are growing up around. Besides Atticus, Jem and Scout, there are many other important characters in the book, especially as it progresses.<br />As the book advances, the characters change. They evolve, become more or less important, and fall in and out of the story. For example, in the first part of the book, Miss Caroline is one of the main characters. She is Scout's first grade teacher, and it is in her classroom that Scout faces the first injustice done to her. Dill, who spends summers with his aunt, Rachel Haverford, in Maycomb, is also an important character in the first part of the book. He plays an important role in being a friend to Jem and Scout and brings out more information about Boo Radley. On the other hand, Boo Radley does not play an important role consistently throughout the book. In the beginning, he leaves gifts for the Finch children. After he can no longer do that, he is not heard from until the resolution of the novel, when he saves their life. Miss Maudie, the Finch's neighbor, is important through out the book. She is always around the help the children and shares her wisdom. Calpurnia, the black woman who works at the Finch's household, is also important throughout the book. She serves as a good example of the African-American community to the children. Another member of the household is Aunt Alexandra, Atticus Finch's sister. In the midst of the main conflict, she moves to Maycomb to live with her brother's family. At first there are many conflicts, but soon Aunt Alexandra is loved as part of the family in her own way. She is supportive of her brother, Atticus, even when she disagrees with him about the Robinson case. Atticus's client, Tom Robinson, is very important to the plot of the story, although he is not the main character. When the conflict is examined, he is the main protagonist. The Ewell family is in the story more than Tom, although they are featured as the antagonists. Other characters are Judge Taylor, who presides over Tom Robinson's case, Heck Tate, the county sheriff, Mr. Underwood, owner of The Maycomb Tribune, and Mrs. Dubose, an elderly neighbor. <br />Although this book was published in 1960, it is set in the 1930s in Maycomb County, Alabama. It is a town that is full of southern pride, where everyone knows everyone else, where rarely does someone leave, and where judgments are formed about people from their last name. Because each family has a position in the county, and each person in that family just follows in the way their ancestors lived and behaved. Each class just keeps to themselves. It would seem like the town was divided into the townspeople, the Negroes, the country folk, and the people who live in trash despite their skin color. This story could happen anywhere, but the setting definitely accelerated the pace and depth of the plot.<br /> The author's purpose was to write a novel that explored the issue of prejudice in a way that everyone can feel and relate to. By writing through the eyes of a young girl from ages six to eight, it allows readers to look at complex, controversial issues in a simple, innocent way. Scout asks simple questions such as \\""Why? Why does this happen? Why is this going on?\\"" Harper Lee makes the readerfeel angry at the twisted prejudice that existed for so long. I think that the author accomplished her purpose the instant her successful book was published and later won the Pulitzer Prize.<br />I can understand why this book has become a classic piece of American literature. The book conveys many emotions and completely shows the injustice and desperate feelings of humanity. The first half of the book focuses on building the atmosphere of the town and of the Finches and other residents. You learn of the school, the neighbors, the opinions of the town, and become familiar with the important character's lives. Then, you are thrown into the midst of Tom Robinson's trial. The whole community must face their personal prejudices and angry feelings of injustice and helplessness. You can see how the behavior of others affects the feelings and opinions of a person. I think that this is an important book that still holds a lot of meaning.",2003-03-25

Indeed both stories are about children peering beneath the veneer of Southern life and coming face to face the ugly secrets of class distinction and racism. The discoveries of such secrets always lead children ultimately to the loss of their own innocence. However, unlike Huck Fin, Jem and Scout have Atticus Finch, their father, to guide them.  Atticus is aware he can't keep the world away from his children forever. Perhaps it is for this reason that Atticus, a lawyer, decides to represent a black man wrongly accused of rape. Atticus is that rarest of people, a man who is willing to lead by example. It is the example Atticus sets for his children during this trial which will stay with Jem and Scout for the rest of their lives. I read To Kill A Mockingbird first in middle school and again years later during college.  Upon my second read I was stunned by how much of the book I didn't understand during the first read.

I chose to read this book because of all the positive feelings expressed from previous readers when I asked them of their opinion. <br />This book is set in the 1930's in a small town in Maycomb County, located in the south. The novel shows how white supremacy still lived on, even many years after slavery was abolished, and this novel shows the persistent prejudice shared in the southern morals of this time. Harper Lee has portrayed a common way of thinking of the southerners who are unable to accept that the blacks have been unchained from slavery. The whites find it hard to consider themselves equal to the blacks. This theme has been shown through the lifestyles of the blacks and their struggles they experience from the white community.<br />The main characters in the novel are Atticus Finch, he is a respected Lawyer of Maycomb County. He seems to believe in and does everything in his power to keep justice alive. He has two children, Scout and Jem. Another character of the novel is Arthur Radley, a rather subdued man who tried his best not to have any kind of relationship with anyone of the community, he never steps foot outside of his house. Although you get the feeling that he does not want to remain distant from people by the way he acts with the children (Scout and Jem). Bob Ewell is an absolute evil character who has no touch with responsible behavior. He has no care for himself, his money or his children.<BR> <BR>I would have to say the protagonist of this novel is Atticus Finch, he is the key character who directs many events that take place in the novel. Like his positive involvement with the poor whites and the underprivileged blacks of the community. He comes across to me as an understanding person who wishes for his children to grow up with a broad outlook on life and a liberal way of thinking. I particularly like this characteristic becauseI believe that is how every child should be brought up. The Antagonist of this novel is defiantly Bob Ewell. In the beginning you just think of him as a lazy drunk, who has no care for others. But by the end of the novel you come to feel nothing but total hatred for him because of his attempts to harm Atticus's children and how he doesn't even think twice before sending an innocent person to the gallows. <BR> <BR>I usually don't like novels based on that time period in history after the abolition movements. But this novel had a meaning much deeper than just the struggles between the white's and the black's, it illustrated the idea of how the human race thinks and deals with social issues and different morals and beliefs. The novel also had a light and humorous mood at times, like when it connects Jems brotherly manner or Scouts spontaneous actions. <BR> <BR>There's no doubt that this book is a classic. It was a time well spent you can not fully consider yourself an American before you read this book.

Author Harper Lee, who earned a richly deserved Pulitzer Prize for literature, once said she never thought of her novel as nothing more than a love story of a widowed father for his two children. The novel is so much more. Intentionally or not, it is a searing indictment of the individual and institutional racism as seen through the eyes of southern lawyer Atticus Finch's daughter, Scout. Written in the innocent words of a child, we see unfolding a white woman's fabricated cry of rape against a black man and the cursory trial trial in which, considering it's the South and a black man is on trial for a crmie against a white victim, the proceedings are little less than perfunctory. As defense counsel, Scout's father endures the disdain of the white community in his lazy southern town. The fate of the defendant, predictable in the then-racist South, is no less heartbreaking and, at the same time, outrageous. Along with racism, the novel touches on people not fully understood, and the character of Boo Radley serves the point masterfully. An American classic in every sense of the word, \\""To Kill A Mockingbird\\"" is a moving experience that, if we read closely enough, compels us to look beyond the prejudices and discrimination in our own hearts.

Harper Lee was also very thorough with the characterization. You felt like you knew everyone in the town and I really got into the book even more because of it.

The book does a good job of using dialogue and characterization.  You feel like you know all of the characters on a personal level.  One thing that makes it difficult to read is the fact that the author, Lee Harper, uses the southern dialect.  Some of the words she uses are slang's that people from the south would use.

Atticus Finch, the father of Scout, the story's narrator, is a lawyer assigned to defend a black man falsely accused of rape. Atticus is a tolerant man who has raised his children to do their best to consider all points of view. Over the span of three years, Scout, gives us a first-hand view of how the townspeople in Maycomb, Alabama behave toward people of different races and classes in the town.  Scout's experiences with the people of Maycomb teach her to consider their points of view in addition to her own.  At her young age she begins to understand the daily life of many of Maycomb's residents backgrounds better than most of the adults. When she confronts Mr. Cunningham and the other men at the jail, she is able to reach them by showing their connections to each other.  Scout tells the story in her own words, but her analysis of the people and their actions are with the point of view of an adult.  She understands what the sheriff is doing when he declares that Bob Ewell has fallen on his own knife, and she also realizes that Boo has been their unseen friend and protector throughout, and should be treated respectfully.

The novel tells the story of how Scout and her family endure the threatening ridicule from their community for Atticus' loyalty to this man.  While Harper Lee delivers the message that black people were discriminated against in the Deep South, the more notable message was the struggle that whites endured when they chose to side with the blacks.  There are some extremely comical moments in this book involving Scout and her brother.  Therre are also several other interesting sub-plots that help describe the morals, beliefs, and problems in the Deep South during that period of time.

To Kill a Mockingbird starts with Scout, a young girl telling about her and her brother Jems summer and the exciting events that occured during it. Scout and Jem were being raised by their widower father Atticus with the help of their housekeeper Clapurnia. Scout and Jem are very curious of the people and happenings in their town. Unpleasant things begin to occur in town though. Atticus, a lawyer, explains that he is defending a young black man, Tom Robinson, who is wrongfully accused of a serious crime.

Set in Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930s, the book vividly depicts the issue of race and how a young girl overcomes the boundaries of color to show her community that there is more to someone than the color of their skin.  Scout, the main character, lives with her brother Jem and father, whom she calls Atticus.  Atticus teaches her and Jem that race really means nothing and that every person deserves the chance to be respected and treated fairly.  Atticus is completely non-violent and will not even show the children how to fire a weapon.  The family's black cook Calprunia tells the children to never kill a mockingbird, because they are only here to sing. <BR> During the summer Scout and Jem befriend a boy named Dill who becomes fascinated with an almost \\""haunted\\"" house owned by Boo Radley.  The children begin to trespass on the mysterious property and soon find little gifts left in a knot in one of the trees.  They are shot at by Boo's father and in the chaotic events Jem loses his pants.  He finds them days later mended lying on the fence.  The children come to believe that Boo is behind all this confusion.<BR>Meanwhile, Atticus is assigned to a case involving a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman.  Atticus tells his children that they might be taunted and treated unfairly because he was taking the case.  The children take the criticism openly and even spend Christmas in a black community and become friends with everyone there.  They attend a mass with Calprunia and become more comfortable with the open and accepting black community there. Sadly, Tom Robinson is found guilty by a racist, unfairly picked jury, even though Atticus proved that Tom did not rape the woman.  While in prison an angry mob wants to kill Tom.

Scout and Jem realize that Boo, even though different from them, is a truly caring and a good person.<BR> Harper Lee relates that the Mockingbird symbolizes innocence, which includes Tom Robinson, Jem, and Boo Radley.  These innocent characters have lost something or been almost destroyed by others. Needing help they unknowingly turn to Scout to recover what they have lost.  Lee also reveals that race can be conquered by even a six year old girl like Scout.  Scout shows the angry mob that what they are doing is wrong and is completely unnecessary, telling them they must treat everyone with respect.  Lee also depicts the morals of a small southern town, by the hate and racists beliefs that fill almost everyone's minds.   Through Scout, Harper Lee shows that the innocence of a child can overcome the terrible boundaries of race.  Harper Lee wrote a meaningful and symbolic story revealing that race is ultimately nothing and that every human should treat all of mankind with the respect that everyone deserves.  This is an outstanding novel that should be required reading for any child or adult. This novel can truly change the way you think about life and your fellow man.",2002-11-05

The story as told from a young girl's point of view has light moments that are filled with the joy of playing with childhood friends and her sibling, Jem.  However, as the story progresses Scout is faced with the concerns that her classmates and neighbors have over her father, the town's most prominent lawyer, representing an innocent black man in a rape case against a white woman.  Racist people in their everyday lives confront Scout and her brother Jem and they must learn how to react to their hateful remarks.  Scout realizes the discrimination that many black citizens face in their everyday lives for the first time.  She doesn't understand the weight that her father's case has in both the families' and the town's everyday activities.  Scout begins to understand her father's kind and respectful nature and begins to respect more as an upstanding and moral citizen.<BR> To Kill A Mockingbird is set during a time that most young readers' parents and grandparents reflect upon as a time with a tremendous communal bond.  The wonderful sense of community takes the reader back to a time in our history where neighbors cared about each other.  However, it also brought back to life the very real prejudices that many African-Americans were faced with during the era of the depression.

In Harper Lee's novel, \\""To Kill A Mockingbird\\"", similar occurrences are interpreted in a wide variety because of beliefs, morals and values.  These non-uniform perspectives are what make each character so tangible.<BR>Every event that occurs in the novel is trans scripted through the eyes of Scout Finch.  Each character perspective, therefore, becomes an aspect of her point of view.  Her brother's courage is an excellent example of this.  \\""Jem was a born hero\\"", pronounces a simple opinion of how Jem is deep down being admired by Scout, even though the two often have trouble getting along.  It is the subconscious bonds between the two that keep them from slipping away when times get rough.  However, Scout is seldom pleased about her brother's journey into manhood.  When Calpurnia tells Scout that Jem is just about Mr. Jem, Scout scoffs \\""He ain't that old.  All he needs is someone to beat him up, and I ain't big enough\\"", rationalizing how Scout respects her brother, yet the respect will not extend so far as to consider him an equal to any adults.  To Scout, Jem just requires assistance in assuring him he's not as old as he thinks.  Scout just isn't up to the challenge.  However, because Scout has such a strong admiration for her brother, much of his masculinity rubs off.  This is also due to the fact that Scout never had a true mother.  Most displeased with Scout's un-ladylike behavior is Aunt Alexandria, who becomes aggravated when she learns that Scout wants to be friends with a poor, uneducated Cunningham.  \\""You're enough of a problem to your father as it is\\"", demonstrates Aunt Alexandria's quest to make Scout behave in a more feminine way only leads to more static between the two.  Scout clearly has an agenda all her own.  Not Alexandria, not Jem, not even Atticus can change her attitude.<BR>Atticus is a father, a lawyer, and a human being.  But in many ways, he is more than all of those.  To Miss Maudie, he is a symbol of respect and gratitude.  \\""Whether Maycomb knows it or not, we're paying the highest tribute we can pay a man.  We trust him to do right\\"" exemplifies how Miss Maudie's intelligence enables her to take everything Atticus does that she may not agree with, and respect him for daring to accomplish the things no other man could challenge.  Atticus could just as well give up on the trial, or stop caring, but his will is too strong.  He could never allow himself to betray another man.  When the townspeople send Atticus their gifts of redemption, Atticus, while impressed, must also say \\""They must never do this again.  Times are too hard\\"", demonstrating Atticus, while he is obviously being respected, holds an equal respect for the people of Maycomb.  He knows that it wasn't easy for so many of the families to show how grateful they were.  In this way, Atticus shows he has humility for everything he does.  Because of his pending antiviolence beliefs, Atticus rarely becomes angry.  Instead, he forces himself to realize that as horrible as people sometimes seem, they're still human.  \\""If spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewell one extra beating, that's something I will gladly take\\"", describes the father's best method of defense is to not lower himself to the level of Bob Ewell.  By doing this,  Atticus can avoid a serious complication, while standing up for his personal beliefs and keeping his dignity.  More people than he may realize approve his courage and honesty.  Miss Maudie's appreciation runs farther than anyone else, even Atticus' own family.  She has nothing but praise for every action he makes.  \\""If Atticus Finch drank until he was drunk he wouldn't be as hard as some men are at their best\\"", associates the fact that if the worst of Atticus could suddenly be brought out of him, if his superiority began to deteriorate, if he was no longer the cunning, respectful man he was, he would still be a better man than a person like Bob Ewell could ever become.  This statement proves that no one is as proud of Atticus as Miss Maudie.  And yet, Atticus very rarely shows that he is proud of himself.  \\""If I didn't [defend Tom Robinson] I couldn't hold my head up in town, I couldn't represent this county in the legislature, I couldn’t even tell you or Jem not to do something again\\"" is a perfect example of a summary of Atticus' beliefs and values.  He must defend a man with no hopes of winning against a racist jury and a clever lawyer while attempting to keep his dignity and father two growing children.  Will he gain a sense of accomplishment from all this?  Perhaps.  The feeling that the right thing has been done?  Probably.  Just proving that he did the best he could, and that he tried his hardest?  Definitely.  That is his only reward, but for Atticus it is more than enough.",2002-10-28

But here's my own take on it.<br />The quick plot summary is that a Black man, Tom Robinson, has been falsely accused of raping a white woman in Alabama in the 1930's.  Atticus (and like most people, I can think of Atticus only as Gregory Peck) is a lawyer who has been appointed by the court to represent the defendant.  The story revolves around how Atticus, his family, and his friends deal with the racial hatreds and other social conflicts that result from his participation in the case.<br />It's hard to imagine how a book can be any more perfect than this one.  On every basis - plot, setting, characterizations - it is a smashing success.  But I suppose if there is one thing that stands out over everything else in the book, it is the wonderful (and not so wonderful) people who populate its pages.<br />The story is told through the eyes of Atticus's little daughter, Jean Louise (nicknamed \\""Scout\\""), who is probably the most realistically appealing child in any novel I have ever read.  Lee doesn't over-romanticize the wisdom of a child, as many authors do.  Any parent, or anyone who has experience with children, knows that children are NOT unspoiled creatures, free from the prejudices and selfishness that have to be taught by adults.  Scout and her older brother Jem are completely natural characters, recognizable to all of us who remember our own childhoods.  But because of the circumstances into which they are thrown, the two of them emerge as nothing short of heroic figures.<br />But there are so many other memorable characters that it seems impossible that this novel could be only 323 pages long.  There is Scout and Jem's annual summertime friend, Dill.  There is the family maid and de facto female head of household, Calpurnia.  There is the painfully naive and judgmental Miss Caroline, a recent graduate from ed school whois assigned to teach Scout's first-grade class.  There is Boo Radley, the town's mysterious recluse.  There is the \\""white trash\\"" family that started all the trouble with their accusation of rape.  Above all, there is Atticus himself, a figure of towering integrity, love, and loyalty.<br />As wonderful as the book is all the way through, I must call special attention to Chapter 15, where the eight-year-old Scout, with simple love and unconscious courage, tames a gang of thugs who have assembled at the local jail to lynch Tom Robinson.  (Classical music lovers who read this book might think of the chapter as a literary equivalent of the famous second movement of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto.)  In my entire reading life, which covers more than fifty years and thousands of books, I have never read a more moving passage than this one.<br />It is inconceivable that a writer who could create so many memorable characters in so few pages would have confined herself to this one novel as her lifetime output.  But she did.<br />So how good is this book?  I used to have three all-time favorite novels (Tom Jones, And Ladies of the Club, and Lonesome Dove).  Now I have four.",2002-09-29

It's about the effect of racism has on a small town from a child's point of view. The town is called Maycomb with \\""grass that grows as tall as a person, roads of dirt, and children with none, sometimes or disgusting eating habits.\\"" The main characters are Atticus, Boo Radly, Scout, Jim and Dill. I liked Boo Radly. He stayed hidden for many years.   I don't know if he really did, what the town said he did; that he stabbed his father in the leg with scissors and then pulled it out. Boo placed wax dolls and food in the hollow tree and in exchange received candy from Scout, Jem, and Dill. Atticus the father of the children heads into a major problem as a lawyer defending Tom Robinson who is accused of assault and rape on a town woman.   The children had many difficulties dealing with Ms. Doubtly's craziness from drug use.

But I'm not reviewing the movie. The book was just as good. Every time I put it down I just wanted to pick it up and go on reading.<br />It was, contrary to several reviewers' statements, very easy to follow. Yes, it can be a bit scattered at times, but much of its charm lies in the child's narration, surprisingly mature at times and yet all the same naive. It flows along slowly but never once drags.

If you ever lived around folks who talks like this, you'll realise how very authentic it is. Adds a touch, like.<br />Overall I felt this was a very moving story.

If they do, they risk rape and mutilation at the hands of the products of late 20th century political correctness. Harper Lee's brilliant novel gives us a view of what is what like at the other end of the pendulum swing, and lets us see what life was like back then - through the eyes of a very young, precocious tomboy named Scout. All of the ills that plague our society are there... rape, prejudice, fear of the unknown, and just plain meanness. Ms. Lee confronts these ills, but leads you slowly through a gentile, scenic picture of Maycomb County, Alabama during the Great Depression.<br />I was first introduced to this story by watching the movie on TV in the late 1960's and was fascinated with the story from the children's point of view. Later, when reading the novel in the 10th grade I realized that Ms. Lee had given us a compelling masterpiece dealing with crime, ignorance, prejudice, innocence, and community that stands out as one of the most enduring classics of the last century. Children were still allowed to be children back then. We follow the adventures of Scout, her older brother Jem, and their friend Dill until their adventures bring us into the rape trial of Tom Robinson, a black man being defended by her father. It is against the backdrop of the a 1930s rape trial that we are introduced to Atticus Finch, one of the best written father figures to ever spring from the mind of an author. His client is a black man accused of raping a white woman. It is through his relationship with his children that we experience the need to transcend social injustice with courage and compassion. The dialect of the characters, the colorful locals, and the rhythm and pace of the story is perfect. It is seasoned with humor, suspense, and some of the most wonderfully entertaining narrative prose I have ever read. I just re-read this book for the 15th time, and still highly recommend. Whetheryou're 15 or 95, To Kill A Mockingbird is still a sensational reading experience.

Nor had I ever seen the famous film with Gregory Peck. Fortunately, I also avoided learning the entire plot through cultural osmosis. Sure, I knew who Boo Radley was-- didn't I? Atticus Finch... yeah, I know who that is... right?<br />Boy, was I wrong. Last week I finally decided it'd been long enough, and I sank into Harper Lee's only novel with high expectations. And I was certainly not disappointed. With its slow, warm and evocative opening chapters, Mockingbird starts off like a sulty summer day in the South. Lee depicts a South of \\""whistling bob white,\\"" biscuits and warm milk, and ladies who on the hottest days bathe twice by noon and then douse themselves in lavender-smelling powder.<br />Jean-Louise Finch, better known as Scout, narrates the story with the keen eye of an adult looking back on a childhood rich with incidents that shaped who she has become. Scout reminded me of some of Carson McCullers's heroines (Member of the Wedding, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter), but without the morbid loneliness and heartbreak. Scout might be described as a tomboy, but that would be doing her a disservice. Her adventures with her older brother Jem, and their dimunitive friend Dill (real name: Charles Baker Harris. \\""Your name's longer'n you are,\\"" Jem points out) evoke the timeless place of childhood.<br />As for Atticus Finch, what can one say about a father who seems to embody the greatest of virtues? He is tolerant, patient, kind, and understanding. He does not meddle with his children's affairs, he speaks to them as fellow adults (he allows them to call him \\""Atticus\\""), and his skill as a lawyer is legendary. Lee presents Atticus in a tough and sensitive manner, so that his believability is paramount.<br />The other characters in the book are also depicted with great skill: Aunt Alexandra, bane of Scout's existence; Miss Maudie, who gives as good as she gets when harassed by intolerant neighbors; Calpurnia, the ever-present black maid who has as much a hand in Jem and Scout's well-being as Atticus; and of course the Ewells, whose poverty and ignorance help set the plot in motion.<br />Harper Lee has written a wonderful book that pulses with life, with compassion, and easy good humor. Watching Atticus face down an angry mob set on lynching a black man, or racing with Jem as he escapes gunshots from the Radley house, or sitting with Scout as she forced to join her aunt's church lady reception, or taking that long midnight walk with Jem and Scout, is pure joy; these are scenes that reverberate in the reader's mind and surely in the minds of several generations of readers.

The setting revolves around Maycomb, a sluggish-moving town where snow seems a mere fantasy.  Maycomb presents seemingly uninhabited mansions and two colliding worlds of races that create an air of suspense and integrity. Maycomb is the perfect setting where the characters get entwined into the rushing whirlpool of schemes and intrigues.  Scout, her big brother Jem, and their close friend Dill, encounter the wrath of Mrs. Dubose, become mystified by the eccentricity of the Radley Place, and witness the injustice of racial discrimination.   To Kill A Mockingbird provides a picture of man's inhumanity to man and the effect it has upon the innocence of mind.  The main character, Scout, values frankness and openness.  On the playground, she would never walk away from a fight.  Scout maintains a high-spirited independence, but she represents a dynamic character.  Being a young child, Scout is as gullible as a dandelion in the wind.  She turns whatever way others are thinking and is easily guided.  Scout radiates the image of being a tomboy from the manner of expressing herself to the overalls that she wears under her dress.  Characterization is developed indirectly by characters' qualities by showing their personality and the way they carry themselves during troubles.  One of my favorite characters is Boo Radley, whom all the children try to persuade to come out of his house.  Boo Radley represents our darkest fears.    Maycomb radiates with injustice and the sufferings of the less appreciated race.  These evils tear everyone apart so that they want to hide in hopes that the problems will diminish.  Boo Radley symbolizes that the Maycomb society knows about the racial injustice against Negroes, but is too afraid of change to fix their beliefs.<BR>The author's style in To Kill A Mockingbird is conversational and simple.  The word choice enables you to leave the world of high literacy and reach a place where actions are not expressed in high, intricate words, but in commonplace English.  Plain words give a feeling of real heart-to-heart situations while words that are sophisticated resemble an idea that is multifaceted and so complex that knowing the true meaning would be a presumption.

It is a small town where everyone knows each other and is fairly close. The book is told in first person from Scout Finch's point of view. Her, her brother Jem and her father Atticus Finch live in a house in Maycomb with their black servant Calpurina. Atticus, who is a lawyer, is hired to defend a black man in court who was accused for raping a white women. Although Atticus is uneasy about defending the man, he knows it is the right thing to do, although the whole town talks about him behind is back for years to come, calling him a n**** lover. The<BR>family finds out what it is like, to stand up for what you believe in. This is somewhat hard for Scout and Jem because of their short tempers however they try their best to be the<BR>better person and look away when people call their father names. The book also shows Jem and Scout and how they grow up over the years with exciting tales, adventures and<BR>journeys. Their memories and tales are irreplaceable.  Most of this excitement is over the summer with their friend Dill, who comes to Maycomb every summer to stay with his<BR>aunt. The three children go about the years, wondering about the mysteries of Boo Radley the Finch's neighbor, who hasn't been seen to anyone in the town in many years, rumor<BR>has it he is dead. Together they encounter childhood adventures, which don't seem so dramatic when they grow up, however at the time were very important. The main focus in the book is on the loss of innocence and also bravery.<BR> This book is extremely well written, and has many strengths. One technique used in Harper Lee's writing that is extremely effective is symbolism. In fact, it is such a big<BR>part of Lee's writing that even the title of her book is the united symbol throughout the novel. To Kill a Mockingbird is a very meaningful phrase in the book. For example when<BR>they explain why you should never kill a mockingbird in the middle of the book,\\""Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't next in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\"" The mockingbird represents innocence throughout the novel. Since the basic theme is the loss of innocence, the characters are<BR>saying that you should never loose the innocence, kill an innocent bird. In the book so many things end up to be not as innocent, so different then they are thought to be in the<BR>beginning. For example the town of Maycomb was such a sweet little innocent town. Everyone was friendly, it was the perfect life. However in the ending we realize that truly<BR>Maycomb and the people who did live there were not so innocent, but in fact extremely racist. This entire part of the book that makes you wonder about what the title and the theme really do mean, is a great strength in the book.<BR> Another strength in To Kill a Mockingbird  is the ending. So many different events occur in the book and the ending ties everything together. The ending is not happy,<BR>however it gives you a reassurance that everything is going to be all right and there are almost no unanswered questions. Even Scout who is still but a child has many of her<BR>questions about life almost figured out, and has been throughout many experiences people her age might never be in. \\""As I made my way home I thought, Jem and I would get grown but there wasn't much else left for us to learn, except possibly algebra.\\"" <BR> This book did not have many weaknesses at all. The beginning is a little slow moving however. For example some things are explained in detail that have no meaning to<BR>the plot or story line. For example some of the scenes at school , and some of the scenes over their first summers with Dill. Other than that there are no weaknesses.<BR> Over all, I think this was one of the best novels I have ever read. Not only does it have a wonderful and in depth plot, but the characters in it seem like you could be there<BR>friends. They are described with so much detail, that when you are done reading, you want to read more about what happens to them. For example does Scout ever become ladylike, and do more people in the town except Atticus for defending the Negro, Tom Robinson in court. After reading this novel you feel like you can do anything you put your heart to, and you can stand up for what you believed. This is so because every character does this<BR>sometime in the book.",2002-06-13

Though her story explores big themes, Ms. Lee chooses to tell it through the eyes of a child.

She, her brother, and Dill Harris, a boy who spends the summers with his aunt in Maycomb, while away the hours reenacting scenes from Dracula and coming up with ideas in how to get a glimpse of the boogyman down the street, Boo Radley.

Then Atticus is called on to defend the accused, Tom Robinson, and soon Scout and Jem find themselves caught up in events beyond their understanding.

The children were also caught up in the mystery behind the man next door, named Boo Radley, who never would come out of his house.  Scout and Jem also experience the difficulty in understanding just how life was.  As a reader I could feel how the children were affected by the situations in the story.  Scout was the youngest and most vulnerable making her the most exciting character in the book.  <BR> In the first chapter, I could see how much I could relate to Scout.  I was quickly drawn to the description of her character and the fearless attitude she portrayed.  The games she and her brother played are the same games most children play today.  It was easy to relate to her way of understanding and going about things because she was so young.

Scout, a tomboy, and her older brother are being brought up in a Southern town in the early 1900's during a very controversial trial.  A black man has been accused of assaulting a young, white woman who lives in town.  Scout's father, a lawyer, is appointed to defend the black man in a trial that the town thinks is unnecessary.  The author gets the point across that everyone but Scout's father knows the black man is guilty.  Scout and her older brother are put in a situation where the whole town turns against them because of their father's decision.  The trial is the main focus of the novel, which has some very interesting and plot changing turns throughout it.  <BR> Racism has always been an issue in American history.  This book represents a voice that could not be heard in the early 1900's.  African-Americans were often accused of crimes they did not commit, but were still convicted only because they were black.  Many were not as lucky as the black man in this novel, since his accusation at least got him a trial with a white lawyer who truly believed his innocence.  In the novel, the entire town presumed the man was guilty before his trial because of their own ignorance.  The people in the town get the opportunity to learn diversity and tolerance that starts to show up toward the end of the novel.<BR> I would recommend this novel to any person who can pick up a book and read.  This book serves many purposes both educationally and morally.  Presented by a female narrator, the book was a first of many kinds.

In this story, there is a lot of racism.  I think this is what the main theme of the story is.  There are two sides of racism.  One has to do with blacks and whites, and the other has to do with the town and Boo Radley.  I felt this was important because it showed that people are not only prejudice when it comes to race, but also when it comes to social class or people just being different from other people.  People are afraid of things, people, and situations that are unknown to them.  When they are afraid of the unknown, they strike out in very unkind ways.  Sometimes they use words, and sometimes it can get very physical as when the lynch mob came to Atticus and he was unarmed.  <BR>Also, another theme that really stood out was maturation.  Scout and Jem grew up and matured throughout the book.  I think they saw how cruel people could treat other people because of the color of their skin, or maybe just what they believed in.  The situations Jem and Scout were put in made them think twice about what they believed in, which tends to make people grow up quickly.  Atticus also changed throughout the story.  I think that the situation Atticus was in would make anyone change because hatred and anger can make people say and do things they wouldn't normally do.  I think there were times when Atticus was very quiet due to the fact that he had so many emotions inside him.  I'm sure through time, he felt the animosity of the town's people.  I think after awhile, that would really get to someone.  I liked Atticus because he fought for what he believed in and didn't give up even though it was hard.  Another character who changed in the story was Boo Radley.  In the beginning, no one hears from him or even sees him.  Toward the end of the story, he is seen more, and is more spoken of.  I think that he was becoming less afraid of people.  In the end when he saves Jem and Scout's lives, he showsgreat courage and I think that is very admirable.",2002-05-14

I enjoyed the situations that took place and the events that happend in the book. I disagree though with the character choice, not necessarily  the choices but who the narrator should have been. I dont believe that Scout would be able to remeber things like the problems that took place let alone being able to basically turn away a mob? At her age things like that are hard to beleive espceially her and jem and Dill sneaking around at night? Its hard to beleive children not even ten years of age could accomplish sneaking out like that and not getting caught is very hard to beleive im 16 and cant even sneak out like those characters. I'd like to see this book from an older adults view like Atticus or a black persons view like Calpurnia.

The book tells the story of Jean-Louise    (known as Scout) Finch, a young girl who learns very valuable lessons beginning at the tender age of six. Most of her time is spent with her older brother Jem and Dill, a boy about Scouts age who visits every summer.<br />As the book begins, the reader discovers that Atticus Finch, the father of Scout, is an attorney who is about to tengo with an extremely controversial case. Tom Robinson, an African American who had respect for anyone and everyone, was accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a poor white girl who also happens to be the daughter of Bob Ewell, a low life racist who was out to get any negro he could. Although all evidence is circumstantial, and although Mr. Atticus Finch did such a good job representing Tom that we could all be sure he was innocent, Mr. Robinson was found guilty of rape. While in jail, Tom makes a fatal mistake and attempts to escape from prison. As he tries to climb the fence, Tom is shot seventeen times and his life was put to end.<br />Even though the case was a major part of the story, many other adventures occur during the course of the book.

To Kill a Mockingbird reminded me of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, describing the truths of humankind's hate and prejudice. Lee's novel was based on her own childhood past in southern Alambama in the 1930's. She put the aspects of prejudice, discrimination, stereotypes, and justice into an intelligent child's perspective. As most other child-point-of-view books, I found To Kill A Mockingbird more thought provoking than adventuresome. \\""Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit `em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\"" A mockingbird sings its' heart out to make beautiful music, and never eat up gardens or nest in corncribs. That's why it's a sin to kill them. Lee used the symbolic mockingbird to depict the innocence of a few of the characters in the book. Such as Tom Robinson, a black man who never did a thing to harm anyone else, but was accused and charged of rape to a poor white woman because of his race. This book unmasks a county's feelings of prejudice and hate. The author incorporates a man defending to save a black man's life while teaching his children the unjust ways of the world. \\""As you grow older, you'll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don't you forget it - whenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes form, that white man is trash.\\""  Lee did a wonderful, unlike any other author, in making a book about the maturation of a child and the steps made into the real world.",2002-05-12

One way Lee made this book so enjoyable is the way she constructed her characters.  She made me feel like I was a friend of Scout's and that I knew all of them very well.  Speech played a big role in forming each character.  By the way they talked, you could tell who they were around and how they were acting.  When scout was around all of his friends from school he would cuss and talk mean to everyone.  This showed how scout was trying to fit in and how he was acting aound all of his classmates.  When Cal took the children to the black church she stopped talking in proper English like she always did at home.  This showed the part of her that was her history and culture.  It let the kids and the readers know that around people that she can relate to, she is more herself.  People would talk about Atticus say he was a bad person for defending Tom, but then Scout would get into fights.  The actions of Scout showed us how protective of her family she is.  The way Atticus is being talked about lets us know how everyone sees him.  The other way we get to know these characters so well is how they are described.  Dill is described as a little guy.  This gives us a visual picture that Dill is around the same size as scout and we can begin to see him as we read.

As we proceed through the pages, the facade drops only to reveal that, what lies beneath is a world of hypocrisy, social lies, prejudice, and ignorance.  <br />A handful of ideas occupy the reader's mind while at reading the book: innocence, education, bravery, prejudice, fear and justice.<br />Education is the weapon through which the widowed father arms his children to fight society. He treats them as equals, adults and of a certain level, thus producing a charming yet troublesome duo...<br />It soon becomes clear why he thinks education is so important. Education is the key to unlocking the ignorance that causes such prejudice.  Lessons regarding bravery and cowardice are also taught in an effective way and in a much wide spectrum than not just children but also adults would think of. Atticus's children find out quite early in their young lives that guns do not make men brave and that any fascination with guns is unfounded. <br />Instead, fighting with one's misfortunes, especially when the battle is by fact lost, is the way of making true men, men of honour. His children learn that it takes more bravery and self-restraint to avoid a fistfight than succumb to the temptation of going through with it. Some adults never do...<br />The most important issue of the book is prejudice in all of its forms.  Through the eyes of Scout, her father is the liberal approach to human relations and her aunt is the respective conservative. Gender roles, class distinctions and skin colour are the facts imposed on thechildren growing up in the average southern town of yesteryears. The belief that a cast of people are better, is confronted by the father's stand, that one should sympathize with others and \\""walk in their skin\\"" before judging or criticizing them. <br />Innocence. As hunters kill mockingbirds for sport, people kill innocence, or other people who are innocent, without any remorse about what they are doing.  Killing innocence is like amputating the spirit, projecting to the young hopeful minds of tomorrow that all is vanity, thus killing any hope in their minds and hearts, and wiping out any chances that our society might have to adopt, adapt and improve...<br />Then comes fear.  Small town folks fear that they should adhere to what others think they should do, act within the margins the social rules command, or be isolated. \\"" Cursed is the mutant by God and men...\\"" Even nowadays, fear of rejection dictates the social status quo and keeps individuals from standing up for that which they believe. Coming from a Greek society, I have been many times confronted by my immediate or wider environment about things I felt, thought or imagined of being right.  I think that the lesson learned here is that until we are able to comprehend and absorb other people's ways, we are just slaves of our own prejudice, fear and hypocrisy...<br />...",2002-05-07

One may find that they can relate with one or more of the characters in the book, and sometimes with more than one at a time.<br />This book is about many things, and although it is very complex it is easy to follow due the similarities to life itself. Like life, there are many characters.  Some that are easy to hate, easy to love, and those that are plainly repulsive because of their disrespect for their fellow man.<br />This story is indeed about prejudice.  It paints a despicable ( but reasonably accurate) picture of the hate that permeated the daily lives of those in rural Alabama.  It also portrays the prejudice that is applied to those that are different for reasons other than skin color.  This book is also about the preservation of childhood innocence.<br />Scout and Jem enjoy a pleasure that many of us only wish we could have experienced.  That pleasure was the love and care of a father that stood for what was right to the point of his own harm.  Many of us have never known that type of uncompromising love that Atticus Finch so readily exudes.  He is a man, as Miss Maudie says, \\""was born to do our unpleasant jobs for us\\"".  The character of Atticus Finch still stands as a man among men.  We could use a few like him today.<br />Jean and Jeremy find themselves subject to the harsh realities of poverty and prejudice, but they are always able to take refuge in the affection of their father. Atticus makes many efforts to protect his children.  His primary tool is truth.  He speaks openly and honestly with his children.

My uncle bought it for me when I was twelve, and at the time I thought, okay, I'll read it . . . one day. A couple months later I finally picked it up, and couldn't put it down. <BR>To Kill a Mockingbird is a profound novel because it deals with a topic no one can understand (racism) but tells it in a language everybody can understand (the narrator is a little girl named Scout). Scout's view of the world at the beginning of the novel is like that of any other child: innocent. You know, the lies we all used to believe, that everybody on earth is nice and kind and that we all love each other, etc., etc. But then Scout, her brother Jem, and her friend Dill (who is based on Harper Lee's childhood friend, Truman Capote) are compelled to face reality all of a sudden when their father defends a black man on trial for rape. The children learn the hard truths of life, that this world isn't always a pleasant place after all. <BR>But what is so extraordinary about Scout is that she never speaks with hate. She speaks with a child's innocence, and describes complex things in a child's way, which makes it easier to understand. I don't think this book would have been the same if Atticus had told the story, or if this had been told in third-person point of view. Then it would have lacked its young narrator's frankness. <BR>There aren't enough words to describe To Kill a Mockingbird. This is by far the best book I have ever read, and perhaps the greatest contribution an American writer has made to the literary world. To put it simply, this book should be read by everyone.

We view things through the 8 to 11 year-old eyes of the young girl Scout Finch. After the death of their mother, Scout and her older brother Jem are raised by Atticus, their almost too perfect father. (He often reminded me of Adam Trask in Steinbeck's East of Eden). You could not ask for a better, more patient, and more understanding father than Atticus. As the town's defense lawyer he takes up the case of Tom Robinson, a Negro unjustly accused of raping a white woman.<br />The resulting courtroom drama shakes the previously idyllic world of his two children, especially Scout. The children raise many legal and moral questions for Atticus, and he compells them to come to their own conclusions about the case.<br />What is brilliant about the book is how these children have a precocious understanding of justice... their very innocence and unbiased judgement points out the true horror of racial prejudice. Sitting in the courtroom, they are able to clearly understand the TRUTH that seems to elude an entire jury of adults.<br />Much more can be said in praise of this book, as there are many side-stories going on at the same time as this court case is proceeding. The timeless wonder of it all is how Harper Lee dovetails all of the other incidents to leave us with a sense of the ennobling nature of childhood. Sometimes children can look upon the effects of injustice and have their own sense of \\""justice\\"" strengthened, rather than diminished.

Rereading it some thirty years later I now see what all the fuss is about.<br />Firstly, this book is about the thoughts and activities of a young girl growing up in 1930s rural Alabama.  There is very much the innocence (and, ultimately, lost innocence) and wonder of youth in the Harper Lee's prose ... kind of a Dixie version of 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'.  Harper Lee's observations of the rascism and hypocritical society of the times are keenly judged.  My only complaint, albeit minor, is that her prose is too rich - it seems out of place (ie, too adult) for a story about adolescent girl.

The central issue of the book is the progressive discovery of the outside world by two - or three - young children, a girl and one or two boys. This discovery has to do with the ugliness of some people in our society, the prejudiced white people, the openly lazy white social cases who live on welfare, the miscarriage of justice against a black man who is condemned on the sole testimony of two white people by an all white male jury, the planned and failed lynching of the black man the day before his trial, etc. But it is also the discovery of the neighbors and that the people you see, or don't see, everyday are not necessarily what they seem to be, like this crippled woman who is fighting successfully her morphine addiction and conquers it just before dying, so that she can die clean. But it all centers on one neighbor that leads the life of a recluse and that fascinates the children who want to attract him outside to see him. They will eventually succeed twice, the first time totally unawares of it, and the second time just in time for him to save the life of the two children in the hands and under the knife of a white reject of society. This initiation to society goes along with the desire to make these children fit for southern gentility, for them to be a gentlemen and a lady, even if those ladies and gentlemen are not exactly pure and clean, unprejudiced and open-minded, in fact quite the reverse. But it is by integrating this society that you may make it change little by little because most of them want change but do not have the courage to advocate it, though they will support those who willl stand for a reasonable and progressive change.

Scout's also great - she's wise beyond her years, which makes reading a book that centers around such a young character enjoyable. Besides these two great characters, it also is a wonderful book.",2001-12-27

And while a rape trial is very serious topic, Harper Lee chooses to write the book from the point of view of an eight-year-old girl. She takes her time getting around to the trial, writing at length about the exploits of Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill. There are lots of laughs -- particularly the night the three of them went to see Boo Radley's house, and Jem ripped his pants so badly he had to return home without them.<br />There are also lots of tearful moments, especially after Tom Robinson got convicted and after he died. He hadn't raped the girl and everyone in town knew it, but essentially he was condemned from the moment after Mayella screamed. The ending, however, is sort of a happy one in spite of what happened to Tom.<br />Yet, not all people in town are racist rednecks. Harper Lee does not go into stereotype. Plenty of white people supported Tom Robinson, Atticus most of all. I met a woman who named her son after Atticus Finch, and after reading the book I can see why. He was my favorite character in the book because of his high-mindedness and fair sense of justice.<br />All in all a terrific piece of work, one that will make its readers think differently after they're done.",2001-12-22

To Kill a Mockingbird possesses each of these qualities. What makes it especially outstanding is the point of view and what is left unsaid. One main driver of the plot is an incident which we never witness and only learn of through some testimony. One of the main characters in relation to the plot we spend a scant few pages with--we never really know him in order to sympathize with him as a character. And another main character, Atticus, though extraordinarily quiet, maintains a powerful presence reminiscent of Howard Roark in Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead.<br />The simplicity and one-sided nature of the trial can be considered a shortcoming, but they actually make the novel's point that much more powerful. It's believable that the jury would find Tom guilty despite his obvious innocence, and this emphasizes how much man can be cruelly unfair to his neighbor. The ending does seem a bit strained as Atticus somehow is unable to see who killed whom when his children were attacked, but this is a very minor flaw.<br />Overall To Kill a Mockingbird tells a powerful, emotional tale with the easy childhood innocence of its narrator. It makes the reader feel tremendously guilty, seeing what we as a society could be vs. what we unfortunately are. If we interpret this not as an accusation by Lee but rather as an inspiration then maybe we can improve things a bit.",2001-12-12

Scout and Jem are young kids that learn valuable lessons while they are growing up.  They know that all people should be created equal. For instance, Scout ventures to a black church and does not think anything about it. Atticus Finch, Scout and Jem's father, represents a black man that has been charged with rape.  Clearly, the black man is innocent, and Atticus Finch wants to do the right thing.

Simply put, I can't think of a better book that has been written in English (or any other language, for that matter).  I have taught it for years to my sophomores, and I love teaching it every time.  Harper Lee's narration and dialogue are so wonderfully simple and child-like, while dealing with some very serious and heady topics:  racism, hatred, and bigotry.  She manages to make Scout, who is nine at the beginning of the novel, sound like a nine-year-old--not an easy task.  Many authors who have children as narrators fall into the trap of having them sound too young and immature or too adult and sophistocated.  Scout sounds like a whiny, impulsive, little brat at times and then makes the most profound and insightful statements at others--as most intelligent children do. . . .  This, I believe, is Harper Lee's greatest accomplishment in this novel.  Yes, she deals wonderfully with the Nazi movements in Europe, the local racism in Maycomb, and the private prejudices against Boo Radley.  However, those issues have been tackled before and since.  Never have they been tackled with a narrator such as Scout, however.  She brings a naivete, child-like innocence, and humor to the novel and its larger, darker, deeper topics and themes.<br />Harper Lee deserves so much credit for not trying to outdo herself by writing more books of a similar nature or even, God forbid, a sequel.  She said all that needed to be said and stopped talking.  Other authors might want to take a lesson from Ms. Lee.  In short, no American student should be allowed to receive a high school diploma without having read TKM and writing a pretty darned good essay over it.  I'd settle for them just reading it, though. . . . .",2001-10-25

A story that should be read again and again. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the classic novel written in 1960 by Harper Lee to great critical acclaim, received the Pulitzer in 1961 and became a classic film in 1962 starring Gregory Peck as the hero Atticus Finch.<br />We are in the life and times of 1930s Alabama, the town of Maycomb County, as seen through the eyes of a young tomboyish girl named Jean Louise Finch, or &quot;Scout&quot; as she is called by her widowed lawyer father Atticus and her older brother Jeremy &quot;Jem&quot; Finch. <br />The span of the story takes place within three years of their lives. From their summer get-togethers with their young friend Dill from Meridian, Mississippi; to their adventures in trying to make their mysterious neighbor Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley come outside; to the courtroom drama of black man Tom Robinson accused of raping a white woman by the name of Mayella Ewell. <br />All characters are positively wonderful! There's the Finchs' black maid, Calpurnia, who acts like the children's mother and guardian; their colorful neighbors: Miss Maudie Atkinson, Miss Stephanie Crawford, and Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose; the town's sheriff Mr. Heck Tate, and the Ewells. All involved help move along the story with both poignancy and humor. The ending of the book, where Scout and Jem are saved by Boo Radley, is perhaps the sweetest moment in any book. The connection between the little girl and the mysterious man is heartbreaking! <br />Harper Lee created a kind of hero to us in creating Atticus Finch, the strong, stalwart man who never hit his children, much less yell at them. Even when Jem and Scout would get into trouble, he would always be there with his broad shoulders and comforting arms. Gregory Peck, in the film, was the ideal choice for Atticus Finch, and won the Best Actor Oscar for it as well.<br />My only complaint,and this is usually with all books and novels, is too much detail to the surroundings of the characters. There are moments when Miss Lee tends to fill about five pages with description of Alabama during the Great Depression. That, to me, tends to slow the story down. Even THE GODFATHER had that same problem, even though it too is a great book.<br />All in all, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD lives up to its reputation as a very important and classic novel.",2001-10-17

A thoroughly engaging and moving reading experience, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of my all-time favourite books.  Those kids (Jem and Scout Finch) are so funny and you just know that the town of Maycomb HAD to be modeled on a real town (it was - Monroeville, Alabama - where author Harper (Nelle) Lee grew up). A story about growing up and the social conscience which binds us all, this book takes place in the depressed year of 1932. The children's father, Atticus Finch,is a man who's morals and conscience remind one of Abraham Lincoln!  The book is written from the point of view of Jean Louise (&quot;Scout&quot;) Finch, a six-year-old tomboy who wears dungarees: she would rather roll in old tires and climb trees with her brother Jem and their friend Dill - he was based on Lee's childhood friend Truman Capote -  than do &quot;girl things&quot;.  There are characters in the book which weren't included in the excellent 1962 film, such as the matronly scold Aunt Alexandra and Zeebo, Calpurnia's (the much-loved black housekeeper) son.  Miss Dubose is a crotchety caution who's addicted to morphine (she falls asleep at the same time everyday while Jem reads to her - as punishment for destroying her garden). Miss Maudie and Stephanie Crawford are amusing characters.  I love the part when Ms. Crawford claimed that Boo Radley was gazing at her from outside her bedroom window  - Miss Maudie curtly replied thusly:   &quot;Well, what did you do, Stephanie? - move over and make room for him?&quot; That shut her up. The comical moments are amusingly life-like and therefore easy to relate to.

This book turned out to be one of my most favorite books ever.  If anyone has read it, they know what Im talking about.  <BR>The book tells a story in the eyes of a child named Scout.  She is brought up in the small community of Maycomb.  She has many adventures with her brother, Jem.  They, like all other children have a wide imagination.  They let their minds wonder with their neighbors.  They believe things about their neighbors that arent really true. One major issue brought up is Boo Radley.  He is presented as a shy, unsociable individual who never comes out of his house, except for at night.  Everyone finds him to be scary, even though they dont really know him.  Throughout the storyline, they find out who the real Boo Radley is.  He turns out to be one of Scouts best friends. <BR>Scout thinks her father, Atticus, is not exciting and just a regular guy.  She changes her mind when he shoots the countys mad dog with one shot.  He becomes a hero, and later Scout learns that his nickname had always been single shot.  She finally looks up to her father and respects who he is.    <BR>Scout learns many lessons throughout the book.  The main idea is that she shouldnt kill a mockingbird ever.  Her father, Atticus, told her its the worst sin anyone could commit.  Mockingbirds are innocent creatures that only play beautiful music.  She realizes what her father was talking about when an African-American man is sent to trial for a crime he didnt commit.  He was accused of raping an American girl, and Atticus is chosen to defend him.  He does everything he can to prove the innocence of this man, but no one will agree with him.  The innocence of a man is taken and he is sentenced to death.  He represents the mockingbird that was killed.

This book really comes down to stereotyping and the judgmental ways of small towns struggling to deal with the big issues.

I don't know how, but it always seemed to come up every now and then in different classes. I never heard of it until then. In fact, for the longest time, I didn't even understand what they were calling it. They said the name so fast that for the longest time I thought they were saying Tequila Mockingbird.

But, now I know why it made such an impression on them, which is what caused me to even think twice about and even remember the book. Luckily less than a year ago, I saw the book in an advertisement, so I bought the book. It was fantastic. First, I loved how the book was told from the perspective of a little girl. I continually found myself chuckling at some of the reasoning of the young story teller, just as my own 7 year old cousin might make me laugh with the things that she says and does. Beyond this aspect of the book, was of course the story itself. It truely reminds us that morals like honesty, standing up for what's right, treating all people with respect, and that we never know a man until we walk in his shoes are things that are important in life today, just as they were back then. A book like &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is a classic because it touches on issues that span all lifetimes.

This book is certainly a masterpiece and deserves to be called a &quot;classic&quot; in every sense of the word.<br />Harper Lee's method of describing predjudice and injustice in a small southern town, through the eyes of a little girl, is a highly effective and moving technique. The fact that Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill can see through the hypocrisy of the adults around them, and the social system in which they live, is very telling and holds a true lesson for us all. These kids can clearly see that an innocent black man is being railroaded for a crime he didn't commit, and are appalled and heartbroken by the system that convicts him anyway.<br />I understand that this book has often been banned for not being &quot;politically correct&quot; in the modern world. Yes, it does contain the N-word and other epithets, even from the mouths of the well-meaning lead characters (who are simply a product of their society anyway). Since I'm not a member of an oppressed group, I can't tell people they shouldn't be offended by these terms. But what we have here is an accurate potrayal of life in a small southern town in 1935, and that's just the way things were back then. Even if the past was painful and ignorant, by covering it up you're trying to pretend it never happened, and that's no way to deal with it. Also, those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.

Atticus Finch, a lawyer and a father, defends a black man, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a poor white girl, Mayella Ewell. The narrative is in the voice of Jean Louise (Scout) Finch, Atticus daughter, who with her brother, Jem, and friend, Dill, endure the underlying outrage of the community when Mr. Finchs vigorously defends Tom Robinson. <br />In the meantime, a great mystery is solved, the mystery of Boo Radley, a &quot;malevolent phantom&quot; who lives in a ramshackle house just down the street from the Finches. Boo was never seen, but &quot;people said he existed . . . people said he went out at night when the moon was down, and peeped in windows . . . when peoples azaleas froze in a cold snap, it was because he had breathed on them . . . a baseball hit into the Radley yard was a lost ball and no questions asked.&quot;  <br />Theres not much more that I can add to the hundreds of other Amazon reviews about this Pulitzer prize-winning book, but a few bits of &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; trivia may be interesting to those who are fans of the book and movie. <br /> . The character of &quot;Dill&quot;  the imaginative boy who was Jem and Scouts best friend and neighbor  is modeled after author Harper Lees best childhood friend. (Dills character is developed in much more detail in the book.)  The friends name was Truman Capote, a boy who grew up to be one of Americas finest authors. Perhaps the friendship was forged because both children marched to a different drummer. Truman was effeminate and didnt fit in with other boys. Harper was a feisty tomboy who didnt fit in with other girls.  This friendship, developed in Monroeville, AL (Maycomb in the book) and which continued into adulthood, gives rise to one of the more interesting controversies in literature. Four decades later, Harper Lee has never penned another novel, just a few articles and essays. The style in many of the passages in To Kill a Mockingbird is very similar to that of Truman Capote.  Did Harper Lee write this novel? Or is it the work of Truman Capote?   Ms. Lee has been quoted as saying that she &quot;finds writing difficult.&quot;  But it is documented that she locked herself away in a flat in New York City for more than a year to write To Kill a Mockingbird. It is very likely that her story is expressed with the advice and help of her good friend. And whats wrong with that?   Harper Lee is still living in 2001 and remains an intensely private person. <br /> . Understandably, the book includes scenes and story lines that were not included in the movie. Scouts aunt, Miss Alexandra, who desperately wants Scout to behave like a young lady, plays a key role in the book after she moves in with the family.  She is non-existent in the movie. Neighbor Miss Maudies house burns down in the books story line  in the movie she is best remembered for the line of dialogue, &quot;There are some men in this world who were born to do our unpleasant jobs for us. Your fathers one of them.&quot; <br /> So, which is better - the book or the movie? <br /> The answer is neither. Theyre both masterpieces that complement and compliment each other beautifully.<br /> Every once in a very long while - in literature and filmmaking - a story comes along with a power of its own that seems to draw from an unworldly creative force.

Nowhere is this truer than within Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird.  I first read this book at University some years ago, and to be honest it had a relatively moderate effect on me.  But in the years that have followed, the messages that are dictated have continued to make more sense to me, and have in many respects never left me.  They repeatedly act as guiding philosophies to the way I try to live my life as an adult.  <br />The book tells the story of racial tensions in the 1930s in a small town in the American South.  Although the 1930s were some seventy years following the abolition of slavery in America, at this time, in many respects whites still viewed blacks as ill educated, immoral and childlike.  To add fuel to this fire, the 1930s were also the defining years of the great depression, a social climate that served to intensify racial tensions, as there was much competition for work. <br />Within this intense social climate the novel dictates a profound insight into understanding racism, and also advises a means to remove this ignorance.  It's philosophy simply dictates that racism is the result of fear of the unfamiliar, and that it is this fear that motivates people to categorize individuals as part of a negative group, as a means to control this fear.  The novel then decrees that in order to remove prejudice people must have an understanding of others as individuals by attempting to understand their perspective as if living their lives.  This would then eliminate fear and stereotyping and ultimately reverse the path that leads to racism.<br />This philosophy is offered to the reader through the objective narrative voice of a child and the lessons she learns through her interaction with various characters within the narrative.  Her father is her biggest influence, a white lawyer representing a falsely accused black man at trial, against the views of hispeers in their town.  As such, as she is lead to an understanding of the novels hypothesis for the elimination of prejudice, so are we the reader.<br />As the novel was written in the 1950s at a time when Southern blacks were demanding more civil rights, such as the right to vote and the complete abolishment of segregation laws, the novel also had resonance in its year of publication.  Perhaps Harper Lee saw this has an opportunity to educate the 1950s white community on issues of race and prejudice, at this critical political point.<br />However, I believe the novel goes even further than this and makes points that can educate people from any background anywhere in the world.  If people could see others points of view by standing in their shoes and seeing them as individuals instead of part of a larger group, then not only would prejudice cease, but human understanding and interaction as a whole would benefit.<br />This is definitely one of those life-changing books that you will come back to time and time again in your life, always reading it from a new perspective.",2001-08-09

To Kill a Mockingbird is the tale of two children, Jem and Scout growing up in a rural Georgia town.  Their father, Atticus Finch, is a kind, just socially responsible man who takes on a case in which a black man is accused of raping a poor white girl.  Since the book is set in the south in the 1930's, the defending of a black man against a white woman is unheard of, but Atticus takes the case pro bono because of every man's unalienable rights, and because of the fact that his defendant is not guilty, a fact which is hushed up and covered over by bigotry and hate in this small southern town.  The novel makes a stand on basic human rights while covering so much other territory.  The antics of Jem and Scout perfectly capture what it is like to be a child during the summer, despite the fact that these summers take place in the charged atmosphere of a racist southern town where both Jem and Scout are forced to do some growing up.  The mysterious character of Boo Radley points out once again that a person's appearance and reputation mean nothing when it comes to their character.  There is so much packed into this one little novel that it the one-hundredth reading would still be a fresh as the first.  Every scene, from Scout's first day at school to the night outside the city jail where a lynch mob threatens Atticus and his client are drawn with amazing skill and beauty.

Then you start to see what life is like from his eyes.\\""  Told in the first person, the book is narrated by eight-year-old Jean-Louse \\""Scout\\"" Finch, a motherless tomboy, who encounters many adventures and learns several lessons in the rural town of Maycomb, Alabama during the Great Depression.  With Scout's elder brother, Jem, by her side, she struggles to accept the racial and economic barriers which had, for too long, separated the townspeople of Maycomb.  To Kill A Mockingbird is a love letter to a community steeped in hypocrisy and injustice; the novel suggests that the chains of the Old South would eventually change due, in part, to individuals such as Scout's sagacious and determined father, Atticus.  When Scout's father, a local prominent attorney, agrees to defend a local Negro worker accused of raping a white woman, Scout begins to recognize the cancer that has all but choked Maycomb out of existence.  As a result of the trial Scout loses her innocence and gains the wisdom that despite ancient grudges it is time for a change in Maycomb.        Characterization is a vital ingredient to the success of To Kill a Mockingbird.  Harper Lee breathes life into all of her characters; she provides them with not only an outward appearance that rings true, but with also a motivation to every action that is plausible because the author makes the reader walk in each character's shoes.  The novel possesses as many memorable figures as any other novel in American history.  In particular, Scout, who narrates the book, is transformed from a highly naive and impulsive little girl to a perceptive and sensitive individual by novel's end.  Jem, Scout's brother, converts from boyhood to manhood and gains a new respect an understanding for his surroundings.  Unlike his children, Atticus remains remarkably true to his character throughout Lee's memoir.  His character is so unforgettable that he remains as the most conspicuous role model for both fathers and lawyers in American literature forty years after the publication of the book.  Another memorable figure in the novel, Tom Robinson, is a hardworking, caring, and honest \\""Negro\\"" who is falsely accused of raping a white woman.  Tom symbolizes the plight of all African Americans at the time where prejudice and injustice were commonplace.  Perhaps the most compelling figure in Lee's work is the mysterious phantom of the town, Arthur Radley.  He remains inside his house down the street from the Finches', a recluse who is neither seen nor heard.  Arthur, better known as \\""Boo\\"", provides the basis for many rumors and stories that keep the gossips guessing in the small community.  \\""Boo\\"" is thus held responsible for many ills and faults of the town.  The mystery of \\""Boo\\"" dominates the imagination and nightmares of Scout and Jem.        The characters of the novel contain weaknesses as well as strengths.  Lee's novel possesses accurate points of view for the time period that adds to the incredible realism that is conveyed through each individual's personality.  Harper Lee's descriptive style provides the reader with remarkable characters and remarkable settings.  The attention Lee focuses on small details brings To Kill a Mockingbird to life.  Most scenes are enhanced by strong dialogue; dialogue that is particularly evident in the riveting courtroom scene that stays with the reader long after he or she has put it down.  An example of Harper Lee's vibrant prose can be found when she sets the scene for 1933 Maycomb: \\""Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it.  In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square.  Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer's day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square.  Men's stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning.  Ladies bathed before noon, after three-o'clock naps, and by nightfall were soft like teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.\\""        The several themes communicated through Harper Lee's brilliant plausible characters tie the novel together creating a beautiful masterpiece.  A classic that ten years from now you will be able to pick up again and enjoy even more the second or third time.  I am thankful to Harper Lee for allowing me to imagine walking around in the shoes of her characters.",2001-06-27

The book is told through the eyes of Scout Finch, an eight- year old girl. At first you get to read about things as they are \\""today\\"", and then the book actually begins by leading us in to the three-year journey  through the life of Scout, her brother Jem and her father Atticus that led to how things are \\""today\\"".  Atticus Finch is a trial lawyer representing Tom Robinson, a young black man accused of raping a white woman. This is the very central thing about this book: Atticus is white and he represents a black man, which is a very controversial thing to do in Maycomb at that time. Robinson is found guilty and he is sentenced to life, al though it is clear to everyone he is innocent. It is this case that presents the ugly, racist side of Maycomb. The things concerning the case happen mostly in the second part of the book. In the first part Lee concentrates on telling about Scout's  and Jem's  relations with the towns other people. Hear you find many unpleasant people and Atticus is forced to explain a lot of things to Scout and Jem about why people act the way they do sometimes. But all in all I would say that Scout and Jem were very happy, because they had a loving and wise father and although their mother had died when they were very little they had a black cook, Calpurnia, who was kind of a mother figure for them, a part of the family.  This book is very good in many ways. I love Atticus as a character because he holds such wisdom and because he really is a man who stands by his principals through the whole book. I noted these words by Atticus because I think they say it all: 'You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view - until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.'  I think it was very clever of Lee to tell things through the eyes of a child: You read about a child's thoughts and feelings but at the same time there is a very mature side to the text. <br />Another goodthing about the book is that although the first half of the book was sometimes quite \\""slow\\"" the end was so good that I must say this book is worth reading again. It is truly an unforgettable novel about fatherhood, honesty and justice.",2001-05-01

'To kill a Mockingbird' is written through the eyes of Scout, an eight year-old recounting the past two years in a childlike innocent way. However, under the surface of her young vocabulary and speech patterns, there is a very mature voice telling us all some very important lessons for life. The childrens' father, Atticus, their housekeeper, Calpurnia and even Boo Radley show us the importance of respect and tolerance of other people, especially the importance of treating other races the same as our own. Every aspect of Maycomb society, even the bad racist side shows us how and how not to behave toward other people, without at any time appearing 'holier than thou' or pious. The wisdom of Atticus in using metaphors to explain the most important lessons in life to his children is evident: 'It is a sin to kill a mockingbird because all it does is sing its heart out for us'. He says this to his son, Jem as a warning to not shoot this type of bird, but also the deeper meaning of not destroying innocence or hating a black simply for the color of his skin. I recommend that anybody who has not already read this book read it as it is a beautiful book with very positive messages.

Then, a few days later, I continued reading and even though I found the writing a little \\""fancy,\\"" I was finally able to find the beauty of Lee's book - it's a pretty \\""grown-up\\"" story, but it's seen through the eyes of kids like me. That makes hard subjects easier to understand, which makes the book so much more interesting.<br />The novel is told from a young girl's perspective. Because the theme of racism, the subject of rape, and the idea of injustice are a little \\""over the top\\"" - even for bright readers -Lee chose a young narrator to tell the story of a black man falsely accused of raping a young white woman and one man's fight to free him. If the story had been told by an adult, readers would have to suffer through the unnecessary chit-chat, opinions, and worries of that perspective. Seeing Maycomb County through Scout's innocent eyes, however, prevents this \\""masterpiece of American literature\\"" from being an \\""I-had-to-read-it\\"" sort of book.<br />Scout, her brother Jem, and their father form one of many families of Maycomb County, Alabama. In that southern state during the Great Depression, \\""[t]here was no hurry for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy, and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County.\\"" As the novel begins, Scout is six and about to start school, where she will be criticized for coming to class already knowing how to read and write. Her young teacher scolds Scout: \\""Now you tell your father not to teach you anymore. It's best to begin reading with a fresh mind. You tell him I'll take over from here and try to undo the damage.\\"" (p. 17) Jem, a fifth-grader,allows his sister to join him in many of his adventures, including his plans with Dill to make Boo Radley come out. But he thinks Scout \\""is getting more like a girl every day.\\"" (p. 52) The children's father, Atticus Finch, is a state legislator and one of the county's leading lawyers. He is selected to defend Tom Robinson, a Negro accused of rape.<br />Racism still exists today, but the problems don't compare to those described in To Kill a Mocking Bird. The main problem seems to be that Negroes are considered the least human of four kinds of people. As Jem tells Scout, \\""There's four kinds of folks in the world. There's the ordinary kind like us and the neighbors, there's the kind like the Cunninghams out in the woods, the kind like the Ewells down at the dump, and the Negroes.\\"" (p. 226) To make the point about Negroes being somehow less important than other folks, the author tells Tom's story. He is a Negro whose left arm is stripped of muscle from a childhood accident. He stops to help nineteen-year-old Mayella Ewell with several chores because, as Tom admits at his trial, \\""I felt right sorry for her, she seemed to try more'n the rest of `em\\"" - referring to her family, who gathers their supplies from the nearby dump and whose father is a drunkard who beats them. When Bob Ewell catches his daughter hugging the black man, he accuses Tom of raping Mayella to save their family from disgrace. \\""And so a quiet, respectable, humble Negro who had the unmitigated temerity to `feel sorry' for a white woman has had to put his word against two white people's.\\"" (p. 204) Atticus Finch does his best to make Tom a free man. His efforts, though, only buy more time from the jury, which still returns a guilty verdict. Unlike her brother, Scout believes that \\""there's just one kind of folks. Folks.\\"" But Tom still ends up dead - shot as he tries to escape from punishment for a crime he did not (could not) commit.   To Kill a Mockingbird could be a pretty \\""heavy\\"" book for young readers if it only concentrated on racism, rape, and Atticus Finch's unsuccessful attempt to free an innocent man. So Lee combines the story of Tom Robinson with the mythology surrounding the inscrutable Mr. Arthur Radley, whom Jem, Scout, and their summertime friend Dill call Boo Radley. One story about Boo is that he stabbed his father with scissors while cutting newspapers for his scrapbook. Another story has Boo scratching neighbors' door screens. Yet another says that he eats squirrels. Kids love creepy stories, and the antics of the three friends as they try to make Boo come out of his house give the novel light and humor.<br />Although I had a rough time \\""getting into\\"" To Kill a Mockingbird, when I finally did I was surprised by how good it was. By the way, the book has such a cool title. I didn't understand it at all when I began the book.

It deals with one of the most pressing modern issues which is race.  The story is told by an adult Jean Louise (Scout) Finch, who is looking back on the period on her childhood from age 6-9.  Harper Lee first introduces us to all the eccentric souls that inhabit Maycomb County in order to give us an idea of how this town operates.  At the beginning of the novel everyone seems like pretty decent people, but we see who are the truly noble people in town when Tom Robinson, a black man is accused of raping a poor white woman.  Scout's father defends Tom in a trial scene that has probably inspired numerous people to become lawyers. Scout is an excellent and winning narrator as the tomboy who refuses to grow up and who is considerable smarter than her peers and clear eyed than the adults around her (with the exceptions of her father and Miss Maudie).  Lee wraps you up in southern small town warmth and childhood misadventures that ring universal until dropping her bombshell of a trial.  How that trial affects Scout and her older brother Jem and their perceptions of the world and of their town is a focal point of the novel.

Her father has been appointed to represent a black man being tried for allegedly raping a white woman.

The main plot centers around the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of the rape of a white girl.  It is within this context that Atticus, the town's gentleman and defense attorney, teaches his children humanity and truth.  The story is narrated by an adult Jean Louise (Scout), recalling the events of her childhood leading up to and after the trial. Tom is convicted and sentenced to death - not surprising given the era, any other outcome of the trial would have rendered this novel trite and significantly diminished its value.  The trial is without a doubt among the most well written scenes I've ever experienced in American fiction.  Tom's accuser represents the complete antithesis of honor, respect, and decency.  I applaud Lee for delivering biblical comeuppance to the accuser in a swiftly paced yet suspenseful narrative that made me anxious to get to the next sentence.<br />Lee introduces the right characters in the right setting with exacting language to support the theme of the novel.  This is perhaps the nations' most well written lesson on the personal depravation caused by racial hatred and the spiritual enlightenment encountered when one stands defiant in the face of it.  And what better way to demonstrate this moral message than through the eyes of children who know nothing but truth, until told otherwise.

Through her exposure to the  prejudice, the injustice, hopelessness, courage and revenge, she matures to  even the extent of an adult.     This novel centers on the life of a young girl named Scout, her brother  Jem and their friend Dill.  Together, they learn to cope with and fight the  prejudices of their small town.  Throughout their adventure, they meet Boo  Radley, a misinterpreted, kind man who has been locked up in his house for  years as well as Tom Robinson, a black man unjustly convicted guilty for a  crime he could have not committed.  These children mature as they stand up to  the bias and face reality.     In Maycomb County, those who are prejudice make the lives of blacks as  miserable as possible.  Tom Robinson, who was always kind to the Ewells, was  convicted of raping their daughter since he was black, although all evidence  proved he was innocent.  Likewise, others frequently bothered Calpurnia, a  black maid of the Finches, even though she was considered a member, even a  &quot;motherly figure,&quot; to the Finch family.  Because someone is black or  different in other ways, people usually jump to conclusions.  The jury, when  they saw Robinson, convicted him just because of the color of his skin.   Furthermore, Boo Radley, because he was never seen out of his house, was  rumored to be a &quot;monster&quot; even though he was a pleasant guy and even a  lifesaver.  When people jump to conclusions, strength and courage are often  needed for them to withstand those conclusions.  Jem and Scout's father, who  was, until then, considered weak by his children, used his strength and  courage to shoot a rabid animal therefore, bringing out his past of being one  of the greatest gunmen of Maycomb.  Scout, his son, also shows bravery by  approaching some prejudice citizens and even convincing them to abort their  plan to kill Robinson.  Many of these people, through rumors, the color of  their skin or life in general often feel hopeless.  Robinson, after being  convicted felt so unjustified and hopeless that he tried to escape prison and  in conclusion, died.  Dill, a friend of the Finch family, also felt hopeless  when he was unwanted by his mother.  Because of the prejudice, sometimes  revenge feels like he only way out.  Bob Ewell, because of his hatred for  black, tried to frame Robinson, and although Tom was convicted Ewell tried to  kill him.  As revenge towards Ewell, Boo Radley stabbed and killed him.  When  subjected to these prejudices, maturing happens quicker.  Jem, after seeing  the injustice done to Tom Robinson, learns about the cruelty and unfairness  of life, making him more mature then even some of the adults.  Scout also  matures as she stands up to a gang of adults to save the life of her father  and the prisoner and convinces them to leave.

The effect created by doing this is more adventure and details, since a kid is adventurous and has a creative mind.  The author did a good job of not losing the the main idea of the book with the different events going on and even though the perspective was told thorough the child's eyes.            I can identify my own life at a young age with the life of Scout.  Since she was a young child, not everything was always told to her.  It was covered with a blanket in hopes that she wouldn't discover what was going on.  She always wanted to be in on the action knowing all that she could.  Me as a child was the same way, and still am today.  A curious, independent, wondering child would best describe Scout and me.  Always wanting to be in the center, &quot;I pushed my way through dark smelly bodies and burst into the circle of ligh.  H-ey, Atticus!&quot;. (154)  This is a quote of when Scout, Jem, and Dill snuck out of the house at ten o'clock at night to see where there father/uncle was going.  When they found him surrounded by a big crowd of people outside the jail protecting the person he was defending in court, the kids went right through them standing next to Atticus.  This shows the sense of wonder, ornery nature, and the courage the kids had in the book.            This book is a book that I believe everyone should read in their lifetime.  Since it deals with the main issue of racisim and prejudice.  Everyone will come across this once in their lifetime and is something that everyone can relate to.  The life lessons that Scout learned can also be taught by the book to the reader.  I feel that this book is for everyone that is capable of reading and able to comprehend the issues revealed.",2001-01-05

I think one of the rights of passage in life should be reading To Kill a Mockingbird.      The themes, characters, and situations remain an indentation in my life, and they are respectively profound, believable, likeable, noble, enigmatic, detestable (in this last case, the Ewell family, of course) and, unfortunately, current. This novel is one of those unique readings that appeals to both young and old alike. That is simply because it defies the decomposing to which many contemporary writings give way and I think that is why I enjoyed it.     After having read this classic at least Three times, I find something new each time. Some interesting plot device, characterization technique, theme, motive or symbol - that I had overlooked before. This, surely, is one of the signs of not merely a good novel, but great literature.       I suppose this is one of those books that will endure for many years to come. It truly is a great part of American literature and will be a not only timeless but an ever-enduring classic. This is one of those books that you fall into \\""the trap\\"" of thinking just because it is popular it is good. This book is a good book and its good to fall into the trap. Something about the story:      This timeless classic is about Scout Finch and what she sees through her eyes during the story. Her brother Jem, her father Atticus, and she live together in Maycomb, a small county in Alabama out in the country. Their mother had died when Scout was only two years old. Across the street, Miss Atkinson lived who cared deeply about her flowers that she grew. Mrs. Dubhouse, an old lady who picked on everyone that passed her house, lived down the road.     Two houses down from the Finches, the Radleys lived. Their house was old and their door was always closed to the world. Mr.Radley lived with his mysterious son. Mr. Radley would be seen now and then walking down the road to the town. He didn't speak much. His son, Arthur was rarely seen unless during the night. Rumor had it that 0h! he would watch people through their windows while they slept, and scratch on their screen doors. The children of Maycomb called him Boo.     Dill, the nephew of Miss Atkinson came to Maycomb every summer to see his aunt. Dill became good friends with Scout and Jem. When Dill learned about Boo Radley he came up with the idea of making him come out. Together, Dill, Scout, and Jem have a lot of adventures trying to contact Boo.      During the same time when they were having their exciting times together, Atticus was defending a black in court. At the time, Blacks were free, but they weren't considered equal to whites. Not everyone in Maycomb believed that Atticus should be doing this, but he held his head high and tried his best in the trial.     With the feelings from the people that didn't think what Atticus was doing was right, and the longing for contact with Boo from the kids, it turns into a near death experience for Jem and Scout.",2000-12-21

Although I titled this &quot;high school reading&quot;, I think that it's a book that can be read and understood by all ages.  It is beautifully written and narrated by the adult Jean Louise &quot;Scout&quot; Finch, as she talks about when she was 8, and how her family(herself, her brother Jem, and her father Atticus) dealt with Atticus defending black Tom Robinson for a crime he didn't committ against a white woman in a racist town.  Atticus is probably one of my favorite all time characters.  He is so sweet and compassionate, and just like that other review said, a perfect rolemodel.  Even though the ending of this book is pretty depressing, I still love it to death.  I'll try to not give too much of the ending away for those of you who haven't read it.  It just seems upsetting to me that Atticus proved so many times that Tom Robinson didn't do it, and the defense had nothing and they still won, just because Tom Robinson was black.  Maybe that's why the book is so good, though.  It doesn't give a Disney ending.  The ending is harsh and serious, but it's realisic.  I have read a few of these reviews, and I was really sad that no one explained the meaning of the title.  I wrote a report on it, so I should know this.  Tom Robinson, the man falsely accused of a crime he didn't commit, and represented by Atticus, is a mockingbird.  When Jem and Scout get guns for Christmas, Atticus tells them the only thing they can't shoot are mockingbirds because they don't do anything but make sweet music for us to hear. This is why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.  Much in the same way, it was a sin to kill Tom Robinson(he dies) because all he ever did was help the girl who accused him of raping her(the crime he was convicted for). I suppose I just ruined the ending, so I'll stop now.  But the bottom line is:  This is a really great book, and you should read it if you haven't already.  Or, if you already have, read it again.

It is a book that, though I had heard a lot about, I had never had the chance to read. I was glad that I got the opportunity to read a book that interested me in a classroom setting. This story takes place in the early nineteen-thirties (coming out of the great depression) in a small (fictitious) town called Maycomb located in Southern Alabama. The novel's plot revolves around the lives of Scout, the narrator looking back on her childhood, her brother Jem and Atticus their father. The book tells how these children, growing up in an extremely prejudiced old southern town learn from their father how important it is to show compassion to all and be people of conscience. Another main figure in the book is the town scare and scapegoat Boo Radley. Boo was put away in his own house to be kept prisoner by his parents and brother for many years. Naturally the people of the town not understanding the whole Radley family's introverted and sometimes odd ways are cruel and prejudiced against them especially Boo when the truth is Boo hadn't ever hurt anyone and didn't deserve the unkind treatment he was receiving by both his family and the town. The children, Jem and Scout were taking part, to some degree, in this talk and gossip against the Radley's but as the book progressed they realized that Boo really wasn't a creepy bad person at all, but a person just like them with a heart and feelings. They realized that like the mockingbirds in the trees he was there only to help and not hurt and by gossiping and making fun they hurting an innocent thing who needed compassion and care instead of cruelty. They found in the end that he was their friend and that one truly can't judge by appearances.

Her mother died before she ever really knew her, so this left her father Atticus Finch and their cook Calpurnia watching out for Scout and her older brother Jem Finch.  They live in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama.  The story begins in the summer of 1933 and ends on Halloween night of 1935.  At this time the majority of the town is racially prejudice.

In part one of the book, Scout, Jem, and their friend Dill are trying to get their neighbor, Boo Radley, to come out and play.  Boo is a grown man that is kept inside their house and isn't ever let out.  When Boo was a teenager he got in trouble, and his father locked him inside the house.  After Boo's father died, Boo's older brother Nathan Radley comes and takes their father's place.  Nobody ever sees Boo, but the kid's gossip describes him as mean and ugly.  The kid's attempts are not successful for getting Boo to come out.  In part two of the book, Tom Robinson, a local black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell.  Mayella is the nineteen-year-old daughter of Bob Ewell.  Bob is a poor farmer who makes no attempt to live with dignity.  He spends his state relief checks on liquor and often abuses his children.  When school starts his children go for the first day and don't ever go back for the rest of the year.  They live right next to the town dumpsters and they have a garbage filled yard.  Judge Taylor assigns Atticus Finch to be Tom's lawyer, because he knows that Atticus is the only lawyer that has compassion for black people.  Atticus fulfills his job to the highest of his ability even though the consequence from it is almost unbearable for him and his kids.This was a wonderful novel that I would recommend to anybody.

I have meant to read it for a few years now, but never had the chance.  Not knowing exactly what it was about except for the rape of a white girl and the charge of a black man it sounded like &quot;a time to kill&quot; to me, but it is anything but that book.        <br />i found myself laughing at this novel because of Lee's quick wit and clever characters.  Calpurnia i found made me laugh the most.  She was so blunt and hard on the children and always had something smart to say to them.        <br />Beginning the book i thought the two children were boys.  Lee never mentions (or at least i didn't notice) that Jean was was a girl.  They called her scout and she didn't want to seem like a girl when she played with Dill and Jem.  I was pretty amazed to find out she was a girl and i loved the way she acted. Always wanting to follow her older brothers lead and wanting to marry dill.      <br />Boo Radley (the scary man that haunts the town of Maycomb, who never leaves his house and might be dead) fueled the beginning of the book.  Lee writes amazingly about children and their comical antics.  It reminded me of the way i used to be.      <br />While the town of Maycomb thought Atticus (the children's father) was not fathering his children right, i came to love him.  His sence of reasoning and hearing each of the children out before making any rash decisions.  He was always so calm no matter what happened and could never be seen without reading. he was an intelligent man that the town should have looked up to instead of looking down on him.  He let his children do what they wanted, but for their own good.  With this freedom the children could learn right from wrong (of course with guidance) and be who they wanted.       <br />To Kill a Mockingbird is also about the hypocrisy that faces us.  During the middle of the book it is brought to Scout's attention by her teacher that it is wrong to kill Jews because they are so law abiding, faithful and help out their communities so well, but Scout wonders why her teacher could feel this way about Jews and not feel this way about blacks.        <br />This novel reaffirmed my appreciation for how far we have come with civil rights.  The book does not only deal with this, but it is a strong vaild point.  In order to get where we are now (and we still have a long way to go) we needed people in communities like Atticus who would take the looks and stares from his neighbors in order to defend what he thought was right.  He defended a black man when the town said he shouldn't have just so he was able to look in his children's eyes.  He wanted them to see that everyone is equal and sometimes the right thing is the hardest thing to do.      <br />OVERALL:  To kill a mockingbird is a novel everyone should read.  Its wit and humor make the message of this book even more brighter to see.  While i did not find this book suspensful till the end (which i must add had a GREAT ending) i found myself wanting to turn each page because i was enjoying myself while reading about the city of Maycomb.  Lee makes you feel as though you live right next to the Fitch's and are sitting on your portch watching the summer days go by.",2000-11-22

Another important character in the novel is Dill, Scout's best friend. Throughout the entire novel Jem, Scout and Dill spend most of the time together they practically become inseparable.

The conflict becomes evident when Scout reveals that Tom Robinson is black. Atticus takes Tom's case knowing that it will be very difficult because no blacks have ever win a case of rape in the State of Alabama.  Atticus stands for his believes no matter what the people say about defending a black. Scout narrates all the fights she has at school because of her father situation. She does not really understand why some people are so unfair only because of the colour of the skin. The book then turns into a novel about racism. The book teaches us about how we sometimes have the wrong idea about people we do not really know and most importantly about injustice. <br />I think the book \\""To Kill a Mockingbird\\"" is a very interesting and enjoyable book. It is very easy to read because it does not use complicated vocabulary. It is particularly interesting because it focuses in a worldwide problem called racism. The book has a plot that makes it very intriguing and it uses a flash back that creates a situation of expectation for the reader. To conclude I would like to say that I really like the book and I will definitely recommend this book to other people interested in good stories.",2000-11-20

The book is like her diary and she tells us everything that is going on in her life. Jean -louise is also known as Scout and has an older brother called Jem that she spend most of the days with. Her father (also known as Atticus) is a successful lawyer that has a difficult time raising the children alone since his wife died after scout was born. Scout is an intelligent and clever girl that likes to learn and therefore knew the alphabet and how to read in an early age with the help of her House -made called Calpurnia. Scout is more of a boy because she hates skirts and dresses like the other girls at school always wear. She loves fighting and does many naughty things with her brother that Atticus and Calpurnia dislike like when Scout and Jem visit the huge, scary and dangerous house  with  the weird man living in it. The climax or the high point in the book is probably the trial (which includes Atticus and Mayella) that takes place near the end of the book but there are many incidents that happen before this that scout experience.<br />The book is very well written because there is not a single moment in the book were nothing is happening. There are many exciting incidents with unexpected endings and you just cant put the book down because you are all the time curious of what is going to happen next to the little girl. The beginning was maybe a bit boring but when you pass the first two pages the excitement begins. I compared my life when I was as small as her to scout's life and it is quite similar because I was also like boy and always wanted to be like my brothers. This book has everything that a book should have: kindness, love, cruelty, excitement, humour, and frightening moments.

Their mom died when Scout and Jem were both young; therefore, Atticus have a black nanny called Calpurnia employed, who helps raising the children. During the book Atticus have to defend a Blackman, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Butch, and in the times of the 1930ies a Blackman's word is worth nothing against a white man's. The Finch's has neighbour called Boo Radley, who Scout and Jem find quite scary and evil.

Things got placed where they belonged and you could feel how the life in Maycomb was like.

As the book discusses serious racial issues you see the view of it from two sides, one from the majority of the people in Maycomb and one from Scouts father, Atticus. Atticus is several times accused of being a \\""niggerlover\\"", but he tells his children not to bother about it. Atticus is my own favourite characters because he has got a character, he has everything under control and keeps \\""cool\\"" all the time.

A time and place very alien to most of us in the modern world. At the center of the story is Scout, a fiesty young tomboy, just old enough to go to school. She has an older brother, Jem, and the two of them get into all sorts of scrapes.

The town is rampant with racism, and Atticus has his work cut out for him. Not because the accused is guilty, but because it's likely that the 12 white men sitting on the jury will convict him even if he's innocent.<br />Lee's mastery is shown when the two plot strands come together in a spectacular way, resulting in danger for the Finch family and the man Atticus has sworn to defend.<br />Sadly, this Pulitzer Prize winner was the only novel Lee ever wrote.",2000-10-09

Harper Lee's semi autobiographical Pulitzer Prize winner is a superb account of bigotry and injustice set in 1930's Alabama  as viewed through the eyes of children.<br />The hero of this moral fable is  lawyer Atticus Finch, who sets the small town of Maycomb ablaze with  controversy when he agrees to defend Tom Robinson, a crippled Negro who is  accused of raping a white woman.<br />But this isn't just a story about Tom  Robinson.  It's also a coming of age story, a story which blatantly  illustrates the fact that we learn something new every day, and that we  must never judge situations or people by appearances.  Tom Robinson, a  simple, hardworking Negro, is judged by the colour of his skin, and by the  oft held assumption that ALL Negroes lie, that ALL Negroes are evil and  dangerous, that no white woman is safe around a Negro male.  And Boo  Radley, the subject of decades long gossip and innuendo, is judged by the  children - Jem and Scout Finch and Dill Harris - as being a bogeyman, a  malevolent being who has dedicated his life to the pursuit of evil.  Yet,  unbeknown to them, he is their secret benefactor, and someday he shall  literally save their lives.<br />Disappointingly, this is Harper Lee's only  novel.  But then, any follow up to this superlative effort would surely  have been inferior.  It's hard to believe that Lee was an adult when she  wrote this - her ability to describe the world and its idiosyncracies as  seen through the unjaded, uncynical perspective of a child is one of the  most memorable and enduring pieces of literature ever penned, provoking  thoughts in the reader like &quot;What is truth?&quot; and &quot;What is  just and right?&quot;",2000-08-29

The novel also presents a somewhat optimistic view of white  Southerners that was somewhat unusual at the time the novel appeared. The  story indicates there are good human beings like Atticus Finch everywhere,  even in the midst of a corrupt society. Even those who do wrong, the novel  goes on to suggest, often act out of ignorance and weakness rather than a  deliberate impulse to hurt others.<br />Another theme of the novel is the  transition from innocence to experience. At the beginning of the story  Scout's world is limited to the boundaries of her immediate neighborhood.  She feels safe and secure, and totally confident that the way things are  done in her home is not just the right way, but the only way. The arrival  of Dill, who comes from a broken home and has lived in another state, gives  Scout her first hint of a variety of experiences beyond her narrow  horizons. Then, on her first day of school, she begins to discover that not  everyone agrees that the way things are done in Maycomb, Alabama, is  necessarily correct. She also learns that sometimes it is necessary to  compromise in order to get along. Even though Scout's teacher's ideas about  how to teach reading may be wrong, Scout must respect the teacher's  authority. Her own father advises her to ignore the teacher's ban on  reading at home, but to pretend to go along with the teacher's methods  while in the classroom. This kind of social hypocrisy is new to Scout, and  she is surprised to hear her very moral father advocating it.<br />Related to  the theme of innocence and experience is the novel's suggestion that  innocent children can often see large moral issues more clearly than  adults. Scout, Jem, and Dill never waver in their horror at the injustice  done to Tom Robinson. The adults in the story, however, see all the  complexities of the situationto the point of being blinded to the central  issue of right and wrong. However much Scout may grow through her exposure  to new experiences, one hopes that she will never lose her childlike  undertaking of justice. In the view of this novel's author, justice is a  simple concept. To recognize the difference between justice and injustice  does not take any special degree of wisdom or sophistication. In fact, the  learned members of the community--such as the judge and prosecutor--and the  proudly religious Baptists who are spectators at the trial are, willingly  or not, allied with the machinery of injustice.",2000-08-20

It takes place in a small Alabama town of Maycomb, with a three year journey through the life of a 8 year old girl named Scout Finch, her brother Jem and her father  Atticus.  Atticus Finch is a trial lawyer representing a young black man  accused of raping a white woman.  The entire story is told through the eyes  of a child who describes the event leading up to her brother's arm being  broken as the book begins it's course.  There is an incredible blend of  characters throughout this story including the mysterious town boogeyman  `Boo Radley'.    All of the stories events surround the trial their  father is involved in, and how he stands by his principles for a man he  knows to be innocent despite the ugly side of generalized racial predjudice  he is forced to endure as he takes on this case.  The children are soon  caught up in series of events they do not fully understand as a result of  this.    'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a brilliant literary work that  explores the conscienceness of innocence in a little southern girl with the  triumphant heart of an adventurer.  Harper Lee delivers a timeless novel  about truth and honesty that is gracefully forged with the undying  instruments of intrigue and heroism.    Although it is set in the  1930's in Alabama, it could very well translate itself to almost any modern  American city at any period in history with it's magnificent depth and  beauty.    Atticus is a true patriot of ethics and morality as he  stands firm on the principles of truth,  despite the vicious recoil he  endures in his journey.  A novel of profound impact on the heart and soul,  Harper Lee created an incredible and unforgettable novel that deserves to  be re-read generation to generation for its timeless example of fatherhood,  honesty and justice.  When I first read this book I knew that I had  read a work of something more than a mere tale about a lazy Southern town.   I was holding in my handstrue beauty written by a literary master.

Who gets married? Does anyone kiss? Are there passages of deep romance? No, no, no... none of that. Try instead family love.<br /><br />Atticus is the kind of single dad we need to see more of in this generation. He cares for his children so much that he protects them from the fires of his grown-up life of representing an innocent man. He protects them from the full impact of his neighbor's lies. He shows them how to love them, even though he knows his neighbors hate him and the love of fellow man he represents.<br /><br />If all Atticus, the father, did, was love the innocent man, he would be doing a good thing, but he demonstrates love and allows dignity (when possible) for the ones persecuting the innocent. He shows he is a big man, and his children mimic this sense of understanding.<br /><br />Deeply rooted in the memories of his children, the story has a gentle subtext of growing up. You can almost taste the lemonade of the porch and smell the flowers in nearby gardens.<br /><br />Lee's power as an author here is that she does let her statements about humanity overtake the story. Rather, she lets the story tell the story, and she just writes down what happened in her imagination.<br /><br />Her characters are not paste-up Southern children or adults, but complex characters all of us relate to (even me up here near Chicago!).

Every time I would look at them and say &quot;It looks so boring, though!&quot; It wasn't until this year for a school assignment, that I read it. I could  have killed myself for not reading it earlier. This book is anything but  boring. It is  a fantastic novel that I will read over and over.    Jeremy(Jem) and Jean Louise(Scout) Finch are brother and sister and they  live in the county of Maycomb in Alabama. The story takes place in the  1930s. At this time, there was a lot of discrimination towards black  people. People also discriminate poor whites, to whom they reffered to as  white trash. One family that was considered white trash was the Ewell  family. Bob Ewell was the father of 8 children. Since thy had no mother,  19-year-old Mayella Violet Ewell, the oldest child, served as a mother. A  black man named Tom Robinson, who worked in fields near the Ewell  household, had to pass by the house every day. Being lonely, Mayella  started making advances towards Tom. This was totally against all code. It  was unimaginable for a white and black to do anything with each other.  Ashamed of what she had done, Mayella went to the court and accused Tom of  molesting her. Atticus Finch, the father of Jem and Scout, is the lawyer  who defends Tom. Every one is against him because of this. Sure enough, Tom  and Atticus lose the trial. But Bob Ewell is planning revenge on Atticus  anyway, because Atticus had exposed him as a liar in the courtroom. What  Bob ends up doing is extremely scary.    This book touched me very much. In  my opinion, i would say Atticus is my favorite character. The lessons he  teaches to Scout and Jem about right and wrong, and how peaceful and kind  he is to everyone is just amazing. Atticus is a great man, and I respect  him very much even though he is make-believe. I have only one more thing to  say.

The most memorable moment in the book, and my  favorite, is when the main character, Scout, realizes the truth about a  character she has had a false opinion of for a long time.

To Kill a Mockingbird was a good book. It was about three Children Jem, Scout, and Dill who were on a mission to encounter Boo Radley. Boo was a man who lived in Maycomb County  and has not been seen in years. Throughout the book a major disturbance  occurs in Maycomb and there is a big trial. At the end of the book, the  children finally come in contact with Boo Radley. This book was good  because it taught four lessons: courage, growing up, education, and  prejudice. Throughout the book, there are many different times which  courage is shown. One example is when Jem lost his pants at the Radley's  and he went back to get his pants off the fence. This took a lot of courage  for Jem. The theme of growing up was shown most often thoughout the novel.  Some examples are: Scout turns down a fight for her very first time, Jem  learns to be respectful in church, and Scouts tells her uncle how to treat  kids. The theme or education was taught when the kids father, Atticus,  taught them not to judge people until you have got into their skin. This is  something that many people in the world fail to do. Finally prejudice  occured many times in the novel. There was an incident at the Radleys and  someone was in the their backyard and automatically Nate Radley thought it  was a black man. Another time of prejudice is when Scout wants to play with  Jem and Dill, Jem doesn't want her to because she is a girl and also  because of her age. These are a few times inwhich prejudice occured  throught the novel. All these themes were easy to relate to and this made  the book even more interesting.  To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful story  that portrays everyday occurences.",2000-05-26

Again and again over the intervening decades since have I pulled down my hard-bound  copy to read in whole or in part on a rainy afternoon because of its sheer  drawing power. In today's complex world one tends to lose perspective as to  how explosive, provocative, and sensational the issues of cross-race rape  was in the early 1960s when Miss Lee's novel was originally published. Yet  despite the sizzling if subdued sexual content and the divisive issues  surrounding the book, it quickly rose to best-seller status and easily  delivered the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for Harper Lee with this, her  first novel.<br />  It is probably the character of Atticus Finch who  deserves most of the credit for the novel's enduring popularity. Seldom has  such a quietly heroic figure been so favorably and memorably described in  such loving detail in an American novel as is fortyish Atticus Finch, the  highly principled and somewhat befuddled widower-lawyer trying his level  best to raise his two young children alone in the midst of the deep South  during the early years of the Depression. As daughter Scout remembers,  there was little that Atticus couldn't charm or talk his way out of. And,  as played by Gregory Peck in the memorable movie, this thoughtful, moral,  and courageous man became a model of modern American manhood for all who  read or watched his story unfold.<br />  Of course, the other characters  are also lovingly and carefully drawn and described, and the way in which  the importance and relevance of the mockingbird parable is sown at a number  of different levels with a number of different characters is also one of  the enduring treasures  found within the pages of this book. Whether  considering Tom Robinson, Boo Radley, Scout, Jem, or Atticus himself, we  all come to better understand the ways in which all the individuals'  stories and fate are intricately and inextricably interwoven with each  other and into the fabric of a particular time and place.<br />  Thus, we  see the degree to which Atticus  relies and depends on their black  governess, and the degree to which he is concerned for her welfare as well.  On the other hand, we watch as  Bob Ewell acts despicably to mistreat  people of color. There are volumes of wisdom herein regarding the treatment  of human beings and the problems associated with trying to live in any  particular place at any specific time.

Atticus said it best: &quot;you don't really know someone until you walk around in their shoes.&quot; I think this quote was a very significant part of the book.

If only everyone would read it, and truly understand, identify with and 'learn' from the story and the message found  within its pages, I believe the world would be a happier and peaceful place  to live in for all.<br />&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a 'rich' and  compelling story set in 1930s Alabama. It's a story about the purity and  innocence of children, about justice (or the lack of it), racism,  hypocrisy, human compassion, trust and love (all issues we can relate to)  told from the experiences and perspectives of a small child (Scout).<br />The  writing is wonderfully beautiful and charming. You'll fall in love with the  depth of inner beauty and innocence found in the 2 children (Jem, and  especially his sister, Scout/Jean Louis). You'll find yourself rooting  passionately for their father (Atticus Finch) to win his case when he  chooses to defend a black man on trial for life, despite much social  pressure on Finch to give up the case and veiled threats against him and  his family. Watch for the part where Finch cross-examines the  &quot;victim&quot; (a white girl who accuses the black man of rape) and  during his closing speech. Both are excellent courtroom drama (the best  I've come across) and they also reveal a lot of the (ugly) truth behind the  case.<br />Atticus Finch's sense of justice, perseverence and fighting spirit  (the way he stood his ground) are most inspiring and touching. Based on  what he believes in, he knows he must &quot;do the right thing&quot;, all  the more since he has 2 young children who look up to him for guidance on  the difference between right and wrong.<br />I also loved reading the precious  scenes involving Atticus and his children - Atticus is really a  &quot;beautiful&quot; person and a perfect role-model of a dad - at once  loving and understanding and patience and fair.<br />And what about the  mysterious recluse, Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley who hasn't left his house  in years and has become some sort of a terrifying yet intriguing  &quot;legend&quot; among the neighbourhood children? Is he really the  madman or evil spirit that the children believe him to be?<br />This book (and  another winner, &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; by Frank McCourt) should rank  highly in everyone's list of must-reads.

Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch,  Harper Lee explores with rich humor and honesty the irrationality of adult  attitudes toward race and class. The conscience of a town based in  prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the quiet heroism of one  man's struggle for justice. Atticus is an excellent example of someone who  is ahead of their time, he has an unbelievably large amount of love in his  heart, and his children really are his life. He is very up front and honest  with Jem and Scout, always treating them as equals. By looking for the good  qualities within even the poorest or socially marginalized of his clients,  Atticus Finch personifies the true goal of his profession, which is to  provide each person with equal standing and dignity before a jury of his  abilities.           It explores human behavior, kindness and cruelty,  innocence and guilt love and hate.

Touching controversial issues such as racism in a  so-called democratic society this novel has become one piece  that many people regardless of age group, can relate to.  To Kill A  Mockingbird deals with the theme of racism in a prejudice society.  The  novels' main conflict is trial against a black man for allegedly raping  Mayella Ewell, s lonely white girl from the suburbs of Maycomb.  The  dilemma of the book is to prove whether or not a fair trial can take place  in the South.  The novel is narrated through the eyes of Scout, a seven  year old tomboy who is unknown to the prejudice society she is part of.   Her father, Atticus Finch is a well-respected lawyer.  Aside, from the  theme of prejudice, in this highly acclaimed novel, the author creates a  mysterious character that is the center of distraction for the vast  majority of Maycomb citizens; Boo Radley.  Both Scout and her brother Jem  become fascinated about this mysterious person and refuse to give up until  they discover his true identity, and because of this they end up getting  into a series of problems.  Regardless of age groups, this novel  touches people in a personal level that anyone can feel reflected on.

Boo is commonly known by the people of the  community as an antisocial untouchable. The kids of maycomb have never seen  Boo, so they make it their duty to seek him and introduce him to their  world. However, the trial of a crippled black man shifts the excitement  from the hibernating Boo, to the most controversial trial Maycomb has ever  witnessed. Tom Robinson a poor black man was accused of raping Mayella  Ewell who carries the poor reputation of her family. Tom becomes a victim  of the unbalanced justice scale of early twentieth century Alabama. The  trial glorifies the word of a crooked white person over the honesty of Tom  Robinson.

I actually had not heard much about To Kill a Mockingbird before I  read it, due to the fact that I tend to read nineteenth century literature,  and I started this book with a fairly open mind.  As cliche as this story  is, I thought that the plot had great potential for making a powerful book,  but Harper Lee's approach to writing it seemed a mismatch.  The powerful  theme served merely as a backdrop to a far less interesting story. There  are points at which one can fairly hear the plot wheezing as it is being  choked by Lee's attempts at cuteness and nostalgia.  The descriptive  passages were rather crude, and at times the language became practically  unintelligable.  Am I the only person who despises dialect?  There are two  things I thought of that can affect the way people criticize this book.  One of these is fear of disliking a book at the risk of being labeled a  Philistine. The other of these is which books are read immediately before  reading a book.  The latter affected me in particular, as I was reading  Madame Bovary alongside this book.

Harper Lee shows prejudice with the trial of a black man in which a white lawyer, Atticus Finch (the  father of young Scout, from whom which the story is told), is appointed to  defend him. Tom Robinson, the black man being falsely accused of rape, and  the Finches' neighbor, Boo Radley (an outcast of the community and very  taciturn in nature) are the symbols in this novel.  In the beginning/middle  of the novel Atticus tells Scout and Jem (his children) never to shoot a  mockingbird. Jem questions why not and Atticus replies not to because  mockingbirds never harm any one or thing, they just sing beautiful music.  When Tom Robinson is convicted, it is symbolic of killing a mockingbird.  Later in the novel, Boo Radley must kill Bob Ewell because he tried to kill  Scout and Jem, however, the sheriff (Heck Tate) makes up a story that Bob  fell on his knife, because if he told the community that Boo had killed  him, it would have thrown Boo into the limelight and would have also been  like killing a mockingbird.

In the first chapter of the book there is a description of the town  as being a weary, tired old town. People mope around going from store to  store at a slow pace. Everything is moving in a very slow pace and it is  very signifigant to how much symbolism occurs between chapter 10 and 1.

It says in chapter 10 that he is moving in a straight line, not a  care in the world where he is going. He is moving slow and steadily. He is  dangerous because he is infected with this virus.

I think that those of us who have read the book love the fact that narrator as well as one of the main characters is a little girl named Scout.  The  story is seen through her eyes and this makes the book more enjoyable as  well as easy to understand.  Sometimes she's funny and witty, other times  she's very intelligent and through out the story she's just trying to  understand the world around her.   Atticus Finch, Scouts father, is a  wonderful character because he shows his love and respect for  his children  as well as for everyone else.  He shows he has moral values rather than  social ones when he defends a black man being accused of having raped a  white women.  This shows that no matter how bad or how wrong things are,  there is always someone willing to stand up for what they believe, and that  there are good people  in the world.  This took alot of courage on  Atticus's part considering they lived in the South.  And although he loves  both his children dearly, he seems to have a special bond with Scout.  He  teaches her that a person doesn't really understand someone else until  they've walked in their shoes.  That is excellent advice no matter who you  are or how old.  What is also highly interesting, and  very original to  this story, is the mystery behind Boo Radley.  He's one of the main  characters in the story yet he never really appears in person.  In the  first half of the story the children talk so much about him that they make  jokes and at some points make him sound like a monster, not knowing that in  the end he's the one who saves the day. I believe that what I love the most  of this story is that it isn't a love story or an action/adventure kind of  story, but one that tells the experiences that all of us can learn from.  They're experiences we see happen sometime in our lives.  Justice and  injustice, prejudice in the society we live in, and courage and respect for  other human beings.  Anyone and everyone can relate and learn from this  story, this is why it's a wonderful story for anyone to enjoy.",1999-12-01

Unfortunately, you never write another one. How could Harper Lee have possibly followed this up? Anything she wrote after \\""To Kill A Mockingbird\\"" would have been anticlimax. So on the strength of one book, Harper Lee will be forever remembered for writing one of the greatest books of the contemporary American literature.<br /><br />I picked up this book late one night the year it was first published, after my mom had been raving about the book for weeks, trying to get me to read it. Well, what the heck, the late movie was boring that evening... next thing I knew, it was two o'clock in the morning and I had just turned the final page on what was the most magical reading experience of my entire life.<br /><br />From the opening line, \\""When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow...\\"" Lee hooks the reader with a deceptively simple story of a Southern family and a Southern town caught up in a cataclysmic moral crisis, and keeps us enthralled till the very last word. Lee's writing style is that of the storyteller who mesmerizes her audience telling a tale so simple, yet so compelling, that you never want it to end. Her narrator is Scout Finch, a delightfully devilish little tomboy who sees her world through the all-observant eyes of childhood. Scout is one of the most enchanting characters in modern American fiction. She's bright, funny, totally real; there's nothing contrived about her. She's someone we all knew in first or second grade, or wished we'd known. Scout lives with her brother Jem, four years her senior, her lawyer father Atticus, and their housekeeper Calpurnia, in a sleepy Alabama town where everybody knows or is related to everybody else. Lee spends the first half of the book drawing us into the life of the town and the Finch family, Scout's hilarious and problematic adjustment to first grade, and brings us into the mystery surrounding the notorious-yet-never-seen Boo Radley. The second half of the book is about the moral crisis that tears the town apart.<br /><br />Lee has a way of saying a lot by saying very little, and her laconic statement that the people of Maycomb had recently been told they had nothing to fear but fear itself sets the time squarely in 1933, the depths of the Great Depression. Times were bad for most people in small Southern towns; they were especially bad for poor whites and all blacks. In 1933 the South was rigidly segregated down every possible line, and a white woman's false accusation of rape was enough to get a black man hanged. When Mayella Ewell accuses Tom Robinson of rape, in the eyes of most of the white populace, Tom has been tried, convicted and is awaiting execution. Judge Taylor disagrees, and asks Atticus to take Tom's case.<br /><br />In Atticus Finch, Lee created what would eventually grow to be the best-loved character in all American fiction. Atticus is a loving but not a doting father, an able lawyer, and an individual of towering integrity. He takes Tom's case because he knows Mayella's accusation is full of holes, and he believes Tom is as deserving of good legal representation as anyone else. Atticus knows better than anyone else how his decision to take the case will affect his children, but as he explains to Scout, who wonders how Atticus can be right if everybody else thinks he's wrong, if he didn't take the case, he could never hold his head up in front of his children again.<br /><br />Atticus knows he's fighting a losing battle, but deep inside himself he believes he may lose a battle but win a bigger war. The chapters describing Tom Robinson's trial and Atticus's defense are some of the most powerful in American fiction. On of the most moving passages in the book is at the end of the trial when the town's black minister tells Scout to \\""Stand up. Your father's passin'.\\""<br /><br />Along with Scout and Atticus Finch, Lee created a host of other memorable characters. Jem is the perfect big brother for Scout, sometimes protective, sometimes antagonistic, always encouraging. Lee only needs to pen a few details about Calpurnia to bring her vividly to life: \\""She was all angles and bones; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard.\\"" Calpurnia isn't the stereotypical Mammy of Tara; she's a no-nonsense maid and housekeeper who dishes out ample amounts of love and old-fashioned discipline in equal doses. And Miss Maudie Atkinson is a delightful creation; funny, ditzy, and wise all at once. Anyone would want her for their next-door neighbor.<br /><br />The two major villains, Bob Ewell and his daughter Mayella, are compelling characters in their own right. Bob Ewell is quintessential white trash, spending the family's relief money on moonshine while his children go hungry. But poor Mayella is as much victim as villain; we can't help but feel for her, ostracized and isolated, knowing only her father's physical violence and sexual abuse; her attempted seduction of Tom Robinson is a desperate cry for love and affection. But, as Lee reminds us, it's all for naught. Tom Robinson was dead the minute Mayella, caught in the act of attempted seduction by her father, opened her mouth and screamed.<br /><br />After the highlight of the trial, the book might have slid into anticlimax, but it's Lee's genius that she keeps the tension heightened after the trial and its denouement, through Ewell's drunken, insane attack on Atticus through his children, and their rescue by Boo Radley. And after everything she, her family, and the town have been through, what has Scout learned from all this? Pretty much what Atticus set out to teach her all along: that you can't get to know a person until you put on his shoes and walk around in them.<br /><br />I turned the final page of \\""To Kill A Mockingbird\\"", unbelieving that it had come to an end. I opened the front cover and immediately started reading it over again from page one. The book had that much of an effect on me. One doesn't just read this book; one experiences it.

So I'm more interested in describing what makes the book work.<br />Humour is one crucial factor.  By never succumbing to the  pretentious grandiosity that has plagued many a novelist since the form's  rise to prominence in the Victoria era, To Kill a Mockingbird achieves an  endearing relationship with its reader.  Every character is vivid, with  strengths and faults, and Lee achieves that difficult amalgam in  first-person narratives presented as recollections:  A mixture of an  adult's rhetorical power and a child's keen, curious eye.  The language is  fresh and unburdened by the moralizing which frequently cripples prose  narrative (especially books which deal with sensitive issues as this one  does).<br />Lee made a perfect choice in personalizing a socio-political  issue.  To Kill a Mockingbird is predominantly the coming-of-age story of  Jem and Scout Finch, and the themes of racism, injustice, conservatism and  the Depression are all the better served this way.  Issues do not come  alive except through the living, breathing experience of their participants  and Scout Finch's particular take on the events of this book only makes  those events gain in moral strength, not diminish.<br />Boo Radley, Atticus  Finch, Scout and Jem, Miss Maudie...the characters of this book have  achieved an iconic status rare in modern literature.  And it has achieved  this not by making them Nietzschean uebermenschen, but by entering into  their lives with fair, enthusiastic frankness.  And to end off, this is one  of only a handful of truly successful negotiations between the dramatic  (eg. theatre, screenwriting) and the narrative (eg. prose narrative,  filmmaking, folk storysongs) I can think of.  Lee's dialogue is sharp  enough, and immediate enough, that even if we pared this book down to just  its dialogue and situations, we'd end up with a remarkably powerful play.   As it stands now, it's a truly successful crossover, its dramatic  situations and character interactions every bit as convincing as the  engrossing power of its storytelling.<br />I am all for challenging the canons  of all artistic forms, but this one is about as close to perfect as I've  seen a novel come, ranking right up there with the greatest of the greats.   It has its weak chinks -- Atticus' misunderstanding of Heck Tate's point in  the second-last chapter is befuddling, for example, but these are so minute  that to dwell on them would be overkill.  Thematically worthy to be called  an American epic, this book never forgets the personal in light of the  social.  We should be grateful it was ever written.",1999-05-27

It is the tragic story of unjustice in a small Southern town which is full of prejudices and mysterious secrets which are uncovered by the  heroine, Scout, her brother Jem and their friend Dill.  This is a wonderful  coming-of-age story, though it does not talk of the passage from  adolescence to adulthood, but shows how an 8 year old girl loses her  innocence.  We would strongly reccomend this book for young adults.  The  end succinctly wraps up the story, and the way the author puts the climax  in the beginning is wonderfully clever. In conclusion, this book shows so  much of our life, and we reccomend adolescents read this book because of  the insights of life it presents to the reader.

After reading Nancy Drew books and candy striper novels, and becoming a &quot;hooked&quot; reader, I finally understood what reading was all about when I discovered Harper Lee.  How disappointed I was to learn that Ms. Lee wrote one masterpiece and then no more.

Atticus is a gentle soul, and a compassionate and tender father to his motherless children.  He calmly explains to Scout, and by his deeds demonstrates to her, that an individual can't capitulate to the violence and ignorance that surrounds him or her because then that person becomes part of the problem and not part of the solution.

There's nothing great about To Kill a Mockingbird.  Nothing at all.  It is is an American classic simply because America felt the need to call a book about itself a classic, and this happened along, blindly, stupidly, to be that book.  From a technical standpoint, there's nothing wrong--Lee writes coherently, and although her book shifts topic suddenly, without cause or warning, she tends to stay on topic.  There are so many American writers that came shortly before Lee or were actually contemporaries of her that do not get recognition despite their far superior work.  Henry Miller offered a REAL view of America, ugliness and all, and it wasn't what Americans were looking for, to the point that they banned his writing.  Someone should ban Lee's book because we tell our students that this is an ideal of literature whereas it is really just a regular old novel, like anything else the paperback racks had to offer at the time.

I just started analyzing this book with my high school english class about a month ago. we havent even finished going over the whole thing yet. But, I have never had one thing teach me so much about being a good person. This story, about two small children Jem Finch and Scout Finch living in the judgemental town of Maycomb in Alabama shows us how dangerous a thing racism is, how judging a person by someone elses opinion can turn an innocent man into a recluse and what it means to be a good christian and parent. These people of Maycomb County called themselves Christian when they were living a lie to god, other people and themselves. The setting takes place during the great depression when people had no jobs but to gossip about other people. An example of this is the neighborhood recluse Boo Radley. Many people started saying bad things about him and his past that most of the town was believing a lie, that he was a criminal. Because of this, Boo decides to stay away from people. Harper Lee decides to show the reader how bad people and lies are, and she refers to Boo as a mockingbird, which is an animal that does not bother anyone and is reclusive. The people go on asking themselves why Boo is reclusive when they are the reasons. Another example of people living a lie is the law case of a black man Tom Robinson. He is wrongly accused of raping a girl.The whole town knows who the real raper is , but they continue to lie to themselves that the black man is the wrong-doer.In the middle of this is Atticus Finch, the father of Jem and Scout. He is the only one who brings up his children the right way, which is how he lives his life. Just think for yourself. Maycomb County believes in the lie of racism and that it is the right thing to believe in only because that is how they were taught. But, Atticus is different. He is introspective like his children and his children like ! him. His parents and probably told him that he should judge a person on the color of their skin, but he thought it out realized that racism is the sin. People may not have agreed with him and some of these people tried to kill him for his  beliefs. But, Atticus had what not many people had and what his children picked up from him, this was courage. He decided to stick up for what he believed in. Atticus is the ideal Man-of-god, the ideal parent and the ideal person. Harper Lee probably used his character in this book, hoping to teach her readers how to be an Atticus Finch, Jem Finch, or a Scout. The moral of this book is to think about what you are taught and think for yourself and stick up for what you think is right.  Infact, you dont have to read this masterpiece because I gave you reasons to, but because it is your duty to. After all, what do I know, I am just fifteen and this is maybe my favorite book yet and there are probably many more greater books than this one. What I do know is that this book made me  like to read and To Kill A Mockingird makes me want to be a better person and keep on searching for those greater books.",1998-04-03

It helps me remember how to exist in the modern world as a moral person.  This reaffirmation of justice, honesty, integrity and compassion in the daily lives of common American people involved with uncommon events may be why To Kill A Mockingbird won the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.  Harper Lee has an intelligence about people -- or at least about the best of us as we'd like to remember ourselves.  Is our daily America as decent as this book recalls?  Probably not.  So, it isn't accurate literature exactly. But it IS an exceptional moral story: how David slew Goliath, how Atticus and Scout beat a thinly-disguised KKK by insisting on the integrity of the accused and accuser alike.  It works because it's seen through the eyes of an adult woman remembering everything as a precocious 6-year-old tomboy.  Atticus Finch represents a sure and convincing morality, almost larger than life.  He's able to shoot a rabid dog straight through the forehead in order to save the street from it, just in time.  He's almost mythic. But mythology works sometimes, especially when transported to a dusty Alabama town to explicate terrible mundane events which are, all things considered, equally mythic in force.  Racism IS a dragon. The Klan IS a monster.  They're just mundane, so we don't recognize them as such. An innocent African-American is accused of an unspeakable crime because the &quot;victim,&quot; and then the town, needs it.  Finch systematically dismantles the accusations based on simple evidence which no one in his right mind could disbelieve.    The story becomes a matter of basic decency and justice because Scout, the girl, has the ingenuousness and moral bewilderment of a smart 6-year-old who sees no racial lines, and who thus is able to express the fundaments which adults either ignore or have become blinded to.  Mythologizing her father allows us to understand that, in some things, the fundaments are valid.  In some things justice is, in fact, this simple--an deliberate act of integrity and will.

It is the story of a white family living in the rural south during the 1930s. This family is faced with many challenges in such a short span of time. The reader gets to see how the family grows both together and apart and also how it copes with its day to day life. This book deals with such issues as racism, neighborhood togetherness and the bonds that either grow or are lost between parents and children as they grow together. This book focuses on the strength of the family institution and it gives insight into the way we (and the world at large) were. Life has definitely changed since this book was written 37 years ago, but in the same respect, it has changed many people who have read it. This is that people for ages to come will both love and enjoy.",1997-10-04

I can't quite say that, since I loved reading before I was given this book by a neighbor when I was about 13 or so (around 8th or 9th grade if I remember correctly).<br /> I remember reading it in two days and starting it all over again when I finished it. This was the book that made me take note of writing for what it was rather than for just telling a story. I remember repeating certain phrases that I liked over and over. I also recall that I was reluctant to return it to my neighbor and took some of my paper route money to buy myself a copy which became dog eared over the years. I have since lost it, but have replaced it with a couple of hard cover copies. In any case, I remember being taken with the simplicity of the way Scout told the story and drew me in. The tormenting of Boo Radley by Jem, Scout, and Dill reminded me of similar escapades my friends and I would pull on the Radley-like folks in our own neighborhood...you know, everyone had that &quot;one house&quot; in the neighborhood that had a scary reputation. I'm sure that added greatly to my enjoyment of the book.<br /> I also remember the quiet dignity of Atticus and how, inadvertently, Harper Lee taught us all a lesson in tolerance, love, and especially the meaning of family. This book still makes an impression on me nearly thirty years later, and it is the one book I re-read twice a year without fail just for pure enjoyment and to spark those memories of when I first read it. I have yet to read anything like it. My deepest gratitude to Harper Lee for this wonderful book!",1997-10-02

At first, the book is rather slow, but carries a good story line; however, once you get past the first hundred pages, things really speed up and you can't put it down. What's more, it is definitely identifiable with reality; everything the kids did is certainly in the realm of what kids do every day.

I love the way that Harper Lee twists small details in with larger ones, all the while, keeping the reader's attention. Though the subject of racial discrimination is a tough subject, she deals with it in the easiest way possible. Though the story of Scout, Jem and Dill always seems to be in the spotlight, the reader gets more of a handle on Atticus's story.

Her reactions and facial expressions kind of put YOU in the story and then when you ask her questions she's secrative about it and wont tell you it's all creepy.  One day I couldn't stand it any longer I didn't sleep at all. I just stayed up and finished the book. it was FABULOUS.  I was on top of the world.  Thinking all day, daydreaming, putting myself in Scout's position or Jem's or Boo's or Miss Maudie's- I was everyone.  It was also great to have been &quot;let in &quot; on my teachers secret-the end and I never tell secrets so that was fun and.  (once everyone finished the book she showed us the movie, it was touching but the book changes your life with a MUCH deeper meaning) I found a deeper meaning to my almost 14 years.  I knew that who I was and what I stand for should be known.  I liked finally knowing the story but then... Mrs. Sewell told us that &quot;the trial&quot; (read the book to find out...) never happened TO Harper Lee - even though it really did happen.  Then what was the purpose? how much really happened? the anger could be there, but the situations???????  I was confused. But Harper must have really met Boo and talked extensively or else why would she live the way she does? (if this is Harper reading this then I am a great fan or yours, yet still confused and I wish you'd email me, I wouldn't tell anyone, secreta are always honored...)  if Dill was Truman Capote then what happened and Jem died? what about the older sister, she wasn't in the story....  This book is deep, but it keeps you hanging.  WHAT HAPPENED?  it is THE BEST book I've ever read and the unit my teacher did was pretty cool.The characters are so deep that they make you think more than any other book that I've ever read.

It is an act  of quiet desperation in the face of overwhelming injustice,  prejudice, racism and bigotry.  It is all they can give to him  but it speaks volumes.
