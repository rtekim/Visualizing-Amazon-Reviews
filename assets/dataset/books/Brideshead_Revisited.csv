I keep hoping the protagonists will choose personal happiness, but they never do.<br /><br />[WARNING: TONS OF SPOILERS!] This novel features a trio of perhaps the most charismatic and tragic protagonists in literary history: gay, tormented Sebestian Flyte, his beautiful sister Julia, and family friend Charles Ryder. In Age of Innocence, it’s the rigid constructs of society that eventually bruise and break the characters. In this outing, Catholicism is the wall against which each character, one after another, tragically dashes themselves: first, Sebestian’s father, trapped by Catholicism in a loveless marriage; next, his heartbreakingly fragile son Sebastian, trying desperately to repress his homosexuality; after that Julia, who tragically discovers her love for Charles after she has married another; and finally Charles who, though a non-believer, is swept up by the tide of Marchmont tragedy and himself broken.<br /><br />All of which would have you thinking of this story as rampantly anti-Catholic, except that Waugh was himself a convert to Catholicism and, accordingly, ensures that each character, though deprived of earthly happiness, ultimately rescues their hope of ultimate grace. Even Charles, the skeptic and non-believer, has by the end of the tale begun to pray. Which, I suppose, is meant to provide consolation of a sort, though not enough to keep me from tearing up throughout the final chapters.<br /><br />Provided you can deal with all the tragedy, there’s much in this novel to admire and, yes, to love. The writing is gorgeous. The evocation of period is brilliant. And each of the three protagonists is hauntingly memorable – especially Sebestian,whose transformation from dazzlingly charismatic schoolboy to gentle but ravaged alcoholic adulthood is wholly riveting.<br /><br />You know how some books don’t seem particularly notable at the time but as the years pass you come gradually to comprehend their wisdom and insight? I have a feeling this is going to be one of those books, and that Waugh’s insights into faith, duty, loyalty, morality, beauty, friendship and love are destined to haunt me for years to come.",2015-06-01

Treasure it’s foreignness. Admire all that sparkles within.<br /><br />As an American, I seriously felt like I needed a translation. For example, what American would know that a “scout” is a domestic worker at Oxford University? Plus the lives of the rich, landed aristocracy of the 1920s and 30s feels so otherworldly to me—the servants, the brutal and constant sarcasm, the expectations of conduct. However, once I accepted that this book is truly a book of an exotic land in a foreign language, I settled down in it and found it a delightfully good read.<br /><br />In this novel, Charles Ryder finds himself mixed up in the Flyte family for two decades, from his college years into middle life. The family has so many destructive issues of which the narrator continues to be drawn into.<br /><br />This isn’t the kind of book that I ever wanted to pick up and dive into; but once I was reading it, I found the pages would fly by. I had to get used to stumbling over the Britishisms. At some point, I figured out that it was useless looking them all up, so I would skip over them and wait to catch up a paragraph later.<br /><br />For most of the book, I found the text alternatives between lengthy conversations and poetical descriptions, neither of which were overly floral or difficult to get through. In fact, I would say the language is possibly the best part of this book. The conversations aren’t realistic, but they do convey a great deal about the characters and viewpoints. Descriptions are absolutely beautiful and do the heavy lifting in this story. The plot is mediocre and seems beside the point.<br /><br />The point of this book, in fact, seems to be the re-creation of the world these people live in. The reader is drawn into it, the sarcasm, the loneliness, the family responsibilities. It’s quite fascinating. Brideshead is the grounds that the book mostly takes place on, and Waugh has such an evocative way of bringing the placeto life.<br /><br />The characters are hideous in a way only a great author can make them. If you want to love the characters in a book, you might struggle with this one. All the characters will have parts of them you will like or find amusing at least, but they all have terribly flawed issues as well. However, their tragedy and complexity make for a good read.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes from the book: “Charm is the great English blight. It does not exist outside these damp islands. It spots and kills anything it touches. It kills love; it kills art; I greatly fear, my dear Charles, it has killed you.” (pg. 313)<br /><br />I recommend this easily to any book group or any individual interested in classics. If you happen to be an Anglophile, this is a must-read for you.",2015-03-05

It was, pointedly, his Catholic novel—a loaded topic which he treats with cunning and stellar indelicacy.  (Of a pious young girl, her brother remarks, “She made a novena for her pig.”)  And the sting is certainly still there—the pages in which Anthony Blanche practices conversational vivisection on the Flyte family are some of the best vicious gossip in literature.  But the tone and style were a departure, both in its sensuous detailing of luxury and in its voluptuously plaintive mood.  The storyline and the prose—of a young middle class artist who gets entangled in the tragedies of an aristocratic Catholic family—were derided by some as snobbish and vulgar, and there’s a good deal of truth in both charges.  And BRIDESHEAD doesn’t cohere—I’m never sure that the book ends up meaning what Waugh wanted it to mean.  But there’s a livid surcharge of emotion in the book—of the delight of privileged youth, which one can certainly still smell around Oxford, and of the embittering wounds of loss, as friendship, love and the hope of belonging go slowly, gangrenously wrong.  And it has a great, surreal cast of characters.  As for the theme of property, I cannot pick up BRIDESHEAD without remembering an autumnal walk onto the grounds of Castle Howard in Yorkshire (the model for Brideshead), with its great gates like trumpet voluntaries, the noble dome of its crypt—and getting a harrowing whiff of how the prospect of owning such a property could throw a life out of its proper orbit.<br /><br />Glenn Shea, from Glenn's Book Notes, at www.bookbarnniantic.com",2015-02-24

Its themes are beautifully worked out, its characters so vivid and memorable, its plot and pacing a masterclass. The story rolls out like a skein of silk across the pages; a thing of both natural and created beauty. Its tone is plangent - a lament for things past - while its scope is epic; paradise lost, the nature of art and beauty, love and loyalty.<br />Why is it, then, that it leaves me with such a bitter taste in my mouth?<br />Waugh states in his preface that the book was written to illustrate the operation of divine grace upon mankind, which I understand to mean God’s free and unconditional gift of love to us, who don’t deserve it, but which Waugh understands, it seems, quite differently.<br />Waugh himself was a late convert to Catholicism and Charles Ryder, his narrator and protagonist, from being a sceptical agnostic at the beginning, has also converted by the end of the novel.  (This is only hinted at, but is unarguably the case. In the prologue Hooper, Ryder’s adjutant, refers to Catholics as ‘your lot.’ Retrospectively, Charles tells us; ‘I have come to accept claims which then I never troubled to examine, and to accept the supernatural as the real.’ Finally, in the epilogue, Charles visits the reopened Chapel at Brideshead and says a prayer; ‘an ancient, newly-learned form of words.’)<br />That Waugh intends to say something about Catholicism is obvious, even without his preface; why else choose to make the Flyte family Catholic? Charles and Sebastian have some interesting but inconclusive debates about the latter’s faith, which, clearly, troubles him a great deal. Likewise, towards the end of the book, Catholicism becomes an issue for the dying Lord Marchmain, whether he should, or should not, be attended by a priest. Rex’s status as a divorc&eacute; and, later, the extra marital relationship which exists between Charles and Julia are both significant to the plot because of the attitude of the Catholic Church. Attendance (and non-attendance) at Mass are often mentioned. Catholicism is indelible in the fabric of the novel; the comings and goings, the attitudes, opportunities and challenges of the characters, of whom by far the majority are Catholic. All of the Flyte family including the estranged Lord Marchmain are Catholics whether practicing or not. Also Anthony Blanche, Cara, Mr Samgrass, Nanny and the household staff. Catholicism is an integral part of the novel.<br />If Waugh wished to cast a positive light upon Catholicism, to explain it, even to promote it, he goes an odd way about it; to me, the nature of Catholicism remains a mystery. Nowhere in the novel is a coherent explanation of its tenets and practices even adequately, let alone persuasively, offered. Despite Charles’ best endeavours to understand it, and his fairly penetrating questions, no-one is able to throw any light on the subject.  ‘There were four of you,’ he says, while Lord Marchmain lies dying. ‘Cara didn’t know the first thing about it, and may or may not have believed it; you knew a bit and didn’t believe a word; Cordelia knew about as much and believed it madly; only Bridey knew and believed and I thought he made a pretty poor show when it came to explaining.’<br />And unfortunately the image presented of Catholicism and Catholics by the novel is so very unappealing. Lady Marchmain is stiff and cold, and invidiously controlling. Bridey is pompous, judgemental and ridiculous. The priest charged with admitting Rex to the church compares him to an imbecile just because he is unchurched. Mr Samgrass wilfully misleads Lady Marchmain about the events of his trip to Morocco with Sebastian, and has an eye very unpleasantly on his own comforts in the matter of food, drink and accommodation. Poor Sebastian and Julia are deeply conflicted about their faith and one cannot but feel for them; Sebastian is unable to make Charles understand that his problem stems from the fact that while intellectually he accepts the teachings of the church, in his heart he rebels against them. Charles unwittingly puts his finger on it when he says; ‘If you can believe all that and you don’t want to be good, where’s the difficulty about your religion?’ Sebastian’s reply is; ‘If you can’t see, you can’t.’ Meaning, of course, that IS the difficulty. Julia’s soliloquy by the fountain is an out-pouring of guilt and angst which has its source in the nursery. She says; ‘I can’t quite seem to get all that sort of thing out of my mind - Death, Judgement, Heaven, Hell, Nanny Hawkins and the catechism.’ Neither of them is able to square the circle in terms of their personal lives, desires and values against the over-arching dictates of the Catholic Church, and both rebel.<br />But the nature of God’s grace as portrayed in this novel is that rebellion is futile; neither Sebastian, Julia nor Lord Marchmain, or even Charles himself, escapes it in the end. And I use that word quite advisedly. There seems to be no escape; that ‘unseen hook and invisible thread’ is inexorable, so at last Sebastian settles in his monastery, Julia sacrifices love for Love, even Lord Marchmain makes the sign of the cross and Charles himself comes to bend the knee. Any  ‘alternative goodness to His,’ as Julia describes it, seems not to be allowed, and all love, it is implied - Lord and Lady Marchmain’s, Charles and Sebastian’s, Charles and Julia’s, Charles and the army’s - will curdle and die, or be demanded as a sacrifice, until only God’s love remains. Then He will twitch upon the thread and bring them back to himself. Rather than a prodigal child returning freely to its father, the image conjured up for me the picture of a whipped dog being brought to heel on a leash, and it rankled.<br />There seems to be no free will, no choice, certainly no joy. Julia’s sacrifice is hard and bitter and seemed to me to be a terrible and unnecessary waste which, surely, no loving father would demand. While it might be comforting to know that after everything, in extremis whether physical, emotional or psychological, ‘underneath are the everlasting arms,’ it seems cruel indeed if those very arms are the ones which systematically carry away any other bulwark of comfort, love and joy which life might offer. ‘Eschew life and seek God,’ this novel seems to say, ‘there is no point in doing otherwise; he will have you in the end.’ What a bleak, fatalistic message!<br />‘Live life,’ say I, ‘and there you will find God.’Charles understand that his problem stems from the fact that while intellectually he accepts the teachings of the church, in his heart he rebels against them.

Evelyn Waugh was himself middle class and the product of a third-rate boarding school (Lancing) and second-rate Oxford college (Hertford), but he longed to be an English aristocrat, and the touching sincerity with which he conjures up that world and its values makes the novel the 20th century's premier document of British class neurosis. Waugh betrays himself and his background in his earnestness and the overwrought aesthetics in this novel. So many British reactionaries like Waugh were middle class and tormented by self-loathing, too supine to embrace reason, too infected by literary lechery, aesthetics and vanity to fully comprehend the sheer hollowness of their adopted worldview.

In fact, by the end of the novel I was actually grateful that Hitler was just off-stage, sharpening The Wehrmacht and readying the iron bombs for dropping on all these self-centered, self-indulgent, wearisome British zombies.<br /><br />Structurally the novel is perfect and if we were ever to wake up one sunny morning mysteriously conferred by God with the gift of being an editor of literature, Brideshead Revisited would be the new War and Peace. Everything from the wonderful framing of the novel with Charles 'revisiting' the estate, to the beautiful language Waugh writes so effortlessly in, to even the subject matter of the ending of the British aristocracy - it's all quite 'perfect'.<br /><br />Trouble is, (nearly) everyone in the novel is a priggish snob, a bitter, hateful gossip, a languid zombie of pre-war 'British-ness', a dying relic of a hemorrhaging Empire, and all around a collection of nasty specimens exhibiting the worst of privileged humanity. Worse still, the main character, Charles, floats about through life with a detached aire that would make a ghost jealous.<br /><br />In Wuthering Heights, Emily Brontë managed to write at great length how people can be cruel and nasty and wicked to each other and yet by the end of her masterpiece we loved everyone (even if there was a sense of Stockholm Syndrome to it all). Here, Waugh does not endear the characters to us in any way - we do not care much about them by the end any more than we began the novel with. They change very little.<br /><br />In Remains Of The Day, Kazuo Ishiguro gave us a similar setting of England on the verge of war with Hitler and an old manor home coming to terms with the new world order. Yet where Ishiguro manages to make a stuffy, detached, brutally professional and dedicated main character (Mr. Stevens) and his master, the naive and member of the old guarde Lord Darlington, Waugh in this novel just shows us how awful these people all are - how out of touch, how insulated they were and how lucky we all are to have had Hitler drop all his bombs on them for half a decade.<br /><br />Not that showing us the bad side of humanity is a bad thing and I most certainly do not believe art needs to be life-affirming and every novel needs to be populated with a Tolstoy's 'Levin', however, when we have nothing to sympathize with, not even a shred of decency, then we run the risk of not caring anymore what the author's intent was (to show the final decay of British upper-class) and just keep turning the pages because the language is beautiful and hoping someone gets a bomb dropped on their head.<br /><br />Not that it's all terrible. Sebastian verges on becoming a wonderful character, but he's under utilized and Waugh seems to be counting on the fact that we'll all just be smart enough to see how Sebastian just wants to have fun and not be around miserable people all day long (his family). Yet by the end we have become Sebastian - drunk with Waugh's language and twisted up on the doorstep of a North African monastery in a puddle of our own urine and vomit, the faint flicker of life somewhere in our out-of-focus eyes that lets the monks know we're not quite dead yet and that they should attempt to kindly revive our stupor.<br /><br />Anyway, Sebastian is written out of the book just past the half-way point and isn't brought up enough again for us to care really what ever may have actually come of him. I think Waugh just forgot to follow the thread of Sebastian being the only likable character in the novel and decided to see how far he could depress the reader.<br /><br />I might have been able to forgive Waugh a bit more had he been a bit more on-the-nose with his theme of class and 'caste', but he even wrote the modern equivalent of an every-man, Hooper, as a dolt. By the end we just have Charles as a middle manager in the Army, dissatisfied and at the same time almost happy that he,partially, ruined an entire family's life.<br /><br />Oh, sure, it's not a bad thing that these types of people are no longer around. The fall of this class of British society is no bad thing for humanity and it serves as a reminder to the rest of us 'plebs' how much contempt the upper-classes truly and surely have for us living in the gutter of Rome. We should never forget that there are few noble Levin's and Pierre's in the world because most of the well-to-do are the banks in Steinbeck's 'Grapes of Wrath' or the cheat who tries to blame a crime on a poor prostitute such as in 'Crime in Punishment'. The real world is full of contemptible characters who are glad they 'got theirs' and will make damn sure you don't see any of it and want you to just go away and not muck up the pretty scenery with your dirty, filthy, unwashed, and unclean odors.<br /><br />And maybe I wanted Waugh to just go all the way - maybe I wanted him to side with the upper classes and not leave us with the final note of gleeful revenge at seeing the end come so painfully to those who deserved it. Maybe if Waugh had been full on conservative and not hinted at the popular liberalness I keep harping on about, then I would have not felt so terrible about all this and could pass it off as a 'Ayn Rand-ian' warning to the well read about how the rich and conservative want to rule the world.<br /><br />Alas, that's not to be. Waugh leaves us with an unclear image of his true intent, paints an ugly picture with beautiful paint, and manages to just depress the hell out of me.<br /><br />Finally, for as beautifully written as the novel is, I already feel like I've forgotten most of it.

The fall of this class of British society is no bad thing for humanity and it serves as a reminder to the rest of us 'plebs' how much contempt the upper-classes truly and surely have for us living in the gutter of Rome. We should never forget that there are few noble Levin's and Pierre's in the world because most of the well-to-do are the banks in Steinbeck's 'Grapes of Wrath' or the cheat who tries to blame a crime on a poor prostitute such as in 'Crime in Punishment'. The real world is full of contemptible characters who are glad they 'got theirs' and will make damn sure you don't see any of it and want you to just go away and not muck up the pretty scenery with your dirty, filthy, unwashed, and unclean odors.<br /><br />And maybe I wanted Waugh to just go all the way - maybe I wanted him to side with the upper classes and not leave us with the final note of gleeful revenge at seeing the end come so painfully to those who deserved it. Maybe if Waugh had been full on conservative and not hinted at the popular liberalness I keep harping on about, then I would have not felt so terrible about all this and could pass it off as a 'Ayn Rand-ian' warning to the well read about how the rich and conservative want to rule the world.<br /><br />Alas, that's not to be. Waugh leaves us with an unclear image of his true intent, paints an ugly picture with beautiful paint, and manages to just depress the hell out of me.<br /><br />Finally, for as beautifully written as the novel is, I already feel like I've forgotten most of it.

I'm not sure how I arrived at that conclusion, but when I first opened it up and started reading, I was surprised to find the initial action in 1944 and the flashback to the 1920s rather than two decades earlier. Never mind; I kept reading, and I'm so glad I did. While it initially started slowly, this is a book meant to be savored, and its storytelling is what writing ought to be.<br /><br />The novel centers around the friendship between Charles Ryder, our narrator, and Sebastian Flyte, an eccentric friend he had at Oxford. The two were inseparable during their school days, and, despite Sebastian's propensity for drinking too much and being quite flighty, he was charming enough to draw everyone near to him and Charles was no exception. Through school holidays spent at Sebastian's family's home, Brideshead, Charles gets to know the rest of the Flytes, from the pious Lady Marchmain to the heir, Lord Brideshead, to sisters Julia and the endearing Cordelia. The two travel through Europe together, meeting Lord Marchmain and his mistress in Venice, and experiencing the world in all of its 1920s glory. But when the friendship ends, Sebastian finds himself alone.<br /><br />Years go by, and he has an unexpected meeting with Julia Flyte aboard a ship crossing from New York to London. Now a successful painter with a wife and two children, Charles has made something of himself, while Sebastian is still an alcoholic, living wherever his whim takes him. The two reconnect, and Charles once again comes under the spell of the Flyte family home. But the family is different, now; Lady Marchmain is ill, there is talk of war, and the children are scattered, as often happens in adulthood.<br /><br />Initially, I thought this story a strange combination of both &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; and &#34;A Separate Peace&#34;, but upon finishing it, it really is neither one. Yes, the halcyon days of the interwar period are painted, and yes, there are many references (and chapters devoted) to the life of a student. But this is the story of a time and a place, the loss of Youth and innocence, of friendship and love, the story of how the world changed when World War II began, and how the old ways of life died along with them. I found myself enamored with Waugh's prose, and I am definitely looking forward to sampling more of his canon.",2014-04-25

I have now done so, and have little to add to the perceptive reviews that others have written.  It is a terrific read, with  sharp social observation of a particular segment of society, and (with the exception of a couple of too literary  long speeches) with brilliant dialogues.  In fact the essentials of the story are captured in the dialogues, in which the characters best reveal themselves and which are rather better than narrative descriptions, which I thought were occasionally over-written with some clever but forced analogies.<br /><br />The book is generally held to be a roman &agrave; clef, with Sebastian inspired by Hugh Lygon, Julia by  his sister Mary, Cordelia by his sister Dorothy, Bridie their eldest brother by Lord Elmley etc, while Charles Ryder was Waugh himself.  This had made me expect that the story line of the novel would be along the lines of Paula Byrne's book, and the early part - about Oxford and about Charles' relationship with the self-destructive Hugh, and about Brideshead/Madresfield Court - is indeed  quite autobiographical.  But after that the story line diverges greatly from Waugh's biography.  The  Marchmains/Lygons are Roman Catholic, not High Anglicans, and that is essential to the novel and to its philosophy.  The marriage between Charles and his wife Celia is utterly unlike either of Waugh's two marriages.  His relationship with Julia, as a lover rather than kind of brother, started much later and after instead of before her unhappy marriage (to Rex Mottram, who is supposed to be a portrait of Brendan Bracken, instead of to a Russian Prince).  One of the highlights for me was how the ghastly Rex Mottram, determined to marry Julia, cynically converted  to Catholicism, only to find they would have to marry in a Protestant ceremony after all.  Bridie is specifically said to have failed to get into Parliament, whereas Elmley was an MP.<br /><br />Like one of the previous reviewers, I felt that second - \\""Julia\\"" - part of the novel was not quite as satisfying as the first - \\""Sebastian\\"" - part, though the passages about the dying of Lord Marchmont, is profoundly moving.

The one constant was that comedy usually predominated and was usually the best part (Scoop, for example, bogs down when Waugh abandons satirizing the media about halfway through and concentrates on a lackluster romantic subplot).<br /><br />Reading his books in chronological order, I'd formed the impression that Waugh was a brilliant satirist who longed to be serious but that wasn't playing to his strengths. Brideshead Revisited contradicts that view. It has a few brilliant comic moments (especially in the scenes with Charles Ryder's father) but drama is what carries the story and carries it very well indeed.<br /><br />Brideshead Revisited is the story of Ryder's involvement with the aristocratic Marchmain family from his college days at Oxford just after World War I and into the mid-1930s, when he loses contact. It is told in flashback by a Ryder serving as an officer during World War II who happens to get stationed at Brideshead, the Marchmain family's ancestral home that Ryder knows so well. Over the years, Ryder had become close in turn to just about every member of the Marchmain family, somewhat of a problem since they were often at odds with each other and rather possessive about his affections.<br /><br />The one constant is how the family's traditional Catholicism affects each family member, whether they lead outwardly pious lives or not. Americans of today may not appreciate just how big a deal being Catholic would have been at that time in England. While overt persecution had ceased centuries earlier following the Glorious Revolution, a very real discrimination against Catholics remained, especially when it came to public life and the peerage.<br /><br />Waugh was a recent convert to Catholicism when he wrote Brideshead Revisited and he approaches the subject with thegusto of a convert. That led him to relatively minor missteps like sentimentalizing the priest who gives Lord Marchmain extreme unction at the end, and trying to spin profundities out of banalities, as he tries to do in the concluding scene.<br /><br />Still, this is a fabulous novel filled with memorable characters both major and minor, vividly described scenes and a strong narrative arc, all rendered by Waugh's fluid command of the language. His best novel to that point (I can't speak for the subsequent ones since I haven't read them yet)? Undoubtedly, even if it is uncharacteristically serious.",2013-10-17

With all the ardor of The Convert, Waugh can find solace and virtue in self-abnegation, self-loathing, self-absorption and self-righteousness. Like so many \\""catholic\\"" artist's he finds ecstasy as a target for arrows and begrudges Jesus his crown of thorns (that would look SO much better on me!). To know even a little bit about EW's dissipated Oxford days can't help but make one wonder why is it always the debauched who become holier-than-thou.<br /><br />First, the self-righteous Lady Marchmain. The personification of sanctimonious prig, whom a husband and son Sebastian despise with an all-consuming hatred that sends one into exile and the other into his cups. Second, self-absorption: the rather prurient voyeur, Charles Ryder, who latches himself on to Sebastian and insinuates himself into the Marchmain clan, rather like the author himself, with the Lygon family at Madresfield. He starts as ingenue and becomes a rather jaded, vacuous hack, loyal to his ambition but keenly aware he is second rate. One doesn't object at all to Waugh's  ending for him and can't help but wonder how much of himself, Evelyn saw in Charles.  Surely the climbing part.<br /><br /> Next, self-loathing.  Poor Sebastian Flyte!  Allmost certainly homosexual he is crushed by his sexual inclination, Catholicism and a mother who could teach Torquemada a trick or two. Like the martyr of the arrows, this Sebastian is repeatedly pierced but by his own self-disgust. Last, representing  self-abnegation is the beautiful sister Julia. Having made a mistake marrying the wrong man and then having  strayed, apparently by the lights of Waugh's religion she must, as punishment be eternally miserable.  With this view of religion it is little wonder Lord Marchmain bolted and Sebastian finds solace in brandy.  They are a chilling charivari, this lot.<br /><br />One doesn't have to embrace Waugh's punitive Catholicism to admire his writing, though.  There is something admirable and very modern about an author who can craft a character like Charles Ryder.  He is basically extremely unlikable--the true anti-hero, and perfect chanticleer of aristocratic decline.  Charles practically rubs his hand with glee at the prospet of elbowing out the plodding Bridey.  But Waugh is too good a writer to look away from the inevitable outcome of the Marchmains, much as he might despair their loss.  And one is tempted to lament the end of Lord Marchmain, and a passing era, til we see what a nasty bastard a marquis near death can be.  In Lady Marchmain he might well have gotten what he deserved  Waugh's depiction of him, and other minor<br />characters such as Bridey, Anthony Blanche, Charles' father and the dreadful Beryl are little gems and great small achievements in themselves.<br /><br />Brideshead Revisited has been called Waugh's masterpiece andi think that is so.

He strings together smoothly a series of vignettes that move the characters through roughly 20 years from the 1920's to the 1940's. The specter of war is woven into the backdrop by a series of concise snippets of political dialogue between characters overlapping other events in the same room. It's just enough and given when it was written it's quite prescient.<br /><br />Waugh says in the forward that this is a story about exploring Grace on the imperfect people that occupy his book. Ryder is atheist. The Flytes run the gamut from resistance and rejection of religion to needing and wanting it in their lives and they all evolve in their views which I suspect is quite natural.

The cast of characters compels one to continue reading, as each shares his or her particular quirks and enhances some sense of how people are both worthy and flawed.

Suffice it to say that the book deals with at least three major themes -- love (and more specifically, how people fall out of love, or realize they were never really in love), family (and more specifically, how our well-meaning relations can damage or stunt us), and religion (both the specific role of Catholics in early-20th-century Britain and the general challenge that people of faith have in dealing with those who don't, plus the shadow that one's childhood faith casts over the lives of even those people who think they have totally abandoned religiosity). Secondary themes include the passing of aristocratic mores in the years after WWI, and a [[ASIN:0394701801 Buddenbrooks]]-like consideration of the fall of a wealthy family. At a couple of points in the story, I expected that last point might develop into the book's major theme, but it never does, and I am pleased by this, as it would have been relatively cliche, and the book as written never is.<br /><br />Waugh's language is sometimes challenging, using academic or architectural words I've never seen before and may never see again (what is the significance of one's \\""oak\\"" at Oxford?). However, on balance he picks his words perfectly. I was particularly fond of \\""crapulous\\"" and \\""bondieuserie\\"", words that really should make a comeback.<br /><br />Not all the characters are entirely realistic; the main characters are given some caricatures to play off of, and some of these (Rox Mottram for example) become the source of the book's funniest passages.<br /><br />Some passages are phrased so perfectly, so clear in communicating complex ideas without ever leaving the narrator's voice. I am thinking in particular of his groping for an analogy to describe English social relationships in terms of the interaction of subatomic particles, and also the narrator's recurring dream of a looming avalanche (the significance of which I can not mention without spoiling a significant plot point).r, on balance he picks his words perfectly.

This was the novel which made me fall deeply in love with literature and is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful books ever written.<br /><br />The novel begins when Charles Ryder is billeted on an unknown country estate during WWII, which turns out to be Brideshead, a place he knew well. The story then unfolds of his meeting of the young Lord Sebastian Flyte at Oxford and his coming under the spell of the Marchmain family and of Brideshead itself. As the young promise of Sebastian declines into drink, Charles leaves Oxford and becomes an architectural artist, before finding that his relations with the family are not yet over when he meets Sebastian's sister Julia on a ship returning from New York.<br /><br />Evelyn Waugh looks at many themes in this novel: love, loss, family and religion all intertwine and interweave in this story. Of course, Waugh was a committed convert to the Catholic faith and religion lies heavily on virtually every page of this book. Divorce, conversion and the pressure of religion are all present. Lord Marchmain, living abroad with his mistress, does not enter the novel for some time, but he haunts the pages and his eventual return to Brideshead and death scene are a pivotal part of the book. This can be criticised for being about the aristocracy (Waugh himself wrote it during the war during a time of restrictions and privations and the glamour and wealth of a past life pour from the pages) or not being relevant, but the themes of disappointment, love, religion and loss are things we have all experienced.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading more about the family and house on which Evelyn Waugh based \\""Brideshead Revisited\\"" you might enjoy [[ASIN:B006TQVE8Q Mad World: Evelyn Waugh and the Secrets of Brideshead]] (there is a kindle version, but it does not contain the illustrations available in the book version).

The story was, in fact, about what you would expect from such a period piece if you've read other novels of the period such as Atonement and Howard's End.<br /><br />At its heart, the story revolves around a somewhat aimless young man, Charles Ryder, without much of a family foundation, set adrift at Oxford College during the period between the World Wars.  While there, he meets a young member of the aristocracy and essentially adopts the young man's family as his own.  The story follows the relationships and history of the eccentric Flyte family in three different threads, first during the Second World War and then in flashbacks to the early 20s and then the late 30s.  In doing so, the author injects numerous comments and allusions to the Roman Catholic faith (and apostasy) of his characters.<br /><br />While I have read several works by Dickens, I found much of the florid prose in this story more difficult to appreciate, perhaps because it is written in the patois of the early 20th century English aristocracy.  When the story was following a timeline narrative, I can say that I enjoyed it quite a bit.  However there were many periods of little or no activity, in which I felt the momentum of the novel grind to a halt.<br /><br />Certainly, the culture and practices of the English aristocracy, viewed by modern standards, seem ridiculous and silly to us today.  This novel focuses on the period when deterioration of the rigid English class structure accelerated and essentially shattered with the outbreak of the Second World War.  It bears noting, however, that it was exactly this seemingly ridiculous culture that resulted in a tiny island nation ruling over one of the greatest empires ever known.  \\""From whom much is given, much is expected\\"", could have been the byword of 19th century English society, and while much was certainly given, expectations were not found wanting.were not found wanting.",2012-09-24

A couple of decades after that role accelerated his breakthrough, he returns to the novel. He enters smoothly into a wide range of male and female, young and old, foreign and English characters. He responds with the same elegant wit and sensitive emotion which made his Random House audiobook of \\""Lolita\\"" similarly praiseworthy. (I reviewed this too.)<br /><br />As for the book, does it hold up? I'd read it in college after I'd seen the series, and I found that Evelyn Waugh, as a Catholic convert, was still handling the shift in his own sensibility delicately. The coming of age of the younger members of the family Charles meets, and how they face the demands of maturity in morals, responsibilities, and economic demands in a changing society serves as the theme for what on the surface, and at first, feels a lighter comedy of manners. Gradually, the defense of the Church's teachings emerges, unsurprisingly and steadily, to counter in the hapless Marchmains the Oxford-London smart set with their own daring morals, or their lack, among the privileged class of post-WWI Britain, and as WWII arrives again. The framing device of Ryder's return to Brideshead, the title of the work, gives added depth in the cyclical brutality within the fate of the ancestral manse, symbolically and spiritually, and some of the last pages in this novel provide its most moving passages.<br /><br />Perhaps the reading betters the book.

Since it was published in 1944, I'm writing with the assumption that I'm the one late to the party and many of you lovers of literary fiction have probably either read it already or are super familiar with the plot.  So, if not, stop.  Now.  You've been warned.    Confession time:  Until a few years ago, I thought Evelyn Waugh's name was pronounced Eh-vah-lynn Wow, and that he was a she.  I wish I were kidding.  One of the great epic fails in book snobbery.  Regardless, every time I passed the \\""W\\"" section at the bookstore or library, I'd see her his titles with their gorgeous cover art...but upon reading the back summary and coming to the words \\""set against the backdrop of World War II,\\"" I usually put the book back on the shelf.  With few exceptions, I love historical fiction...as long as the book doesn't take place entirely in the trenches. Before you yell, please note that I'm sure my bias has kept me from discovering a great many tomes. I just have a hard time getting into several hundred pages of war and destruction and blood and death and politics and guns and moral turmoil and brotherly bonding/bromance, etc.  I know full well that there are many notable works of literature (mostly by dead white dudes) with fabulous plot lines and gorgeous prose (A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls...well, just Hemingway in general, War and Peace,  All Quiet on the Western Front), and I'm sure I'll slug through a few of them for the general-betterment-of-self/expansion-of-overall-cultural-literacy at some point...it's just not my favorite.    BUT a few months ago, I DVR'd (yes, I still DVR) Brideshead Revisited when it aired on Ovation and fell in love with the story.  And when Waugh's name came up again in the Mitford biography I'm reading (he was friends with Nancy Mitford and is said to have takeninspiration from the Mitford kids among other Bright Young Things of the era), I read up on him and decided to add this and Vile Bodies to my 30-before-30 literary bucket list.    Brideshead Revisited is, in fact, set in the 1920s, 30s and 40s, the years leading up to World War II, though only the prologue takes us anywhere near the trenches (phew!).  Charles Ryder, our narrator, and his unit are stationed at Brideshead, which serves as catalyst for Charles to reflect on how he came to know the house and to tell the story of his two great loves who grew up there: Sebastian and Julia Flyte.    I know there's debate as to whether the nature of the deep relationship between Charles and Sebastian had a sexual aspect....in my opinion, Charles' love for Sebastian (and vice versa) was absolutely romantic (see the definition), in terms of their relationship being imbued with their desire for adventure and their idealization of and total dependence on the other, often steeped in a reality exclusively their own.  Also, I think they probably had sex at one point. Or at more than one point.  Or at least fooled around.  It was an era of experimentation (booze!  jazz!), and it wasn't super uncommon for young men to experiment that way in boarding school or when away at college, or because they were, in fact, gay or bisexual, etc.  (n.b. Tom Mitford, brother of Nancy Mitford et al, for example, is thought to have had at least one homosexual relationship in his youth and according to this Telegraph UK article, Waugh may or may not have been involved at one point with a gentlemen who has been said to have inspired Sebastian). I loved the contrast Waugh was able to strike between the love shared by Charles and Sebastian and the love shared by Charles and Julia.  Charles and Sebastian's relationship imploded because, in a way, they preferred to cling to the idealized version of the other (it's hard to live in the reality where the person you feel closest to is an alcoholic with somefairly deep emotional problems.  I think, in many ways, Sebastian's flight to Morocco, etc. occurred out of love for Charles, to protect Charles from destructive force he knew he had become.  Maybe on some level, Charles understood it as the gift of a unmarred, idyllic past, as he says on page 203 \\""These memories, which are my life--for we possess nothing certainly except the past--were always with me.\\"").  Charles and Julia's romance imploded because they failed to move beyond the reality of their situation (i.e. Julia's deeply entrenched Catholic belief system was a tad restrictive, and then there was her nagging insistence upon avoiding eternal damnation...a bit prohibitive to a divorce/second marriage to another divorcee who also happens to be an agnostic).  It's a book as much about denial as it is about desire, and how both can be acts of love.    My favorite character by far was Cordelia, Sebastian Flyte's young sister, and I died laughing at scene where she talks Catholicism with Charles upon their first meeting:    \\""[Cordelia says] 'D'you know, if you weren't an agnostic, I should ask you for five shillings to buy a black god-daughter.'  [Charles] 'Nothing will surprise me about your religion.'  [Cordelia] 'It's a new thing a missionary priest started last term.  You send five bob to some nuns in Africa and they christen a baby and name her after you.  I've got six black Cordelias already.  Isn't it lovely?' \\""(p. 82)    She's so precocious, and fancies herself to be so forward thinking, yet she acts almost as a mirror against which Waugh is able to reflect back everything he saw wrong with the Catholic church at the time (and possibly with religion in general, but given that he and I never discussed the matter, this is purely conjecture), but she's also such a likable character due to her youth and wit.  Through Cordelia especially, Waugh shows us how no person is only one thing; that no thing is either solely good or bad.    Waugh was such a dynamic and flexible writer.  He possessed such a gift for characterization and voice! I wish I had even a fraction of his stylistic dexterity!  (Just a fraction! I'm not greedy!)  Even at the most tragic moments, Waugh's wit (I can't help noting these observational zingers as evocative of Oscar Wilde at his best in The Picture of Dorian Gray) shines through.  For example, when Lord Marchmain is dying, his mistress Cara says this of his condition:  \\""His heart; some long word at the heart.  He is dying of a long word.\\""  (p. 288)    Rubric rating: 8.5.

What exactly that means the reader will have to discern himself, but the result is a mixture of both the organic and the contrived.  But what else would one expect from a divine plan?<br /><br />Evelyn Waugh writes dialogue effortlessly; the characters of Sebastian, Brideshead, Edward Ryder, Julia, Lord Marchmain, Anthony Blanche--all of them speak with an ease that in part is due to their upperclass status but moreso to the skill of Waugh.  His ear for voices is remarkable--I never read a line of dialogue that I didn't hear in my head with a distinct, vital voice.<br /><br />If I chose to complain (which I have not), my only issue would be with the topic of divine grace.  The few moments that struck me as false were a certain character's guilt-speech concerning the death of Christ, a later moment from the same character on the possibility of living outside of God's grace, and a specific scene of witnessing someone crossing himself which I will not further elaborate on, for the sake of spoilers.  At these moments the machinery of grace showed itself, and by this I mean the machinery of the plot.

There is still satire and humor in this text, but it is dryer and less central to the plot than in some of his previous novels. Also, unlike his previous efforts the characters in this novel are not caricature, but well developed human individuals. It is also rather episodic in plot and we follow the characters from their late teens to early thirties, a rather formative time in one's life.<br /> I think that reading this novel will be a fuller experience if the reader has a religious background, and some personal experience with faith. But it is not necessary to enjoying (and getting something) from the text.<br />The novel deals with a close circle of friends, and depicts how they all in their own ways come to God. I feel that Mr. Waugh was trying to write a great novel of faith (my personal opinion) and to that extent I think he left religion, and the Catholic Church in particular, open to some criticism, which I don't think was his intent. However, one could read the same sections that I think expose the weakness of the church, and see them as plot details that strengthen the argument for faith. Waugh was much smarter than I, and I am going to assume that was his goal. What makes the text so layered is that one can read the novel and see a great testament to God and Church, and others can read it and just as easily argue for the destructive power of religion on individuals.

Then I read it for its wonderful characterizations and dialogue and for the fascinating, to me, glimpses into the mores of pre-war England, as well as for its elegiac view of traditional English culture. (I also wondered frequently what, exactly, was going on between Charles and Sebastian!)    All of those aspects remain interesting, but this time I concentrated on the theme stated by Waugh himself in his preface--'the operation of divine grace on a group of diverse but closely connected characters'. I don't want to give away the plot because it's a good one. Left to myself, I would have guessed that the theme had to do with the many varieties of love, but can see, after re-reading the book, what Waugh meant to do. There are many varieties of love among the group of people who populate this story, and Waugh considers them all to be precursors, or 'forerunners' of love for their Christian god. Waugh himself, like many midcentury English intellectuals, was a convert to Roman Catholicism.    I certainly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the English novel. It's more serious and more philosophical than Waugh's satires but has its own charms.    This is Waugh's revised 1959 edition of the book originally written in 1944 during an army furlough. Critic Frank Kermode has written an introduction and there's a brief preface by Waugh for the new edition. Also included is an interesting chronology of Waugh's life, paralleled by corresponding literary and historical events. There's also a bibliography of his works.    This Knopf Everyman's Library hardcover edition is quite attractive, with shots from the movie tie-in on the dust jacket. I had one small complaint about the physical book--the inner margins are quite narrow.    A postscript--The main character, Charles, has two children, Caroline and John. His wife insists on calling the son Johnjohn, much to Charles's dismay. This is curious, no?     I received an advance review copy from the publisher.",2010-05-25

He made his bones in the types of movies I'd never had a desire to see, and I was never too impressed with his performances when he deigned to appear in movies I would watch.

His skill in differentiating characters ranks with the best, his vocal delivery approaches musical mellifluence, and his dramatic interpretation is perfection itself. Part of it may have to do with the fact that the source material is as near perfect a book as has ever been written; part may have to do with his having gained an understanding of the novel when he played in the miniseries.

It keeps enough of his humor to be read for enjoyment, but it certainly included other themes--religion, friendship, betrayal (classic soap-opera love stories).    But before you read it, you should be aware that Brideshead Revisited is really two books. The first half is about the narrator, Charles Ryder, and his relationship with Sebastian Flyte. After they meet in college (Sebastian gives Charles a hothouse full of flowers), they develop an extremely close, possibly homoerotic relationship. Sebastian introduces Charles to his family, and the whole thing begins to slowly fall apart in chapters that are painful to read.    The second half of the book is about Charles' relationship with Sebastian's sister, Julia. It could be said that this is more psychologically accurate than the first half of the book, as all of the characters' flaws are exposed in gory detail. However, it's simply less fun to read. One of the most important characters from the first half, who you will probably love as much as I did, simply disappears. The two halves of the book are very sloppily connected, as Waugh tries to change course too quickly.    With the movie coming out soon, it might be a good idea to read this book now.

A friend, devouring his ouvre voraciously, gave me this book in high school or college, and at the time I thought it very good. I recently reread it, however, spurred on by Thomas Howard's lively essay on it in The Night is Far Spent, a collection of Howardiana, mainly essays on literature.<br /><br />The second time around I was more aware of the construction, which seems to me somewhat different than the sort of savage satire Waugh was known for or the occasional dark comedy like The Loved One. I say that having read only a few novels and knowing little of the author's background. Waugh was early on the great champion of P.G. Wodehouse, whose light comedies of manners seem so different from his own novels, that I perhaps search for something of PGW in EW in my reading.<br /><br />This novel illustrates some of the pitfalls and challenges of writing in the first person, in that Captain Ryder talks somewhat differently than he thinks, with his part of a dialogue sometimes amounting to a mere sentence or even a word. Driving (reading)along that smooth road, as it were, one encounters a speed bump in the shift to the second sort of writing, which consists of descriptive passages, and to a third sort consisting of longer ruminations and reflection by Ryder on the present and past. As one reviewer put it, the story is told by indirection.<br /><br />This is Waugh's best known novel, largely due to the popular British mini-series made from it a few years back. It's also often said to be his only Catholic novel, but that means the main characters are Catholics (not Ryder) not that Waugh has some didactic purpose or hidden agenda in the writing.

According to what we know, Waugh had a few second thoughts about the present book.<br /><br />The story is really three stories that are separated in time which have been pieced together. It is set in post WWI England and it is about the protagonist and narrator Charles Ryder, a student at Oxford University college and his encounter with members of the Flyte family at Brideshead.

The three pieces or sub-plots are his relationship with Sebastian Flyte, then Julia Flyte his sister, and then finally Lord Marchmain, an Anglican, converted to his wife's religion which is Roman Catholicism.<br /><br />Each of the three sub-plots has a different slant to the story. The relation with Sebastian is similar to an Oscar Wilde situation, and the reader is left in doubt to the extent of the relationship. Is it physical or platonic? Also, the author brings in the subject of alcoholism.

The closing of the Second World War oddly enough filled Waugh with a whiff of hope that there may yet be a Grace that watches over us all: He wrote the book \\""to trace the workings of the Divine Purpose in a pagan world.\\"" Such a shift in metaphysical gears is noteworthy in that in his earlier books, Waugh saw religion only as a cover for hypocricy. Now in BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, Waugh continues to depict religion as a cover, but this time, it may obscure that for certain people, religion may have a base that provides ongoing faith, even if they lapse into faithless actions.     The novel opens with Captain Charles Ryder revisiting a mansion that in his youth he had often frequented, Brideshead. Except for the last few pages, the entire novel is a flashback that shows how Ryder enters the lives of the powerful Marchmain family. As Ryder interacts with them, he can see that they are a family in crisis, not the least of which is a failure to maintain a sustaining ethos that Waugh has railed at in all of his previous novels. The patriarch of the clan, Lord Marchmain, early in life found himself in religious confusion; he thought that by converting to Roman Catholicism, he might find inner peace. He did not help his cause by abandoning his wife and family to take a mistress in Italy. His four children, Sebastian, Brideshead, Julia, and Cordelia, have their own issues, many of which revolve upon either a too heavy or a too light emphasis on religion.     At first, Ryder has an idyllic existence in his youth as he becomes intertwined with the Marchmains. His friend Sebastian, is a hopeless alcoholic. Later in the novel's second half, Ryder marries, but begins an affair with Julia, which ends predictably unhappy when Julia refuses to divorce her husband and to marry Ryder because of religious restrictions. There is no one in the novel who is happy with the way that things have turned out.                                                                   Critics have tended to focus on the religious implications of the novel. A typical comment is that there are so many religious overtones at all, a surprising development considering the lack of same in Waugh's earlier canon. Further, many readers have confessed confusion as to the purpose of all this religion. Did Waugh intend it to be revered as a sustaining ethos or did he see religion as he did earlier, as yet another symbol of an irrelevant institution fit only for ridicule? The answer is both cryptic and troubling. If the search for values is limited to the sphere of mortality, then there can be no possibility of an ethos to sustain one when circumstances become dire. Waugh implies that it is only when one has faith that there is a realm of faith beyond the earthly walls of Marchmain castle, that life and death may have meaning, however terrible and terrifying that meaning may be.",2006-08-12

The first and last are in the \\""present\\"" while the middle two are in the \\""past.\\""  The middle two compose the bulk of the book.      SYNOPSIS. The first of them is apparently about an eccentric h*m*s*x**l alcoholic, Sebastian Flyte (I wrote that word that way to deceive the automatic censor).  It is mostly about how his alcoholism gets him kicked out of Oxford and how his family tries to get him dried up, without avail.  Ryder is in the background, but interacts with the other characters.    The second of them is apparently about the affair between Ryder and Flyte's sister Julia.  They both are unhappily married and decide to divorce their spouses and then marry one another.  However, after they are divorced but before they remarry (or something like that), Julia's father dies.  He had become a Catholic to marry his wife, but had been excommunicated later.  But, in his death throes, he made some gestures that might have indicated that he wanted to become a Catholic again.  The whole family (also Catholic), whether observant or not, is concerned about his soul.  They are therefore relieved when it seems he might have repented.  Ryder, seeing this, suddenly stops being a jaded agnostic and believes in God.  He and Julia decide not to marry after all, since Catholicism forbade remarriage unless the marriage was annulled by the Holy See.    The first and last parts are Ryder returning to the Flyte family house (known as Brideshead, it being at the head of the stream called Bride) years later.      EVALUATION. The dialogue is frequently scintillating and delightful.  The narration has some great phrases.  Take, for example, the metaphor, \\""thin bat's squeak of sexuality audible only to me,\\"" which refers to his reaction when a girl asks him to light a cigarette, apparently requiring him to put it in his mouth.  The narration, however, is obnoxious at times.  Waugh tried to use a physics metaphor without even describing the metaphor, pleading ignorance of physics.      The division of the book mostly into two separate stories is bad.  It disassociates parts of the story from one another, interrupting the narrative and one's identification with the characters.  In fact, the two halves seem like different novels.     The whole feel of the story of a dysfunctional English aristocratic family in the 1930s was warm and fuzzy.     Now for the book's purpose, which is supposedly to show divine grace.  Firstly, I do not like novels that try to demonstrate a proposition or teach a lesson.  Secondly, I do not like the proposition or lesson of this book.  Are we to believe that grace comes at certain times to certain persons for no given reason?  That seems quite odd.  The idea that one has lived his whole life one way can suddenly decide to change at the last minute is inexplicable.  Also, it seems that the book is saying that those raised Catholic cannot escape the faith.  That seems to deny the power of choice of the one taught.  I regard these theses as repugnant.",2005-01-14

I don't want to be of service to anyone or anything. I simply want to do my work as an artist.\\"" <br />Certainly nothing useful can be added to the abundant praise of Waugh's wonderful artistry in creating \\""Brideshead Revisited\\"", nor  in Lindsey-Hogg's skill in bringing the novel faithfully to life on the screen.  But we may wonder if Waugh lived up to the intent stated in his diary because \\""Brideshead Revisited\\""  seems at first acquaintance to be an unabashed effort to present religious faith in a serious positive light without the skepticism so often found in modern fiction.  Waugh strives to reach his goal through the delineation of his characters of whom Charles Ryder is masterfully portrayed by Jeremy Irons. We find Charles a rather cold, diffident, unsympathetically remote agnostic, and largely a foil for bringing the other characters to life in illustration of Waugh's chief agendas. <br />Waugh's biographer, Christopher Sykes who knew Waugh personally, characterized him as something of a snob from middle class origins who looked up to the aristocracy, and looking down on the lower classes did not hesitate to make people feel ill at ease with regard to their origins through a clever form of bullying.  We see this depicted by Waugh's reveling in the social gaffes on the voyage, and in the hair-cutting incident with Hooper and Charles contemptuous treatment of  him, but curiously in the end Hooper appears to rise cheerfully above such harassments.  Does Waugh see Hooper as too stupid and insensitive to know that he has been insulted, or of such inner strength that he makes his assailants look shabby by comparison?  Waugh is said to have despised the man he modeled Rex Mottram on, characterizing Mottram as a fraud marrying Julia for advantage. But Mottram also is revealed as a pragmatic success in a society bound by the questionableprohibitions of Catholic doctrine regarding marriage and divorce.     <br />Biographer Sykes, a Roman Catholic himself, wrote that Brideshead Revisited. \\""is solely addressed to believing Catholics and admirers of the Catholic Church.  The general reader is rather left in the cold.\\""  This is certainly evident in the story's climax at Marchmain's deathbed scene where Charles first argues vehemently against a priest administering the last rites but suddenly undergoes a totally surprising conversion at the dying man's sign of acceptance. Whether Waugh brings this off successfully or not will depend of what the viewer/reader brings to the scene.  Certainly what Waugh has shown us to this point is what misery the strictures of organized religion can impose on the lives of its subjects through guilt and conditioning.  Sebastian drowning his remorse for his homosexuality in alcohol; Marchmain's alienation from his wife's obsessive conformity driving him to Paris and a loveless relationship with a mistress; Brideshead's mindless obedience condemning him to collecting matchboxes and a ridiculous marriage;  Julia's lapses from doctrine leaving her with a life of endless tormenting guilt summed up in her final remark to Charles as she sacrifices her final chance at happiness, \\""I am not quite bad enough to set up a rival good to God's\\"".

His story revolves around a dying patriarch, Lord Marchmain, and is narrated by his elder daughter Julia's lover, Charles Ryder.  A man notably detached from his emotions, Ryder experiences a dramatic turn-around by novel's end.<br /><br />Ryder's change of heart comes about during the final months of Marchmain's life.  The patriarch himself is not overly concerned with his latest round of failing health and confidently expects to recover.  His son Lord Brideshead (Bridey), however, sees otherwise and summons the local priest Father Mackay to anoint his father.  Not even pretending hospitality, Marchmain has his younger daughter Cordelia spirit the priest out the door.  In the words of his Venetian mistress Cara, Marchmain is a scoffer who disdains the Church.<br /><br />Marchmain's shabby dismissal of Father Mackay sets a negative tone.  Ryder himself chimes in with the sarcastic remark, \\""The witch-doctor has gone.\\""  Skepticism like this, however, provides little comfort to the dying aristocrat.  Even his personal physician can do nothing more than to try to keep his patient alive from day to day.<br /><br />Both Cordelia and Bridey are away when their father's condition takes a sharp turn for the worse.  Julia, on the other hand, is at the estate and promptly goes out to call for Father Mackay.  After she and the priest return, Mackay gets an update from Marchmain's doctor: the patriarch is now semi-comatose.  The priest then goes in to see the dying man and asks him to acknowledge remorse.<br /><br />At first Marchmain does nothing.  Father Mackay anoints him anyway and as he gives him the final blessing, the dying aristocrat surprises everyone by motioning with the sign of the cross.  Marchmain thus makes his peace with God and dies reconciled to the Church.  For Ryder this is like the \\""veil of the temple being rent from top to bottom.\\""  From then on, both he and Julia know instinctively that their affair is over and that they would be leading separate lives.<br />Dennis J.

Evely Waugh focuses on what he thinks is important, and he doesn't particularly care if the reader doesn't agree with him. He is also utterly unapologetic about involving things like sin, morality, and God that are looked down upon by modern critics. That is what makes him great as an author. <br />The true key to this novel is the quote from G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown mysteries that is mentioned. The one where Father Brown talks about bringing someone back by a twitch upon the thread. An invisible thread long enough to let someone go to the ends of the world, and still bring him back. That, of course, is what God does in this novel. As Evelyn Waugh said, this novel is about the operation of Divine Grace upon a disparate group of individuals. And so the alcoholic Sebastian, the self-indulgent Julia, and the agnostic Charles are all brought back to God in the end. <br />It is the effects of time that make this novel so profoundly moving for me. Charles goes for so many years without even thinking of his time at Brideshead, and then one brief meeting with Julia brings it all back to him.

'Brideshead Revisited' is an extremely well-written book that thoroughly tells the story of Charles Ryder, an English officer who is forced to recall the happiest and saddest moments of his life.  Through his memories, we learn of the wealthy and eccentric Marchmain family and the formative role they played in the narrator's life.<br /><br />Charles Ryder begins his memoirs when, as a soldier in WWII, he finds himself requisitioning the old manor home of the Marchmain family.  He immediately recalls his first encounters with the family - the mysterious and ultra-stylish Sebastian, whom he encounters while at Oxford, a pretentious young man who carries around a stuffed bear and has a propensity to drink.  Sebastian is hesitant to introduce Charles to his family, for fear they will charm him so much that he will lose him as a friend for himself.  But Charles does meet, and is charmed by, the Marchmain family, ingratiating himself into every aspect of their life.  He quickly becomes a mainstay with the family and is called upon in times of great stress - when Sebastian's propensity to drink gets him expelled and causes him to escape his demons by running away.

Some family members weigh desires and progressive attitudes against social and religious convention and find the latter lacking, while others cling to old religious and social practices and seek to continue to enjoy the opulence of a soon to be, bygone era.  <br />Waugh documents the excesses and eventual downfall of the youngest son Sebastian, whose burden it is to confront his disillusionment with his faith, with his morally incorruptible mother.  Lady Marchmain's control over her children using her charm, piety and the religious doctrine she devoutly observes is unquestionable.  Each member of her family is affected to varying degrees, including the absent husband. <br />The novel's narrator and protagonist Charles Ryder, is a self-confessed agnostic and friend of Sebastian.  The story commences with Charles, who, at a low ebb in his life, is commissioned to command an infantry regiment during World War II and is despatched by train to an unknown location.  His sullen mood determines that he neither feels the need to know his destination nor does he particularly care.  Upon alighting the train to make camp Charles discovers he is within sight of Brideshead, the castle that was the Marchmain ancestral home and location of much happiness for him twenty years earlier.  Charles recalls that precious time and relates the story with a deep sense of nostalgia and recognition that those languid days of love and abundance are gone forever.  <br />Lady Marchmain commands abidance to Catholicism 'in a voice as quiet as a prayer and as powerful' from four very different children.  The elder son, Brideshead is pious and conservative, unamusing and annoyingly narrow-minded. Julia is a contemporary woman, smart and verybeautiful.  She agonises over her marriage to a 'colonial' who doesn't understand centuries of observance to certain social protocol and devotion to a church, which he considers encourages the perpetuation of guilt for its own purposes.  As Julia's angst is disclosed she is portrayed as a complex young woman who must reject her faith to marry. She eventually finds herself disappointed with her choices and is left wondering how life could have gone so awry.  <br />Sebastian is 'the most conspicuous man of his year by reason of his beauty, which is arresting, and his eccentricities of behaviour, which seem to know no bounds'. Sebastian's charm captivates Charles from the first moment he sees him. They become inseparable and live life at Oxford to the full, however Charles eventually realises that Sebastian drinks to escape, rather than 'through an excess of high spirits, in the love of the moment and with the wish to prolong and enhance it'. Charles must eventually come to the conclusion that he has 'lost' his perpetually sullen friend.<br />Cordelia is the youngest of the Marchmain children.  She is too young and devout of faith to fully understand her brother's dilemma, however she loves him unconditionally.  Cordelia also seems too young to be aware of her mother's need to control, yet after Lady Marchmain dies, Cordelia confides to Charles that her mother 'was saintly but she wasn't a saint' and that 'when people wanted to hate God, they hated mummy'. There is a resigned acceptance at her inability to love her mother and of the lapse of faith of her father, sister and beloved brother.<br />Sebastian's deep depression and inner battle to reconcile his beliefs with his mother's expectations of him, are exemplified by Charles' responses in the conversation that he and Sebastian shared 'in the collonade with the papers'.  Sebastian would not find true solace in his relationship with Charles because he perceived that Charles could not grasp the gravity of his dilemma,despite their mutual love.  Waugh's decision to portray Charles as irreligious adds depth to Sebastian's dilemma.  The reader is left with the distinct feeling that love does not 'conquer all' and that the chasm between being unaffected by religion and the need to be devout of faith is too wide to bridge for these two introspective young men.  The book's most amusing dialogue occurs when Sebastian, unable or not wishing to try to defend his faith, exclaims 'Oh don't be a bore, Charles.  I want to read about a woman in Hull who's been using an instrument'. <br />Lady Marchmain attempts to solicit Charles `to her side' in order that he assist her to deny Sebastian the alcohol he increasingly relies upon.  Initially charmed by her, Charles eventually recognises her ploy and rather than winning his confidence, Lady Marchmain's emotional blackmail succeeds in `closing the low door in the wall' and Charles is destined to no longer meet Sebastian in their `enchanted garden'.<br />Charles loses contact with the Marchmains until many years later when he and Julia are literally thrown together on a ship in a storm. It is a fitting climax to Charles' involvement with the Marchmain family that he and Julia should become lovers.  The raging storm could be perceived to be a metaphor for the consummation of their relationship and that in itself to some degree, closure to Charles' lost love for Sebastian.<br />Presumably Evelyn Waugh sought to mourn the passing of an era and to celebrate his 1930 conversion to Roman Catholicism.  In doing so he created an extraordinarily splendid tale.  The novel may be excused for glorifying the aristocracy, because it transports the reader to 'that enchanted garden' which is full of life's glorious excesses.  It is tragic to lose an enchanting, teddy toting, young man to the bottle and it is sad to see love lost on a technicality but it is comforting to watch Waugh's characters rediscover their faith despite sinking to desolation and despair before doing so.

When it came time for me to write a review of my own performance at work, I tried to find inspiration from Waugh's style; I showed the review to my wife, who was blown away by how well it was written.

I can tell you that it touches on religion and war and homosexuality and class and family, but I am hard pressed to provide a synopsis.

More likely my dissatisfaction is a result of the dispassionate voice of the main character/narrator that gives the story a dream-like quality similar to L'Etranger by Camus.  If the narrator himself is dispassionate, that makes it tough for me to get wrapped up in the novel.<br />I fear that criticizing a modern classic speaks more to my own unsophisticated tastes than to the strengths or weaknesses of the novel, so it is it is with some trepidation that I give Brideshead Revisited only three stars.

He comes across the estate of his old friend, Sebastian Flyte during the war and it stirs up his old memories and that's where the story actually starts because that whole first chapter, you must understand, is entirely boring. The novel is sort of told in flashback mode by Ryder who befriends Sebastian during his college years after meeting him in a contrived way (throwing up in Ryder's room) and that of course, brings about events that would never ever happen (a guy sending a fellow he barely knows a room full of flowers and inviting him to have lunch with his friends) in real life. Sebastian carries around a teddybear that is a gimmick the writer uses to make people remember Sebastian is \\""different\\"" from the the rest of the people in the story. Besides the teddybear, Sebastian does very little else to distinguish himself between him and the rest of the people in this story but then half way threw it, he goes from guy who drinks for fun (Charles and Sebastain skip away and get drunk alot) to big just a pathetic drunk. So, I guess he was given TWO chacterstics then, lol. There's another fellow in the story called Anthony Blanche but he's barely worth mentioning but he's big gimmick is stuttering and after a while, it becomes so tiresome and awful. I couldn't wait for that him to be written out. He's supposed to be rather openly homosexual but Charles and Sebastian's relationship is written as more of sort of friendship with hints of homosexuality. It's really left up to the reader's imagination or what you want to believe. So anyway, Sebastian hates his family but he keeps dragging Charles back to his big rich castle home until he eventually encounters them, first sort of as individuals and later as almost a whole family except for Sebastian's dad who left the family and lives with another woman. Sebastian acts like a baby when he gets around his family and worries they'll steal Charlesaway from him but then he locks himself up in his room and drinks so Charles has little choice but get to socialize with them. Eventually, their 'friendship' falls apart and Charles falls for Sebastian's sister. After their 'friendship' dissolved, sebastian disappears and is only briefly mentioned and I found the novel got pretty dull after that and it was a struggle to finish.

As he enters the university we initially see Charles as he was taught to be, in reality a somewhat small and boring figure, never having experienced the joys of boyhood, but is given a glimpse of happiness during his tenure at Oxford and beyond, where he is influenced by a fateful encounter with members of an Aristocratic family.

Charles Ryder, artist and scion of a minor upper class family, is a captain during World War II whose unit is posted to a large estate (Brideshead), a place where he spent some of the happiest, and unhappiest, times of his life back in the early 1920s, when he was at Oxford with Sebastian Flyte, the younger son of the wealthy and Catholic Marchmain family. The first part of the book is the story of the rise and fall of the friendship between Ryder and Sebastian, who hates his mother and sinks into alcoholism. The second part, which seems disconnected, is the story of Charles's success and the collapse of his marriage, and of his tenuous affair with Julia, Sebastian's sister. And that's about all the plot there is. But I enjoyed the book mostly for Waugh's mastery of character evolution, his depiction of the changes in Sebastian's grasp on the real world and on the growth of Ryder's cynicism. The supporting characters are fascinating: Sebastian's eldest brother, Brideshead (a lovely name!); the younger, pious sister, Cordelia; their friends, Anthony Blanche and Boy Mulcaster, who grow from tiresome undergraduates to men occasionally worth listening to; Julia's Canadian husband, Rex Mottrom; Sebastian's parents and Charles's father, and even quite minor figures in the story. There are also some great comic scenes, such as the thoroughly heathenish Rex's efforts to be converted to Roman Catholicism to please Julia's family, and Cousin Jasper's disquisition on how to be a proper Oxford Man. And Waugh's take on the peculiarities of the Anglo-Catholic world are very good.

But at center, Evelyn Waugh's greatest novel (and one of his few non-satirical works) is about religious faith, and how that faith continues to operate in the lives of even those who seem to reject it, and how that faith supports even those who falter badly in it.<br /><br />The story is complex. It is told in the first person by narrator Charles Ryder, who develops a close and possibly homoerotic relationship with artistocrat Sebastian Flyte while the two are students at Oxford.  Seduced by the glamor of Flyte's way of life and the beauty of his ancestrial home at Brideshead, Ryder becomes deeply involved with Flyte's family as well--a Roman Catholic family in which the various members either use their religion to manipulate others or actively rebel against it.  With the passage of time, Sebastian's drinking expands into alcholism--which appears to be fueled by his guilt at rejecting the church, a rejection which may be based on his own uncertain sexuality.  Ryder consequently transfers his affections to Sebastian's sister Julia--but again religion influences their relationship: Julia has made an unfortunate marriage, and although she is willing to engage in an affair with Ryder, she may not be willing to divorce her husband, an act that will cast her completely outside the bounds of her faith.<br /><br />The characters involved in the story are often extremely charming, but they are not necessarily admirable, and the passage of time in the novel nibbles away at their charm in such a way as to expose their flaws; even the narrator, Charles Ryder, gradually emerges as a somewhat second-rate person of dubious integrity.  Even so, there remains a strange element of hope in the novel, a sense of God's grace and mercy even in the face of deliberate affront.

It confronts a difficult theme -- the disintegration of a once-noble British family by two world wars and changes in the social and moral fabric of the first half of the twentieth century.  But Waugh handles the material with the aplomb of a natural storyteller and the objectivity of an observer who is wise enough never to become too symphathetic with his characters.<br />\\""Brideshead Revisited\\"" is narrated in flashback through the voice of a British Army captain named Charles Ryder, who one day in 1943 inadvertently finds himself near an estate called Brideshead which he recognizes as a place he'd first seen twenty years before.  His memories take us directly back to 1923 when he was a freshman at Oxford and befriended a fellow student named Lord Sebastian Flyte.  Sebastian is pampered, effeminate, and abnormally juvenile; he spends more time drinking than studying and owns a teddy bear.  Now, I realize that it's not absurd for a grown man to own a teddy bear, but it is when he frequently refers to the bear by its christened name, treats it as a confidant, and brings it with him on outings.  With Sebastian, Charles finds himself moving in a new social circle, illuminated by the even more flamboyantly effeminate and sexually ambiguous Anthony Blanche.   <br />Sebastian is secretive about his family but nevertheless takes Charles to visit the family house at Brideshead.  Eventually Charles does get to meet Sebastian's sisters Julia and Cordelia, his older brother the Earl of Brideshead, and his (separated) parents, Lord and Lady Marchmain.  It's apparent that Sebastian dislikes his family, especially his pious Catholic mother; his excessive drinking is a means to escape his unhappiness.  Charles, meanwhile, sort of adopts this family as his own and becomes intimately involved in their affairs; his own father -- his only close living relative -- is somewhat of a doddering old fool and not much good company.<br />Over the following years, the characters grow and develop as all good characters should.  Julia marries a budding politician named Rex Mottram, who makes a comically clumsy attempt at conversion to Catholicism before the wedding; Charles becomes an artist and starts an affair with Julia during a stormy Atlantic crossing; the Earl collects matchboxes; Cordelia, the most conscientious of the Flytes, becomes a humanitarian aid worker.  Sebastian, who is so central early in the novel, gradually falls out of the picture; years of idleness, apathy, irresponsibility, and debauchery lead him to a miserable existence in northern Africa.<br />There is significance in Charles's chosen profession -- that of an artist who paints architectural portraits of ancient English manors -- because it parallels his role as historian and chronicler of the decadent Flyte family; he gives the impression of a curator proudly showing a portrait of a stately old house or family and saying, \\""This was once a great monument of England.\\""  \\""Brideshead Revisited\\"" is not an outright funny novel like \\""Scoop\\"" (although there is an amusing cross-reference to the Beast, the newspaper from \\""Scoop\\""), but it is still filled with Waugh's wry charm and his effortlessly mellifluous prose.",2002-02-15

That's probably more accurate.<br />I am not nearly qualified to give Evelyn Waugh advice on how to write. But I will anyway: Please, Mr. Waugh, stick to cute satire, and leave the romance fiction to the less acute; make the books more mordant than maudlin; model \\""The Loved One\\"", which was far better than this tale of loved ones.<br />My main complaint is that Waugh here comes off as little more than a poor man's Oscar Wilde. You have a proliferation of aesthete's epigrams (\\""Oh, Charles, don't be such a tourist. What does it matter when it was built, if it's pretty?\\""), the crypto-homoeroticism (actually, it's not that well hidden at all), and various variations on Dorian Gray's syndrome. But where Wilde's writing revels in its formulas and in it's decadence, Waugh doesn't appear to be having very much fun.<br />The first half begins well enough. Charles Ryder, a cipheric army captain, happens on Brideshead Castle after a lengthy absence. It, and its occupants, defined his youth, and the sight of it forces forward a flood of memories. The remainder of the novel takes place within these memories, Ryder mainly acting as observer of those around him. He is a fine narrator, allowing equal time to the objective and subjective aspects of his memory (i.e., the events as they happened vs. his reactions to said events). <br />While at Oxford, his chief subject is Sebastian Flyte, a charming dipsomaniac. Sebastian is Charles' best and only friend, while being his 'in' to Brideshead. He's an addictively self-destructive character, still in love with his childhood (a teddy-bear named Aloysius goes with him everywhere; he adores his old nanny), which eventually leads to his own undoing. It's typical of the novel that when Sebastian's immature drunkenness rears its ugly head, one of his school chums casually remarks: \\""How boring!\\"" Charles' days at Oxford are the novel's high points, as the charming and intriguing people he meets form a peculiar tapestry. It was a true pleasure to read the first hundred or so pages, as Waugh appears on top of his game.<br />Unfortunately, Oxford days are abandoned in the novel's second half, and the narrative flounders under the weight of 'big ideas'. While the residents of Brideshead are no less fascinating than the Oxford boys (as Sebastian accurately says: \\""I'm not going to have you [Charles] get mixed up with my family. They're so madly charming.\\""), the harsh melodrama that ensues got on my nerves. And, ultimately, Waugh never gives his characters anything cohesive to do; episodes drag on much too long, wearing out their welcome long after any relevant point has been made. Take his treatment of Lady Marchmain, Brideshead's matriarch, and a devout Catholic. A side comment by (her daughter) Cordelia epitomizes her mother's character:<br />\\""I sometimes think when people wanted to hate God they hated mummy... She was saintly but she wasn't a saint. No one could really hate a saint, could they? They can't really hate God either. When they want to hate Him and his saints they have to find something like themselves and pretend it's God and hate that.\\""<br />Out of the mouths of babes, no? Cordelia (read: Waugh) crystallizes in that one speech all the problems that religion has brought to the novel's second half. It's typical of the kind of sharp writing Waugh excels at. But the effect is diluted when the argument is repeated, in various forms, ad nauseam. It got to be quite tedious.<br />Charles, at one point, pledges to only live in a world of three-dimensions, that he can experience with his five senses. He soon he finds out that artifice rules the day, especially at Brideshead Castle, and such a world doesn't exist. I'd expected Waugh to pounce all over this idea with his sharp pen and sharper mind. But instead he revels in Charles' overwrought sincerity. Waugh's pointed wit usually punctures holes in stuffy characters such as these, but here he is content to just create them.<br />While in arcadian Oxford, \\""Brideshead Revisited\\"" shines, enough that I can offer a marginal recommendation.

I think there is more to it than that. It is a about a man in conflict with the noise of life, he finds himself through the love of a college mate who he engages in undergrate frivolity with, despite the urgings of a graduate student relative.  The haunting aspect of this novel maybe that the noise of life turns out to be his wife, his children, as well as his relationship with the army, and his own dad.  The man that, if any, can be given credit for helping the narrator find himself, ends up losing himself.

Written during World War II and framed by the conversion of the Brideshead estate into an army camp during the war, the novel depicts the youth and early adulthood of one Charles Ryder.  The 40-year-old army  captain that the war makes of Ryder recalls the days of his optimistic  youth as a close friend of teddy-bear toting Sebastian Flyte, younger son  of the Brideshead household and classmate of his at Oxford.  Sebastian  awakens much in Charles, and it is arguable whether he doesn't awaken more  than does his sister Julia, who later becomes Ryder's fiancee.<br />For the  220 or so pages that constitute Part One this book comes off as a splendid  (though not aggressively hostile) satire of upper class British society in  the 1920s.  Especially of the particular damage that the \\""long-suffering\\""  Catholic mother can do to her loved ones (I kept thinking, \\""O, the  martyrdom!\\"" every time Lady Marchmain used one of her patented guilt trips  to twist the psychological and spiritual arms of her children--Sebastian  most often.)  BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is also a powerful \\""lost illusions\\"" type  of novel, but the particular illusions lost don't seem any more attractive  than the reality that replaces them. \\""Henceforth I live in a world of three  dimensions--with the aid of my five senses,\\"" says Charles, but that seems  limiting, doesn't it?  It does to Waugh but his answer isn't necessarily  any more appealing. Part One is hilarious and promises much.  Part Two,  sorry to say, does not deliver on that promise.  The satire stops and the  soap opera begins.  Sebastian disappears and Ryder becomes a much less  sympathetic character--why he would fall in love with Julia in the first  place is hard to fathom.<br />A great problem with this novel is that it seems  to place the Catholic religion in an unflattering light to the extent that  the reader would think that Waugh himself was anti-Catholic.  Think again.   He was a convert well before he wrote this book and despite the fact that  he DOES present Catholicism as being the last thing anyone would want to  fall into, people fall.  The fact that they fall into rather than embrace  Catholicism sucks away whatever joy might have been left in the novel--I  was reminded of the line from Kevin Smith's movie DOGMA, paraphrased here:  \\""Catholics don't celebrate their faith, they mourn it.\\""<br />So, in  celebration I must say that to call Waugh a fine writer is to sell him far  too short.

His multi-faceted and strikingly human depictions of the Brideshead inhabitants, his facility with language, his stately compression; few writers can claim to have so often struck upon le mot juste.

But like most English literature of the first 65 years of the 20th century that I have read, life mostly transpires in the drawing room, in this case literally, and when not there, one can substitute Oxbridge for flashbacks and a pleasant change of scenery.  If this book is theological, then God is a member of the peerage.<br /><br />The crisis faced by the family at the center of the book is whether and how to hold on to their Catholicism in an Anglo-centric universe of Protestantism.  I over-simplify in the interest of cutting through the fat.  You see, when one is a Jew, once a religion accepts Jesus Christ as the Messiah, what is the big difference?  I apologize profusely to my dear friend Father David, recently ordained, and to one of my favorite clients.  I think it is a far more interesting question to explore why Christianity as a whole will condemn a soul to Hell for not having accepted Christ regardless of how good the person to whom that soul belonged had been during his or her lifetime, while a truly evil person who accepts Christ as the Messiah gets to skip jail if she or he is anointed with a spritz of oil and receives last rites.<br /><br />Waugh's deep and controversial work is  a particularly well-written (hence an extra star) slice of life that once more illustrates why the peerage ain't what it used to be.  Because the subject is ostensibly serious, the book lacks the dry wit and occasional self-deprecation of those comedies of manners that we love so well.  Waugh does his best not to show that his sympathy for the Catholics is limited, as they can be compared to those who carry a revolver on a fox-hunt.  He is one of the last defenders, intentional or not, of a way of life that makes sense only to those who cared about it in the first place.<br /><br />I would have liked the book betterhad it dealt with the religious themes as it does the hurly-burly architecture of Brideshead itself.  It is a waste of a talented stylist's art to have treated like a Shaw entertainment a subject so overwhelmingly earth-shattering at the time of the writing of the work (during the Second World War).  While the great artists of the day were questioning the very existence of God, Waugh remained in the shadows of his Oxbridge dormitory asking whether Catholics took marriage entirely too seriously, thereby spoiling a perfectly reasonable divorce as the best-adapted solution to man's problems in a godless world.",2015-07-14

It is brilliantly written, both in the evocation of characters and in the evocation of physical sensation -- the gillyflowers outside the window in the summer, the fun of getting drunk, the silence of a sickroom.  The prose is just as pointed as in Waugh's satirical works, but here it is designed to illuminate, not simply to amuse.  And the structure of the novel feels inevitable, as time passes, characters change, and relationships shift.  Waugh himself said that the novel was &#34;steeped in theology&#34;, and the tenets of the faith ultimately determine the lives of most of the characters.

Probably because this is not a lifestyle I understand very well, it took a while to like some of the homosexual characters, but in the end I liked almost everyone in the book. I believe the book is semi-biographical which makes the novel very realistic. Evelyn Waugh actually based most of the characters on real people he knew at Oxford and at these country estates. They ended up being famous or infamous later in life. What I didn't enjoy was some of the plot, especially how Sebastian became a drunk. I really envy this upper-class English life-style and can't understand why anyone born into it would intentionally destroy himself just to get back at his overly pious mother. Julia's courtship and finally marrying Rex is something else I don't understand.<br /><br />In the BBC 1981 series most of the main characters who are supposedly in their late teens are actually over 30. The youngest, Cordelia, Sebastian's 11-year-old sister, is played by an actress who is 22. I got used to it because the acting and the voices are so wonderful.  It helps to watch the BBC series first, but keep in mind that the cast is a little old for their roles.",2014-04-27

Everything about the novel drips with the aristocratic style and language of pre-war England. I'm a great fan of the PBS series Downton Abby, but this is for me, the real deal, none of it dumbed down for television viewing by Americans. Charles Ryder, is the aloof narrator, who tells his story over more than a decade, from young Oxford student who falls in love with the beautiful Lord Sabastian Flyte, and with his entire family and their ancestral home, Brideshead, and later through an adulterous affair with Sebastian's younger sister, Lady Julia. Charles' remoteness, presumably the outcome of having been raised motherless and by a father who can hardly bear to have him in the same house, allows Charles to observe everything and everyone around him without becoming overwhelmed. Other characters, some highly developed, drift in and out of the story, some delightfully quirky, some sweetly charming, some sadly banal, all necessary to the understanding of the changing times. I'm one who prefers to have the ends tied together, but this is Evelyn Waugh's story, and he leaves us a cast of characters whose lives can only be conjectured in the aftermath of two world wars, the dismantling of country houses, and of a privileged way of life.",2013-03-30

He was at school with the younger son of the manor's family and despite a relative's warning, took up with him. Visits to the manor bring him in contact with the dysfunctional family.

You get Waugh's classic  story dropped into your mind. (Good copy is not the point of inexpensive e-books.) Screw the typos; Just read the story and count yourself lucky to be hanging out with Charles Ryder and a bunch of religiously whacked out  pre-War Upper class Brits....back when religion mattered. Speaking of bad copies, last night, i saw the DVD of the  new movie version of Brideshead; and it'a a very poor copy of the original movie with Jeremy Irons et al. Don't go there just download the Kindle version and run with it. The new movie doesn't hold a candle to the e-book.",2010-03-20

The typos and all-over formatting is deplorable (That's why the 4 stars as opposed to the 5 stars it should deserve).  The material is still wonderful, so much can be forgiven.  I question however, how this e-book was created.  It does not even list the correct author (Waugh)and the author listed (Wendorf) has not added any commentary to the text.  Makes me wonder if this is a pirate copy that slipped by Amazon!  Whatever, for 2 bucks it's still one of the 100 greatest books ever written and deserves to be in everyones' collections.",2009-11-12

I don't know who's responsible, the publisher, who provided the book for use, or amazon, who developed the format and probably the conversion software...Quotation marks were often half-done, so it seemed characters would start by making conversation and suddenly veer directly into narration.  The word \\""I\\"" was often replaced by the letter \\""T\\"". Frequently, words were br k e n apart and/or missing letters.  This technology has been available for two years now, so I should expect that the task of FORMATTING TEXT and CHECKING SPELLING would be under control by now.  I've downloaded free old books from gutenberg.org and manybooks.net that didn't have this problem, so to find it in a major publishing house is rather irritating.  The same problems recur in the other Waugh book, The Sword of Honour Trilogy...though it hasn't occurred in Waugh's Complete Short Stories, though I've read quite a few of them.",2009-03-07
