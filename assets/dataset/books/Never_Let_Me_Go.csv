Ishiguro tells the story of Kathy H., who grows up in a boarding school, Hailsham, and makes two lifelong friends, Ruth and Tommy. Her relationship with the pair is complicated and fraught with the kind of tension one would expect in a triangular love affair. Ishiguro gets under the skin of this trio and, with calculated and deliberate care, teases out the intimacies, jealousies, and contradictory feelings Kathy struggles with growing up in Hailsham and when they eventually graduate and live in &#34;the Cottages&#34;.  Ishiguro's sometimes painstakingly detailed deliberation on the humanness of his characters is perhaps not just indicative of his realist sensibilities, but as a way to bring his larger concerns to the fore. Whether that is completely successful is perhaps not as clear. The reader soon wonders why Kathy and the other students never mention any families and relations. Are they orphans? Why is it they never venture out beyond the school grounds and instead create myths that they half-heartedly believe about the terrors that lurk up on the hills behind the school buildings? Words like &#34;donations&#34;, carers&#34;, &#34;deferment&#34;, &#34;possibles&#34; and &#34;completing&#34; also slip into the dialogue seamlessly and their true meanings become clear as the story progresses. A mysterious lady and possibly a school benefactor they just know as Madame comes regularly to peruse the children's art pieces and creative writing, to presumably select them for her &#34;gallery&#34;. A passionate teacher who feels the children needs to be told more about what lies ahead in their lives leaves the school abruptly.  That Kathy takes the role as narrator helps the reader see things from her perspective, and we find out along with her the destinies of people like her, which throw up questions about what it means to be human, if art is proof of a soul, and the new possible worlds that science and technology can offer to us, and if we should be so hasty as to embrace it all. Perhaps in his keen eye on the characters, these latter larger issues, when they surface, become swallowed up and at best, stand at the margins. Nonetheless, the the novel is a fine example of what some critics call &#34;slipstream&#34; in the way it blends sci-fi and literary fiction.",2015-08-16

I read this book giving it my full attention and trying to immerse myself fully in the story. And while I did get into the story somewhat, I didn't care about any of the characters by p. 5 and I didn't care about any of the characters in the final chapter.  The story is structured around several mysterious incidents that occur at Hailsham and so it is somewhat intriguing. Something seems to be going on with Tommy's drawings. I shall read further to find out what all the fuss over these petty childhood drawings. Why is the older woman crying to find Kathleen dancing with a pillow? I shall read further to find out! In the end, the great mystery SPOILER is not much of a shocker. All the kids are merely organ donors. And so that is supposed to be the point: that when something gruesome like this actually occurs, we will roll over and barely notice how unethical it is. That Ishiguro sets it in the present/recent past further underscores this point. Those who gave this book five stars tended to emphasize its larger message, but I don't read a book for its larger message. I can get that from the synopsis. I read a book to feel something. The protagonist of this story didn't want anything. And in fact because she didn't want anything, it is somewhat unbelievable that she would be motivated to tell this story. The book might have been more interesting from Miss Emily's point of view. She would have written with more urgency, but then we wouldn't have gotten the insight from the Hailsham residents themselves. Too bad the Hailsham residents were super boring.",2015-08-07

There's something about it -- not simple to pin down.  The writing is so elegant, so magical, and yet the characters are so deeply human and recognizable.  You feel as if you know them, or even that you ARE them, they are so familiar.  And yet they are placed in a world that is just slightly off-kilter.  It isn't our world, but it's very similar, and easy to believe, even though some things about it are outrageous.  I loved this book so much (and the movie made of it) that I only regret that I can't read it again for the first time.  I've given it to many friends.  In my opinion it is Ishiguro's best novel, and that's saying a lot.  He has his narrative gifts under such control, and knows how to develop these characters in a way that we feel for them, and are then vulnerable to their fates.  One is tempted to see it as metaphor, and yet that isn't necessary.  This world works perfectly on its own terms, and these people do their best to understand and come to terms with their merciless positions in their world.  I really can't praise it highly enough.  The plot, if summarized, would seem horrible or perhaps off-putting, and yet it is one of the most lyrically beautiful and profoundly true novels that I've ever read.

Nobody will ever know, because I was dreaming a particularly sad and beautiful dream. Ishiguro’s voice in this novel is Kathy, who has been a “carer” for eleven years. It’s unclear what that job entails and who Kathy is, but the reader must continue obliviously if they are to enjoy the full force of the novel. Indeed, though the plot is somewhat linear, with Kathy recounting first her memories of her life at Hailsham, a boarding school shrouded in mystery, and continuing until present day. They scattered and seemingly indiscriminate, illustrating moments of doubt, frustration, and anger that all adolescents experience, but also hinting at the pivotal tragedy of Hailsham and its students.<br /><br />In terms of secrets, the plot of Never Let Me Go and the truth about its characters is probably common knowledge, as the novel was published in 2005 and the critically acclaimed film adaptation was released in 2010. This reveal of this “secret” in the novel is nevertheless where Ishiguro’s craft really shines through.<br /><br />To see my review in context, please visit https://thewaythroughwords.wordpress.com/",2015-07-23

By that point I was hooked! I took the book with me everywhere and at points had to ignore my family for some time so that I could get to the end!<br /><br />The main narrator Kathy begins the story talking about how she has been a carer for almost 12 years and is about to stop being a carer. Her next step in life is left unknown at this point, but the whole story leads to what will become of her. She takes you through her childhood. She was raised at Hailsham, a school/orphanage  or so it seems until you learn more about the disturbing purpose of the school.<br /><br />I felt lulled into remembering with her, these idyllic childhood days, but always lurking in the background is the cruel reality of what becomes of the children who live at Hailsham.

Now the criticism: The needs a shot of epinephrine or adrenaline - simply said, the book had no life. Every time I thought the book was going towards one direction - oh, it's finally going to get good&#34; - no, only bunch of unnecessary dialogue, or references of characters that don't come to fruition, and don't play a role in the overall story.

Secondly, are we becoming so cruel in our society, that we would do something like this? I don't see why not because of how our feed animals are treated. That's the frightening part, that we might actually resort to this type of thing, making clones and then harvesting their organs. Also there seems to be something immoral about the fact that your exploiting a person but the person doesn't really understand why it's unjust so they just go along with it and have little or no resistance to it. I mean really the clone is born and they know one day they'll donate so much of their organs that they'll complete i.e. die during the process and they just accept it, like a person would accept the fact that they will work a dead end job the rest of their life.<br />His portrait of Ruth was my favorite. She's so irritating and what you call a &quot;mean girl&quot; but he wrote her character in such an honest way that reminded me so much of a &quot;mean girl&quot; I know very well. Something about mean girls no one ever talks about is that they are so honest and brutal that you almost end up thanking them. A mean girl says &quot;This is the way things should be&quot; and they say it with such conviction and they have so many people who side with them that you believe them. There is some comfort in taking the grey areas out of a situation. I tend to see all sides to a thing and get bogged down in indecision but mean girls aren't afraid to say &quot;bulls***, this is wrong&quot;. The crappy part is when you're the recipient of that honesty.<br />Anyway back to the story, it was creepy and easily the most depressing thing I've ever read. And you really start to feel that hopelessness, if all the students are doing is being raised to donate organs, why does anything matter?

Perhaps the positive reviews raised my expectations too high, but I just didn't enjoy this book. Promised a dystopian tale with tons of emotion, I found instead a memoir masquerading as dystopian wrongness. The descriptions of the narrator were involved and reminded me of my grandmother's stories -- a bit rambling, but eventually they got to the point, but sometimes it was so late that you weren't sure why the point was even relevant any more.<br /><br />Soooo, if you're looking for a great dystopian novel... this isn't it. However, if you want beautiful descriptions of childhood friendships and coming of age stories in a slightly altered life situation, then this is for you. There's some literary merit in this; it just wasn't enough to keep me interested. It just dragged on and on. Since the previous reviews promised that it got really good at the end, I kept plowing through, but any reader who has read more than a few dystopian novels would realize the transparent nature of the secret... and that's the only part that was truly interesting.<br /><br />I can see this being used in a high school setting as a springboard for discussions on the controversial topic within. Of less literary merit, but certainly more action, consider a book study on the same topic that includes Unwind by Neil Shusterman, The House of the Scorpion by Nancy Farmer, and The Scorpion Rules by Erin Bow (coming out in September).

I can respect Ishiguro as a writer- usually, he's been great at setting an atmosphere, touching on basic truths and so on. But this book fell flat. The premise seemed interesting on paper. You have a group of children at a boarding school being raised for organ donations. It's not a new premise but it's one that has a lot of potential. You'd think that combining this premise with Ishiguro's literary stylings would lead to an amazing novel but no. I literally put the book down about ten minutes ago and I can only remember the names of like four characters. All the characters are generic and bland. The plot doesn't go anywhere. All the dialogue's stiff and free of any semblance of personality. Hell, even reading Kathy's narration felt like I was reading the diary of a robot wearing a middle aged British woman's skin.<br /><br />I don't mind novels with a slow build-up. But this book felt like it went nowhere. In fact, an entire plot thread involves one of the characters secretly drawing animals in a notebook and getting laughed at by his girlfriend. As many other reviewers have pointed out, the premise doesn't always make sense either. There's these children being raised with virtually no boundaries or restraints in a boarding school (later on, cottages) that's within driving distance to a village. Later on, the characters (who are, again, being raised to one day donate organs and eventually die) are given the freedom to leave whenever they want, travel all over, and so on. I understand Ishiguro's trying to make a point about being resigned to one's fate. But there's literally nothing stopping any of these characters from running off or even saying &#34;gee, my life really sucks. I don't want to die or give up one of my kidneys&#34;. They just sort of...accept everything and barely make any effort to understand why their life is the way is it or even protest against their fate. There's one point in the book where the characters help one of their friends find the woman she's been cloned after and it's suggested that they've all been cloned from average to lower class people walking around nearby areas. That actually would've been a very interesting plot thread to explore if Ishiguro wasn't so hellbent on telling us how much freaking Kathy loves her thrift store lamps.<br /><br />This was only about 300 pages and yet it took me about three months to read it.

I don’t say that as a negative, just a factual account of how long it took me to get into the text.<br />There are moments in this novel, especially in Part Two, that anyone who has been in a close friendship that drifted apart will recognize. Kazuo Ishiguro does a nice job of showing, not telling, his readers the emotional life of his characters, and I appreciated his restraint in not telegraphing every emotion his character’s felt. On the opposite end, one of the most annoying aspects of the text was the constant obvious transitions between each section/chapter.

As always,<br />Ishiguro pulls you under.&#34;  -NEWSWEEK<br /><br />Book Review: Never Let Me Go by Kazoo Ishiguro<br /><br />This book is worth reading for the story alone. Revealing its true nature at just the right time, a good story morphs into a thought-provoking notion.<br /><br />The three major characters march through the mysteries of their childhood with the reader, and the small stories within the bigger one will begin to feel strangely similar to your own. It is only the ending that colors everything a little darker.<br /><br />The heart of the story harkens back to the question of redemption. When is it truly too late for love? When a person's life span is limited, how can lost time be redeemed? And the story is told so that in every small story, a new piece of the mystery is revealed and the story ebbs and flows, making their lives seem as long and real as it was short and devastating.<br /><br />If you've seen the movie, consider this book an insider's guide to all those thoughts behind the smirks, tears, and hopeful glances.<br /><br />&#34;After that I think we went back to talking in a more or less friendly way...

An iconic book.","I have thought about this book a lot since reading it. Much has been made of how lightly Ishiguro touches the deeper themes and I absolutely agree with that. The book is very sparse on scientific detail (and legal, political and social detail too for that matter), but deliberately so I am sure, and I think that it allows for breadth in the reader's understanding of the narrative. The characters, whose origin is at first mysterious but is central to the story, accept their disturbing and gradually evident fate- were they cultured to do so from their earliest days? Perhaps it is even more sinister than that. One boy known in his childhood for his bad temper on the sports field is seen without real explanation, to start to control it. But near the end of his life he throws another brief and futile fit of protest in a field in which there are cattle. Were the cattle just a metaphor for human 'herd behaviour', or did Ishiguro just whisper a question about human modification? It is disturbing that no-one really effectively helped the children who came to believe that they were different to 'normal' people- but he makes no clear reference to just how different these people appeared to  'normals'. The really chilling thing about this tale for me was that there was no comfort to be had from its fictionality- it is a stark analogue for too many real-life situations such as the wars of last century in which millions went to their deaths for the benefit of a few. It is a powerful treatise on the ethical treatment of our fellow humans that would seem very familiar to animal rights activists, and in a sense occupies the 'creepy valley' between the two. I also found myself wondering about meaning and futility. This is a deceptively powerful book.",2015-04-14

In a word: Don't. If you need more than that, listen:<br /><br />Many here have said the writing style was slow and repetitive because the protagonist and narrator keeps saying &#34;and now I'll tell you the story of Room 14...and now I'll tell you how Ruth got mad at me...at now I'll tell you how I got mad at Ruth&#34; etc ad nauseam. However, I was able to get past that because it does lend a certain level of suspense. Another reason I kept turning the pages was the obvious: what the shoot is happening here? The novel is set up in the mystery/sci-fi-esk style we've all read before, and so you want someone to pull back the curtain and reveal the conspiracy behind the crazy alternate reality. Except you should have learned from Dorothy about pulling back curtains because there's nothing back there besides a phony in a cape.<br /><br />The entire &#34;climax&#34; where you do find out what's going on is simply a stuffy, melodramatic and overall dull scene where the students find out pretty much... nothing. Yeah, after about 250 pages of wondering what's going on behind that curtain, you realize the entire mystery is a letdown. So you're outraged, right? Like a human person, you feel like someone just cruelly psyched you out. Meanwhile, the students (same students who are supposed to be &#34;human&#34; due to their &#34;souls&#34;) barely care! And when people couple up, they barely care! And when huge fights go down or people die or breakup--pretty much the same thing! Overall, if the plot of the book doesn't interest the characters, then it doesn't follow that it should interest me.<br /><br />One last thing, and here's a spoiler to accompany it: the final scene of the book just has Kathy crying for a second while looking at a bit of trash.

Her friends Tommy and Ruth are knitted together and they all develope as a close phalanx. As you travel with these &#34;special&#34; persons, you realize that they are more human than they are given credit for.

Others are written well, but have a weak story. Never Let Me Go has the dubious honor of having a terrible story that's written terribly.<br /><br />The story itself, is pretty boring. When the big secret is finally revealed, it's not that shocking. The story plods on without anything really happening, and everyone behaves in a way that is totally unbelievable. The students yearn to have a question answered, which is not that interesting, but getting the answer amounts to the climax to the book. Overall, very boring. To make matters worse, the author chooses to tell the story through little flashbacks such as, &#34;I knew she was angry, but still, I was surprised about what happened the next day at the taco bar.&#34; Then we hear about the incident at the taco bar, which almost always turns out to be a rather boring uninteresting incident (if you didn't guess already, there is no taco bar. i made that up so as not to give anything away).

I see billions of people fighting and clawing in a survival of the fittest cage match in order to improve their lot in life. If the book is about friendship, it'shard to say what questions it's asking seeing as the main characters never interact like friends. In fact, if we weren't told that they were so close, you'd think they couldn't stand each other seeing as no one is in any way nice. If it's about the dangers of science, well then we should have been presented with reasons why this situation may have an upside, because the way the premise is presented the obvious and only answer is &#34;no, this isn't right.&#34; So much for making me think.

It did get tedious near the middle and I continued to read to find out how the donor system is finally addressed but not for the character resolutions.  It was lacking in many details that would have made it a very good sci fi book.  Here are some: Society doesn’t openly rebel against the donor system. Children don’t question their situation even after exposure to media and awareness of their position. Characters remain as pre teens even as they grow to adulthood. After Hailsham the donors are allowed to interact freely with society but never protest their situation. They have money, drivers’ licenses, etc but it is never explained how. They go to their donor/termination willingly. What the donation/organ transplant actually is is not explained, nor how they continue to normally function afterwards.  This book could borrow some ideas from other dystopian books, notably 'Brave New World' and 'Lord of the Flies' or the movie 'Blade Runner' to make it a starkly horrific book.  On the plus side, while I had a hard time grasping how an adult male could write as first person female preteen, he did it quite well, and excellent was his depiction of their ‘idyllic’ life at Hailsham at the early age.  Unfortunately the characters never progressed much beyond this age.  One could take the position that the Hairsham characters were bred to be docile, possibly modified at the time they were sterilized, and that they had no free will in their actions, but we see no evidence of this in the book.

She is very good at being a carer and is lucky enough to be able to choose sometimes which donors she wants to look after.  She remembers days gone by and regales us with stories of her childhood growing up in Hailsham, an elite and special boarding school for children like Kathy.  Her best friends throughout school were Ruth and Tommy.  They grew up together and faced some of the typical clique issues throughout school.  However, Hailsham was different than other places.  There were mysterious rules and ambiguities.  The children were always told how special they were.  They were encouraged to be creative and artistic, showing their skills in art and poetry.  The best items were taken away by Madame to her gallery, for unknown reasons.  The rest were available for trading between the children.  The traded work, and few items specifically brought in for trade for the children, were the only possessions the children had.  They were treasured fiercely.<br /><br />Ruth, Tommy, and Kathy grow up together and Kathy found that she was more often than not the third wheel.  As Ruth and Tommy became a couple, Kathy was relegated to an outsider role, one where she was on the fringes, but not necessarily always a participant in events.  After leaving Hailsham, all three move on to the Cottages to live before becoming carers.  At the Cottages, the three get to interact with people who didn't grow up at Hailsham.  They see how normal people live their lives and have freedoms to do as they wish.  This is a new adventure for the three as they have grown up within boundaries and know their inevitable end.  They were born to be carers and then donors.  They begin to hear rumors at the Cottages that if they were in love, they could defer the time they had to begin being a donor.  There is tension and infighting and ultimately separation where Kathy leaves to start he life as a carer.  She reflects on her time at Hailsham and what it all meant, what her life now means, and what she didn't understand before.  The question is, is it too late to do anything about it.<br /><br />This was an ok read.  It was a bit slow at times as there isn't an overwhelming amount of action in the story.  There is a lot that happens over the course of Kathy's life, but the information is slowly trickled out, much like the information of cloning, donors, and completion was delivered to the Hailsham students.

Ishiguro contemplates an alternate reality where clones are raised for spare parts. Do I hear groaning? Relax, this isn't yet another rehash of a tired old science fiction troupe: step one, clones are blissfully ignorant; step two, clones realize they're only spare parts; step three, clones rebel. No, instead Ishiguro uses the premise to look inside the lives of the clones and explore what it means to be human through the lens of this particular dystopia. I don't think I'm spoiling anything if I tell you there is no rebellion. This is a hopeless situation and Ishiguro offers no pat solution for a happy ending. His story is about finding the spark of life within the hopelessness.<br /><br />The story begins with the clones as children and follows a linked trio as they progress all the way to the ends of their lives. It is a slow and mournful symphony that gets under your skin and stays there. No essay on bioethics could make the point better: there are consequences to our societal choices that run deep. He offers no solutions, just makes it impossible to turn a blind eye. Literary speculative fiction like this is rare. I guess this reflects the market, which caters to our ever-decreasing attention spans with a glut of fast paced, easy to digest fare. Too bad, because more speculative fiction like NEVER LET ME GO would elevate expectations and perhaps allow SF publishers to deliver more than the literary equivalent of blinking lights and loud noises.

First being, why didn't Tommy, Kathy, or any of the other adult clones try to do something about their fate?? They were seemingly free to walk about society without anyone watching over them. They looked like regular people. What was keeping them from jumping ship and starting a new life somewhere else? Start over with a new identity somewhere? I just can't get around this. I can't believe that people would have just rolled over and accepted this fate. Did people rebel? What happened if they tried (were there past consequences that kept people from rebelling? If so, what happened?)<br /><br />Also, I would have liked the details of 'donation'. What organs did they take first? What and who decides this? Why did some people die after donation #2 but some people lasted to #4? But why did no one live past that (was donation 4 where they took your brain/heart?)<br /><br />I just have a very unfinished, disturbed vibe after this book.

It requires a lot of patience due to its muted tone and almost deadening pace. I don't agree with reviewers who have said it could have been told as a short story but it certainly could have been condensed into an 80-page novella and been just as effective. That the book raises important questions about society and life and death and science and fate is admirable. That its style prevents many readers from finishing it, let alone understanding it, is a serious flaw.<br /><br />I'm not sure why Ishiguro made some of the choices he did. The restraint employed in telling the story added to the uneasy sense of fate closing in but also distanced me from the sad outcomes of the characters. In contrast to the slow-going narration of the first 250 pages, the climactic scene includes a gush of narrative explanation that seemed clumsy and tacked on. Like other readers, I was disturbed by the complete passivity of the characters. On the other hand, a less literal reading suggests that the book is not about the exploitation of human clones at all but about the mundane ways most people muddle through their lives and blindly accept their fates.<br /><br />\\""Never Let Me Go\\"" reminded me of a great episode of \\""Star Trek: The Next Generation\\"" called \\""The Measure of a Man.\\"" It involved the character Data, an android, having to prove his sentience to avoid being declared Starfleet property and being dismantled by order of a government bureaucrat.

The book is narrated by a young woman named Kathy. Kathy has a job as a &#34;carer&#34; (a sort of nurse) for special people called &#34;donors.&#34;  Kathy is telling the story of her life beginning when she was a student at an exclusive British boarding school called the Hailsham School. Kathy and her friends - Ruth,Tommy, Grace and others - seem to exhibit the usual kid behaviors. They form cliques, join clubs, tease each other, have fights, and so on. The kids also go to classes taught by teachers called &#34;guardians&#34; and have their best artwork and poems collected by a periodic visitor called &#34;Madame.&#34; In a lot of ways Hailsham seems more or less like a normal boarding school. It isn't however. The kids never seem to leave the school at all and we soon learn that they have no parents and are being groomed to be &#34;donors&#34; - which is just what you think it is. When the kids are grown they are expected to give away their body organs.  Though the premise of the book is intriguing the story moves along excruciatingly slowly. Moreover, it's hard to identify with the characters who are, for the most part, not particularly likable. I really hated Ruth, who was a bitch, a liar, a manipulator, and a thief. Even the &#34;nicer&#34; characters though, like Kathy and Tommy, don't inspire me to care about them very much.  As Kathy's story continues we see that the students finish their studies at the Hailsham School as teenagers and then move to &#34;cottages&#34; for a couple of years or so. By now the students are less sheltered and go out and about. They also engage in typical young adult behavior with a lot of hooking up and sex. After a couple of years or so in the cottages the students generally start their jobs as &#34;carers,&#34; after being carers for a while they become &#34;donors.&#34;  I kept expecting the author to explain more about what was going on in the story: These kids seem to be clones but where did they come from? Who got the organs (or were they for some kind of research)? Why did the kids go along with this program? Why were the students so casual about death and sex? I never got the answers though.

Maybe Hogwarts is okay, but Jane Eyre and the Orphans of Chaos had some very terrible experiences. Never Let Me Go is another story that involves children growing up at an isolated English boarding school called Halisham. The story is told by Kathy H., a Halisham student who has no memory of life before the school (like all the other students). She tells the story of growing up there and quite a bit of her life afterwards.<br /><br />Life at Halisham is both nurturing and mysterious. The children growing into adulthood go through the typical social dramas of life--cliques form and transform, shy or awkward students get bullied, interest in the opposite sex blooms. Most of the teachers take good care of them but some are frigid to or frightened of the students. The students' future is not clear. In fact, it seems ominous. One teacher, Miss Lucy, almost blurts out the secret but is removed. Meanwhile, the students are encouraged to make art and the head mistress collects the best to take away somewhere. The student have all sorts of theories about why she is collecting their works.<br /><br />After they complete their studies, Kathy and some of her class mates move to the Cottages, an interim spot from which some of them will become carers and others donors. Social interactions are still their primary interest but they also wonder even more about their future and their past. Students from other similar schools are at the Cottages and they have lots of questions about how well the Halisham pupils were treated. Life after the cottages for Kathy is one wandering around Great Britain caring for various donors. She tells us about her closest friends, Ruth and Tommy, as they go through the donation process.<br /><br />The big revelation of the mystery at the end of the book is not so surprising. Kathy and her friends make several wrong guesses about their lives which provides the characters with some pathos and motivation.<br /><br />The interesting part of the story is seeing them work through their ideas and emotions while their lives move along. Ultimately, they are dealing with a fate chosen for them, trying to understand it and make the most of it (but strangely enough, not change it). Kathy is a sympathetic character even if she isn't the brightest bulb in the pack. Ultimately, the unease of Halisham carries through the whole story. The students, even in their special circumstances, deal with issues in their lives similar to what all of us deal with--what is our place in the world, how we should treat others.

Throughout the book, it feels like the characters don't do anything. Their existence is as students in a boarding school, then at a home for those who turned sixteen.

Just a fair warning!!]<br /><br />This is a tricky book to review. I didn't mind the plot and I was somewhat moved by the story. It is a credit to Ishiguro that the real strength of the book was the complex and meaningful relationships between the characters. For example, Ruth-Tommy-Kathys' relationship was powerful and moving because it very much mirrored the relationships that many young adults and teenagers have. This relationship was portrayed (in a realistic fashion) as being complex and messy, just like many &#34;coming of age&#34; relationships are.<br /><br />So, why the low review? Well, I guess I just have to come out and say it.....the whole cloning/sci-fi/dystopian England aspect (dare I say theme?) of the book really diminished from the overall quality of the story. The strength of the book, in my opinion, was the aforementioned relationships between the characters. And while the cloning bit did provide an interesting backdrop for the story, it also detracted from the characters (what I mean is that at times I found myself engrossed by the characters and their actions....only to have a somewhat clumsy reminder that they are clones and this is a &#34;fake&#34; England--which in turn ruined the realism of the relationships and caused me to &#34;put distance&#34; between myself and the characters).<br /><br />Finally, and this is perhaps my most serve critique of the cloning/dystopian elements of the book, there was a head-scratching lack of fight against &#34;fate&#34; by the characters. For example, why didn't anyone (including Kathy) try and &#34;escape&#34;? Why was that option not even discussed? The characters were hoping to get a deferral....but they weren't willing to try and disappear or flee to another country? Seriously, I'm not saying there needed to be a big flight but the sad, resigned-to-fate actions of the characters really just seemed lazy and frankly inhuman. This, more than anything, really highlighted to me the flaw with including the cloning aspect of the story. I'm not against making the characters clones but it just would have made more sense to me that if Ishiguro was going to develop their human traits that he would have developed all the traits--including considering the possibility of seeking a different fate. This was especially puzzling because the characters would discuss their futures if they could have &#34;normal&#34; lives (example--Ruth talking about working in an office somewhere).<br /><br />As a result, the book just felt uneven and left me unsatisfied.

It is narrated in an almost conversational style by Kathy H., a thirty-one-year-old carer. Kathy reflects back on her life so far: her childhood at Hailsham School, a transitional period at The Cottages with her closest friends from Hailsham, and her working life caring for donors. In many ways, Hailsham resembles a typical English boarding school, giving its residents a sheltered upbringing, although it is soon apparent that this is no ordinary academic institution, and these students are, in fact, destined for a vastly different fate. Kathy’s narration concentrates on interactions between the students themselves and with their guardians, dwelling on incidents, conversations and reactions; it sounds, for a woman of her age, quite immature.

In addition, the main characters are strangely passive. You could argue that it's conditioning, but those in similar positions in history - for example, slaves - always rose up. Donors could have threatened suicide, banded together, tried to escape. If they look like everyone else, couldn't they have tried to slip into regular society? Something, anything but what they do - just watch passively and accepting everything as fate. The only thing that comes close is their asking for a 'deferral', but it didn't come close enough.<br /><br />Much like 'The Remains of the Day'. I am still trying to see what people see in this book. There are many dystopian novels vividly painted that portray horrific realities; there's nothing original about sci-fi involving the moral complexity of cloning. Only those who are unfamiliar with the vast genre of literary-quality sci-fi feel that a book is of value merely for coming up with such an idea. More is needed. Unfortunately we don't get it.<br /><br />Stylistically, there's nothing to keep one reading but plot, as the language is not exceptional or beautiful. Compare it to Cormac McCarthy's language, for example, which is worthy of being read out of context for its own right; even if I hated his book's topic I'd be compelled onward by the language itself. At least in 'Never Let Me Go' the language is clearly edited, clean and clear, but as someone who loves literary fiction and poetry I notice a strong absence of complex structure, imagery, or poetic rhythm. It's plain, plain words, but without the effect of Hemingway, to the extent that even adedicated reader begins to skim, then skip ahead. Only at the end did I begin to hope it would get good, that the meat of the novel would finally be revealed. Perhaps, I thought, he'll bring something out like a bomb, so shattering, that its contrast from the dullness of the rest of the book will give it heightened impact.<br /><br />No such luck.<br />Passive fatalism is dull, and people who are like sheep aren't the ones I want to read about, identify with, or ponder. Worlds without any cracks in the seams at all - a student who escapes? A teacher who tries to shelter the students? - such worlds are colorless. And the guardians fall flat. Why not bring them to life, have one who always wanted kids accept the clones as her substitute children, or something, anything to show us who they are, really, what their motivations are.<br /><br />Not to mention ludicrous aspects that real sci-fi genre authors are forced by alert readers to address. Like, how do people walk and have sex while missing 2-3 of their main vital organs? I think one donation should be enough to end a life - vital organs aren't called 'vital' for no reason.<br /><br />There's a whole world left out that we could have witnessed. Have them view clones growing in tanks, have an actual sighting of a 'possible', explain biologically why they are unable to reproduce if they have all the same organs as us - are they fully human duplicates? Or have they been altered not to have reproductive organs? Or just sterilized? Finding out these things one by one would be an interesting experience.<br /><br />Except, the character have so little curiosity. Yes, we get that people tend to accept whatever system they are raised in as the norm and not question. But not everyone. Someone always wonders. And once it's all out in the open, and they are coupled up and in love on the farm, you'd think there'd be some real discussion, self-questioning (are we human?), us vs. them, clone power!,  let's get the heck out of Dodge. Seriously.And if they look just like everyone else, why wouldn't they try to escape, or go exploring - are we seriously to believe they have freedom to go for long car rides and they just follow rules? Shouldn't they be tattoed or something, have a mark on their forehead to distinguish them from the 'normal' humans? In many ways I found this book unbelievable, and the first rule of sci-fi is that it must, however fantastic, create a believable dream a la Neuromancer. This book doesn't.<br /><br />All the author does is paint a situation.<br />I prefer books where the character inside the painted situation actually do something, and we get to go along for the ride.<br />With this book, all we do is get in a car going 20, and watch it accelerate to 25 on a flat stretch of unmarked highway. On a cloudy day. Not my idea of a literary masterpiece. Not even close.<br /><br />Still, for writers the book is worth reading as a guide of what NOT to do. For everyone else, just watch the movie, or better yet, skip both and do something more enlightening.",2014-01-02

I had read and enjoyed Ishiguro's earlier books, particularly Pale View of the Hills.<br /><br /> What intrigues me about Ishiguro is the way he has handled his dual Japanese/ British heritage. In Pale View, a Japanese mommy dearest, through projection and rationalization, is unable to accept her part in the suicide of her Japanese born daughter. His second book, An Artist of the Floating World, focuses on a Japanese collaborator who rather than experience a crises of conscience perceives nothing amiss with his wartime activities. His best known work, Remains of the Day, the story of a faithful retainer who follows the lead of his lord, a Nazi sympathizer, to the exclusion of his personal life, refects more of a samurai attitude than an than Anglo one. When We Were Orphans, takes place in Japanese occupied China.  Therefore, when we look at the bulk of Ishiguro's work, we see people  engaging in much rationalization, sometimes wartime collaboration and unable to see the larger truth,- all within the framework of the Japanese culture and wartime experience.<br /><br /> So when I began Never Let Me Go, I immediately referenced Japan: the carers = comfort women, the specialness of the boarding school = Japanese military academies, the passivity of accepting one's fate = the attitude of the Japanese people, and the gruesome nature of the donors reason for existence = unit 731 where heinous experiments were conducted on Chinese and Russian civilians, including vivisection without anesthesia [ incredibly many of the doctors who committed war crimes were not tried or punished and went on to hold high positions in post war Japan]. This is all overlaid with Anglo lady bountiful do gooderism, a  sentimentalized view of the public school and once again the passive voice of a narrator focused on minutia, rather than the real issues -all which worked so well in Remains of the Day.<br /><br />Ishiguro, in a brief interview posted on youtube said he was interested in examining mortality and our knowledge impending death over a compressed time span. Perhaps that is so.  But, I think, really, rather than a projected dystopian future what we have is a haunting examination of the inner lives of victims of  real historical events and their helplessness in experiencing what it meant to be 'inferior' to a 'superior' group of people which uses them in a most appalling way.<br /><br /> In any case, it is a book well worth reading.in Remains of the Day.<br /><br />Ishiguro, in a brief interview posted on youtube said he was interested in examining mortality and our knowledge impending death over a compressed time span.

They like the other students are not allowed out of the grounds and have no knowledge of the outside world except for what they learn in school.  The country is Britain in the 1970s.

The truth comes with a guardian who is promptly fired soon after, they are clones being raised solely for their organs and bodies to be used in donations.  The art and quality education is confusing to them but keeps them busy and feeling they are worthy of being something more than donations.  As adults they are sent to live in dilapidated cottages and are given jobs as caretakers.  Caretakers care for clones who are already donating.  Many clones survive 3-4,donations but are never told what they are donating and when they will die.  As life seems to be endless caretaking for donors, many caretakers finally choose the next step to become donors themselves where eventually they arrive at completion, the clone equivalent to death.

After Hailsham, her brief adolescence reveals more about the outside world, sex, and the dark expectations for her future as an organ doner.

However, except for the premise, which is revealed with great subtlety and naturalism, the setting for this novel could almost pass for one of those coming-of-age novels set in English boarding schools in the countryside, with the major characters almost real-world counterparts to Harry Potter and his cohorts. However, there are notes struck early on by the terminology that evoke a world containing only bleak futures for these pupils as we realize the purpose for which they are being groomed.<br /><br />Told as a first person narrative by the `survivor' of the boarding school Hailsham, Kathy H. begins her reminiscence with the wistful nostalgia of many narratives in which the narrator remembers an idyllic/troubled chapter from her childhood. English literature is full of these novels e.g. `Jane Eyre,' `David Copperfield.' The dynamic of a bonded triangle emerges early in the childhoods of Kathy and her friends, Ruth and Tommy. Inevitably, tension will arise between Kathy and Ruth and possessive struggles over a superior, romantic bond with Tommy will be sprinkled throughout their adolescence and even into early adulthood, as they graduate from Hailsham and move into The Cottages, converted barns in which they are rehearsing for an adult life in the outer world that none of them will have for more than a few years.<br /><br />The emotional tug-of-wars between them often left me mystified. Why is Ruth so upset over this action of Kathy's or what does Tommy really feel, independent of the expectations these two women project on him? There seems to be a missing element, as though these characters are incomplete. That seems to be precisely the intention. They are clones and, much like the androids/replicants of Philip K. Dick's `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and subsequent film version, `Blade Runner,' they have been kept in ignorance of their origins and left to contemplate their ultimate fates. It is natural for everyone, even clones, to want to find their true origins. Ruth becomes, for a time, obsessed with tracking down her `possible,' the genetic original from which she was modeled.<br /><br />The adjective `incomplete' is very appropriate here as their lives are revealed as extending into a vague, indefinite future where their `guardians' will release them carefully into the world until they are summoned for their first donations, culminating in `completion.' This is presented as a natural, predestined fate from which none of them can escape. There are rumors of deferrals, in which a couple can prove that they are in love with each other and possibly be granted a deferral they begin their donation process. Tommy's theory is that this was the purpose of all the artwork they were encouraged to produce, to be collected in the gallery of Madame, a mysterious, silent woman that periodically appears throughout the years to take from them to be included in her Gallery. The artwork is viewed as a window into their souls according to him. Like Ruth's obsession with her possible, Tommy's theory is his attempt to have some influence over his fate or at least to learn a reasonable explanation of it.<br /><br />Kathy is, in a sense, granted a deferral through her experience as a carer--she looks after various others like her as they go through their first, second, third, possibly fourth donation, however many it takes before they reach completion. She has a knack for being a carer and it provides her objectivity in dealing with the destinies of individual donors and prepares her for her own donation phase. Her serene manner and unquestioning acceptance of their fate makes the premise for this riveting novel even more horrific.<br /><br />Like other `creation in search of creator' novels such as Dick's `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and Mary Shelley's `Frankenstein,' `Never Let Me Go' asks the question, do these man-made humans have souls and if so, to what extent can they feel authentic love and emotion rather than counterfeit imitations of it? The heartbreak and pathos the reader feels upon the novel's completion seems to indicate that they do have souls; what they feel and what they experience is as real to them as our experiences are to us. Perhaps they feel even more intensely as the parameters of their lives are so clearly delineated for them and they are left in no doubt about the ultimate purpose of their lives.",2013-06-27

The premise is unfolded so slowly, subtly and masterfully, I wish I could have experienced it completely unspoiled. The story takes you in gradually, allowing you to become part of this alternate world, largely without realizing that's what's happening. And as each new detail is revealed, it is done without judgment or reflection. It is just a statement of how things are in this world. This writing technique allows the questions and thoughts to build and simmer in the mind of the reader, so that by the time the characters are expressing their own pain and anger at the destinies they have been born to, the reader is right there with them.<br /><br />But there is more to the story than its premise, and it's the deeper layers that make the story all the more disturbing. The blind acceptance of their dictated paths, the human tendency to fall in line with what society tells them is safe and will make them loved and accepted, and the frustration and feeling of resented helplessness that it causes is something that anyone can relate to, on some level. And this is why the book will haunt you, long after you finish it.<br /><br />This is not a new book, and there has been a movie made from it, so many will already be familiar with the story, but for those who are not, I won't reveal anything specific about it.

Not quite for the children of Kazuo Ishiguro’s 2005 novel Never Let Me Go.<br /><br />Growing up as average children in an East Sussex boarding school in England, the three main characters, Ruth, Tommy, and Kathy, appear to be normal kids in what may be a futuristic world. At the worst, you assume they may be orphaned. The “guardians” watch over the children, and encourage them to pursue their artistic skills for a frequent art competition, in which a strange woman visits the school and picks only the best art to display and sell. The narrator, Kathy, recounts the years before her time as a donor, including her childhood, young adulthood, and few years of womanhood. She fails to leave out any details, including her few experiences with sex, boys, and work. Caught between her love for her best friend, Ruth, and the boy she essentially rehabilitated from Social Siberia, Tommy, Kathy is forced to watch many of the proceedings from the outskirts of the book, yet her social commentaries and observations are right on target.

Not quite for the children of Kazuo Ishiguro’s 2005 novel Never Let Me Go.<br /><br />Growing up as average children in an East Sussex boarding school in England, the three main characters, Ruth, Tommy, and Kathy, appear to be normal kids in what may be a futuristic world. At the worst, you assume they may be orphaned. The “guardians” watch over the children, and encourage them to pursue their artistic skills for a frequent art competition, in which a strange woman visits the school and picks only the best art to display and sell. The narrator, Kathy, recounts the years before her time as a donor, including her childhood, young adulthood, and few years of womanhood. She fails to leave out any details, including her few experiences with sex, boys, and work. Caught between her love for her best friend, Ruth, and the boy she essentially rehabilitated from Social Siberia, Tommy, Kathy is forced to watch many of the proceedings from the outskirts of the book, yet her social commentaries and observations are right on target. From what readers can quickly tell about Kathy’s world, is that, oddly, her friends and other children are chosen as special organ donors.

This burst in scientific advancement is due in large part to a cloning program that creates clones - or students as they are known in the book - to donate as needed until their death. This seemingly horrific misuse of human life takes a decided backseat in the story, however, to the lives and lessons of the students, three in particular. Through their education, growth and discovery of what they are and what they mean to the larger world around them, we get a heartbreaking look at what makes a person human and how to find out what makes you unique in a world that is strictly laid out for you from birth.<br /><br />Narrated in first person by Kathy H. we get a glimpse into the life and mind of a student of Hailsham, an exclusive boarding school in the English countryside. Reminiscing back on her life, in particular her connections to two other students, Ruth and Tommy, she sorts through her memories as she comes to the time in her life when she will stop being a carer (a student who assists and comforts donors until they die) and will begin her donations. At times the narrative begins to ramble, but it is through these periods that the truth of what the students of Hailsham really are is revealed in small tidbits, making for a thoroughly unsettling feeling. The true emotional experience, however, comes as these three students struggle with the same issues all of us can relate to (finding out who you are, finding love, growing up and away from our childhoods) only on a much deeper and darker scale.<br /><br />Never Let Me Go is a brilliant look into the complexities of human growth and the various implications scientific advancement can have on all our lives, even those very ones it creates.

I finally read this much praised novel, so here are some additional thoughts from my perspective. It took me a while to get into it and to read below the surface: to discover the underlying moral questions and accept the resulting growing uneasiness with reading the novel. That getting below the banal and restrained description of the life of a group of young people, it turns out, is most important in Ishiguro's finely crafted story. From the opening pages, the narrator, Kathy, reminisces on her youth while preparing for a new stage in her life asa \\""carer\\"". It was a great disadvantage for me that I had watched the movie not so long ago, so I knew of the later developments in the story and the hints, when they are scattered among Kathy's memories, are building a much more complete picture as to what expect than an uninitiated reader would be able to have. The exploration of what happens to the children/students of Hailsham, and more importantly, why are they there, should come slowly, a bit like in a detective story...<br /><br />It is difficult to say anything about the deeper meaning of the novel without giving elements of the story away. Suffice to say that the first part reminded me in some aspects of real-life accounts of English boarding schools and, more disturbingly, of children's homes in the formerly East Germany. The \\""big brother\\"" image is not far-fetched. But then, there is much more here to ponder in terms of society's preoccupations, science's advances and the preservation of human values.

I purchased the book after a friend recommended it, and started reading it without knowing any of the plot. I recommend other people read it like that too. Ishiguro is a master of foreshadowing, and the future of the characters is never fully explained until the end of the book, although there are hints throughout.<br /><br />There are three main characters: Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy, and the novel follows their sometimes difficult friendship. The characters are vivid and capture your heart. The first half of the book takes place at a boarding school (Hailsham) with no contact with the outside world, save \\""Sales\\"", where items are brought in for the students to purchase. The mysterious Madame, outbursts of teachers, and the way they're treated by the landlord at the post-Hailsham cottages all foreshadow how the rest of the world views them. They grow up with no knowledge of their fate, but even to the end they remain hopeful that there's a way out.<br /><br />As the students get older, they resign themselves to what they were brought up to do. Kathy, the main character, holds on to her memories to help herself deal with her life, and to remember her companions.

The characters never seem to grow up (even though three stages in their lives are depicted).<br />The hype on the covers talk about it being a frightening vision of the future - excuse me? There's nothing frightening about this book at all... it's a frustrated teenage romp through inadequacy - right up to age thirty-one.<br />I'm going to ask you a simple question - you're a clone, you've been bred to provide body parts for others, your life's going to be short.... how do you feel?

This relationship develops. It has its breakdowns and its reconciliations. It's sad because it's about loss. Futures are lost because of this silliness, this dysfuncionality between the three and, as we see, they never really grow up.

The fragments of the main character remained with me for a long time after I saw the film version. Then I read the novel a few months later. I was again blown away with sadness and reflections on the various meanings I projected on the book. Indeed, after reading so many reviews here, it appears that there endless interpretations of Never Let Me Go: a commentary on the developing ethics of cloning, a love story, a tragedy, a coming-of-age story, science fiction, definitely not science fiction, a metaphor for animals rights, a metaphor for hopelessness and the futility of life, and on and on. The genius of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel is that it causes people to ruminate and debate.<br /><br />I can't add much after nearly 750 reviews. If you want to know whether to read it or not, I'd tell you that it should be your top priority to read this book as soon as you can. It's that good.<br /><br />Still, as I said, the book left me thinking about its meanings for days. Here are some of my thoughts after having read it:<br /><br />In a closing scene (as an adult) Tommy notes that Ruth is a keeper of faith. With nothing to go on but the word of others, she holds out (probably against her better judgment) that justice or some fleeting reward will prevail. Meanwhile, Tommy notes that he and Kathy are more level-headed and search for a practical means to those same ends. They seek evidence and reassurance. Ultimately the three find no answers and encounter a large amount of regret spanning back years. For me, this can be a metaphor for the religious believers in society vs. those who place their stock in science and logic. Both may find at the end of life that there are more questions than answers.<br /><br />Ishiguro crafts his characters so well that it's only in hindsight that you realize how thoughtful an author he is. Among the children at Hailsham, and later at the Cottages and finally in the Centres, the \\""students\\"" are almost always isolated and segregated off from \\""normal\\"" society. Years and years pass and the minds and habits of the students are in some ways twisted by the seclusion. The children fill the void of loneliness with each other.  More importantly, they fill the void of knowledge with rumors and homemade folklore that follows them even into adulthood. From tales of the woods behind Hailsham to stories about Madame's Gallery or deferrals or how everything that someone loses ends up in Norfolk (the list goes on). This may be one of the central themes that ties Never Let Me Go together: a lifetime of ignorance and delusion brought on by loneliness culminate in a brutal conclusion when the truth finally comes out.<br /><br />Yet even when the truth is totally laid bare, the characters march toward their fate almost without complaint and certainly without resistance. One of the few times that someone who isn't \\""one of them\\"" actually speaks in the novel, Madame Marie-Claude notes that a new world was quickly approaching and there was little anyone could do to stop it. As Miss Emily concurs, no one would go back to the \\""dark times\\"" even if they did feel sympathy for people like Ruth, Tommy, and Kathy. As readers, we can look to all the disposable people in our society whom we go out of our way to ignore and cast aside: Chinese factory workers who are maimed and killed making electronics for Western consumers, sweatshop workers, migrant farm workers, immigrants in all manners of jobs, adult and child prostitutes, prisoners... the list goes on. We cast these people aside and often refuse to acknowledge their humanity because it benefits us in some way.

Readers who stick to lit fic may well find the issues in this novel thought-provoking, but anyone familiar with SF will have encountered it all before, and much as it hurts me to say so, more deftly handled. I feel like Ishiguro just didn't want to bother addressing any of the practical questions many other reviewers have raised because he wanted to focus on whatever the point of the novel was supposed to have been, but readers of quality SF are used to having it all - good writing and some oh, I don't know, PLOT to go along with their ethical/philosophical/sociological musing.<br /><br />Saddest of all to me was that ultimately it felt like an early novel, rather than an accomplished book by a master of the craft.

I believe that Remains of the Day is clearly his best; this book, similar in some respects with the genteel British setting (and obviously different in others, given the differences in genre) , doesn't quite measure up to that one, but it was still really quite good.<br /><br />It's difficult to discuss the story without spoiling it, but it is worth saying that while many people talk about the surprise twist in this book, the fact that it is a surprise isn't really that important. The 'twist' is revealed gradually and organically, and the reader comes to it slowly in a way that when you actually get to it, it's not really a surprise, and instead just a mystery gradually revealed. This is all proficiently done.<br /><br />What Ishiguro excels at is getting in the mind of his protagonists, and he has done so again here. It is interesting, though, that while Kathy, the story's center, does experience a large number of emotions, she remains relatively passive and resigned throughout everything, and seems to be at peace with how things happen. She never really has a breakthrough moment of clarity, and accepts her position in life and society without realizing its full injustice. Ishiguro is often a writer who focuses on our regrets; this novel departs from this a bit in that the regrets aren't really held by the main characters; they are instead simply resigned to their fates. Dark stuff indeed, though it lacks the heartbreak that I might have found had at least some part of his protagonists recognized and protested (if only partly, or if only for a short time!) their fates.<br /><br />In any case, the book is beautifully written, well paced, and expertly structured.

The characters shy away from asking awkward questions about their lives and so does the author in this story. I wouldn't want a book to try to give all the answers to fundamental questions of life, but this one doesn't actually formulate the questions. It does raise questions, but everything is peripheral and hinted at rather than explicit, so which questions the reader asks are the ones they already have concerns about.<br />He puts a group of people into a nightmare scenario and leaves them to make sense of their lives. They do not find reasons, but do find acceptance within themselves. They know from very young that their purpose in life is to die for others, although they only gradually come to a full realisation of this. They have hopes of a possible escape through first artistic achievement and later falling in love and being in a stable couple. Neither of these offer a way out, so they are left with finding consolations to make their short lives more bearable. The best consolations turn out to be friendship and memories, and for Kathy the fulfillment of caring for others.<br /><br />What questions or issues might this book also raise:<br />The nature of humanity. Are human clones human? If they are, are some humans more valuable than others? Does this hint at discrimination against any group of humans?<br /><br />The fragility of life. Mortality is at the forefront of the characters minds in the central and latter part of the novel. (They are mostly in denial in the earliest part.) If you know your life will be short, would this book help you come to terms with that? What would you do to prolong your own life, if it might be at the expense of another's?<br /><br />The use and abuse of science. This book is not science fiction and any science in it is at best vague. (Which body parts are they donating? To whom? Who are the originals? How many are there, so are the clones batches or individuals?) The scientific issue is still there in the background.<br /><br />Ethical farming. If an animal (or human clone) is being raised simply to be killed for meat (or spare body parts) does it matter if it has a good quality of life? This question is more explicitly asked than some of the others, although I may think that because it is one I already consider. Hailsham is an experiment in giving these clones a pleasant environment to grow up in. Most clones grow up in much worse places (hinted at by mentions of electrified fences, and a minor character who shudders at his memories). The experiment is abandoned, but the raising of clones for spare body parts is not.<br /><br />I still do not think I understand this book.

I first heard about this book on PBS .  It is definitely a science fiction book plus the story of human relationships.  Let's hope the science fiction part doesn't become reality.<br /><br />The story is told by Kathy H and set in England about ten years ago.  Kathy is 31, involved in a career that causes her to drive many miles to many places around England.  She tells readers about her childhood, then brings readers up to her present.  The book is divided into three parts, Kathy and her friends at private school, leaving school and preparing for their careers, then working at their careers.<br /><br />Kathy tells of Hailsham School, a private school that taught and catered to these children, they were special, were going to do great things.  She tells of the some of the teachers or guardians, Miss Emily, the headmistress, Miss Geraldine, the kids favorite teacher, Miss Lucy the teacher who quits the school in anger.  There are many students, different ages, different grades.  Kathy has many friends, her two best friends are Ruth who is a born leader, outgoing, bossy and chooses Kathy as a friend.  Tommy is goofy and gets picked on by others.  The school is located in a beautiful section of England, located away from civilization.  The children are catered to as this is a private school and encouraged to be creative.  A foreign woman, Madam, comes and chooses the best art, paintings, poetry, writings and other creative work done by the kids to put  in her gallery.  The children never leave Hailsham, there are never parents visiting.<br /><br />Then when the kids are sixteen they leave Hailsham and move on to a facility where they are to learn careers.  They are allowed more freedom and are not overprotected as when younger.  They come and go as they please and are happy to do so.  They enjoy going to town, visiting, shopping, eating at restaurants.  Ruth and Tommy become a pair, so in love. Kathy is a thirdwheel, decides to leave this facility early and start her career.<br /><br />The book begins when Kathy is driving all over the countryside, driving long distances to different facilities.

Kathy is doing well in her career but is deciding to go further ahead.

Nevertheless, Ishiguro underpins the story with a disquieting secret which he slowly illuminates through the book's three parts. The book begins with an introduction by Kathy, the narrator, a woman in her early thirties, and a \\""carer\\"" for \\""donors\\"" of which she will soon become one. Kathy assumes we know what these terms means, yet there's an obvious discomforting undercurrent in these terms and the strange conversations and memories she discusses. Kathy quickly takes us back to her childhood at the boarding house, Hailsham. Beginning there, Kathy describes her life and her relationship with two friends, Tommy and Ruth, that become the focus of the book. Following the story of these three characters, the book slowly reveals to both the reader and the characters the latter's place in the world.<br /><br />Ishiguro parcels out the truth in small increments, and in such a way that requires the reader to understand the implications and subtext in these revelations. The most unsettling aspect of this choice is that it's never quite clear, at least it wasn't for me, whether you've managed to grasp the full horror of the world. Though, I won't reveal any plot points, the rest of this paragraph may tip you off to something you may not want to have spoiled, reader beware. From the first pages, the reader has a good idea about the secret of the book, you probably have one from this review itself. Yet, I couldn't help wondering if there was something more. I wanted there to be something more, something less casually corrupt. I subconsciously hoped for an antagonist to embody the unstated yet known evil. But, there isn't one. And that makes the story far more compelling than what I expected. There's no force or group to stifle, no particular person to blame. And, perhaps worst of all, the characters seem to accept their ultimate fate unquestioningly and without complaint. Ishiguro reveals these facts late in the book, and though this manner of exposition is the type of literary device I typically hate, the lead up and execution made up for any faults.<br /><br />This is an absolutely fantastic book. Though a dystopia novel, the book only briefly broaches the world outside these three characters' lives. There's little overarching story or plot. Instead, we're told a story focused on the mundane aspects of growing up in a boarding school, the romantic interests of teenagers, and these characters' short adulthood, all the while interspersed with the compelling and troubling reality that this isn't a normal or fair world.

This was not touching, or intresting, and it really should have been. Ishiguro tried to ring it all in at the end, piling up the \\""moving\\"" elements of the story, but it was too little to late.

Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth are real - they are us, the readers, and they smell of our lives in all its complexities. I read this book twice. The first time took me roughly fourteen hours. About four days later, I picked it up again and finished it in about six. Both times the fundamental truth that underpins our own lives is startlingly clear in the memories Kathy remembers: no matter how long we have, it is never, ever enough. We all want to defer completion. Wouldn't it be nice to have another three years? Hell, why not swing for four?<br /><br />Kathy H. presents her life without guile or angst. She is young, but she is old. In the end, it seems like she's accepted her fate. She isn't going to rage against the dying of the light. Instead Kathy meets her preordained fate with resigned acceptance. The story isn't a tale of free will versus destiny, it is a study of life and living, and the incomprehensible difference between them; the nature of the human soul, love and longing, friendship, existence, and Time.<br /><br />Ishiguro has incredible insight into the human condition. Without saying as much, he points out the certainty in our world that we would sacrifice the lives and liberty of artificial humans for the sake of preserving our own kind. I suppose the story is as much about the needs of the many over the wants of one, but I've never read anything else where I've wanted so badly for the wants of one to be so selfishly fulfilled. \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" is dark and beautiful, powerful and moving.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.***<br /><br />Set in the late 1990s in England, Ishiguro's novel centers on Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy, three young people raised at Hailsham, a special boarding school for clones. They grow up with the knowledge that they will be allowed to live into their late twenties before they're required to begin donating their vital organs through a series of operations. The novel reminds me of Niffenegger's The Time Traveler's Wife in that it employs a science fiction premise (time travel as a genetic disorder), but chooses instead to focus entirely on the domestic elements of day-to-day life. Unlike the The Time Traveler's Wife, which is by far an easier read than Ishiguro's meandering text, the reader gets no grasp of the characters at all. The main body of the narrative consists of Kathy's passive reminisces of her childhood and young adulthood at Hailsham, as well as her occupation as a \\""carer,\\"" a sort of hospice job for the still whole clones to look after the dying ones who, as the novel puts it, are \\""close to completion.\\"" The way Kathy goes through her memories in a \\""By the way, that reminds me of the time...\\"" sort of manner is positively infuriating. There's no flow to the story, which made my reading experience of plowing through this disjointed novel very frustrating.<br /><br />Its use of science fiction elements is another problem. Being from a family that reveres classic science fiction (literature by authors like Asimov, Heinlein, Dick, etc. that speculates about futuristic ideas and how they would affect society), I found myself unable to take this novel seriously. You would think that such a fictional society wouldn't be the England of today, but perhaps an England in an alternate universe where the Nazis won World War II. Naturally, having already eradicated the Jewish race and other undesirables, such a society would have no qualms whatsoever about allowing the barbarity of forced organ donation to take place. The fictional society of Never Let Me Go, however, is more or less exactly the same as the real-life England that Ishiguro himself calls home. As an author, he is too lazy to address the questions that will inevitably surface with the subject of cloning: in a society so very similar to our own, how is it that human rights groups would allow forced organ donation to go unchallenged? Besides, why clone people? If science has progressed so far that cloning people is commonplace, then why can't they just clone organs? I understand that, strictly put, this novel is meant to be a literary one, despite its dystopian premise, but the author really has no business messing about with such a subject unless he's prepared to fully explore it.

Characters    The book is told from the first person view of Kathy, who is remembering her life growing up at the Hailsham boarding school in England.  The book revolves around Kathy and her two best friends from the school, Ruth and Tommy.  Kathy is in many ways an average student (most of the book takes place during their school years) and I could identify with her greatly.  She in many ways deferred to the more outgoing Ruth and in some ways was on the outskirts of the most popular groups in the school.  I enjoyed her character and I thought that the way her character was written was one of the high points of the book.    Setting    Most of the spoilers of this book are related to the setting, and I don't want to spoil the books in my reviews, so I won't go too far into it.  But the book is set in England from the 1970s or so to the late 1990s.    Plot    The book is essentially told as a flashback with Kathy talking about her life.  The way that the book unfolds is very natural.  She will start talking about one subject, and it will remind her of something else, and she'll go back and forth a little between the two subjects.  The book seemed to stretch on a little bit from time to time, but looking back I don't think I can see anything that you would be able to cut without losing something from the story.    Enjoyment    The book starts out fairly cheerfully, but throughout the book there is an increasing tension and the feeling that something is wrong with the way that the world works for these characters.  The book is never rushed in its pacing, it takes its time to get where its going, and the book is very well done.  The book also raises some interesting moral questions that we may eventually have to deal with.  I try to review all of my books with the standard Character/Setting/Plot topics as a template, but this book is more than just the combination of those three, the theme and moral questions that it raises are more important.    Overall Grade    This would be a wonderful book to read with a thought provoking reading group, but it's still a good book to read, although it may not be for everyone.    7/10",2011-06-20

Anywa, I kind of had an idea of what the book was about since I had read a couple of reviews for the movie. I can say reading the reviews kind of ruined the book a bit for me, but I tried to ignore it. The book is told from Kathy's point of view, as she remembers her time at Hailsham and her friends there, Tommy and Ruth, who become a couple during their adolescent years. And you can already see the triangle forming, don't you? Children at Halsham are special, and have a purpose in their lives that also makes their life span very short. I won't say what it is because that was one of the things that I got spoiled on movie reviews and I wished I hadn't.<br /><br />I think this book is great for book clubs, it will , for sure, generate discussion. Not only is the characters motivations, such a Ruth's, to be discussed, but also Hailshams policy on the children. Whether should  the children know why they are in Hailsham or not, and even going beyond the book  and asking whether is fair to use these children in this manner. I found the Ruth character very unlikeable, even when she does have a redeeming gesture toward the end of the story. Still, I could understand her insecurity and her motivations for trying to keep Tommy and Kathy apart, but mostly I wondered why both Tommy and Kathy allowed themselves to be bullied by Ruth.  Also, there wasn't a point where I felt I was missing out on other character's motivations or stories, even when the book is told from Kathy's point of view the author does a great job at describing their motivations. There was a lot of sex in this book though, not graphic just a lot of talk and mentions of it.<br /><br />Audiobook Review: Rosalyn, the narrator, has a gorgeous accent.

I had heard of it and knew it had received critical praise, so I picked it up. Within a few pages it became clear that this was a science-fiction/dystopian/alternate reality novel, which was not at all apparent from the summary on the back. At this point, I was pretty irritated because I do not usually enjoy those types of novels.<br /><br />Fortunately, I stuck it out with this book and it ended up being rewarding. Stylistically, this is a quick read; the prose is deft, airy, and never pretentious or dense. Ishiguro has an uncanny knack for portraying the sometimes bewildering mood swings and outbursts of teenagers with empathy. As someone who was a teenage girl myself not long ago, his realism and insight impressed me and I found the characters almost painfully believable.<br /><br />As I said, I knew very little about the book when I bought it, but it didn't take long for me to become ensnared in the web of dark fatalism that surrounds the plot. Believing in the characters just exacerbated my anxiety for them, and the author did a good job of manipulating the reader's emotions enough to cause suspense and yet make the ending seem natural and even inevitable. My emotional reaction to this book was very intense, which I wasn't expecting at all. However light it may be in style, it is definitely not so in theme or subject matter. It reminds me of Joyce Carol Oates's comments about [[ASIN:1936594285 Wuthering Heights]], which she says tests how far we go in interpreting Heathcliff's ostensible villainy as tragic heroism to satisfy our romantic impulses; this is a book that made me aware of how hard I was hoping for a happy ending or deus ex machina, however ridiculous.<br /><br />Overall, despite the sci-fi elements and bioethics issues raised, this is at heart a novel with very humanistic themes that doesn't get unduly weighed down by the details of its alternative reality.

On one level everything seems so normal, while on another level nothing is completely right.<br />Never Let Me Go is the memoir of Kathy H. She is recalling her childhood as she nears the end of her career as a \\""carer\\"".  As she obsessively relates details of her boarding school childhood, she gradually reveals the sinister purpose of the exclusive education she and her friends received.  So, the book is a dystopian cautionary tale about the ethical dilemmas of a near future where human cloning is a real possibility. Well, yes it is, but why does Ishiguro go to such lengths to make it all seem so commonplace? The sacrificial clones apparently accept their fate with only the most impotent of protests.  They make a cult of exclusivity to be obtained solely by those who are about to make a third \\""donation\\"".  They literarily never say die; the correct word for death is completion. Even the Hailsham guardians who bucked the system to create better conditions for clones did not look beyond that. Hailsham made an underlying atrocity seem pretty and acceptable to all.<br />And that seems to be the key to Ishiguro.  Somewhere, I read that Margaret Atwood said, \\""An Ishiguro novel is never about what it pretends to be about.\\""<br />I've read three of his books now.

I bought the book anyway as I needed something to read during several long flights.    In the most general terms, the book follows three characters (Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy) throughout their lifetime: from childhood to adulthood and then death.  The author describes in vivid detail seemingly mundane scenes throughout their lives.  Only in the third part of the book does it pick up and questions are finally answered, perhaps not to the satisfaction of some.    What is striking about this is the characters are being cultivated for their organs.  As a minor character notes in the first part, the lifespan of our main characters is shortened considerably.  Perhaps mid-30s, tops.    Instead of giving an exhaustive review of the book, I just wanted to point out the thoughts that struck me while reading the book.    Several reviewers noted/complained that the book was slow, boring, mundane, etc.  I will admit I was annoyed while reading some of these passages.  However, the premise of the book, as I and other see it, is what defines a human?  As I read the book, the style of narration (first person, Kathy's point of view) seemed very personal to me, like she was recalling a story.  These recollections might be something I might have.  In other words, in recalling a story, I might describe certain details that I thought were important and not others, i.e. it is subjective, not objective.  Moreover, Kathy's memories contained emotions and feelings.  Clearly these are things experienced by humans.  Perhaps the author wrote this way on purpose to subtly inform the reader of Kathy's humanity.  Our humanity shows itself in the details of everyday life, e.g. the small interactions we have with people.  In showing Kathy and the others this way, I believe the author shows his views that the characters are human, despite being cloned.    Near the end of the story, I noticed that if I ignored the Kathy et al.'s ages that the emotions they were experiencing may be similar to those experienced by the elderly and terminally ill.  One scene in particular pertains to one Ruth clearing her conscience before completing.  I am speculating, but this seems like she wanted to make herself right with the world/her maker/whatever before dying.  Other scenes seems to support this idea as well.    Finally, it struck me how a lot of the scenery seemed very empty and lonely.  While the scenery in the first part of the book is full of life and is lush, like a garden, the scenery gets more desolate and lonely as the book goes on.  Especially at the end, Kathy describes driving through empty roads and walking down long empty streets.  It is at this point I realized that though these characters are human (in my mind), they are so isolated and alone, sometimes even from others like them.  Again, for some reason this made me think of growing old and the loneliness that may come with aging as loved ones die one by one.  The final scene seems to acknowledge this with a tone of inevitability.       One reviewer warned future readers that they might cry.  I didn't cry.  I just have this sinking feeling in my gut like I was punched.

Her voice alone carries the reader forward, creating a subtle, almost suspenseful undertone to seemingly banal memories and reminisces through the first half of the novel.  At times it can be nostalgic, always sad, and strangely foreboding, but for a reason that I could never quite pin down.  This is because nothing of Kath, Tommy, and Ruths' future is explicitly revealed through their time at Hailsham, but the behavior of the teachers - Miss Lucy in particular - and strange policies of the school - \\""The Gallery\\"" in particular - foreshadow a haunting outcome for these children.  However, it's this same voice that seems to detract from the end of the novel.  I never really felt any variation in her narration, even during extremely tense, emotional scenes later in the novel.  Descriptions of past behavior were revealing, but I felt that the narrator should have lost her even-keel during some of the climactic scenes with Tommy and Ruth.  I guess this was intentional, but I had trouble getting past the narration and truly feeling for the characters during these points in the novel.  Having her break down emotionally in her narration during some of these events would have evoked a stronger response in the reader, in my opinion.    In terms of subject matter, do not expect science fiction.  I didn't, and I had no problem with the way the story is told.  Minimal description is given of the how the setting of the novel came to be, and how things work from a scientific standpoint.  For many, all of it may seem a little far-fetched, and when I look at it from a scientific standpoint, I feel the same way.  It's hard to believe in a 1990's England with these sorts of policies and practices.  However, that's not the point of the novel, and the fact that the author gives little detail on the science and reason for the setting is intentional.  Rather, the author is subtly driving us to consider the morality and ethics of the situation the characters are in, and not how they got there.

You could knock me over with a feather by the end of the story.<br /><br />In the rural British countryside resides Hailsham, a privileged and insular boarding school with wild fields, ponds, and fences demarcating boundaries from the outside world.  The story is narrated in three parts by thirty-one year-old Kathy, who reminisces about herself, Ruth, and Tommy, three friends who met there as children.  It reads like a chronicle or diary, with Kathy's alchemy of naturalness, naivet&eacute;, and sublime powers of observation reminiscing almost like an open letter.

US,15394148,RHT2MHJRBMFEV,1400078776,813354201,"Never Let Me Go",Books,5,3,4,N,N,"Haunted me to sleeplessness","Ever read a book that affected you so much you kept waking up throughout the night thinking about it? Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro is not horror nor can it be classified as the typical science fiction novel, despite the fact that it has a decidedly science fiction premise and ultimately made me horrified for its characters.     Before going any further, I must caution you that if you're even thinking about reading this book - don't watch the movie trailer! It gives too much away. And although I am going to try not to reveal too much in my review; it will be difficult as the very elements that kept me up at night are the ones that would spoil it for you. If you want Never Let Me Go to take you utterly by surprise - stop reading this review and go straight to the book. Although, don't devour it all at once late at night like I did or it will keep you up, and once you do fall asleep, it will be an uneasy night for you.     Never Let Me Go starts out with 31-year-old Kathy H. looking back on her childhood at a private boarding school, Hailsham, and the friends she made there, Ruth and Tommy. She describes innocent-seeming childhood intrigues and on the surface her time at Hailsham, in the English countryside, is bucolic. Likewise, the tone of the book is calm and unhurried; Kathy's point of view is nostalgic but observant. However, their world, Hailsham, and society in general, has a subtle shade of surreal. Although the setting feels like contemporary England, the reality of the book is off-kilter; under the surface something profoundly disturbing lies in wait for these children.     \\""You've been told and not told,\\"" a minor character, a teacher at Hailsham tells the children in one pivotal scene. This aptly describes the experience of reading Never Let Me Go. From the beginning, words like \\""carer,\\"" donation,\\"" \\""donor,\\"" and \\""completion\\"" are woven into the narrative as ordinary terms. What they mean and how they affect the characters are depicted as a matter of course; yet as the children's ordinary existence is slowly, subtly exposed to be extraordinary, the sense of disquiet turns into horror.     \\""Thinking back now, I can see we were just at that age when we knew a few things about ourselves--about who we were, how we were different from our guardians, from the people outside--but hadn't yet understood what any of it meant. I'm sure somewhere in your childhood, you too had an experience like ours that day; similar if not in the actual details, then inside, in the feelings. Because it doesn't really matter how well your guardians try to prepare you: all the talks, videos, discussions, warnings, none of that can really bring it home...    All the same, some of it must go somewhere. It must go in, because by the time a moment like that comes along, there's a part of you that's been waiting. Maybe from as early as when you're five or six, there's been a whisper going at the back of your head, saying, 'One day, maybe not so long from now, you'll get to know how it feels.' So you're waiting, even if you don't quite know it, waiting for the moment when you realise that you really are different to them; that there are people out there, like Madame, who don't hate you or wish you any harm, but who nevertheless shudders at the very thought of you--of how you were brought into this world and why--and who dread the idea of your hand brushing against theirs. The first time you glimpse yourself through the eyes of a person like that, it's a cold moment. It's like walking past a mirror you've walked past every day of your life, and suddenly it shows you something else, something troubling and strange.\\""    Let me be clear: there is no gore, nothing graphic, nothing explicit - yet the images and the possibilities suggested by Never Let Me Go haunted me to sleeplessness.     ***SPOILERS***      For those who've read the book- this is what kept me up at night-    Why did they never try to escape??? It didn't seem from the story as if they hadGPS devices on them or anything like that. What could have kept them from hiding out or running away so that they didn't have to provide \\""donations?\\"" What was astounding was they didn't even want to; it never occurred to any of the characters to do that. The most that they hoped for was to get a \\""deferral\\"" or to put off their \\""donations\\"" for 3 years.     For ordinary humans, that is non-genetically engineered ones, the will to live is primal, biological. But these are no ordinary children. As clones, they've been genetically engineered to provide healthy organs for ordinary humans. Further, they've been engineered to be sterile as well. Although, it's never said, I think that the children have been bred to be docile to. If you recall, the first cloned animal was Dolly, the sheep. That's what the characters acted like - docile sheep, both as adults and children. They've been bred and reared to not stray from the herd nor from the path chosen for them since birth.     Towards the end, two of the characters try to get a deferral; the scene is heartbreaking, not only because they were doomed but because even though they were adults in their 30s, their logic and emotional maturity were those of extremely naive and trusting children.     Also, I kept thinking of how many donations the characters could make before \\""completing.\\"" What exactly does that mean anyway? 3 seems to be the number; so what can you donate and still be alive? A kidney, a lung, bone marrow, eyes? Once you get to the liver, pancreas, and heart - well you're pretty much done for. Even the characters didn't know what happened after \\""completing.\\"" Although there is a nebulous fear of existing in a vegetative state somewhere until their remaining organs are harvested, this not knowing is accepted. No one questions it or their fate for that matter.",2010-10-03

Ishiguro writes his book in such a passive tone, that some readers may find it boring.  In the first act of the book, we learn about Kathy's past with her revisiting every childhood memory she deems important.  We slowly learn that there is something unusual about her and her classmates, but the true story does not begin until we have gotten over the initial horror after learning what it is.  It is after this that some readers may become uninterested with the plot, although I feel it may be the most genuine story of my generation.  Never Let Me Go is not a romance novel, nor is it an adventure story.  Although there is love, there is very little longing and sorrow that often comes from messy love triangles.  And the most adventurous part of the story is when Kathy and her friends spend a day following a woman whom they do not know, and have absolutely nothing to gain by visiting her.  Yet there is such a beauty in this book, and such a longing for a happy ending that you may find yourself unable to resist turning to the next page.  The characters in this book know their terrible fates and at some point fear it, yet they never run away from it.  It is the only life they know, and to break the rules by running away or fighting back seems unthinkable to them.

I'd also call this a post-modern book except that Ishigoro states that it takes place in the 1990's.  However, this novel wowed me.  I could not put it down once I'd started it.<br /><br />The story is about a tight-knit group of students who go to a boarding school in England called Hailsham.  On the surface, Hailsham is like any other posh place.  However, once you look under the surface, there is something very odd lurking.  The students have never been out of Hailsham and they are unfamiliar with the 'ordinary' world except for what they learn from their teachers or textbooks.  There is no internet nor is there any computer learning.  The students are preparing to be 'donors'.  They know this but they don't really know what it is.  As the book says, they are \\""told but not told\\"".  They are children raised by their teachers at Hailsham who are called guardians.  They don't have families or parents.  They have been created through some sort of cloning for the purpose of giving their organs to others once they reach a certain age.<br /><br />The main characters in the book are Ruth, Tommy and Kathy.  Kathy is the narrator and the novel is told through her eyes.  Ruth is the ringleader of their group, and her moodiness and opinions often set the tone for how the others feel.  Tommy starts out as a young boy who is angry all the time, filled with tantrums and acting out.  As he matures, he learns to control his anger and fit in with the rest of the students.  Kathy is a pleaser.  She wants everyone to get along, to make things right with others.<br /><br />The students are encouraged to be creative.  About four times a year they have 'exchanges', a time when they are able to choose items that they or other students have created - poems, paintings, drawings, sculptures.  However, before the students get to pick their choices, a mysterious 'Madame' comes to the campus and gets to go through the artwork first.  The students have a rumor that she has a gallery somewhere.  For creating this artwork, the students are given tokens and these tokens serve as their currency to buy things at 'sales'.  About four times a year, a white van pulls into Hailsham and the students are given an opportunity to buy items that it delivers.

Kathy has feelings for Tommy and vice-versa, but Kathy holds back as Ruth and Tommy have a relationship despite Ruth's crude attitude and indifference.

Firstly, and perhaps most importantly the book is very well written. The visual landscape, if simple, is rich; and the narrative, though slow, builds upon itself in such a way as to exact maximum impact at the climax of the novel. And it is this impact which I'd like to spend some time talking about.     This book is soul crushingly depressing as even Cormac McCarthy and Ian Mcewan (I'm reminded of Atonement, perhaps in part by Keira Knightly's turn in both movies) novels are not. Even 1984, dystopia of dystopias struck me as more uplifting. In part, I take this as a perhaps unintended side effect of what I consider the weaknesses of the novel. As other reviewers note, this is in some ways a strange, perhaps even psychologically uncompelling world, even as dystopias go. Where today PETA and Greenpeace raise a ruckus over endangered owls (and I only poke half jokingly), what kind of cold uncaring world would have to exist to raise children for spare parts.    Clearly this is a central thematic concern of the novel, but for the best of this world to be the cold and distant Emily and Madame or the utterly powerless Miss Lucy seems almost absurd. Add to this the paralyzing apathy of the main characters themselves, and even 1984 looks like a nice place to live. Plus it isn't as if the terrible central conceit of the novel is hidden from society. No evil corporations (see the perhaps more believable Moon) or governments to blame this time. No deep, dark conspiracies as the students wander around freely. Nope, just the most cynical and uncaring civilization ever conceived. Seriously, even the post apocalyptic wasteland of Mad Max looks friendly in comparison to England. Having said all that, however, I guess the book has had its effect. I'll be checking to see where my next liver comes from.",2010-09-02

What can I possibly add to the discussion?<br /><br />A few things.<br /><br />*** Mild spoilers ahead ***<br /><br />First, I love Ishiguro.  He's an outstanding writer.  The Remains of the Day is perhaps the greatest novel about unrequited love ever written in the English language.  But even Ishiguro is a master at only a few themes.  Simply put, his best works are about characters who are unable to break free from their predestined paths.  They can be constricted by Victorian manners (such are the protagonists in Remains of the Day), or they are constricted by an inescapable understanding that they will will live very short lives (as the protagonists in Never Let Me Go).  The idea to break free and escape never occurs to any of these charaters in Ishiguro's finest works.  England might as well be a maximum security prison - a giant gray Alcatraz.  And no matter what, none of his characters dare lose their dignity.<br /><br />Never Let Me Go is not science fiction, nor is it a dystopia novel (like 1984).  The best way I can put it is that it is a brilliant short story or novella, expanded to novel length if for no other reason than to let the reader soak-in the sterile, gray environments the protagonists inhabit.  The novel is written as a free form memoir, with a terribly irritating literary device.  The narrator, Kathy H., has a habit of getting ahead of herself, telling us of a crucial turning point or event, but forces herself to backtrack in order to set-up the next major point (usually expressed as \\""I'll return to that later\\"" or \\""more on that later\\"").  And when she does divulge the details of this major turning point, it is usually a creepy, awkward conversation between her and one of her two closest friends, Tommy or Ruth.  It becomes quite clear that these characters have a radically isolated and skewed worldview.  For them (or at least Kathy H.) major events are not graduations, or moving to a new residence, or even death.  No, major events are spilling secrets and making the occasional error of saying too much or being too harsh towards one's somewhat distant friend.  In other words, they are totally old school British schoolchildren in a bubble.  These schoolchildren inhabit an alternate England - one that has advanced science far greater than the real postwar UK.<br /><br />Never Let Me Go has scenes from this alternate England that you may never forget.  The empty rural roads and service stations where Kathy H. finds peace driving her car.  The perpetually gray skies.  The refuse and trash collecting in the trees and barbed wire in a field somewhere in the east.  The casual, passionless relationship the characters have with sex and death.  The stiff upper lip attitude of wanting to make it to one's fourth 'donation'.  It really is a brilliant work if you accept the argument that it is a dystopian story that avoids going into any details of the dystopia.<br /><br />In other words, this is not Children of Men.  The Europe in this novel might be in the midst of a serious public health crisis, but Never Let Me Go neither hints at one nor explains what it might be.  Or Europe might be so prosperous, so technologically advanced, that the creation of these children might have seemed as natural as any advancement in a First World society.  Ishiguro gives nothing away, expect for a key line about how science advanced so quickly after 1946 that there 'was no time' to consider the morality or logic of those advancements.  In other words, England had become a well mannered monster.  By 1996, England was consuming living, breathing, beautiful children as easily as stocks were traded on the FTSE.  These children will be throughly educated, grow up, experience two years of independent, sexually liberated life, and then work to fulfill their predetermined destinies.  And this England, as you might expect, seems quietly proud of that achievement, despite having 'no time' to ponder the consequences.  Because, I suspect, more important things in English society must be maintained.  There are cricket matches and afternoon tea parties to attend, after all.  Carry on, you English.  I am certain Ishiguro is attracted to that theme given the similarities to 20th century Japan's adherence to honor, dignity, and constrained mannerisms.<br /><br />That alone is highly disturbing and original.  And while I suspect Ishiguro was inspired by Dolly the Sheep in 1996, others with more sinister agendas have already looked to this novel for ideological ammunition.  Opponents of embryonic stem cell research and abortion see parallels in this novel.  They see how a society, with good intentions of advancing health and science, can destroy perfectly good lives.  The difference they cannot escape, however, is that the children in this novel are not in a lab or in a uterus.  But I am just rubbed the wrong way when I see 'Antis' flocking to a book by a secular British man as a source for their petty arguments.<br /><br />But as Kathy H. might say, let me return to what I was saying about the novel itself.<br /><br />I feel like such a picky reader when I complain that this could have been a novella or short story.  As great and elegant a writer as Ishiguro is, even he has no serious justification for the length of this work.  There is much creepiness and some suspense, but no tension.  Rather it is a largely atmospheric work.  At least the book gives us two amazing sequences, the road trip to Norfolk, and Tommy's moment of rebellion and passion (which may very well reflect the frustration of many readers of this book).  Even a quiet, introverted student like Tommy has to let it all out when he (and we) discover that we were told so much and at the same time, so very little.<br /><br />But there is a glimmer of hope - the 2010 movie directed by Mark Romanek.  Not only will the story line be tighter, it might play better in the medium of cinema, despite offering no answers as to what happened to this alternate world.<br /><br />And of course, that is Ishiguro's point.  This novel is intended to make us think about our real world and our lives.  For succeeding at that, I give him tons of credit.

I ended up choosing another book and I forgot all about Never Let Me Go up until one day last week, when I stumbled across the familiar cover in a local Borders.     Let me begin by saying that this novel is a page-turner. At one part the suspense was so great that I was running late for work because I couldn't put the thing down, I just kept on thinking to myself \\""One more page, I just need to finish this part. One more page!\\"" Sounds like the sort of book you'd want to read, right? The problem with this is that at the end of all of the suspense and mystery, the big 'ah-hah!' moment never comes. The conclusion was so unfulfilling and non-clematic that I was left wondering if I'd just wasted two days of my life.    I'm not saying the storyline isn't interesting, because it is, but I think that the summary on the back is misleading. It makes you think that you're in for some big, plot-twisting surprise, when really the story being told is much simpler than that.

And while this one might not be everyone's cup of tea, it's hard not to marvel at his skill and to wonder what else you've been missing.  The novel is suffused with an elegiac quality that seems to grow naturally out of the story.  It is told by Kathy as she looks back at her early life with friends Ruth and Tommy at Hailsham, an elite English boarding school for students who, we come to realize, are quite different from students at most other schools.  I won't say specifically how, although the revelation is not so much a bolt of lightning as a gradual dawning.  Indeed, it is no great secret, and the matter-of-fact way in which the novel introduces and expands on it reinforces how \\""natural\\"" these students' lives have become, both for them and for the larger society.  The three friends drift apart sometime after they leave Hailsham, but they are later reunited through circumstances specific to their special nature, and it is this that occasions Kathy's reminiscing.  It is an absorbing book.  It is in addition (though not primarily) a criticism of scientific hubris.  We know how to do something, therefore we should do it, or so goes the thinking, too often crowding out any proper consideration of consequences or collateral damage.  Or of ethical issues, which will always arise but often too late to put the genie back in the bottle.  But there is no aspect of science or policy touching human life, including attempts to do something supremely positive and beneficial, that does not raise ethical issues.  I would love to have seen this developed further, but of course that would have changed the narrative arc and probably made the novel less effective because more heavy-handed, which it decidedly is not.  This is not a criticism.  My only criticism is that there is something just a bit Wizard-of-Oz-ish at the end (going to seek information and favors from the erstwhile wise and distant one, and finding that that person can't really do much for you), something a little bit cinematic when the explanations come pouring out.  It seems almost too planned, though I don't know how we could have learned what we needed to learn otherwise while retaining Kathy's voice as narrator.  The big question for anyone reading the story (BIG SPOILER HERE--YOU MAY NOT WANT TO CONTINUE IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO READ THE NOVEL) is: Why do the students--not just the three main characters, but all of them--accept their fate when they know the truth?  Why don't they rebel, make a fuss, or run away?  They all come to see at some point that their purpose is to donate and die.  Why not flee and melt into society?  Duty?  Fear?  Resignation?  An inability to think of options?  Any of these possibilities is chilling, as is the most likely one--that they have been so successfully conditioned that this option isn't even considered.  That might be the most disturbing part of the story.  Ishiguro doesn't hit the reader over the head with it, though.  Rather, he allows it to work its way into your consciousness as you wonder at what appears to be an inevitable acceptance.  It is much more effective that way, and much more disturbing.  Much of the pain in the novel comes not from the \\""students\\"" realizing what they are and how truncated their lives are, but from the more aware and kindly of the \\""creator\\"" race coming face-to-face with the reality of the world they have created, with its cures and its cruelties, and realizing the toll it takes on beings not so different from themselves (despite their best efforts at self-deception), and therefore the toll it takes on all humanity--on the very idea of humanity.d favors from the erstwhile wise and distant one, and finding that that person can't really do much for you), something a little bit cinematic when the explanations come pouring out.

I think that as most of us age, we tend to look back on our younger years with a mix of approval and regret, and I appreciated that connection with Kathy.    Never Let Me Go is very readable and would appeal to people interested in dystopian fiction but not ready to take the \\""hard-core\\"" plunge into the genre.",2010-08-15

This is the chief question raised by \\""Never Let Me Go\\"", and the lack of a clear-cut answer is precisely what makes the novel such a haunting read. There is a noticeable detachment in the narrator's (Kathy H.'s) voice, as she delineates events of her past without a palpable sense of urgency. I found myself initially a bit puzzled by the ostensible blandness of Ishiguro's prose, especially in light of how opulently, lustrously detailed his writing was in \\""Remains of the Day\\"". It is only when Kathy catches up with the events of her present life when it comes into focus what exactly Ishiguro is doing. The piercing brilliance of \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" is that it never removes itself from the singular vision of Kathy. A product of methodical indoctrination, she tells her story in a way that only indirectly lets the reader in about the macabre reality of her circumstances. She cannot properly express the reaction of horror arising within us because of the profound limitations that have been set on her own world view, however it is her vulnerability, her \\""realness\\"", which makes the final outcome of her story all the more shattering. We witness the thoroughly ordinary characteristics of her and her friends, their adolescent misadventures and struggles with the ambiguity of the future. To gradually realize that they are all at the mercy of a plan far beyond their power, a by-product of scientific advancement and the need for cutting-edge solutions to first-world problems, is ultimately what gives the novel its unexpected emotional pull. Ishiguro explores the notion of an existence that has been displaced from the natural order of life, but filters it through the perspective of someone who understandably does not have the volition to do much, if anything, about it. And even though the fate of Kathy and her friends is ultimately a cruel one, the author never reduces them to conduits of a moral message about the perils of eugenics. \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" isfirst and foremost a meditation on the human condition, examining the undefinable merit of an individual's experience in the world notwithstanding the circumstances under which it came to be or the role it plays in the larger scheme of progress.

I'm delighted to have finally read the novel, and I definitely enjoyed it, but I can't help feeling just a bit let down.  I've been hearing raves for years, and my expectations were pretty high.<br /><br />I don't even know what to say about a book that has already garnered hundreds of reviews.  It's got a plot that supposedly has a big reveal, so I want to be careful what I write, but that was also part of the problem for me.  What was supposedly the big secret was obvious to me from the beginning, either because I've unconsciously picked up chatter over the years, or, um, it was just obvious.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a story told in reflection by Kathy, our 31-year-old first-person narrator.  She's reflecting on the events of her life, thus far.  The first lengthy section of the novel details her upbringing at an unusual British boarding school.  There she formed the relationships that were pivotal in her later life, most notably with her best friends, Ruth and Tommy.  She continues relating the events of her life after her schooling, and the continually evolving relationships she had with her friends as she slowly learns more about the world they're living in.<br /><br />That was sufficiently vague.  The story is interesting, disturbing, and very, very thought-provoking.  There were a few problems I had, but I want to emphasize that despite minor complaints, I thought there was real brilliance to this book.  My biggest problem was that every single scene, some of them very emotional, was related by Kathy.  And her recounting, in hindsight, was always somewhat flat and removed.  An example, \\""...for a while things were okay between us.  Maybe, looking back, there was an atmosphere of something being held back, but it's possible I'm only thinking that now because of what happened next.\\""  It was literally a case of being told, not shown.  Instead of being directly in a scene, we get everything through the prism of Kathy's eyes.  It wasn't that she wasn't a sympathetic character, but somehow I had trouble channeling her emotional connection to the events of her life.

I have no doubt his reputation is justified, and I look forward to exploring more of his work in the near future.  However, he so skillfully and consistently narrates in Kathy's voice, that all poetry is lost.

When we first meet Kathy, she is 31-years-old and is looking back on her time at Hailsham in order to make sense of what happened during her time there. Primarily, she wants to examine the relationship that developed between her, a girl named Ruth and boy named Tommy.<br /><br />  * Ruth and Tommy were two of Kathy's fellow students at Hailsham, and the three of them develop a complex and complicated relationship amongst themselves that changes and morphs several times over the years. It is Kathy's need to make sense of this triangle that prompts her to look back on her days at Hailsham and the events that took place after Ruth, Tommy and Kathy left the school.<br /><br />4 things I liked or disliked about the book<br /><br />  * I liked how Ishiguro doesn't lay all the cards on the table from the start. Much like Kathy, the reader gets bits and pieces of a puzzle that they need to assemble for themselves as the book progresses. Ishiguro keeps doling out the pieces of the puzzle one at a time--holding back a few key pieces until the end of the book. The puzzle starts on the very first page when Kathy matter-of-factly refers to the fact that she has been a carer for over eleven years. Of course, this term meant nothing to me. \\""A carer?\\"" I thought to myself. \\""What the heck is a carer?\\"" Then she starts tossing out other terms--like donations--that begin to create questions in your mind. But then Kathy's story takes on some rather humdrum elements and begins to seem like any other \\""young people dealing with relationships at a boarding school\\"" book ... but then Ishiguro swoops in and lays another puzzle piece before you that has you wondering just what is going on.<br /><br />  * I liked how Ishiguro created a story that develops on two different levels. One is the story that Kathy is telling us--the story of her experiences and perceptions. But as we gather puzzle pieces and start putting them together in our minds, the reader begins to write another story--a much darker and frightening story than the one Kathy seems to be telling us. It is as if the reader becomes part of the story--filling in the gaps that Ishiguro chooses to leave blank. In many ways, I found the book to be almost an interactive reading experience. It was quite interesting.<br /><br />  * I liked how Ishiguro raises a host of ethical issues without addressing them directly. Instead, Ishiguro comes at things obliquely--laying out ethical dilemmas but leaving them unanswered or offering mixed messages based on how Kathy, Ruth and Tommy view their lives. It was an interesting way to tackle these issues, and I think it makes for a good discussion. My mom read this book at the same time as me, and we ended up getting in a rather lively discussion of the variety of topics raised by the book. It would be a good choice for a book club.<br /><br />  * I disliked not getting MORE details about the dystopic world that Ishiguro creates. Once I realized what was going on, I became thirsty for more information on how this society came about and the logistics of how it functioned. As much as I admire Ishiguro's approach to this book, it also left me feeling dissatisfied. I would have loved a follow-up to this book ... a sort of companion book that described the society that led to the creation of a place like Hailsham and a person like Kathy H.<br /><br />5 stars or less for my rating:<br /><br />I hemmed and hawed about what rating to give this book, but I finally decided to give it 4 stars.

I'd never read any of Ishiguro's work. Admittedly, I was probably a little intimidated from a distance; his reputation is, as any good reader knows, something to be admired and respected. However...    However this novel was an ordeal to get through. I could not wait to put it behind me. I am a dedicated reader, and I really had little desire to finish it. But I did. And regardless of the author's rep, I'm still going to review as usual.    'Never' is an anti-story told in a casual, conversational, anti-storytelling way. It is the thesis presentation of why there's so much merit in the writer's adage 'Show, don't tell.' Now, I get that this was precisely the way Ishiguro wanted to tell the tale. I also get that as a stylistic approach, it had its strengths, and is a considerable accomplishment, pulling off this consistently-rendered task.    But despite the powerful premise, what was presented on the page brought me a bounty of almost exclusively negative responses. Frustration. Anger. Discomfort. But more than anything else, annoyance rendered the experience one of, as I've said, endurance; probably the least enjoyable novel I've read (keeping in mind the writer and his oeuvre), one I would not recommend to anyone, under any circumstances. I felt nothing for the characters, grew resentful at the dearth of actual story, and ended up having little tolerance for just about everything associated with the habits of Kathy H, from whose perspective it is that we learn everything. (I will say this: Ruth, one of the other primary characters in 'Never'? The word that describes what she is rhymes with 'bunt'. I could have strangled her. Then drowned her. Then thrown her in front of a train.)    There was a lovely story in there. Somewhere. And the settings and their particulars were relayed in a reserved, yet powerful-from-out-of-left-field sort of way, given to us in achingly simple ways.But despite the provocative nature of the premise, despite kudos having been earned by Ishiguro for maintaining the narrator's voice (no matter how grating), 'Never Let Me Go' was a sustained disappointment, leaving me constantly hoping for more, while continually breaking my heart...and checking to see just how many more pages I had left.    I have no doubt that there are many readers (and critics) who found this novel to be something special. I could not; ultimately, it was not a story I had much of any desire to read.

I happened upon this book by accident in fact. I was reading an interview of Kathryn Stockett (writer of The Help) and in it she listed some of her favorite authors and books. 'Never Let Me Go' being one of them. And since I loved The Help, I thought it would be interesting to see what type of literature she was into. I started reading this book on Saturday, March 20th and I've just finished it today, Monday, March 22nd. This book was very interesting and definitely a challenge for me to read. I say that because most of the books I gravitate towards have clearly defined plots and make you, as a reader, so excited about getting to the end if only to satisfy your curiosity about what happens to the characters you've come to love or hate.<br /><br />In saying that, this book definitely kept me curious and eager to get to the end. But for all the wrong reasons. When I purchased the book, I kind of thought it's premise was something like M. Night Shaymalan's movie The Village. Where these people lived a secluded place, far off the beaten path, completely separated from the rest world and not until much later in life do some of the residents find out they were living a lie. This book was nothing like that. In fact, I couldn't tell what it was even about for the first 50 or 60 pages. Not much happens. But why keep reading it you might ask? I kept reading it because the writer, Ishiguro is so good at giving you just enough information to hold you're attention for a little while longer, until you find yourself halfway through the book, thinking, no, rather hoping that you're going to get to something interesting, some revelation that's going to make up for all the energy you've given so far. And sadly in the end, the only thing you walk away with is how you've been duped into giving so much energy in the first place. Ishiguro is definitely a master of suspense, he kept me going much longer than I thought I would. But I wouldn't recommend this book to any one of my friends. I think they'd just get mad at me for telling them to read a book that doesn't really have a plot and keeps you on the edge of your seat as you wait for an exciting, thrilling, and/or shocking revelation that never comes.<br /><br />While I don't want to give away any spoilers, I will say that if you like books that are passionate, thrilling, exciting, and hard to put down, then 'Never Let Me Go' is not for you!'t recommend this book to any one of my friends.

(just in case)<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and read it over the span of a few days. I had no preconceived expectations of the genre. It did not strike me as science fiction per se. Rather, there are science fiction themes in the plot that serve an important purpose for painting a picture of a unique kind of experience that I immediately likened to that of real-life oppressed groups. Some reviewers have expressed disappointment that more elements of this fictional world were not revealed, but I think this shows admirable restraint on the part of the author. The story is told very much from the characters' point of view, and it becomes clear that the characters only have an inkling of their place in the larger world. They fully understand themselves as \\""other,\\"" but they clearly lack the tools with which to ask how that arrangement came to be. By explicitly NOT addressing the who, how, why of the \\""programme,\\"" the novel remains tied closely to the inner experiences of the characters. To illustrate this point, I was well into the novel before I wondered why none of the students seemed to rebel at this system, and I found that I was not frustrated that they never questioned their assigned roles. Although the reader inevitably views the \\""students\\"" as pawns in an extremely cruel system, the students never really do so themselves. That is one of the major tragic themes of this story. Aside from one radical teacher (\\""guardian\\""), whom the other guardians regard as \\""too theoretical\\"" and too eager to depart from \\""what works,\\"" it is clear that even the characters' fiercest protectors nevertheless regard them as less than full persons.

For one, it's a page turner. The reader is left to wonder at the meaning of words sprinkled casually by the narrator, and the childhood events which hold something more than can be immediately grasped. Just as the \\""secrets\\"" are unveiled to the narrator and her peers, secrets whose meanings they realize they already half knew, so is the mystery revealed to the reader. Without spoiling the plot for new readers, Ishiguro manages to give just enough data so that by the time we learn what's really going on, we're left marveling at how we didn't guess it in the first place.<br /><br />In Never Let Me Go Ishiguro distills much about the human life cycle in a shortened life spans of its main characters. By watching how they deal with their own mortality and the conditions of their existence, the reader can't help but draw the connections to his or her own life. I think this was Ishiguro's intention, to show the complacency we demonstrate in our lives. In short, we are slaves that think we are free. We are asleep, dreaming we are awake. The themes echo those of the mystic-philosopher George Gurdjieff, so well presented in Ouspensky's wonderful [[ASIN:0156007460 In Search of the Miraculous]].<br /><br />The book is a meditation on death and freedom. What does it mean to be free? How can we be free when we are not even aware of the prison in which we find ourselves? For the narrator and her friends, their prison is accepted as their lot in life. They do not fight it, nor do they even realize what prisoners they are. They live and die according to a will that is not their own, and they do not fight. The book is depressing in this regard, but the truth of the matter is that we are often no better off. Without the perspective necessary, we cannot see the limits of our freedom, and thus cannot do anything to expand those limits. Ishiguro doesn't give his characters a way out. They live to the best of their abilities within the limits of their environment, but cannot transcend that environment. Machines in the cog work of larger machine. In this sense Ishiguro presents a fine allegory for life, albeit without the hope offered by a writer like Gurdjieff.mits of their environment, but cannot transcend that environment.

While yes, the main idea of humans being cloned for their eventual `donations' is always hanging over our heads as we read this engrossing novel (so engrossing that I read it in two sittings), it really becomes a secondary character, leaving open the way for the true meat of this novel to shine forth.  This is a beautifully detailed (although never demandingly so) portrait of life and the coming of age realizations that come with it.<br /><br />Told from the eyes of young Kathy (her protagonist reminds me of Benjamin Button in that she is really just our eyes into the lives of those around her), `Never Let Me Go' tells of three friends (Kathy, Ruth and Tommy) who grow up at somewhat of a boarding school named Hailsham.  They grow up with the knowledge (although they rarely understand completely) that they have a specific course in life to follow.  After they complete their school they will start their training to become carers (somewhat like nurses) before they get their notice that their donations will begin, where their bodies will serve the greater good of society, or humans.<br /><br />After that they wait to complete, or die.<br /><br />What Ishiguro's novel so marvelously does is create a sense of normalcy that is something completely unexpected and ultimately more moving.

Instead of placing divisions between these `clones' and the reader, Ishiguro makes each of the characters human.  Instead of focusing on their impending doom (it is always there, but never the focal point) it focuses on their present life.

I don't think I've ever read anything quite like it. What a beautiful story. It made me smile and it made me cry, and it touched me deeply. It really makes you pause and reflect on large morality issues, and the world that Ishiguro paints could so easily become our own. It is completely believable throughout, which makes it all the more chilling and touching at the same time. I look forward to reading more from this fantastic author.",2009-10-23

Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go draws these parallels both physically and morally.  The basics of the plot have been recounted (and perhaps spoiled) in many reviews here, so I won't recount it again.    Never Let Me Go is a story with a secret revealed as each successive chapter peels back layer upon layer the stories of kids who attend a special school for certain special youth in England.  The pace is leisurely to the point of being laconic.  Ishiguro's prose reads more like romance than science fiction; his voice is unique and refreshing for the genre.  Each of the three main characters is fully formed, and each has his or her own special point of view.  Each handles his or her own existential journey uniquely.    The story is morally challenging; I won't go into great detail to avoid spoilers.  What I found brilliant about Never Let Me Go is that the reader is morally challenged with each character and the social setting.  How the characters meet their fates I felt was especially challenging.    The book didn't rate five stars with me for two reasons, however.  First, the chapters have a rather formulaic structure which wore on me after a while.

It makes absolutely no logical sense in the end, if you think about it for 5 minutes.      The whole concept of 4 staged donations and carers on which the plot is based would have no place in a society that raised clones simply to use their organs.  Why would they bother to take one organ at a time and pay the expenses of recovery, carers, food, clothing, shelter, etc. for years on end?  They would simply have harvested all the important organs at once and been done with it.    I know, this isn't the real world, and the book is all about suspense, characterization, imbuing the ordinary with nuance and mystery, and is not intended to be logical in any sense, but in my opinion, if you are going to try to write something thought-provoking, it needs to stand up to some thought without completely crumbling into an impossible illogicality.

I was reminded of the recent movie The Island about clones with a similar purpose who find out what they are and immediately start planning an escape from their fate.  This book couldn't be further from that mindset - and while that movie wasn't realistic by any means, it at least seemed more emotionally authentic.

Ishiguro is a first-rate wordsmith, and his ability to understate while speaking volumes dazzles me.  Already I am looking forward to his next book, which could be a cookbook and I'll still read it cover to cover because I know it will be that good.      I feel compelled to speak up about a couple of points, however, because they seem to be escaping most of the reviewers.  First is all the talk of souls or no souls: do cloned people have souls or not?  You can't answer this question until you define what a soul is, and that, indirectly, is the main objective of this novel.  Kathy, Tommy and Ruth are not under the microscope to demonstrate that they possess souls; they are the mirror reflecting back to us whether or not *we* possess souls.  In Ishiguro's novel, \\""creativity\\"" and \\""art\\"" are used to demonstrate the breadth of a person's soul, but none of the \\""Guardians\\"" (symbolic stand-ins for you and me) ever create anything.  Instead they hoard the student's art to admire in private, presumably to make up for their own lack of creativity/soul?  (Is there a parallel here between the writer (with much soul) and the reader (with little soul))?   At every turn, the students more than demonstrate their capacity to possess a soul, while the \\""Guardians\\"" demonstrate their lack of one.  While useful to advance the ideals of the novel, I personally doubt such black and whiteness would be the case in real life.    My second point is \\""this is Logan's Run all over again but with a different ending.\\""  Why don't the students flee when they discover finally the terrible fate that awaits them?  Some have suggest that they, like sheep, don't know they have the option.  Looking again at the larger picture I have to ask who among us is brave enough to flee their mundane existence for a chance at a new life?  For the few that have made the attempt, sit down and be quiet.  I'm speaking to the great majority who comprise the rest, people who recognize that all the students had to do was take off to parts unknown and live out their lives in freedom, just like anyone who complains about their daily existence can do... and yet they all fail to act.  The answer is complex but is rooted in the concept of \\""our place in the world\\"" and personal inertia which resists change, even away from a bad situation.  Judge not, then, etc.      As some of my fellow reviewers have stated, I was interested in knowing how this alternate world functioned.  What laws were enacted that enabled the homicide of the clones for organ harvesting?  There is allusion to horrific conditions for non-Hailsham clones but no detail (the couple who took the students to Norfolk were from another facility and could have shared their story...); I wanted those potential hells enumerated, not as a sermon but as a spotlight to show the unimaginative just how bad this alternative world could get.  There was opportunity for comparisons and contrasts, for conflict, for societal examination that were lost in the understatement, and the knowledge of that loss is probably what leads everyone to put down the book at the end feeling as if they missed something important.      That leads me to issue my verdict about the \\""meaning\\"" of this novel.

I should say that it's not a book for everyone since it sometimes drags along with a lot of `every day life' detail. I can see some people getting bored, but I decided to take the book for what it was worth; I realized early on the value of the story pacing because I knew in the end it would personalize me more the characters in such a way that I could understand their mindset. I lived their life with them. There has been some criticism of this book that no character rebelled against their fate as eventual organ donors, that everyone just seemed to accept that one day they would become donors and then die. I feel that this criticism is misguided. How are people to know what the world is like when they've been conditioned to live and think one way? From the day these clones were `born,' they were raised to believe and live one way. That they accepted their fate is no different from the way that we accept our own. One can't expect characters to manifest deep philosophical thought about something they have no knowledge of whatsoever. In so many dystopia novels, people do rebel against the order in place and this is what readers come to expect. Why should it always be the case? Why should every one of these books be about the destruction of a misguided society? Can't it just be a snapshot in the process? The lives of a few people involved but not earth shattering? The characters never went into long speeches about how unfair their lives were, they just lived life, enjoyed what they could, but always knew they would die for the sake of others. To tell the truth, I couldn't stand to read the last page. It actually hurt to read them. I didn't want the book to end because I knew what would happen, I knew what would become of the characters. It wasn't even their sadness that I absorbed more than it was my own sadness that this was all that their lives were about.",2009-01-06

If not for the occasional mention or inference of something that didn't quite ring true with modern society as we know it - I would have summed the book up as a boring novel of class distinctions within a British Private school.

The narrator of Never Let Me Go is Kathy H., a woman who introduces herself as a \\""carer\\"" mere months away from becoming a \\""donor,\\"" as though we should know what these terms mean. This nearness to ending one stage of her life to entering another causes her to reminisce about Hailsham, the school in the English countryside where she grew up with her two closest friends, Tommy D. and Ruth. The three form an unlikely trio: Ruth is headstrong and imaginative; Tommy has an uncontrollable temper; and Kathy is steady and observant in the subtleties of human behavior. It is this last quality belonging to Kathy H. that sets the tone of the novel. Everything is precisely told in an even, matter-of-fact voice that never questions the strange terminology and conversations that alert the reader to something more grave lurking under what seems, on the surface, to be an ordinary story about three childhood friends. As the three grow up, they begin to face moments more important than the minor disagreements of childhood.<br /><br />Ishiguro's richly textured description of the relationship among the three supplies all the details without confronting the larger issues. As Kathy tells us, the guardians at Hailsham both tell and not tell the students the truth about Hailsham and their lives--exactly what Ishiguro does to the reader. The truth is doled out in increments, over the course of the entire novel, requiring the reader to understand what is implied as much as what is told. The frightening side to all this is that the characters never question the course of their lives. No one runs, or questions why they are the ones to make the ultimate sacrifice. One of the most poignant moments comes near the end when Kathy says, \\""Why should we not have souls?\\"" By this point, it has been apparent to the reader that Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth are human in every sense of the word, with talents and intelligence and foibles and complex emotions, and yet are regarded as both freaks and disposables by the \\""normals.\\"" For the reader, these characters are anything but expendable.<br /><br />Ishiguro's literary style of examining small moments might disappoint readers who expect a strong plot. Although the premise may belong to science fiction, this novel is more concerned with characterization and theme.

As the dread of the inevitable increases in intensity, Ishiguro builds a counterbalancing sense of hope that somehow, just this once, tragedy will be averted.    And even though this is a work of fiction, it is not hard to draw parallels to the fate of the impoverished, diseased, or otherwise afflicted untouchables that inhabit our world.  Ishiguro introduces us to an imaginary world just beyond what we commonly see, and in so doing reminds us that much of our own prosperity is built on the bleached bones of the oppressed.  The painful, short lives they lead are somehow similar to the lives of the characters in his novel.  And the noble, stoic way they accept their fate is a testimony to the concepts of justice and fairness that we human creatures assume is our birthright.    So sad!  So true!

The setting takes place in Britain where the world is seemingly at peace with its military conflicts, but the consequences of violence mounts high when grave injuries and diseases threaten the fate of humanity. The solution... to breed clones for each human body ensures that for every wound there is a solution without fail. Yet, with the widespread acceptance of the human cloning industry, what does the human race think of its counterpart? Nothing. Although the answer is cruel and backlashes on every aspect of human morality, our instinct to survive desensitizes humans to guilt as someone may think after an organ operation, `Did I kill someone for this kidney?' or `Is there a part of myself that died without me ever knowing it?' Such thoughts can be a crippling blow to one's morale, yet since the process of cloning is such an efficient way to ensure survival, the human race allows it to flourish no matter what the cost.       As the humans may see clones as expendable resources, yet there are some other reasons why they are not welcomed in society. Much like slaves and immigrants in the past, clones are considered to be \\""sub-humans\\"" of this futuristic society. They are used then thrown away when they are no longer of use. One of the obvious differences that stand out about the clone, Kathy, is the misspelling of some of her words. She would spell civilize as \\""civilise\\"" and realize as \\""realise.\\"" Although it is not a remarkable difference, society never fails to notice people's faults. Whenever an outsider makes an appearance, the people of society fear that he/she is a threat to their existence. Out of fear and ignorance, society criticizes anything that the outsider may do uncommonly; in this case, making a few spelling errors. As the slaughtering of clones continues, thequestion of whether or not they are human is raised. And to decide the debate, Hailsham steps forward. The students of Hailsham or clones are taught to be creative in the arts. Its operation was to prove that these clones were in fact human beings with souls, even though they were a \\""science experiment.\\"" However, no matter what Hailsham proves by having \\""students\\"" create magnificent works, such as this book, humanity continues to bury itself in denial.     Every student of Hailsham is told what their sole purpose in life is from infancy. For Kathy to mention this rather calmly it may come as a surprise to the reader. In fact, this is one of Ishiguro's main themes. When there is an aggressor that asserts its power, it is common for any animal, including humans, to be submissive to that aggressor. Why the students had not seen beyond the walls of Hailsham was to keep them like ants in an ant-farm. The forest is another method of keeping the students under control, considering that if they even dare so venture outside Hailsham they could die in the process. The unwritten rules had kept student from inquiring the mysterious ways and the weekly examinations made sure their organs were healthy when the transplants were to be made. Kathy's role as \\""peacekeeper\\"" is an example of their mind control. If the guardians were to encourage individualism, then the students wouldn't be like lemmings and, follow who ever was in lead. Yet, the most shocking thing in this book is that the students have enough opportunities to leave and run for their lives, but do not. It seems easier just to stay and go with the flow and not revolt. The clones just give up and wait to die like cattle. This is the fine line where Ishiguro separates himself from other more \\""American\\"" works, which encourage individualism such as the movie \\""The Island\\"" or \\""I-Robot.\\""     Hailsham was both a prison and shelter. It was a separate community for the clones to grow and be treated like normal humans in a safe haven that shielded them from the outside world's prejudice. Nevertheless, Hailsham never let them forgot that their fate hung over their heads like a haunting shadow. And to make sure, every guardian, student, and unwritten rule subliminally kept them in line so that they may give up quietly and without fret. In doing so, these clones will submit their lives as human sacrifices for the survival of the human race.",2008-10-06

Like Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale or J G Ballard's Kingdom come, Never Let me Go is built around an abhorrent aspect of social organisation. Crucially, in all three books, the focus of the subject matter is merely an extension of a facet of our own society. Fertility issues provide the material for The Handmaid's Tale, while brainless consumerism fuelled Kingdom Come. Kazuo Ishiguro's subject matter has a medical focus that provides an essentially more credible idea than either of the two other works mentioned. Eventually Ballard's vision cannot be maintained by his scant material, whereas Margaret Atwood's is strengthened by the credibility of its own downside. Ishiguro's story line is strong enough in itself to maintain interest, credibility and drama from start to finish. There is real humanity in this story.<br /><br />The book begins in Hailsham, an obviously special school set in an idyllic corner of the English countryside. But this is clearly no ordinary education. We follow the fortunes of three of its students, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy. We see them grow up, make their fumbling transformation from childhood to adolescence and then embark upon the stuttering unpredictability of young adulthood. Hailsham's students have to learn how to deal with their own shortcomings and how to manage their talents. They must cope with sometimes strained relations with their teachers, especially in the area of reconciling what they want to do versus what seems to be demanded of them, and thus what they are allowed to attempt. They become aware of sex and introduce themselves to its world in their own ways at different times, each of them reacting differently to their experience.<br /><br />So what makes these people so special? Well, for a start they live protected lives. They never appear to need any money, nor possessions, for that matter, what little they do have being recycled ad infinitum via a system of almost formal barter.

It is gloomy, sometimes funny, comtemplative, but no matter what emotion you have when reading this book, even the positive ones, it is tinged with a deep sense of sadness.    Kathy, Ruth and Tommy are students at an elite school in Hailsham and it is constantly stressed to them how special they are. Their school is also spoken of with great esteem and appears to be very well regarded. The students lives are characteristic of most boarding school kids. They study, fight with each other, gossip about their classmates and teachers and dream of the careers they will have when they leave school. But in all of this you will sense something odd that for a long time you can't quite put your finger on.

You will realize that long before the word \\""clones\\"" is ever used, about twenty pages before the end, and that suggests a problem with the author's pacing or foreshadowing.  The story is told from the point of view of Kathy, a young graduate of Hailsham (does that Dickensian name indicate the author's take on the ethical issue: will any good ever come from a sham?), an English boarding school now closed.  Hailsham's students and graduates are unusually compliant souls.  They do what they're told, which is strange considering that there is no mention of how they were socialized prior to their arrival at Hailsham.  They accept their lot with a minimum of struggle or angst.  Meanwhile, their \\""guardians\\"" -- the teachers at Hailsham -- impose various rules, collect samples of the students' artwork for mysterious purposes, and wrestle with inner demons of their own.<br /><br />The elegiac mood which some have praised in this work stems from the inevitability of its central characters' barren lives.

As we get older, as we lose our friends and family, as the environment around us changes and things once familiar to us disappear or become unfamiliar, as we cling to our memories of how things used to be, how do we come to accept the fact that our lives are finite and attach some meaning to our limited existence? These are questions that the narrator of \\""Never Let Me Go,\\"" Kathy H., copes with as she recounts the disjointed memories that comprise her life. Sorting through these memories, she finds comfort in her friends and her career, eventually coming to terms with the meaning of her life and her ultimate fate.     Reflecting upon her life, Kathy devotes most of her time to thinking about her friends from Hailsham, a secluded boarding school where she grew up. Because contact with outsiders at Hailsham is limited, one of the school's big events is the quarterly Exchange, where students are given tokens they can use to buy other students' artwork. As this is the students' only way of accumulating material possessions, they grow dependent on each other for their \\""personal treasures\\"" and learn to value others' work, forging unique bonds with one another. Kathy's two best friends are Ruth, an extroverted leader at the school, and Tommy, a shy introvert who gets bullied due to his lack of creativity and inability to produce substantial work. While they depend on each other throughout their time at Hailsham, like a lot of friends they drift apart after leaving the school. Looking back at the petty argument that led to the group's break, Kathy comments, \\""It never occurred to me that our lives, until then so closely interwoven, could unravel and separate over a thing like that.\\"" Kathy regrets the loss of her friends, but doesn't do anything about it until she hears that Hailsham is closing: \\""[I]t started to dawn on me, I suppose, that a lot of things I'd always assumed I'd plenty of time to get around to doing, I might now have to act on pretty soon or else let them go forever.\\"" Realizing that her time is limited, Kathy decides what is important to her - what she doesn't want to let go of - and reconnects with her old friends, Ruth and Tommy.     In addition to her friends, Kathy's career has a special meaning in her life. Kathy begins the book by identifying herself as a \\""carer.\\"" Although a lot of carers \\""are just going through the motions waiting for the day they're told to stop,\\"" Kathy enjoys her work, the long drives and the solitude, and she knows she is good at what she does. As a carer, she helps look after patients, assisting as they recover from \\""donations\\"" and keeping them calm. She knows that she is a good carer, which is important to her: \\""[I]t means a lot to me, being able to do my work well.\\"" However, when she becomes Tommy's carer, he questions the meaning of her work, asking her if she really considers her job to be important since all of her patients are going to \\""complete,\\"" or die, anyway. Kathy responds, \\""Of course, it's important. A good carer makes a big difference.\\"" When reflecting upon her life, Kathy decides not only that her friends are important to her, but she also considers her job important, believing she makes a difference by helping others.     However, as the book begins, Kathy only has eight months left as a carer, and then she will begin the last phase of her life. Initially, Kathy does not accept this fate, hoping to get a \\""deferral.\\"" When the headmaster of Hailsham tells her a deferral is not possible - Kathy cannot escape her ultimate fate any more than the rest of us can - Kathy wonders what the purpose of her life has been: \\""Why did we do all of that work in the first place? Why train us, encourage us, make us produce all of that? If we're just going to give donations anyway, then die, why allthose lessons? Why all those books and discussions?\\"" In fact, one of the Hailsham teachers, Miss Lucy, had made this same argument when they were children, believing it was more important that they know their ultimate fate than worry about creating artwork and developing their sense of culture: \\""If you're to have decent lives, you have to know who you are and what lies ahead of you.\\"" But this is not true, the Hailsham headmaster counters, addressing Kathy and Tommy: \\""Look at you both now! I'm so proud to see you both. You built your lives on what we gave you. You wouldn't be who you are today if we'd not protected you.\\"" Ultimately, Kathy comes to agree with the Hailsham approach. When she meets a patient who did not go to Hailsham, but wants to hear all about her time there so that he can replace his own memories with Kathy's, Kathy realizes \\""just how lucky we'd been.\\"" Without being warned what lay ahead - as Miss Lucy had wanted - Kathy had been free to live her own life; even if it was messy, it was hers. As the novel concludes, Kathy drives to Norfolk, where she had shared her happiest memories with Tommy: \\""I imagined this was the spot where everything I'd ever lost since my childhood had washed up, and I was standing in front of it.\\"" Instead of hanging on to those things and people she has lost, Kathy realizes that this is as far as her fantasy can go: \\""I just waited a bit, then turned back to the car, and drove off to wherever it was I was supposed to be.\\"" Like most of us, Kathy knows her life is limited, and the best we can do is go about our everyday lives, doing what we are supposed to do. She will never let go of her memories of what she has lost, but she has accepted her fate.     Though her life hasn't been perfect, Kathy, reflecting upon her memories, finds that her life has been meaningful - having had close friends, an important job, and an idyllic childhood, she considers herself \\""lucky.\\"" But has she, in fact, led a decent life? Has her life been purposeful and meaningful? These are universal questions we may all ask of ourselves - how to accept our own mortality and assign purpose to the limited life we have been given. However, these big questions of how to deal with loss and mortality also become a source of frustration and disappointment for readers because, while \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" builds these questions up, it never seems to fully resolve or answer them. Fortunately, though, it does provide some clues. One of the recurring items of the book relates to a song Kathy plays as a child called \\""Never Let Me Go.\\"" What makes the song special for Kathy is that she assigns her own meaning to the lyrics; instead of listening to the actual words, she imagines her own version of the song: \\""Even at the time, I realized this couldn't be right, that this interpretation didn't fit with the rest of the lyrics. But that wasn't an issue with me. The song was about what I said.\\"" At one point, when Kathy is dancing to the song in her mind, Madame, a Hailsham leader, catches her and starts sobbing. Later Madame confesses that, when she saw Kathy that day, she imagined Kathy was holding onto the old world, a \\""kind world,\\"" which was being replaced by a \\""harsh, cruel world,\\"" but now Madame realizes her interpretation was wrong: \\""It wasn't really you, what you were doing.\\"" Soon after Madame catches her playing the tape, the tape is lost, her friend Ruth tries to replace it, and later, with Tommy's help, Kathy finds another copy of the tape. The symbolic implications are clear: just as she assigns her own meaning to the song, Kathy assigns her own meaning to life. Sometimes she may be lost, sometimes others like Tommy may help her, and sometimes others like Madame may assign a different meaning to her life than she does, but Kathy is the final author of her life. While others may deem her life meaningless, she herself is content, if not happy. \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" may not provide a universal answer for some of the big questions it posesabout loss and mortality, but the ultimate message seems to be one of hope: as the authors of our own lives, it is up to each of us to take what we are given and make the most of it.",2008-06-30

It slowly reveals a horrible truth: man has set up a macabre production system of willing, sterile human clones in order to use them as organ `donators' when they are grown up.  The institution where they are brought up functions as an art school: `we thought you art because we thought it would reveal your souls ...we did it to prove you have souls at all.' But unlike Bartolome de las Casas's defense of the Indians, here the proof comes too late. With the support of `cabinet ministers, bishops, all sorts of famous people', this was what the world noticed the most: `all these ways to cure so many previously incurable conditions. They preferred to believe these organs appeared from nowhere.'    The major theme of this book is the same as the one of the first masterpiece in world literature, the Gilgamesh epic and its search for eternal life. The search here turned into a horrifying massacre of copies of human beings ... for the benefit of the originals.  It shows how deep mankind has fallen. But there is a sprinkle of hope in the form of one dissident among the originals, who defends the viewpoint that the clones should `made aware' of their sinister destiny.    For Kazuo Ishiguro, we should never let her go, the `old kind world', and never replace it by a more scientific, efficient, but harsh and cruel one.    Although some will not like the slow progress, the piecemeal revelation and the indirect suggestive style, Kazuo Ishiguro wrote a dark, but formidable masterpiece.",2008-06-28

It would not necessarily be appropriate to classify this book as science fiction yet it is oddly futuristic and certainly is a commentary on the ability to create clones of humans and then to harvest the organs of the clones over time through a series of transplant operations.  This aspect of the story gradually reveals itself through the lives, experiences, and relationships between three young people; Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy.    These three young people were reared in a special school that educated the clones in the arts, music, sports, and basic education. Hailsham seems to be a progressive educational institution, yet because critical information is not fully revealed to the young people at Hailsham, multiple plots and conspiracies develop in the minds of the young people. The book thus explores the social bonds and relationships that develop among parentless children.  Not having parents means that the teachers in the school, the Guardians, are the only real adult role models for the kids. Therefore the kids form cliques and groups that include or exclude others and develop a society and social structure similar to that seen in middle schools across the nation. Some kids are in and some kids are out.  Ruth is a struggler to remain always in the right crowd. Tommy is explosive and transparent and thus is usually a victim and is considered to be on the outside. Kathy is an introspective reflective loner who forms bonds with Ruth and Tommy, whom she carefully observes and understands. Eventually the characters graduate from Hailsham and move to the Cottages which appear to be for high-school and college age clones, awaiting training first as carers and then as donors. Other clones were not as lucky where little resources were expended on them and they were expected to begin making organ donations upon reaching biological adulthood.  The futuristic medical establishment is never revealed and the teachers for the clones and the doctors and nurses who harvest the organs never refer to the large medical infrastructure that would support such a system as this book implies.    The book focuses more on the creation of family among those who have no family and the subtle nuances of tone, body language, choice of phrase that all imply how far we are into or out of a relationship with another. At this, the novel soars and is far more an anatomy of relationships than it was an anatomy of the body organs that these young folks eventually willingly give up as their fate in life.

Yep, I said it. I went there. I think this book is brilliant, on so many subtle levels that weeks after re-reading it, I'm still pondering how Ishiguro was able to capture what he did. Here's what I said in my old review:<br /><br />\\""Ishiguro remains one of my favorite authors whose talent is extraordinarily mysterious to me. I still can't figure out how he knows how to write what he does. Like McEwan or McCarthy, he shapes a world beautifully understood by himself, yet those of us who try and enter find ourselves picking our way through dangerous territory. I have to say I was nearly taken out of the world in 'Never Let Me Go' because I was so repeatedly astonished at how subtly he drew the characters and their actions. The small pettinesses of the world of somebody like Kathy or Ruth are so mundane they become marvelous. It transcends the skills required to create a believable SF world; this is nearly an experiment in existentialism, whereby these characters grow challenged by their empty lives and make such feeble attempts to enrich them.\\""<br /><br />I believe all of that and more, now. Sometimes the strangely maundering tone of the work sinks into a torpid banality that I could still tell, somehow, was deliberate on the part of the author. Showing us what it might actually be like, with the first-person narrative, to exist as a clone - and to not do it with flash and action - boy, that takes cojones. Ishiguro's imaginings are so oddly dreary we nearly don't want to believe they could be real; and yet he makes them absolutely real. The very first time I read this book it took nearly a hundred pages for me to figure out what it was about, and when I did the revelation was gently and irrevocably terrifying.

They seem like normal teens, except no one talks about their parents or home life, or what came before Hailsham.  No one.  Never.  And no one knows what faces them after they leave the school.  And then Ishiguro finally lays it out for us.  It was kind of like what I suspected, I think, but it was enough of a surprise to make me want to follow their lives to the fast approaching conclusion.  They do have a purpose to their lives, but it's a tough, heart-wrencing one.  One of the characters, Ruth, states emphatically that they are all modeled on trash:  junkies, prostitutes, winos, and tramps.  And she and her friends Tommy and Kath try to get some answers for themselves.  But then, after Hailsham they are divided into two separate categories with very pre-determined outcomes.  But, that would be telling.  Read it for yourself.  I believe it will be a rewarding experience. And maybe a precursor of what is ahead for the human race.",2008-04-07

By the time you the reader are enlightened, you are so wrapped up in the intrigue, that you can't put it down.  The best description of this book is science fiction, something that is not true, but could be true, as science and medicine progresses and mankind degresses.  Imagination and fantasy take hold.  What we are missing is the description of the kind of society that would allow this usurping of human beings to occur.  We already live in a world where this no longer seems like an impossibility.  Using Kathy as the first person narrator, you experience first-hand the students' feelings, emotions, needs, and humanness, which makes it difficult to understand why they so readily accept their fate.  However, when I think of other modern and ancient societies, this no longer seems so far-fetched.  Woman and slaves who accepted their subservient or oppressed state in life, promoted and encouraged it in the next generation, and still seemed to hope for fulfillment and emotional satisfaction, never rebelling, but living within the society as best they knew how, shows that this is a realistic stance for the author to take.  It is all they knew.  The enforcement of their fate in this novel is subtle but hidden.  The characters are likeable but realistic, revealing human emotions like anger, love, and jealousy.  The fact that these are talented and intelligent students makes their fate all the more tragic.

I was immediately captivated by the voice of the main character, which is strong in its simplicity.  I read the book quickly.  I found the book beautiful, sad, and pointed.  There is a clear message here, which is echoed through, as another reviwer pointed out, the works of Margaret Atwood (though i thought more of Oryx and Crake than the HandMaid's Tale), as well as George Orwell and even The Giver.  It is a tale of a world gone wrong.  It is the kind of book that reminds us of temptation - it is tantalizing to think one could grow new organs for oneself, cure cancer, and thereby prolong life.  It is traumatizing to think that these organs must come from living beings.  Ishiguro explores all of these deep seated psychological and scientific issues ironically, by ignoring them.  All of this - that humans are cloned, raised (and the words separate but equal couldn't help but whisper at the back of my mind), and then systematically killed as their internal organs are harvested one by one.  What the story focuses on, rather, is the story of kis growing up.  Bewildered by the world of adults, exploring fantasies, exploring each other, forming friendships, and falling in love.  It is a coming of age novel, but one that is suffused with suspense from the first page.  You can't believe whats going to happen will actually happen so you keep reading to prove yourself wrong.  Or right.  Either way, suddenly you find yourself in the last pages of the novel, which, and I hope this doesn't spoil too much, is anti-climactic in a dramatic way.

This is a story about humanity, what it is to be human, what it means to be compassionate.

Moderately recommend","As a child, Kathy H. attended Hailsham, an elite boarding school where children were raised to be both healthy and artistic and taught to believe that both their health and creativity were essential to themselves and to the world they would one day enter. Now an adult, Kathy reflects back on her life. She charts the very slow progression of her growth, her friendships with fellow students Tommy and Ruth, and her knowledge, as she herself gradually began to learn about her role in the outside world--and what this role dictates about her identity. A combination of heavy introspection and soft-scifi, Never Let Me Go has a thought-provoking premise and is brilliantly written, but fails to reach its potential, spending all its time in excruciatingly slow buildup and none of it in impact, theory, or debate. Enjoyable, but somewhat empty, and so moderately recommended.<br /><br />This book's greatest strength is its writing style, but it is also one of the most irritating aspects. Kathy, the narrator, is intensely thoughtful and analytical, breaking down her personal history into eras, important moments, and developing themes. She walks the reader through the story of her life much in the way she lived it, slowly, very slowly, bringing to light her final realizations. In other words, there is a lot hidden in this book, and it takes the book's entire length--literally until the last fifteen pages--to reveal it all. In between are circuitous examples, where Kathy starts to talk about one event, goes back a bit to explain why the event was relevant, explains the event itself, and then goes on without having drawn a major conclusion--instead, she's just mapped another point on her gradual arc or argument. The resulting pace is excruciating, both artful, brilliantly thought-out and executed, and simply painful as the reader is lead along, disappointed, and lead along again. The book's pace bring the characters to life (although both Ruth and Tommy lack some dimension) and, with it, the life that they lived, through Hailsham and beyond. As such, it is the highlight of the book, worked like an artform, but it is also intensely irritating and makes the book (which actually reads quite quickly) seem longer than it is.<br /><br />There are a near-infinite number of issues, from the ethical to philosophical, that could be brought to question and debate in this book. The very premise almost begs them--both the science of the base culture and the purpose of Hailsham itself. Unfortunately, however, none of these topics are brought to issue in the text. Instead, the book is consumed by the very slow progression of the story, the creep towards the \\""twist\\"" revelations of who the children are and what purpose they serve. When finally revealed, these revelations are not all that big--not because they lack the potential to be, but because they pale in comparison to the immense buildup that leads to them. The characters just barely exceed the gradual revelation of the book's premise and are largely just passive carriers of the story, and so the other various issues, the possible debates, never enter into the text. So when other reviewers talk about the questions this book raises, what they're really talking about is the potential for questions--and that is not the same thing. The burden of meaning for this book, everything that the reader could take away and continue to think about, rests entirely on the reader, who must pull out the themes and ask the questions himself, carry on the debates himself. The author shirks his responsibility, and the book suffers for it, failing to live up to its potential.<br /><br />My final complaint with this book is that the underlying concept seems, blandly, unrealistic. **SPOILERS** follow, so be warned: The fact that in the book's contemporary culture the clones are considered non-human despite looking, acting, and living like humans seems entirely impossible.  Consider: Humans never viewed the first cloned animals asdifferent than their original counterparts; indeed, we were amazed and drew attention to the fact that they were identical, that they were clones. So why would cloned humans be any different (especially that these clones pass in human society as normal and indistinguishable)? Outside of the huge wastefulness of cloning entire humans just to harvest their organs, the fact that the cloned humans were not considered humans seems unreal to me, no matter who the gene donors were, no matter what brief attempts Ishiguro (though Ms. Emily) makes to justify it. **END SPOILERS** This is the underlying basis of the book's conflict and plot, and so problems with this concept create problems throughout the book. They weaken the foundations, making it difficult to accept the book and, as a result, even more difficult to take on the work of finding and analyzing themes, which the author fails too do. In the end, Never Let Me Go has a thoughtful premise with heavy potential for thought, theory, and debate, and it is skillfully, even artfully written, but the book fails to live up to its potential: the author does not tackle his own themes, and no matter how interesting the premise, it is an unreasonable one. I wanted to enjoy this book, and I did, but I felt cheated at the end: the final product was surprisingly empty, with the burden of meaning placed entirely and unfairly upon the reader alone.iginal counterparts; indeed, we were amazed and drew attention to the fact that they were identical, that they were clones.

But what saves this book is its underlying implications; it asks questions for the real world like: Are we truly helping when we endeavor to comfort and protect groups (racial, ethnic, political, religious, class, etc..) who are perceived as less fortunate than our own? Should we instead educate these groups so that they may empower themselves in time? OK. I'm being a bit leading here, but still these are important questions to ponder in this global society.<br /><br />Overall, Ishiguro deftly blends science fiction (bio-ethics) and more general socio-political themes to concoct an enjoyable thought-provoking experience. I happily recommend it.<br /><br />4 stars",2007-09-18

[[ASIN:038549081X The Handmaid's Tale: A Novel]] If you enjoyed NLMG, then I recommend HT.    This is my second book I've read by Ishiguro (prior was 'When We Were Orphans'). The remarkable items of this book are: 1) Ishiguro's consistent voice throughout the book as narrated by his character Kathy; 2) the form of the writing - I would describe as indirect & plodding, addressing the 'negative space' surounding the characters and habitat. The reader is left to 'peeling the onion' based on the many clues; 3) ethical issues that are raised.  After awhile it became apparent that the charatcers were human clones. To me, a clone implied a level of exactness and perfection in the outcome - that you knew exactly what result and outcome you wanted. However, I found the characters were flawed in a sense. Tommy's behaviorial outbursts, lower IQ and inability to produce meaningful art did not fit with the purposes of the program. Ruth seemed to be easily influenced by any person, object or thing that she encountered. She totally incoporated images found in magazines and hearsay as reality and really had no original ideas, although she did demonstrate a lot of empathy toward Kathy and Tommy before completing. Kathy was the most well-rounded person in the story. I found her to be almost a complete conformist to the Hailsham and Cottages system. She was a bit consumed with sex (not love per se) and sex seemed to lack meaning to her beyond mere intense desire.

The novel is divided into three parts: she tells first of her schooldays at Hailsham then her first year or so away from the school, and then finally recounts more recent events.   The narrative begins much like many memories of childhood and school, though Kathy and her friends Tommy and Ruth aren't like other children, and Hailsham isn't a standard educational institution. From the beginning there's mention of \\""carers\\"" and \\""donors\\"" and the children have no family. Soon it becomes clear that Ishiguro portrays an alternate universe in which biological technology has advanced more rapidly than in our world. In this alternate version of the 1990's England, society raises human clones to maturity in order to kill them and harvest their organs. Kathy, Tommy and Ruth are all young clones awaiting their destiny.  The author has instead chosen to look at the issue of genetic engineering through the eyes of characters who seldom consider the debate. The sensitivity and imagination he displays is such that the subject is treated in a distant, almost cool light. By choosing to enter the debate with a dramatic, heartrending account, Ishiguro enhances the emotional impact of his novel. The characters themselves offer no comment upon their lives, leaving the reader to form their own attachments and deliver their consequent judgment upon the issue.  Ishiguro's understated narration focuses on the way young people make a life out of whatever is on offer. Hailsham students are carefully sheltered from any real understanding of their fate and of the world in which it will be acted out, have nothing else to go on.  The depth and quality of the relationships between Kath, Tommy and Ruth certainly accentuate the cruelty of their deaths.

The plotline of the novel follows the fairly simple story of her recollection of a love triangle which began while she was a teenager at the exclusive but now defunct Hailsham House where she was schooled and, it would appear, raised.  The story seems mundane enough at first.  Girl loves longstanding male bestfriend, but subsumes her love when it becomes clear that her female best friend is also interested in the same boy.  Kathy's narrative is clean and matter of fact, full of the detail of day to day school day memories. The story of love lost and regained which drives the narrative forward is one which has been played out in love songs (like the fictional \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" song which Kathy takes to) for as long as love songs have been written.  But this is no ordinary coming of age story.  Nor is it really about a love story, although the whole concept of love, and artistic power is one which sets off the sinister underlying elements of the story.  It takes about 70 pages or so of hints before the reader is made aware that neither Kathy, nor her love interest Tommy or best friend Ruth are `like us' -- usual characters in the sense that the realistic matter-of-fact guise of this novel might indicate.  What the reader finally becomes aware of, more or less concurrent with the narrator, is that the characters are clones, `created' rather than born, solely for the sake of providing replacement parts for `humans,' a `species' to which these people clearly do not belong.<br /><br />And yet, of course they are exactly like us.  They hunger, desire, are moved by beauty and feel pain in exactly the same way.  And of course however they may have come into being, they have all the same neuro-linguistic perceptions as anyone might.  Somehow, and somewhere, one imagines a kind of parental set - the persons, scientists or whatever who have created them, and who has the responsibility for their existence.  These missing characters form part of the novel's setting - the backstory and backdrop which is never revealed.  The gods which created Kathy, Tommy and Ruth are missing from the novel, along with any kind of reference for morality.  Not quite missing however are those people after whom the clones are created--the \\""possibles\\"" -- and there is a kind of touching nostalgia of the sort that an adopted person might feel for his real but utterly inaccessible parents among the characters for their possible.  In his usual delicate and understated way, Ishiguro creates an extraordinary tension between the many dichotomies in the setting of this story that begins to take priority over the love story as the novel moves forward.  The first point of climax occurs when Kathy sees the head carer of Hailsham, \\""Madame,\\"" crying in her doorway after witnessing her dancing with her pillow to an old tune, the \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" of the title.<br /><br />For the reader, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy are simply characters, and it is Ishiguro's skill as a writer that the dichotomy between their obvious humanness and the non-human nature of their roles begins to sit uncomfortably at the back of the reader's head.  The three characters' growing self-awareness and sense of being different coupled with the learned inevitably of that difference becomes poignant when Ruth goes in search of her `possible.'  It is the closest any of them can get to their origins and so it is a powerful moment of loss and longing when the group of students suddenly sense the impossibility of ever striving to live the kind of lives they are longing for.<br /><br />The philosophical questions around the ethics of this world, or the terrible use of what are clearly people in this way is hardly raised, with the very brief exception of a last ditch visit made by Kathy and Tommy, in an attempt to get `out of' the donor program - based on a rumour circulated among the donors that anyone who demonstrated `true love' might get let off.  The lovers made their pilgrimage, and instead found some semblance of the horrible truth about their existence.<br /><br />But however present the moral question is in this story, it is never directly raised, and Ishiguro resists the urge to make it obvious.  If these people are artistic and capable of love, is their tragedy any greater?  If they don't mind their role, is it any less horrible?  It's impossible for the reader to take anything other than the position of horrified spectator in this strange world, and the more you think about it, the broader the implications of the questions raised.  Because in many ways, this isn't really a distopia about the horrors of organ donation, although there is a certain degree of discomfort at the notion of raising a species, or even animals, for such a utilitarian purposes.  But of course the whole issue of technological progress and morality is one which is upon us now, when even faces can be transplanted, and when machines capable of thinking are just around the corner.  The morality in this novel is pretty clear, but there are also hints that the book may be showing us more the similarities rather than the differences in the lives of these characters and those of the readers.  After all, we are all going to die after a relatively short life of utilitarian work on behalf of someone else, and while we may have the consolations of family which the characters in Never Let Me Go don't, the novel makes our own exertions on the hamster wheel seem almost as futile as Kathy's. It's a chilling notion that makes you want to go berserk just like Tommy.<br /><br />This is a powerful, expertly written novel which reads easily even as it leaves the reader deeply disturbed.  The unanswered questions it raises about what it means to be a human, about the nature of life, and about morality that will resonate with the reader beyond the pages of the book.<br /><br />Magdalena Ball is the author of [[ASIN:1904492967 Sleep Before Evening]]<br />\\""There is so much beautiful writing here, soaring passages.\\""get let off.

Because in many ways, this isn't really a distopia about the horrors of organ donation, although there is a certain degree of discomfort at the notion of raising a species, or even animals, for such a utilitarian purposes.  But of course the whole issue of technological progress and morality is one which is upon us now, when even faces can be transplanted, and when machines capable of thinking are just around the corner.  The morality in this novel is pretty clear, but there are also hints that the book may be showing us more the similarities rather than the differences in the lives of these characters and those of the readers.  After all, we are all going to die after a relatively short life of utilitarian work on behalf of someone else, and while we may have the consolations of family which the characters in Never Let Me Go don't, the novel makes our own exertions on the hamster wheel seem almost as futile as Kathy's. It's a chilling notion that makes you want to go berserk just like Tommy.    This is a powerful, expertly written novel which reads easily even as it leaves the reader deeply disturbed.  The unanswered questions it raises about what it means to be a human, about the nature of life, and about morality that will resonate with the reader beyond the pages of the book.

When I read about Never Let Me Go and saw the wildly polarized reviews, I knew I had to read the book; something from an author I respect that inspired such emotion couldn't be bad, I thought. I was right.     A quick plot summary: Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy are students at an isolated boarding school called Hailsham. They have no parents or last names or any connection with the outside world, all they have is one another. Over the years, the three characters become more and more entwined through ties of friendship and, as they grow older, love. After they graduate, they begin to realize their special fate, why they were raised at this isolated school, and it is this heartbreaking realization that colors the rest of their short time together. The entire story is told by Kathy poignantly looking back on it all. Quintessential Ishiguro.     FIrst, I must say that I am baffled at all the negative reviews of this book. What did you expect when you picked it up? Some sort of Blade Runner-esque thriller? I think perhaps readers were drawn in by the \\""science fiction\\"" premise, and expected something totally different than what Ishiguro provides. This book is not about cloning or its ethical ramifications, although I guess some of this is inevitably present. I believe Ishiguro only frames the story with these quietly horrific issues in order to put a magnifying glass to the lesser ways we are all guilty of the same thing that Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth are: passivity.     The book is a beautiful meditation on the idea that in some way or the other most of us don't go after what's really important in the time that's given us - true love, that American Dream, our dream profession, whatever we value most -  and how our own self-delusion makes breaking free and pursuing our own happiness so damn hard. It's not beautiful in a conventional way - you won't find any stunning turns of phrase or verbal pyrotechnics - but that's not Ishiguro's style. Rather, on a larger scale, every scene is perfectly fitted with the next, every tidbit revealed about the character's lives absolutely essential, every memory blurred with exactly the right amount of doubt, so that the entire novel shimmers with the gleam of complete truth.     While Never Let Me Go is not a page turner in the traditional sense, I, for one, could not put it down and I finished it in a day and a half. If any of the subject matter I discussed above interests you in the least, you won't be able to put it down either and I will bet that in the days following, your thoughts will also be haunted about how much your life might be like those of the students at Hailsham, about the paths you haven't taken in your own life.

However, it stayed with me after I finished it and I found myself liking it better after I had put more thought into it.    Never Let Me Go centers on the lives of three main characters, Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth.  Kathy, the narrator, and the other main characters grow up at Hailsham, which initially appears to be some type of boarding school but which we quickly learn is something different.  Hailsham is a facility where children who have been created so that their vital organs can be harvested and used by others are housed.  We learn that Hailsham is only one of numerous such facilities and that the Hailsham students are comparatively fortunate to live in humane conditions and to be treated kindly by their caregivers.  The children are told little by little about their intended purpose, and are told over and over again how special they are.  They are told also that they will never have children and will never participate in the careers that other people have.  The social justification for using them in this manner seems to be that since they are clones, they don't have souls and therefore there isn't a moral or ethical problem with it.  Members of the society who have created the clones are repulsed by the idea of interacting with them firsthand; they are afraid to come face to face with the reality that the clones are in fact human beings.  We eventually learn that Hailsham was created as an experiment; an effort on the part of a few socially responsible individuals to show that the clones might possess souls.    As the book progresses, the main characters leave Hailsham and begin living the lives that have been planned for them; for a time they serve as \\""carers\\"" to the other donors, and then they become donors themselves.  The characters are well drawn and realistic.  Through them we are able to experience firsthand the suffering and dehumanization inherent in their situation.  We also get a better idea of the complexity of their situation and what it might be like to be in that position.  It is apparent that these characters are interesting and intelligent people and that they could be active contributors to society.  It is also apparent, however, that they know they will never be given the chance.  In some ways they have the same loves and desires as all people, and in other ways their ability to form attachments and sustain relationships is stunted by their situation.    During the time that Kathy is narrating the book, she is still a carer but realizes that she will likely be summoned to become a donor at any time.  After having lost touch with Ruth and Tommy about ten years before, she reconnects with both of them by becoming Ruth's carer.  Soon after that, she sees Ruth die or \\""complete\\"" as they call it.  When Ruth dies it seems that she is very aware of what an unfair and brutal hand she has been dealt, and while Kathy sympathizes with her it doesn't appear that she shares Ruth's feelings.  Kathy does experience some grief at losing her friend, but her grief is tempered with blind acceptance of the inevevibility of Ruth's death and is in no way comparable to what the average person experiences when a friend dies.  Kathy's place in society has robbed her of the ability to feel that she and her friends have any right to live out full, active lives.    After Ruth's death, Kathy and Tommy begin in earnest the romantic relationship they wish they had had years earlier.  They are able to do this via Kathy becoming Tommy's carer.  Tommy has already lost three vital organs and expects to be summoned at any time for his fourth and final donation.  The pair decide to follow up on a rumor they have heard that two former Hailsham students who are genuinely in love might have an opportunity to have their fate deferred for two years.  The two cling to this possibility and decide to pursue it.When they decide they are ready to apply for deferment, they track down a former Hailsham administrator.  Predictably, they learn that the deferment was just a rumor and that no such possibilities exist for the likes of them.  They do learn more about what Hailsham really was and about the circumstances surrounding their childhoods and their creation.  Although contacting Hailsham's former staff members makes them aware that there are non-clones out there who believe that their situation is unjust and morally wrong, this doesn't lead them to explore or even consider the possibility that there is any future for them other than living out the lives which have been prearranged for them.    One might wonder why the main characters don't rebel, but the answer is obvious.  They have been programmed from an early age to believe that they are donors and nothing else.  Also, the members of broader society have found subtle ways of letting them know there is no way out.  Naturally, they don't or can't question the society they live in and their role in it.  It is apparent that the donors are not satisfied with their fate, but they cannot question the society that assigned them their role.  The only way of changing their circumstances that they can even conceive of is to cling to a pathetic hope that their fate could be \\""deferred\\"" for two years - if they are found to be sufficiently worthy.  There is some real psychological truth to this novel; things don't change very easily once a practice like this has begun and has become ingrained in society.  Ishiguro is exploring some complicated issues in this book, but I don't believe his focus is intended to be on the issues surrounding human cloning.  Instead, he is focusing on broader questions, such as the morality of people using other humans as a means to an end, whether or not a human life has inherent value, and whether or not we are accountable for how we treat others even if their lives don't have intrinsic value.  He is exploring what can happen when we deny humans their humanity.  This author subtly makes the point that we may be confusing certain issues by asking the wrong questions.  The people who created these clones justify using them for donor organs by telling themselves the clones don't have souls.  But obviously that isn't what matters.  The clones' suffering is just as real as anyone else's and it is not moral to put another human being in that position, whether or not that person's life is intrinsically valuable and whether or not that person has a soul.    I realize Ishiguro is not an American author, but some of these issues are particularly relevant to Americans.  Not for the obvious reason that cloning and stem cell research are now hot media topics but because the suffering which is caused by unchecked greed and selfishness is the real focus of this novel.  Americans are notorious for letting our greed motivate us to treat other humans as a means to an end.  For example, a large percentage of the products and foods we purchase on a daily basis cost much less than they should, as the people who worked to create them are not compensated adequately and thus are forced to live in substandard conditions.  We treat other humans as a means to an end every day and do not seem interested in stopping this from happening.  It is that type of selfishness which is exemplified by the situation of the clones in this novel.  It is well known by most members of the society Ishiguro describes that the clones generally spend their childhoods in substandard living conditions and that as adults they undergo a brutal process of having their vital organs taken for use by others.  It is also apparent to anyone who chooses to be realistic about the situation that they are just as human as anyone else and entitled to the same rights.  But because of human selfishness, a situation that could easily be put to an end is permitted to continue and expand, and at the end of the novel we see no endin sight to this practice.",2007-06-30

We follow the lives of Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy, students at Hailsham, a picturesque boarding school. Only about halfway into the novel is the nature of this society completely revealed, when we find that the students are clones, living as normal humans until their organs are needed.     Fortunately, the story never directly questions societal ethics of cloning. Doing so, even slightly, would have changed the tone to a political bent, shredding the tender story. And although he doesn't question cloning, he does, however, lead the reader to an underlying answer while maintaining a tight reign over the actual storyline.     Ishiguro broaches many topics, such as societal detachment and the struggle of a minority class, but its his focus on the aching to belong, an experience that, I venture to guess, most people feel or have felt at some point, that gives us real emotions filtered, only mildly, through prose.     Kathy is one of few students raised at Hailsham, where the caretakers focus on creative outlets; we discover later that the art is being preserved as possible evidence of students' humanity. Oddly enough, the caretakers miss the student's self awareness and emotional maturations, arguably the most human of all traits.     Through Kathy H., we see that the students are capable of ranging emotions, from sadness and forgiveness to lust and curiosity. She excels as a \\""carer\\"" because she interacts with the dying on a personal level, interprets their moods, and calms them. As a human-like force, she doesn't embrace the horrific outcome of her life and list towards death like many of her peers, she focuses on her friends, repairing old mistakes and forming stronger bonds.     In spite of the sci-fi setting, the unique traits of Ishiguro's narratives, such as a languorous flow and inherent subtlety, allow him to slip rather significantitems into the story without any grandiose epiphanies. You feel as though you're like sitting with a friend, listening to recalled events, some familiar and some new.     After reading the last chapter, I honestly didn't know how to feel. Tapped out emotionally, I just desperately needed a hug.

The dystopian element was just an added bonus.  <br /> <br />The novel takes place over three decades of the three friends' lives. The first is while they are sheltered students at a mysterious boarding school, where the children are regarded as special, but never told why. The second phase of the book is when the students, now young adults, are transferred to a residential compound where they begin developing romantic relationships. The third phase is during their adulthood, when they begin to serve their \\""purpose\\"" in life. The relationship between the three friends is heart wrenching and poignant as they face the reality of their futures together. <br /> <br />Ishiguro has an interesting way of writing prose. It is sort of flat and detached, almost as though he is holding back, but still resonates. I think the detachment serves to reinforce the strange lives these children and young adults have led. All in all, it is a deeply disturbing look at the human condition, love, and loyalty in the face of despair.",2007-06-06

There is an incredible number of alternative views the reader can take as to its purpose, meaning, symbols, structure, etc. which makes it unbelievably rich. It is a deceivingly short work of an unsuspected density.<br /><br />As one would expect from this writer, the book seems to have been worked on over and over again so that the seemingly casual style can only be the result of careful planning, rather than fluid and thoughtless writing.<br /><br />Contrary to some other masterpieces of his (mainly \\""An Artist of the Floating World\\""), Ishiguro doesn't blur here the line of time and events, probably so as not to have the reader worrying too much about the practical (sciencefictional) details of the plot.<br /><br />Contrary to what has been said by many reviewers, I think it is a very wise and deliberate move to keep the practical questions out of the story. Because this way the book sticks out much more obviously as a metaphor for a number of human conditions. One is naturally drawn to the obvious parallelisms between the dilemmas that afflict the characters in the book and many of the unsolvable plights of humanity: death, fate, meaning of life, freedom of choice, love, sense of duty as an answer to the futility of existence, you name it.<br /><br />The extraordinary circumstances of the characters on this book are in the end an extremely useful literary device to distill these problems to their essence, to bare them for the reader.<br /><br />That's the way it worked for me, anyway.

As fiction it wears a bit thin.

The prose is disarmingly simple and feminine and the first person goes into great depth about her school.

Similarly, I don't think we care about people in industrial situations who slave to make our heaven for us - not to mention all kinds of farm animals kept in poor conditions. Those in comfort could not care less as long as they can maintain their status.

Were they cloned to have an extra liver, a third kidney?  I don't believe so, because I thought the general public was against cloning biologically superior beings (they didn't want to be replaced).

Perhaps he was just skimming over that because he didn't know how it would be possible either.  An author like Michael Crichton (one of my favorites) would have explained it in great detail.  Crichton is certainly superior to Ishiguro in that sense, but Ishiguro is superior in character development and emotions.

But, if you give the book a chance to do its work, you realize after all that the plot doesn't really matter.

Hailsham, a diferent kind of school located in the English countryside for \\""donors and carers\\"", far away from the madding crowd, is a special community comprising people guarding a secret and others who, we are soon to discover with growing horror, are the secret. Yet these mysterious donors and carers - who are they anyway is a question that constantly nags at you - don't behave like humanoids, robots, freaks or characters from \\""The Stepford Wives\\"". To most readers' puzzlement perhaps, they seem to exhibit all the traits you'd expect of normal human beings.     Kathy, Tommy and Ruth, the trio at the heart of the novel, are all products of Hailsham, who become fast friends from the time they discover one another and eventually find their relationship stretched, tested and strained by feelings of possessiveness, jealousy, one-up-manship, etc. But there's also genuine tenderness as between Kathy and Tommy, and finally deep compassion and love amongst all three that we can all identify with. Surprisingly too, while bred for a specific purpose and in a hothouse environment, there's no escaping the fact that these donors and carers are naturally drawn to activities that allow them to express their own innate sense of creativeness. If there's a message in Ishiguro's crushingly sad tale of people relentlessly seeking hope in a world where none exists, it's to remind us of the indomitable human spirit, the unextinguishable flame that lives even in the hearts of these manufactured human specimens. What more of real human beings ?     Ishiguro is one of that rare breed of fast disappearing modern writers who eschews bombast and linguistic pyrotechnics in favour of simplicity because he truly understands the power of good writing and the efficacy of utilising a directness in his plaintively incandescent prose to make that instant connection withthe reader. Trust me, you will be hard pressed to find even the occasional big word that requires consultation with the dictionary. Ishiguro has rediscovered the lost art of creative writing, a craft that assures him a place among the greats in contemporary fiction.    \\""Never Le Me Go\\"" is arguably the best among last year's Booker candidates.

Time is precious.  So precious, in fact, that I wonder whether it is worth spending the time reading this book!  For me, it serves more as an enigmatic koan than as an articulate exploration of existential concerns.  *  Ishiguro says that over the preceding decade he had written a few stories concerning unspecified 'students' living in run down accommodation in the English countryside; he liked these tales, but did not know how to order them as part of some larger structure; then he chanced upon a science program and the idea struck him that they might be clones.  He claims not to be very interested in, or knowledgeable about, science, and that his aim was not to critique current developments in reproductive technology.  *  My experience of reading the book was one where the narrator, Kathy, was more a permanent child, rather than a 31 year old woman. She and her clone peers are children who never grow up.  More disturbing is the implication that they do not want to grow up.  They all are cramped by this overwhelming passivity.  Seemingly devoid of intellectual curiosity, they are fearful of finding out too much about their circumstances.  Perhaps Ishiguro is implying that we are all like this, at least in part, and in order to cast an unflinching gaze upon this aspect of our characters he has chosen to simplify his cast - they have been pared down to the traits he wishes to meditate upon.  *  This minimalism of characterisation extends to a minimalism of mood.  The book is the literary equivalent of an overcast day.  The low heavy sky presses down on every page, and if one were to lift one's eyes away there, through a curtained window, would lie the sad green of country England.  Kathy, the narrator, constrains the amplitude of her emotions.  Hers are the small concernsof a compliant child at boarding school. She wishes not to make trouble, she wishes to be liked and to 'get on', and she accepts the role she is being asked to play in society as her duty.  Her friend, Ruth, while similarly fearful, has mild aspirations towards climbing above her station, while the boy they share, Tommy, is even less reflective than they, his inner life expressed through ineffectual rages and tears. Sex is a bodily function, mildly disapproved of, as if by some understanding county vicar.  It hardly stirs the passions.  *  Obviously some readers find all of this effective.  With so few distractions, one is forced to dwell repeatedly on a narrow set of concerns.  The writing is simple in a thoughtful way, with uncomplicated rhythms, and a voice that is true to itself.  Perhaps reading this can put one in a ruminative state where it becomes possible to contemplate one's own mortality and corporeality.  *  Yet I'm not convinced that the book is a success.  The choice of the actual subject matter feels poorly explored and, as a result, arbitrary.  The fact that these characters are clones asks for a more thorough and imaginative and coherent realisation of the world which bred them - to leave their passivity enigmatic is something of a gimmick, a trick that ostensibly leaves room for the reader's imagination, but which also spares the author quite some work.  Ishiguro is implying a dystopia, but it is one glimpsed through the blinkered eyes of one of its seemingly rather dull victims - it means the reader potentially gets to see and to understand as little as the narrator, or at least little more.  The actual interpersonal relationships portrayed are also very limited.  They do not develop in depth beyond childhood allegiances and lusts, and so they do not serve as triggers for thoughts about adult interactions.  The lack of family interactions, necessitated by the premiss of clones, makes the book all the more irrelevant to reality.  *  So much of lifeis left out!  What is left can generate existential thoughts, but these quickly expire for want of an exciting, expansive narrative structure.  Ishiguro is an accomplished musician, and here he has created a miniature reminiscent of those by his compatriot Takemitsu Toro.  It might also be said to exemplify the Japanese aesthetic ideal of wasa sabi - it is restrained, it has an undercurrent of haunting longing, and it has an acceptance of sadness and evanescence.  Yet in the end it is an English novel, and I wonder whether the intended aesthetic is at odds with the chosen form.",2006-12-03

The story is set in England and is told by Kathy; although she spends much of the book looking back over her life, the 'current' date is somewhere in the late 1990s. Kathy has been working as a carer for eleven years, though she will probably be stepping down within the next twelve months. As a carer, it's her job to look after organ donors. Given that her donors tend to have excellent recovery times, it's something she seems to be very good at. However, it's also clear that the donors she cares for donate repeatedly. In fact, from early in the book, there's the suspicion that her patients are only 'allowed' to stop donating when they die - or 'complete', as Kathy puts it.  <br /> <br />Kathy studied at Hailsham : more or less a boarding school, apparently quite prestigious, though also a little unusual. There's an air of familiarity between the pupils and the staff - who are referred to as guardians, rather than teachers.

What prevents them from just leaving the situation?  You want to shake them awake.    Third -- and this relates to their sheeplike nature, I suppose -- very little actually happens in this book.  It's mostly talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.  Character studies, I suppose, but listless and uninteresting characters.

There's a lot of focus on the prosaic lifestyle/setting of boarding schools, so, if you can't stomach it, you probably won't finish the book. <br /> <br />The kicker, as detailed already by lots of commentators, is that these children are really being home grown as clones in which they will, when they reach maturity, give their body parts so that real people, as they are defined, will live longer.  From birth they are taught this is a noble thing and it only boils down to how many body parts they can give before they die and there are even names for continuing states of giving body parts. <br /> <br />The idea isn't too far out there as far as sci fi ideas go, though, this is marketed as mainstream fiction.  We've been cloning animals with some success and today there are people who buy body parts from each other.  Let's not forget the kidney thing in China, the paper issue of someone in NYC buying a liver from some poor person in South America and there's also some evidence of a Middle Eastern prince who flies around in his jet and has a 25 year old kid who will give his heart to this prince if said prince has heart problems and needs a new heart. <br /> <br />All said, unless you like the author's writing style, it may not be worth it to continue. <br /> <br />Most people reading this to the end in my book club found it creepy and it is.

US,52955528,R1FA3042UJEIKQ,1400078776,813354201,"Never Let Me Go",Books,3,15,23,N,N,"occasionally interesting but flawed and often tedious","There's a line between understatement and tedium that comes too close to the latter in this novel. I understand the author wants to stress the ordinariness of the events as a cover for the evil or horror of what is being concealed.  Shirley Jackson did that well. But in this novel it's overdone to the point that I think many people will not get past the overwhelming detail to the understated points.  For that reason I can't see recommending this novel.  The subtlety is nice, but you have to be motivated to keep on despite the blase events and characters that conceal the evil. The novel is often very very slow.  <br /> <br />In addition, you wonder if the setting is undeveloped to lead the reader to question, or if the author was just careless or lazy, not interested in putting in the effort to fully develop his theme.  There's too much that doesn't fit.  If the characters are not human and have no emotions, then why do they need the emotional support of \\""carers\\"". Contrariwise, if society doesn't recognize that these are people, then why set up the system of carers for these donors?  Why not warehouse and harvest the donors when adults as carelessly as they warehoused them as kids?   And if these kids were warehoused during their formative years (except for those lucky few at progressive places like Hailsham) then why do these creatures need personal carers after a lifetime of institutionalism?  Or why not go a step further and stunt their emotions so fully that they have no needs this way, or do the equivilent of a physical lobotomy.  And if the creatures or donors do have full human emotions, why don't they rebel, try to escape their fate?  Or contrariwise, why don't the ones who were raised in warehouse situation just turn out as sociopaths, who have no fellow feeling?  Even the ones raised outside of Hailsham seem pathetic and sweet, nor sinister.  Yet the administrators of Hailsham state that they find the young clones who were more humanely raised horrifying and are terrified of them. It would seem it would be more horrifying to \\""animate\\"" their creatures (a la frankenstein), rather than warehouse them,  yet that's what Hailsham endeavors to do, animating the monster they say they are already horrified of, making more human what they already find inhuman.  Yet they don't act terrified of them when the novel reaches its cusp, more concerned again, with the mundane task of moving a piece of furniture than the supposedly \\""terrifying\\"" students who broke out of the mold enough to seek out some answers.  The whole scenario thus doesn't hang together at all. The characters, motivations and situations are neither one nor the other and the result is not very plausible.  If the characters are so bland because they are subhuman and brainwashed, then why do the administrators also seem to suffer from similar lack of affect in crucial scenes -- leading one to believe the author just can't write emotion, not that it is the clones who are subhuman.  And if the clones are not engineered to be passive, then where is the rebellion among at least some of the Hailsham students, or among the others less humanely raised, where is the rage or the sociopathic behavior? Particularly among the warehoused ones?   <br /> <br />The disjointedness of the book I'm sure leads to lots of discussion among book groups, and questions in the reader's minds, but it seems these questions are not for the ethics involved but there mostly because of all the red herrings the author left undeveloped or unresolved.  I'm never convinced that's good writing, even if it leads to endless discussion.  <br /> <br />It's hard to know what message the author intended. The book ends not with a bang but a whimper, and since no one else in the novel seemed to care about these events or characters, why should the reader?  For every person that finishes this book, many readers will drop along the wayside, drowned in detail or tedium. For those that do finish it, the sense is thatperhaps they should have dropped out as well.  The author needed to put more effort into making a statement one way or the other, creating a more plausible scenario, or even some definite emotions.  <br /> <br />The events culminated in the main character feeling a little bit of revelation, and then going back to her quasilife, on to her next appointment, her path unwavering. The Hailsham administrators supposedly spent the whole of their lives trying to make a better environment for these children but when two show up on their doorstep having broken out of the \\""mold\\"", the administrators are still more concerned with moving a piece of furniture.  If there's a statement there, it's almost so existential as to be moot, that perhaps none of the 'humanity' in this novel, cloned or otherwise, had a real emotion, or knew what to do with one if they had it.   <br /> <br />For a more engaging dystopian situation,  read \\""This Perfect Day\\"" by Ira Levin.  <br /> <br />",2006-10-27

I've found this book troubling in many ways, and months after I read it, I just had to comment for others.  The amazing insight I got from Ishiguro's book was that these clones are much like all of us--always ready to move on, even when we know that what we're moving toward is awful.   <br /> <br />Several people have commented that they wanted Kathy to escape her fate, and were profoundly disturbed that this never occurred to her as she  meekly marched toward her destiny.  I think this is a realistic observation of the human condition, and after reading the book, I began finding myself noticing that all people seem to move through all the rites of passage in their lives with eagerness, just as Kathy and her peers did.  In fact, Kathy, like all of us, is always impatient to get to the next milestone, even as this movement brings her inexorably toward pain and death.  Why would we be surprised by this intensely human reaction?   <br /> <br />The story didn't feel like science fiction, nor like a reprise of other clone books written in the past several decades.  It felt like a very normal coming-of-age story about humans who just happened to be clones, callously created to rescue others.  So, I was never shocked, nor did I want them to escape.

The fact that you can easily blow through it in just a few sittings in no way diminishes its impact.    Before reading this book I had read a few of the reviews on Amazon and I knew that it was a book about a somewhat science-fictiony theme. (I won't spoil it here -- I think that even a general idea of what it's about spoils some of the darker elements of the story.) A lot of the reviewers would criticize the plot: Would the characters really behave that way? Is that how it would really happen? But to look at it like this, I think, misses the point.    It's significant that Ishiguro informs us on the first page that this story takes place in \\""England, late 1990s.\\"" This is not a cautionary tale, warning us not to let science take us down a certain road. In Ishiguro's fictional world, the road has *already been taken*. The decisions have been made, the outcomes have already transpired. All that remains is to ponder the meaning of the events he relates. As such, \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" is not really even a science fiction book in the ordinary sense. What Ishiguro has done is create a powerful and haunting metaphor for the human condition.     We follow the Hailsham students from when they are children through adulthood. Along the way we experience all the major events of their lives. And yet, for these characters, some of the significant transformations of our own lives -- the discovery of sex, for instance -- are treated as no big deal; they happen and everyone moves on as if nothing has changed. There is another understanding they must come to, however -- a darker truth about the Hailsham students that is completely alien to our own existence. It is this brilliant stroke that allows Ishiguro to paint us a symbolic portrait of our own lives -- with all their mysteries and joys, the sadness of aging and loss and death, and the search for meaning -- in such a way that we can view it with entirely new eyes.     Is destiny assured? Are our fates inevitable, or canwe do something to change them? And if we could, would we have the courage to do it? What is the nature of human relationships? Is every human being born equal, or are some more worthy than others? For that matter, what does it mean to be human? Are we the products of a loving creator, or are we ultimately all alone?    This is a moving, masterful book, told with deceptively simple language. But be warned: It is by no means a feel-good story. Come to it prepared to think about uncomfortable truths, to be teased into drifting back through your own half-forgotten memories, and to ponder the inevitable.    P.S. I often hear this book compared to Margaret Atwood's \\""The Handmaid's Tale,\\"" but I don't think that's quite accurate. While some of the themes are similar, Atwood's novel really *is* a speculative, cautionary science fiction book about a possible future; in this case, an America transformed by exaggeratedly fundamentalist religious ideas. Ironically, if I had to compare \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" to any other book of recent memory, the one I might compare it to is Atwood's other science fiction novel, \\""Oryx and Crake.\\"" The stories aren't much alike at all, but somehow the mood seems similar.",2006-09-07

In light of this and the page-turning device of unfolding basic information in a much extended, backward sort of way, the novel to me struck only one sustained, tear-jerking note while I waited for the last bits of information to be revealed.

I was intrigued by the concept of this novel, knowing only that it involved a dystopian society.  The subject matter was interesting (I don't want to spoil it for those who have not read the book), but I ultimately believe that the intrinsic visceral nature of what the author discusses drives the reader's emotional response rather than Ishiguro evoking any sentiments or thoughts through his actual words.  The characters are sympathetic, but I felt that much more could have been done with them, their drives and motivations fleshed out more so that the reader truly empathized with their plight.  To be honest, although the characters face a clearly horrific future, they actually don't seem all that bothered by it, which in my mind greatly detracts from Ishiguro's aim of humanizing science. <br /> <br />I will say that I found to book to be greatly compelling while I was reading it.  Most chapters end on cliffhangers, and the prose flows organically, such that you can move through the book briskly and with ease.  But I can't help but feel that the first two parts of the book are more engaging and captivating, while the final third is anticlimactic and disappointing.  The big payoff is never truly delivered and I didn't feel that any of the answers offered to the story's \\""Big Questions\\"" were all that surprising or inspired.   <br /> <br />Kathy H is an interesting choice for a narrator, and I applaud Ishiguro's decision here.  However, I feel like this issue has been dealt with better in books like \\""The Handmaid's Tale\\"" or \\""Brave New World\\"".  The subject material may be timely, but I did not feel the ultimate story was innovative here.  It is clear what the main points the author wishes to drive home, because anyone who has ever thought sensibly about the issues will have considered them, I just feel that Ishiguro fails to make his points any more salient than they inherently are.  It's a subtle distinction, but while I was engaged by Kathy H, I never really felt invested in her. <br /> <br />I wanted to like this book, and by and large I did enjoy reading it.  I just don't think it captivates beyond the immediate reading experience, and was not so remarkable that I would feel the need to read it again.

It was my first Ishiguro--it won't be my last. Kudos to Lieutenant Colonel O'Gorman's stunning cover photo, `Christina.' The image of the young lady with the Rapunzel locks colored my reading all the way through the book. She was so human--I immediately associated her with Kathy H. And she had mystery--what in the hell was she staring at? Her pose connotes aloneness, an effect enhanced by O'Gorman's use of what I'm guessing was a very long telephoto.<br /><br />Ishiguro's tale lived up to its cover. He is a master of subtext and indirection, takes his time dribbling out plot details--he's like Margaret Atwood that way--you're on page one hundred or so before you're really sure what fate is awaiting the characters. His most evasive technique of camouflaging the plot is the jargon used by the students at Halisham--`carers,' `the fourth turning.' The students use these words like everyone should know them while the poor reader is left to decipher their meaning through context.<br /><br />Once their fate became clear to me, I went through a phase where I thought surely they would be rescued. Escape would have been so easy--they weren't under lock and key. And then I began to realize that none of them ever intended to escape--the notion was foreign to them. They were all resigned to the fourth turning. And that made me angry. They had by then so impressed me with their humanity, I saw their destiny as premeditated murder. I kept thinking of Dylan Thomas' famous closer: \\""Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\\""  I found it incongruous that the students should be able to go gentle into that good night, albeit one body part at a time.

Stylistically, it reminded me a little of Chang-rae Lee's A Gesture Life, except that Lee's narrator (occasionally) seems aware that he is unforthcoming with the depths of character that animate him, while Kathy does not. There is an atmosphere of pathos throughout Kathy's tale, but nothing keen enough to pierce the reader to the heart. It feels rather suffocating than moving. <br /> <br />The plot seems like a sci-fi conceit, but this is not science fiction any more than When We Were Orphans is a detective novel. It's closer to a sadistically ironic coming-of-age tale, which requires us to follow the mundane and frequently dull events of Kathy's childhood and young adulthood as we, and she, gradually come to understand that there is no adulthood drawing us forward, no age to come at which one will feel like a real person, and all the petty growing pains of childhood will become meaningful in retrospect. Kathy and her peers lead ephemeral lives that are just as ordinary as real lives. These individuals are not tragic poems that blaze brightly before disappearing too soon; they are simply conscious human beings whose horizon sits uncomfortably close. The novel might be mistaken for a dystopic fantasy of the future but for the fact that, though published in 2005, it locates the story in \\""England, late 1990s\\""--this is in fact a look back to a moment receding into the past. Perhaps what is so disturbing about Ishiguro's vision is that it turns our attention as if to something we missed along the way, but without delivering any epiphanies, undermining any illusions we might have been harboring, consciously or not, that beneath the surface of the everyday are great, shining truths or profoundly devastating tragedies. Instead, there is a persistant sense of longing, loss, and failure of understanding--the very things we sought to escape through insight.

In this case, the observation is similar to that made by Ishiguro in his earlier works:  namely, it is easier, but emptier, to live a life where the rules of living have been defined.   By showing the barrenness of a life where obedience is a substitute for emotion, Ishiguro argues that people should challenge assumptions and define their own lives before they lose the capacity to make those changes.   <br /> <br />While this theme is relevant, its effect is muted by the stark structure that Ishiguro uses to tell his story.  To put it simply, it's difficult to develop a connection or attachment to characters like Kathy and Tommy that have trouble displaying emotion.

Also, outside biology, Never Let Me Go accumulates more incoherencies, begged questions and general disbelievabilities than any three novels by Jules Verne.  <br /> <br />This accepted, the novel's background is a present-day England and Wales where, after WW2, advanced transplant practices would have become a major social fact, and an untold number of children would have been raised from birth to be (nothing but) transplant donors. The narrator, Kathy, is one such future organ bank. Her and her peers' belief is that they have been produced by cloning from particular individuals (each different, perhaps for genetic variety). What is certainly true is that they are made infertile as infants.  <br /> <br />It is impossible to tell whether Kathy and the donors she knows are a special category among donors, or simply a typical group among donors of that age. (This is one of the hundreds of questions that go begging and for which Kathy shows no concern at all.) However, for that group at least, childhood is spent in special orphanages from which they never go out until they leave at sixteen. There is then a limbo period where they are lodged in more open surroundings and begin to interact with \\""normals\\"" outside their previous supervisors, especially in outings where they pass for normals. These one, two or three years end with their decision to become donors immediately or, more commonly, to spend some time first as \\""carers\\"".  <br /> <br />Supplying an explanation where Ishiguro does not, I surmise that it is much preferred that organs be cropped on need from the living donor. There are a maximum of three living donations, and death is simply the last donation (at best the fourth), known as the \\""complete\\"". There seem to be several years from one donation to the next. The organs must be in perfect health. If after a donation the donor's health declines, then she or he completes early. She may also request that from psychological lassitude. The function of carers is to provide psychological support so that recoveries go better and the full run of separate donations can be achieved. <br /> <br />From their first donation until completion donors live in one smallish institution, among many in various spots of England or Wales. Novice carers are attached to one residence, but those with more experience travel by car from donor to donor. Kathy is an exceptional carer, having reached twelve years' experience, and the age of thirty-one. The novel is the biography she puts down, hopefully for other carers, before her first donation. She does not live in an institution but in an ordinary bedsit somewhere, which is rather rare. Most people who take up caring last very few years in that function, because of poor competence or psychological stress. Some do not even learn to drive, a sign that they intend to be carers only for a small spate.  <br /> <br />All question-begging aside, as a work of literature the novel has several flaws. Kathy is not very bright, and these are 250 pages of not-very-bright prose. Even at that, the naivety of the earlier parts is a psychological impossibility once we know what she has learned later, but before putting pen to paper. The first two thirds of the novel are concerned with her five last years at the orphanage and her first year or so after that. One character comes to dominate these two thirds, Ruth, a duplicitous point-scorer who has cornered dim Kathy into being best friends with her. The impression is that Ruth has taken over the novel because Ishiguro does not have a very clear idea of what he wants to do. But the final third, relating Kathy's last year, is worse. Here, Ishiguro provides three \\""resolutions\\"". First, Ruth Confesses Her Wrongs Before Dying (completing). Second, Many Mysteries Are Clarified  (more or less) in a yet-more-unlikely interview. Finally, Kathy is At Last Reunited with Her Original Sweetheart, from whom Ruth has kept her away all those years -- for a while after his third donation (shades of Evangeline). Structurally the entire work belongs to the young-readers section. <br /> <br />Never Let Me Go's literary point, however, is foreign to its novelistic structure. It is an inborn atmosphere, never stated, but to my mind pointed to by the title (which Ishiguro does not explain except as a song title from the fifties). \\""Never let me go\\"", or the equivalent converse, \\""may I never let you go\\"", is what no donor can say except in an evanescent romantic dream. Just has they have no parents and will have no children, donors are taught very early that they do not \\""have\\"" a body, they're carekeepers for one. Likewise, at the same age they learn that they have no future in the sense of an unknown fate to be built. More accurately, they learn that all of them have one definite future, as if they were cattle with awareness. So the entire tone of the novel, at several depths, is detachment. Because the individual and collective future of donors is a given, they are not very attached to any person (including \\""normals\\"" they may have sex with), to any endeavor, to any accomplishment except caring, to any possession, to their own feelings or indeed to any choice. From the earliest age their life is to Let Go. That is the singular sentiment made concrete by 250 pages in Kathy's voice.  <br /> <br />I bought this book because of a not quite accurate review by Anita Desai in the Sept. 22, 2005, New York Review of Books. On the face of it Desai is a much better writer than Ishiguro, and her review is a more memorable literary work than the novel it discusses. My feeling is that, given the material in the last paragraph, Ishiguro could have written an excellent short story. But it would have brought in not one hundredth of the money the novel will bring in, and indeed it would have been little noticed. As it is, the story is drowned in a pre-adult nineteenth-century novel, scandalously indifferent to any hint of science, and all that survives is the tone: detachment.",2006-07-05

But I don't want to give anything away -- part of the joy of Ishiguro's writing is the way he teases out the details of the world they live in without making it feel like he's intentionally withholding information to build suspense. The narrative is extremely well crafted, perfectly capturing the slightly rambling way people tell stories in the first-person narration of Kathy H., a former student at a prestigious and mysterious boarding school named Hailsham. On the cusp of a life change, Kathy is recollecting her life story and her relationship with two other students at Hailsham named Ruth and Tommy. The ups and downs of their interactions propel the story along to a heartfelt and heartbreaking conclusion that is remarkably resonant for such a staid narrative (perhaps its impact is felt all the more because of the restrained emotions that preceded it). I would highly recommend this book, and look forward to exploring Ishiguro's other novels as well.r interactions propel the story along to a heartfelt and heartbreaking conclusion that is remarkably resonant for such a staid narrative (perhaps its impact is felt all the more because of the restrained emotions that preceded it).

On the most obvious level it is a sort of alternate history that depicts a dystopian society in 1990s England that breeds human clones to become organ donors for \\""the normals.\\"" In that aspect, it brings to mind Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, where humans are created in test tubes and have fixed functions that they grow up to perform in society.<br /><br />However, Never Let Me Go is more subtle than either Huxley or -- another obvious comparison -- George Orwell's 1984, in that the oppressor is not specifically depicted and there is no one person or group that is in obvious conflict with Ishiguro's main characters. There is nothing overt that keeps them in their places, whether that place is at school when they are children, or at \\""recovery centers\\"" while their internal organs are being systematically plucked out.  I kept wondering why the two lovers, Kathy and Tommy, didn't just pick up their stuff, get in her car and take off for parts unknown, eventually blending in with the \\""normal\\"" population.<br /><br />And that brings me to the next, deeper level, of the novel, which is about the nature of humanity.  All of this novel's characters seem to meekly accept their fates, even Tommy, who has a temper and often throws fits of rage when frustrated.  They are also hyper-sensitive to one another, reading motivations and emotions into each small gesture and remark, as though every utterance and movement each one makes is deliberate, premeditated and loaded with significance.  To me, human behavior is much less reasoned than that, with much said and done that has no rational basis.  (Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.)<br /><br />In that regard, perhaps the clones (euphemistically called \\""students\\"" in the novel) really are not human beings with souls, but beings bred for a specific function, which strong emotions tend to derail.  If that is the case, perhaps the students' creators bred human emotion out of them in order to facilitate their end purpose.  Most \\""normals\\"" seem to view the \\""students\\"" as sub-human, which is of course necessary if the \\""students'\\"" organs are to be harvested in good conscience.  This brings to mind a host of justifications for deplorable acts and practices throughout human history, from slavery to the contemporary killing of the Great Apes.<br /><br />Ishiguro reveals to his readers that the students' adult \\""guardians\\"" believe they are human beings with souls, and the \\""guardians\\"" spend a great deal of time and effort trying to prove this to the other \\""normals.\\""  This takes us to yet another, deeper question posed by the story: Can members of a privleged class save those who are less so, or must the oppressed save themselves?<br /><br />The actions that the \\""guardians\\"" take on behalf of their \\""students\\"" do not change the ultimate fate of the latter.  They do, however, change the conditions in which the \\""students\\"" are reared.  So, in the end, the main \\""student\\"" characters are well-read, cultured and, as children, had more creature comforts than many of their peers.  But they also have false hope that some outside force may \\""defer\\"" their fates, and in the end those dashed hopes may be more painful to endure than if they never had hope at all.<br /><br />Essentially, the \\""guardians\\"" are reformers of the Jane Addams type, who move in with the oppressed and try to help them.  But the final outcome is not changed, and one is left wondering about the validity of a reform movement in the first place.  Perhaps the only real way to make institutional change of the magnitude required in this novel's world is for the \\""students\\"" to embrace their true identity as clones and start focusing on how to stay alive.<br /><br />Ishiguro does not offer opinions on anyof these issues, rather presents the questions in powerfully compelling ways that make us stop and think about our assumptions and the way the tasks of daily life tend to distract us from considering deeper issues.<br /><br />While it's always true that a great novel will mean different things to each person who reads it, I believe that this is particularly the case with Never Let Me Go.

The same way the butler character in \\""Remains\\"" has glimmerings of another way of looking at life, Kathy, the main character in this book, senses that she's missing something important and can never put her finger on it.  The problem here is, the conceit of being a (SPOILER HERE) groomed-for-organ-donations clone seems to also require that the character possess a sheeplike docility about her situation that is quite maddening for the reader. Her glimmerings of awareness, and those of her friends, consist of examinations of the minutiae of life; the thoughtless word, the missing tape, the unfinished sentence.

It starts out harmlessly, like a child's tale; a seemingly simple story with initially only three characters narrated in a tightly restrained yet elegant prose.

I was very surprised to read an interview with Ishiguro where he claimed that this is his most cheerful book to date!    If you loved this, I recommend 'Spies' by Michael Frayn.

His use of an alternate world in \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" highlights his limitations as a writer.

The story is narrated by the main character, Kathy H., as she recalls her life from the beginning of her schooling years, her teenage years, and middle aged decline. The entire book made me feel very disconnected, as if I was watching the snow settle tiredly inside of a snow globe. I found myself switching constantly between relation and empathy, to disbelief and bafflement.  <br />The story begins when Kathy H., a middle age woman, introduces herself as a \\""Carer.\\"" She explains that she has been a carer for almost eleven years, and she tells us that she is planning to become a \\""donor\\"" after this year is completed. She begins to tell us of her experiences at \\""Hailsham,\\"" a mysterious academy that could be compared to Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling's \\""Hogwarts.\\"" Here the children are taught only about books, how to survive in the \\""real world,\\"" and most of all, art. In the Hailsham academy, children must produce large quantities of art, which is then sold in exchanges and rewarded generously based on the levels of talent and creativity it produces. Kathy H. recalls that an exceptionally good work of art would mysteriously disappear, and it was rumored that a gallery existed to showcase all of the outstanding work. None of the students had ever established this as a fact, but they liked to believe that the work they were doing had some kind of purpose. Here Kathy met her two best friends, which stayed with her throughout the entire story of her life, Ruth and Tommy D. Ruth is a stubborn girl with a vivid imagination, often times getting into arguments over trivial things. Tommy is a big-hearted boy who is often times bullied for his poor art abilities, throwing him into uncontrollable temper tantrums. I sensed tension a growing with each year the students near their graduation from Hailsham, and sexual relationships begin to form between students. Kathy sets the matter-of-fact, relaxed tone as she tells stories that I did not find relaxing at all. The students begin to wonder why it is that \\""Miss Lucy,\\"" a guardian at the school, is acting so uptight, and where all of their artwork is being taken to. <br />Shortly before graduation, Miss Lucy finally reveals to the students that they are never going to grow up and do anything great with their lives, because they are being raised to donate their vital organs. She tells the young adults that they will become carers for their friends as they donate, and eventually will be called to donations as well. I was taken aback by the light way that the students responded to this news. This was a section of the book that I did not agree with because I found myself left with many questions. Why did the students accept their fate so easily? Why didn't they try to escape the fate that was nearing? I found this to be very unrealistic, and against human nature.  <br />After graduation the students are then sent to cabins where they will house until they are ready to begin caring for donors. Tommy begins to create art to make up for his lost Hailsham years, and Ruth becomes very preoccupied with impressing the older kids in the house. She also begins to dream about the career she hopes to have when she gets older, even though she knows her fate is pre-decided. Rumors spread that a couple can claim to be in love and prolong their lives together. The older graduates speak of the gallery, and how the mysterious woman in charge, \\""Madame,\\"" will use the works as an indicator of whether the two deserve this privilege. Tommy suggests that Kathy and he try to receive this privilege and they go on a scavenger hunt to solve the rumor.

And while we don't know what these donors are exactly, we do know that this is the other waiting future for these students.<br /><br />It's not hard to figure out what Donors do. They donate parts of themselves to people who need transplants. Though it's never actually spelled out, things which are donated are probably kidneys, lungs, parts of the liver, eyes, skin, bone marrow... whatever's needed. These are children who have been cloned as body part farms. And horrible as that concept is, what seems even worse is that their life at their school has actually given them a taste of something outside the narrow framework of what they have been designed to do. They're not just unconscious bodies in vats, they're living, breathing people who get angry and feel sorrow, who fall in love and who create. They're people, and yet they go to their fates with the conviction that this is what they must do.

As one character -- a former guardian -- says to two of the students who have sought her out to try to discover the truth of the deferrments: People would hate the idea on the face of it, but at the same time their primary concern is that their children survive, their parents, their husbands and wives. Who wouldn't choose a loved one over what you've been taught to think of as a spare part farm, a thing devoid of a soul, of feelings, even of real consciousness? But this isn't about the lies, it's about the people who get chewed up by them, and their short, restricted lives which nevertheless manage to offer scope for beauty and affection and creation.

You see a world in this book that is incredibly horrific and tragic, but that is never dealt with directly. The narrator is a clone who is the victim of this world. But her own inability to directly address the horror of  her situation leaves it for the reader to take that step, and that makes the message all the more uncomfortable and affecting since it is not delivered on a platter. It is the most effective use of first-person narrative I have ever read. <br />The humanity of the cloned characters comes through very much in the book, and the refusal of the world to acknowledge their humanity is something very familiar from human history. But at the same time the reader has to wonder why there is not more rebellion on their part, why none of them try to run away and pretend they are not a clone so that they can avoid their sentence of having their organs \\""harvested.\\"" This must not only be because the setting is England, with its tendency toward cafeteria line conformity.

The converse, however, is not true:  just because you're a good writer does not automatically mean you'll be a good science fiction writer.  Which brings me to Kazuo Ishiguro, who is obviously a good writer, noted primarily for The Remains of the Day and recognized with various awards; but is he a good science fiction writer?  With Never Let Me Go, the answer is a qualified yes. <br /> <br />Never Let Me Go takes place in an alternate England where cloning is not only legal but has been going on for quite a while.  Kathy, the narrator, is such a clone, raised to make \\""donations\\"" and eventually reach \\""completion.\\""  The book relates her life in three parts:  her childhood at an academy for the clones, her years of young adulthood with semi-independence, and her years as a carer, who tends to the donors.  Kathy is also part of a semi-romantic triangle with Ruth and Tommy, both of whom have their own issues.   <br /> <br />Superficially, the book resembles the recent movie, The Island (a movie I liked), but with character and description taking the place of action and special effects.  (Kind of imagine The Island as a Masterpiece Theatre, and you get an idea of the differences.)  This novel, in fact, does not have that much of a plot; it is more of a fictional autobiography, filled with episodes that show a gradual development of characters.  As the characters get older, they (and we) learn about the world they are a part of, a world where clones are treated as second-class or worse. <br /> <br />While one of the goals of science fiction is to create a \\""what-if\\"" scenario and see how it plays out, it has to do so in a world that is plausible within the rules that have been set up.  In certain ways, Ishiguro succeeds with creating a reality that is believable given the initial idea of cloning.  But in other ways, this world doesn't seem fully credible:  the way clones are raised and treated often doesn't seem very economical, and there should be political implications that are hardly even discussed, much yet seen (and what about children?  The only donors are adults; does that mean children cannot be recipients, or they must get adult organs).  In addition, Kathy and her friends are far too passive about their fate; no one ever really questions if they could live any other way. <br /> <br />Which is why Never Let Me Go is okay but clearly flawed as science fiction, which is what it should be considered given its subject matter and speculative nature.  On the other hand, I get the feeling Ishiguro is only minimally interested in science fiction except as a means to create a novel (maybe, like many \\""literary\\"" authors, he considers science fiction writing to be slumming, but that's only a guess).   <br /> <br />As fiction, however, this is a good, well-written book, and I would recommend it if your interests go beyond science fiction.  If you're essentially only a fan of the genre, you may be disappointed. <br />",2006-02-09

I read it in just two sittings, absorbed  by the crystal clear prose that gives an immediacy and pace to the 1st person narrative of Kathy as she describes her passage from childhood innocence at the seemingly idyllic Hailsham to a chillingly adult acceptance of her ultimate fate as a 'doner'.  I quickly became wrapped up in the lives of Kathy and her Hailsham friends Ruth and Tommy right until I turned the last page feeling moved and also strangely unnerved. Yet only in the days since have I really felt the full emotional meaning of the story.<br /><br />The central theme seems indeed to be about the loss of childhood innocence but I doubt very much that the sexual meaning of the term is most relevent here.  Ishiguro seems to be telling us a fable about the loss of childhood wonder at the world, the unquestioning joy of being alive in a mysterious universe full of possiblities that most children feel at least some of the time and that all are destined to slowly lose to the cold harsh realities of the adult world. It seems also to ask whether love, friendship and meaning in life can have any intrinsic value given a scientific picture that increasingly sees human nature as goverened by laws indifferent to human hopes and ideals, a world where even love and altruism spring ultimately from the cold mathematical algorithms of evolutionary game theory.<br /><br />Certainly a book that I'm going to re-read expecting to find something both profound and moving each time.",2006-01-20

Whereas many authors fail to get the voice and tone right when they make the main protagonist someone of the opposite sex, Ishiguro succeeds. He's dropped the register of the language perfectly, too, so that Kathy H. comes across as bright but not too literary.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that the novel falls short on realism. No society that has decent people in it would tolerate the situation of Kathy H., Tommy, and Ruth. There would be an underground railroad; there would be safehouses in remote parts of the United Kingdom. People would be smuggled to countries where religious views would never tolerate harvesting organs from sentient fellow creatures. For this reason, I think \\""Never Let Me Go\\""'s lack of realism causes it to fall a bit short of Margaret Atwood's excellent recent dystopia, \\""Oryx and Crake.\\"" As for why these particular protagonists don't flee, I think Ishiguro answers this: a lifetime of breeding to accept one's situation has lulled them into submission. None of them is a crusader; if they were, they would have tried to find Miss Lucy. And Ishiguro never says that no one else has tried to escape.<br /><br />But if the novel is unrealistic on one level, it's closer to reality than one might think on others.<br /><br />First, coercive organ harvesting is reported to exist. Consider this press release from the University of California, Berkeley, dated April 30, 2004, which begins: \\""A . . . Berkeley medical anthropologist is helping authorities in Brazil, Israel and South Africa investigate what she calls a shocking new 'slave triangle' in which the poor are being taken to distant cities by criminal syndicates and coerced into selling their organs for illegal transplants.\\"" Or the excellent and compelling report in The New York Times of May 23, 2004, that begins: \\""RECIFE, Brazil--When Alberty Jos&eacute; da Silva heard he could make money, lots of money, by selling his kidney, it seemed to him the opportunity of a lifetime. For a desperately ill 48-year-old woman in Brooklyn whose doctors had told her to get a kidney any way she could, it was. [¶] At 38, Mr. da Silva, one of 23 children of a prostitute, lives in a slum near the airport here, in a flimsy two-room shack he shares with a sister and nine other people. [¶] [¶] He recalled his mother as a woman who 'sold her flesh' to survive. Last year he decided that he would, too. Now, a long scar across his side marks the place where a kidney and a rib were removed in exchange for $6,000, paid by middlemen in an international organ trafficking ring.\\"" Of course, a libertarian response might be that the latter is an economic transaction among voluntary actors and hence morally neutral. But under Mr. Silva's circumstances, that sounds a bit like negotiating the price of a ladder to a man stranded in a pit full of poisonous snakes. It's not so far removed from \\""Never Let Me Go.\\""<br /><br />And instances of looking away more generally from the circumstances of others are not hard to find either. We in the United States are happy to consume cheap produce even though we know it may have been harvested by undocumented workers living and working in horrible conditions. Small construction projects in this state are carried out much more cheaply when done by people who speak limited English and have no union card. We don't spend much time thinking about the fate of the union workers whose jobs have been displaced. And many people view those who live in other countries as not quite real, nor fully human. I see this in the indifference to the recent news report that we may have killed a number of civilians in a bombing raid in Pakistan. It's not just the paucity of expressions of concern (that would be insufficient evidence), but the affirmations of the need to sacrifice innocent bystanders that I heard on local talk radio yesterday.

I would give this six stars if it were possible, because it adds an unexpected and quietly devastating emotional dimension to Ishiguro's already-powerful armory. Although this book has something of the alternative-reality feel of [[ASIN:0679735879 THE UNCONSOLED]], it is by no means so difficult to read. It probably beats even [[ASIN:0679731725 THE REMAINS OF THE DAY]] in the surface lucidity of its narration, and emotions that had been denied or repressed in that earlier novel are here allowed to flower, albeit briefly. Indeed, one strand of this book is a love story, simple, true, and almost traditional, though denied the traditional happy-ever-after ending.<br /><br />I am sorry that many of the previous reviewers, professional and otherwise, have given away the secret of what the book is about, since the pace at which Ishiguro reveals information is masterly. First, he gives hints that Hailsham, the secluded co-ed boarding-school in the English countryside, is not a normal school. Then he lets drop little bits of information, though never the complete picture. Even when the book is over, there are still larger mysteries out there that are never explained. Indeed, as others have pointed out, it is not only the readers who must accept the mystery; the characters themselves are hesitant to demand explanations for what they have not been told; it is part of what sets them apart as a sub-class, living apparently full lives within a cage of which they are only dimly aware.<br /><br />There is a scene about three-quarters of the way through the book, after the heroine Kathy has got her own car and travels widely around Britain, when she takes a couple of her friends on a trip to see an old boat, beached on the edge of the marshes. It's just \\""this old fishing boat, with a little cabin for a couple of fishermen to squeeze into when it's stormy.\\"" A common enough sight along the shoreline, one would think. But for the people in this story, it acquires almost mythic significance. Kathy first hears about it from people as far away as Wales, and people who have been to see it are given the respect due to returning pilgrims. But for people who are effectively institutionalized, such outings can seem very special indeed; I remember feeling the same about some day-trips from boarding school, or later from a long-stay hospital. It is a brilliant device of Ishiguro's to demonstrate the smallness of his characters' world by showing the intensity of their enthusiasm for something so apparently trivial. It is one of his dominant techniques in THE REMAINS OF THE DAY, and it recurs in each of the four books of his that I have read.<br /><br />It is interesting that Ishiguro states the place and time quite baldly on the first page as \\""England, late 1990s.\\"" Such glimpses of the outside world as we get, increasingly towards the end of the novel, are tied more closely to place and time than is usual with this author. And yet the basic premise of his story would have been impossible in the nineties. Although he is essentially writing science fiction, he needs to set it in the familiar world to prevent his readers from slipping into a special sci-fi gear. The most touching thing about his quite extraordinary characters is precisely their ordinariness, framed towards the end by long car journeys between various decrepit facilities, and lonely evenings in bed-sits. The heartbreak of the closing paragraph is conjured out of a description of windblown rubbish, \\""torn plastic sheeting and bits of old carrier bags,\\"" caught in a wire fence.<br /><br />I have noted before how in each of his novels, Ishiguro seems to take a particular genre of British popular fiction and rework it to his own ends: the Upstairs/Downstairs story in THE REMAINS OF THE DAY or the Great Detective story in [[ASIN:0375724400 WHEN WE WERE ORPHANS]]. Here, although the author surely owes much to John Wyndham's THE MIDWICH CUCKOOS, the dominant genre is not science fiction but the boarding-school novel. And once again, he has captured the convention to a tee; it is also clear that he has been through such schools himself. This is all the more remarkable in that this book features a young woman as narrator and a mostly female cast, and thus breaks away from the classics of the genre (for example, Kipling's [[ASIN:0192838598 STALKY & CO]]) which all have a boys-school bias. But he has the adolescent female psychology down pat, especially the way that the closest friendships can also harbor intense rivalries.<br /><br />Ishiguro's appropriation of classic British tropes is parallel to what I see as his attempts to enter British society. As even a book written by an Englishman, Alan Hollinghurst's recent [[ASIN:1582346100 THE LINE OF BEAUTY]], reminds us, English society is inherently dominated by class -- or rather caste -- with great importance placed on being a member of an in-group, and numerous ways, subtle and not so subtle, of reminding others that they are merely outsiders and not \\""one of us.\\"" An immigrant from another culture, however talented and however well-connected, could not help but feel this even more acutely, and Ishiguro's books are peopled with characters who believe themselves to be part of a privileged elite, but are still conscious of a true elite beyond their circle to which they will never belong. The boarding-school setting is a perfect metaphor for this, beginning with shifting in-groups among the students themselves, extending to the distinctions between the older and younger students, and eventually moving into the outside world, where having been to such a school at all is both a mark of privilege and a handicap.<br /><br />One might even say that it has a metaphysical component, questioning whether a life led in accordance with rules set by an unseen power that can change them at a whim is worth living at all. What, in short, do any of us live for? Ishiguro's answer in this book seems to be that you simply have to live as best you can. I find it a strangely reassuring one.once again, he has captured the convention to a tee; it is also clear that he has been through such schools himself.

Ishiguro's appropriation of classic British tropes is parallel to what I see as his attempts to enter British society. As even a book written by an Englishman, Alan Hollinghurst's recent [[ASIN:1582346100 THE LINE OF BEAUTY]], reminds us, English society is inherently dominated by class -- or rather caste -- with great importance placed on being a member of an in-group, and numerous ways, subtle and not so subtle, of reminding others that they are merely outsiders and not \\""one of us.\\"" An immigrant from another culture, however talented and however well-connected, could not help but feel this even more acutely, and Ishiguro's books are peopled with characters who believe themselves to be part of a privileged elite, but are still conscious of a true elite beyond their circle to which they will never belong. The boarding-school setting is a perfect metaphor for this, beginning with shifting in-groups among the students themselves, extending to the distinctions between the older and younger students, and eventually moving into the outside world, where having been to such a school at all is both a mark of privilege and a handicap.     One might even say that it has a metaphysical component, questioning whether a life led in accordance with rules set by an unseen power that can change them at a whim is worth living at all. What, in short, do any of us live for? Ishiguro's answer in this book seems to be that you simply have to live as best you can. I find it a strangely reassuring one.",2006-01-12

The principal issue is: do humans that are cloned for the preservation of health of the non-cloned population have the same rights and privileges as the rest of us?

The lead characters in both novels (a butler in Remains, a 31 year old \\""carer\\"" in Never Let Me Go) narrate both novels by relating surface events without realizing the ramifications of them.  This requires the reader to glean the plot implications by him or herself.  The difference between the two characters is that the main character in Remains of the Day ultimately understands the futility of his life, while the main character here simply accepts her fate.   <br /> <br />This book, which I suppose is nominally science fiction, but is more likely just a different form of a dystopian novel like Brave New World, is distinguished from other dystopian stories by the absence of a non-conformist character who challenges his or her fate. Several reviewers have mentioned Hannah Arent's theory of the banality of evil in discussing this novel.  The crucial difference here is that not only the evil people (identified or otherwise) banal, but so are the protagonists. It is left to the readers to contemplate the horror of the protagonists' lives, as the readers see the main characters grow up (they are school children for much of the book) and essentially embrace their fates.  <br /> <br />The final novel I will invoke here is Frankenstein, a book that describes a scientist's attempt to create a human being by himself.  Yet even Frankenstein's monster makes an attempt to assert his humanity. The protagonists in this novel have been so conditioned to accept their fates that they live and die without ever raising an objection to the cruelty of their fates or the way that society regards them as subhuman.

Having now read both books, I can see why it would be easy for there to be such passionate disagreement.  Banville's book is rather slight but it contains gorgeous, enthralling prose.  Ishiguro's book is deep, passionate and current but has some weakness which rather surprised me from a writer of Ishiguro's experience and excellence.<br /><br />Never Let Me Go is a novel of cloning.  One immediately imagines some science fiction horror story but that is not what this novel is about.  The technical aspects of cloning are never discussed and are barely hinted at.  This novel, told from the point of view of one of the clones, a young woman named Kathy, is about human beings.  Initially, it is the story of how these clones experience life but, ultimately, it is about ethics and the nature of the soul.  Deep stuff and worth spending some time chewing over as this beautiful novel unfolds.<br /><br />There are just two things that are slightly off in this novel.  First, Ishiguro has it set in England in the late 1990's.  Why the recent past?  As far as I know, nothing like has been going on in England or anywhere else and I found it distracting to always have in the back of my mind the knowledge that this story was is no way real.  Why not set the novel even a few years into a possible near future?  This would have necessitated no real changes in the novel and served for a much more ominous atmosphere and given the novel its own reality.<br /><br />That, however, is a small problem.  My second issue is larger.  A lot of questions that need answering are raised throughout the novel.  Unfortunately, they are answered in the last few pages in what is essentially a monologue (disguised as a dialogue--only the other characters barely speak).  To me, it seems a rather cheap device to bring closure to these well-drawn, beautiful characters.<br /><br />But don't be fooled.

I had previously read, and been wholly unimpressed with \\""When We Were Orphans\\"" and had no desire to give Ishigiro another go. Fortunately I overcame my skepticism, and about a week before our meeting I finally opened the book. From almost the first page I was enthralled and completely under the spell of the prose. I'm not generally a fan of highly mannered writing, I tend to prefer a little razzle-dazzle, a little style, but the precise and pitch-perfect narration sucked me under like a riptide. It is the best novel about nostalgia and memory I have ever read, and at the same time, it is a brilliant science fiction tale. Like all science fiction, the story has its own mysterious vocabulary, but it is told without the genre trappings that ghettoize science fiction. Ishigiro sets his story in a recognizable  mid-1990s Britain but with a significant and sinister difference. And like the best science fiction writers, he does not attempt to explain why this difference exists, or how it came into being, or how the technicalities of it work, he simply presents it as a given and lets his characters loose. Those who demand explanations and internal historical rationales for it are going to be disappointed, and are, moreover, missing the point of the book.<br /><br />From the very begriming, 31-year-old narrator Kathy sets a subtly ominous tone by telling the reader she has been a \\""carer\\"" for over a decade and that the authorities are pleased with her. It's a short step from this to \\""donors\\"" and \\""recovery times\\"" and other intriguing tidbits that announce we are in a slightly different world. The three central characters are Kathy, her best friend Ruth, and Ruth's boyfriend Tommy, all students at Hailsham, some kind of elite boarding school in the English country. Told in the manner of recounting one's innermost musings, Kathy reflects on her happy childhood at Hailsham, attempting to dissect every encounter and event for meaning and hints of her present situation. The school appears idyllic, with staff who care greatly for them, and yet one gets the sense it's like a zoo or orphanage, for the children know next to nothing about the broader world and have almost no contact with popular culture. Ishigiro does a wonderful job of capturing the inside world of such a place, with all its traditions, mysteries, fragile friendships, and petty jealousies.<br /><br />After graduation, the trio are sent to a remote cluster of cottages where they spent two years in a safe post-graduate environment. They are nominally meant to do a lot of reading and write a big thesis paper, but mostly it's meant to slowly acclimate them somewhat to the outside world. From here, it's difficult to discuss the book further without spoiling it, so I'll just say that as Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy grow into adults, they slowly come to realize more about their relationship and more about the reality of their existence. It should be noted that many readers (especially those used to science fiction's recoding of words) will have realized what's going on pretty early in the story. However, Ishigiro is not looking to shock the reader with a big reveal, nor to ignite some kind of ethical debate (although it could easily serve such a purpose), but rather to explore the nature of relationships and memory.

Never Let Me Go is about human cloning. More specifically, it is about a group of cloned children growing up in an English boarding school, where the truth about their biology is both the cause and effect of some very strange happenings, which ultimately make for one of the best contemporary novels I have read, a book that should not be overlooked and cannot be ignored.  <br /> <br />Ishiguro, a student of Freud, likes to employ subtle psychology in his work. He likes his narrators too damaged to ever truly reveal themselves. What the reader learns, he or she learns mostly through the information the narrator chooses to withhold about their pasts and through the plainness of their reactions to the present. In this regard, Never Let Me Go is more of the same, in that what is most essential to novel's plot is barely mentioned, or concretely addressed. \\""Few writers dare to say so little of what they mean,\\"" wrote one critic, describing Ishiguro's style of approach. Because of this, any lengthy description of the novel's thorny arc of action would dull its effect for first-time readers.  <br /> <br />What can safely be said is that Ishiguro, who is also a student of the English novel, knows all to well that the patches of literary ground where science and morality clash havealways been arenas of brutal and bloody contests, with neither side interested in armistice. From Bacon's New Atlantis to Shelley's Frankenstein and Huxley's Brave New World, the tradition of tackling tough social issues through speculative fiction has always been a favorite pastime of English writers with highly refined sensibilities. I cannot imagine that Ishiguro doesn't understand the traditions he has inserted himself among by writing a boarding-school novel about the politics of scientific advancement. He knows exactly what he's doing. He's provoking us. And, for the most part, it works.  <br /> <br />Told from the backward perspective of Kathy H, who is 31-years old when the story begins, we learn about the young lives of Tommy and Ruth, who are her two best friends, and the lives of all the children at a special school called Hailsham-a wonderful Dickensian name whose sinister perfection can only be fully understood at the novel's end. Most of the early-going is typical. Social cliques form, loyalties are established and tested, a juvenile form of sexuality begins to bloom-all of which is handled very skillfully by Ishiguro, whose powers of perception and whose ability to capture the reality of human interaction have never been more functional. Add to this picture a host of inklings, of hints and whispers, and you'll begin to understand how wonderfully terrifying and brutally banal the core of this novel is. The children have questions that aren't answered, certain subjects that are off-limits. They notice nobody ever leaves the grounds, that some people don't seem to know how to act around them and that everyone who is not a student seems to have access to a universal truth being kept from them. They notice all of this and they explain it all away.  <br /> <br />For the reader, whose suspicion is apt to grow after a few chapters, the answers the children come up with don't satisfy. Are the teachers sheltering the children from harm, or are they fooling them before the slaughter? The answer is not a simple one. Some of the teachers burst into tears and leave the school under painful circumstances after they are apparently unable to continue working among the children. Others, who at first seem cold proponents of the children's dark fate, which is continually teased and hinted at but not immediately revealed, later turn out to be some of the strongest advocates for them.  <br /> <br />And what of Kathy and the other cloned children? Are they sheep, or are they sheep with souls? Even most the teachers who've lived and worked among them are incapable of going beyond this either/or examination of the children, and because of this, there is no reckoning at the novel's end. There is only twisted discovery and gradual acceptance. This is one of Ishiguro's most brilliant tricks. He parcels out information to the reader at the same pace he does the children. The result is by the time we have the whole picture straight in our heads it is no where near as shocking as it initially would have been. Just as the children have done, we become accustomed to it (even Kathy, the novel's unreliable narrator, is incapable of judging the circumstances of her undoing and assigning any morality to it). So the epiphany, when it finally comes, fails to engineer any discernible effects on the plot or the characters at all. And in many ways, this is the novel's most sobering and realistic assertion. People, more often times than not, fail to act or act ineffectively. Dénouement is a slippery French word that describes the culmination of a fabricated plot; it does not describe or represent reality. Part of Ishiguro's genius is his ability to realize this and codify it as art, just as he does in the very last conversation Tommy has with Kathy, when it's made clear they both know more than they let on about the reality of their existence, but neither are capable or prepared to do anything about it.  <br /> <br />\\""I keep thinking about this river somewhere, with the water moving really fast,\\"" Tommy says. \\""And these two people in the water, trying to hold onto each other, holding as hard as they can, but in the end it's just too much. The current's too strong. They've got to let go, drift apart. (They want to stay forever)...but in the end, we can't stay forever.\\""  <br /> <br />Thus, the novel ends the way it was always going to end-with a stoic resignation that hauntingly recalls the bleak sort of acceptance victims of the Holocaust exhibited as they stood patiently in line waiting to be gassed.  <br /> <br />Or as another reviewer, quoting a snatch of some Schopenhauer, put it: \\""In our early youth we sit before the life that lies ahead of us like children sitting before the curtain in a theatre, in happy and tense anticipation of whatever is going to appear. Luckily we do not know what really will appear.\\""  <br /> <br />The horror of Never Let Me Go is that the children of Hailsham know almost exactly what lies beyond the curtain and they continue to look and participate in the pageantry of life anyway.

Other readers have addressed the moral importance of this book.  I agree that raising people for organ donations is wrong.  That's why this book probably fails to raise important moral issues: we were already in agreement before reading this book. <br /> <br />2.  I found the book unconvincing scientifically, socially, and presonally.  The Hailsham students (and others) eventually participate in a series of organ donations instead of one major organ harvest.  This is poor science.  It would be extremely difficult to keep donors alive and well for any period after losing major organs, and their overall health, and therefore the health of their remaiing organs, would become less useful if not outright unusuable.  I also find it difficult to believe England would allow systemized murder to occur in this form, though this is the smallest objection to a work of fiction.  Kathy and Ruth's friendship was difficult to believe, because Ruth was such a dominant and dishonest personality, and Kathy cared about knowing how things actually are.  Finally, it seemed there was something missing in the way the characters reacted to their lot as adults: neither Kathy nor anyone she knew ever tried to escape, or to think seriously about it. <br /> <br />What was good about _Never Let Me Go_?

The novel is spellbinding, eerie, complex and thoroughly enjoyable.  I recommend it highly.   <br /> <br />As so many reviewers have already recounted here, the story appears to be about three boarding school kids, Kathy H., Tommy D., and Ruth, and their coming of age at a British boarding school called Hailsham.  But Ishiguro turns this familiar setting into the backdrop for a pseudo-science-fiction novel as it turns out that Hailsham is a school for human clones who will later have their organs harvested as adults.  This fact is disclosed slowly by the narrator Kathy H. as she recounts how she and the other children came to learn of their fates.   <br /> <br />For me, this perversion of the British boarding school novel conjured up another favorite book of mine, John Knowles' \\""A Separate Peace.\\""  Just as Knowles used the idyllic boarding-school setting to explore the dark side of friendship, when it can be perverted by jealousy, here Ishiguro uses his setting to explore the darker side of science as well as the darkest side of humanity, i.e., its consistent failure to question institutionalized evil.  The kids at Hailsham are effectively dehumanized slaves who exist to provide organs to others, but they never seriously question the right or wrong of the society that does this to them.  Nor, for that matter, do the people around them.   <br /> <br />What is particularly eerie about the story is that the Hailsham kids are all well cared for and well treated on their way to their unconscionable ends, and in the face of their physical needs being met, they lose sight of the bigger picture of where their lives are headed.  Indeed, the narrator focuses so singly on the minutia in her life that her blindness to her fate appears willful.  The implication that we all live our lives blind to great injustices and absorbed by daily minutia is clear.  <br /> <br />Ishiguro's novel is never heavy-handed in the themes itexplores.

This inability to easily categorize the book is due to Ishiguro's refusal to make things simple for the reader. In so doing, he reminds us how rare this is, and how most books spoon-feed us, telling us exactly what to think and feel. The greatest dystopian novels, such as 1984 and Brave New World are quite unapologetic in their roles as cautionary tales. The relationships that occur in these novels are clearly secondary to the descriptions of the repressive societies. Not so with Never Let Me Go, which is at least as character-driven as plot-driven.<br /><br />The novel starts off rather innocently, as Kathy H., the narrator, recalls her girlhood days at an exclusive boarding school. There are some clues that things are not quite normal. For one thing, all of the characters' last names are merely initials (I know this device is used in at least one other well known story, but I don't recall which one). Another strange thing is that none of the characters seem to have families or any references outside of this school. Finally, the roles by which they are identified are rather unconventional. Kathy is a \\""carer\\"" who cares for \\""donors.\\"" Early on I assumed these were simply unfamiliar (to me) terms used by the English for ordinary occupations, such as home health care aides. It soon becomes apparent, however, that these roles are far more sinister. The sinister, and actually quite horrifying truth, is hidden from the reader for quite some time. At first, we are introduced to Kathy and her complex but not all that unusual relationships with her friends and classmates, especially Ruth and Tommy. These three end up in a  kind of romantic triangle. Ruth is revealed as a manipulative person who uses underhanded tactics to come between Tommy and Kathy. These personal dynamics are interesting enough that we barely notice, or only gradually notice, the truly bizarre events that are taking place around these children/young adults. It turns out that this school is part of a larger plan, in which human clones, treated little better than farm animals, are harvested for their vital organs. These \\""donors\\"" are literally bred for this purpose alone, and  end up dying painful deaths after a certain number of operations. Ishiguro does not set this tale in some distant (or even near) future, or in some imaginary world but in England at the present time. This is a creepy \\""what if\\"" scenario that could still take place given the direction modern science is taking.<br /><br />It's difficult to guess the author's motive for writing a book, especially a writer as subtle and multifaceted as Ishiguro. He forces the reader to do all the work, rather than shoving a conclusion down our throats. What I came away thinking was that the real theme of this book is something not directly mentioned, something quite conspicuous by its absence --the tendency for most people to conform to the status quo of their society. While people in this novel have disagreements about particulars, such as whether these \\""donors\\"" should be told as children of their future roles or shielded from this terrible reality until a later age, no one ever questions the morality or sanity of the practice itself.  I found myself wanting to scream in frustration at these characters to stop quibbling over petty details and overthrow the system, or at least find some way to evade it (at one point they try to find a way to get \\""deferments,\\"" but only playing strictly by the rules). This, however, is possibly what Ishiguro is aiming at --to show us how difficult it can be to question what is universally taken for granted. While the novel is certainly about other things as well --e.g. the dynamic between friends, the possible dangers of a soulless, materialistic scientific/medical establishment out of control, I think it is ultimately about conformity. More specifically, Ishiguro reveals how the events of everyday life can make people blind to the big picture. The brilliant thing about this novel is that the characters are interesting and complex enough to fit into almost any scenario. The fact that they live in this nightmarish world almost seems incidental. The book tempts us to follow the characters and simply take this world at face value. If we refuse to do so, as I assume we are meant to, it might make us not take our own, only slightly less dystopian world for granted as well.materialistic scientific/medical establishment out of control, I think it is ultimately about conformity.

Clearly, many of them wanted more in their lives. Ishiguro teases us with Ruth's dreams of working in an office, but then drops it, and Ruth's disinterest in the subject years later seems contrived. That all of the otherwise whole people would literally lie down and die did not ring true with me. I also found in unbelievable that after 16-18 years of isolation that these students could go out into the world and function normally. No amount of play-acting at Hailsham or any other school would prepare them for that.  Given what is revealed at the end about how other clones were raised, I find their integration into the world as carers to be completely unbelievable. <br /> <br />I don't believe that only a small group of people would object to raising clones in inhumane environments. There was nothing in the book to suggest that the people in this \\""other\\"" world were sufficiently different enough from this world that they did not have consciences.

The reader is left with many questions to reconcile each character with his or her destiny.  What is the nature of a clone's \\""life\\""? How and why that society allowed human cloning is implied but not discussed within the novel leaving the reader with too many questions; which  may in fact have been done on purpose by Mr. Ishiguro. <br /> <br />If the Mr. Ishiguro's purpose was to stimulate discussion and push society into bio-ethical discussions about the social viability of human cloning, then he has certainly achieved his goal by prompting questions that to date have no satisfying answers. <br /> <br /> <br />",2005-10-02

You start to get attached to the characters and the book slowly draws you in. The general feel of the book is an above average \\""coming of age\\"" tale taking place in an exclusive boarding school. There are your normal circle of friends, some friendly teasing/hazing, and adolescent romance. What sets this book apart is a slightly sinister subplot surrounding who these kids are and why they are there.

Although they are not normal, and they are dealing with realities that normal people would not have to deal with, you still identify with them,and you seem to mature with them as they deal with realities that are unfair & cruel.

Why can't these people (or perhaps \\""people\\"") realize the immorality of how they are being used?  Upon closer observation, it seems that these questions are exactly the sort Ishiguro must have wanted us to ask, as well as the very questions that make this book worthwhile.   <br /> The narration begins in the voice of Kathy, a woman who details her experiences growing up in a special school named Hailsham.  From the very beginning it is apparent that the narrator and the children in the school are anything but normal; they react with indifference to events that should traumatize them.  What follows is the odd tale of Kathy and her friends, all of whom are sheltered from the outside world and sequestered from normal kids.  The plot creeps forth, supported by awkward incidents (throughout Kathy's life at the school and later on in life) that reinforce our sense of these children as abnormal. <br /> Although Ishiguro never hides the truth of what these children actually are, he does use Kathy's casual narration to subtly reveal the truth about them.  It is the nonchalant manner in which Ishiguro broaches the subject that makes this story truly eerie.  Kathy's narration emphasizes the carefree mentality of the Hailsham students and adds to the novel's creepy atmosphere.  Even after these children know that they will die donating organs, they accept it.  For them, this is life.   Ishiguro strives for a simplistic writing style, which emphasizes the idea that the novel is narrated by someone quite nave.   <br /> Though Ishiguro does not mask the truth about the children, neither does he spell out anything for the reader.  The plot rolls on and you are left to search for a moral and draw your own conclusions.  It is the questions the book raises that make it worth the read:  how far will mankind go to improve itself?  Do these clones have souls?  The capacity to love?  Ishiguro explores a frightening new world and leaves it to us to discover his book's inherent meaning. <br />",2005-09-14

The narrator of Never Let Me Go is Kathy H., a woman who introduces herself as a \\""carer\\"" mere months away from becoming a \\""donor,\\"" as though we should know what these terms mean.  This nearness to ending one stage of her life to entering another causes her to reminisce about Hailsham, the school in the English countryside where she grew up with her two closest friends, Tommy D. and Ruth.  The three form an unlikely trio:  Ruth is headstrong and imaginative; Tommy has an uncontrollable temper; and Kathy is steady and observant in the subtleties of human behavior.  It is this last quality belonging to Kathy H. that sets the tone of the novel.  Everything is precisely told in an even, matter-of-fact voice that never questions the strange terminology and conversations that alert the reader to something more grave lurking under what seems, on the surface, to be an ordinary story about three childhood friends.  As the three grow up, they begin to face moments more important than the minor disagreements of childhood.<br /><br />Ishiguro's richly textured description of the relationship among the three supplies all the details without confronting the larger issues.  As Kathy tells us, the guardians at Hailsham both tell and not tell the students the truth about Hailsham and their lives--exactly what Ishiguro does to the reader.  The truth is doled out in increments, over the course of the entire novel, requiring the reader to understand what is implied as much as what is told.  The frightening side to all this is that the characters never question the course of their lives.  No one runs, or questions why they are the ones to make the ultimate sacrifice.  One of the most poignant moments comes near the end when Kathy says, \\""Why should we not have souls?\\""  By this point, it has been apparent to the reader that Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth are human in every sense of the word, with talents and intelligence and foibles and complex emotions, and yet are regarded as both freaks and disposables by the \\""normals.\\""  For the reader, these characters are anything but expendable.<br /><br />Ishiguro's literary style of examining small moments might disappoint readers who expect a strong plot.  Although the premise may belong to science fiction, this novel is more concerned with characterization and theme.  If you like writers in the tradition of Ian McEwan, Marilynne Robinson, Chang-Rae Lee, and Margaret Atwood (whose The Handmaid's Tale creates a different dystopia), you'll be immediately swept into this alternate world where the past is also the future.athy, Tommy, and Ruth are human in every sense of the word, with talents and intelligence and foibles and complex emotions, and yet are regarded as both freaks and disposables by the \\""normals.\\""  For the reader, these characters are anything but expendable. <br /> <br />Ishiguro's literary style of examining small moments might disappoint readers who expect a strong plot.

Ishiguro reminds us that education is based on trust in the future. The petty betrayals and avowals of adolescence become heartbreaking once we realize that they can never come true. The angry teacher who struggles to rend the curtain, only to give up in frustration and sorrow, seems futilely heroic long before we know the full situation. The enforced ignorance that is part of the school's mission seems a disservice to the earnest young people who believe blindly in a future that doesn't exist. It's inevitable that we ask whether we're doing the same thing in our current system of education. Kathy knows the whole story, but she narrates the gradual dawning that leads to her current understanding. Although we don't see the end of her story, we dread the bleak future illuminated only by the memory of brighter days. As the reader slides into conversation about the limits of science and technology, a sense of gloom overcomes him. The sadness overwhelms my desire to talk much about the novel.

Narrated by Kathy H., now 31 years old and reflecting on her school days, I luckily never felt lost as I sometimes do. Her analytical storytelling rather slowly guided me through the book. Each story is picked and dissected by Kathy. She cautiously moves past the inconsequential surface of certain details to underline the true meaning. But what draws the reader closer is the secrecy behind Kathy's analysis. Ishiguro makes sure to give the reader a large part in dissecting the details. It is that dissection or subtle focus on minor details that we as readers must do that brings the events to life. I found myself collecting small clues from each intricate, detailed memory and storing it away for later use when all of the clues would fit in the puzzle. Each little story or event carries so much hidden emotion that does not seem \\""normal\\"". Ishiguro even created his own language to fit with the abnormally of the book. In the beginning you may hear words such as \\""carrer\\"" or \\""completion.\\"" But as you continue to read and understand the meaning of those words, you feel even more apart of this bizarre world. But what's amazing about Ishiguro's technique is the combination of this secret world and common adolescent school life. I must praise Ishiguro's capture of youth mentality in a school atmosphere. He seems to understand the usual phases of adolescent growth from a girl's perspective! The characters toy with love, friendship, and self-hood- all the wonders of growing one's character. I felt as if I watched the narrator grow into herself.<br /><br /> Try not to get sucked into the common response to the title \\""science-fiction.\\"" Yes, the clues wind down to the application of science in our society but Ishiguro's novel is far from the aliens, spaceships, or bug-like creatures that I always thought \\""science-fiction\\"" referred to.

What amazed me was the way the characters responded to the unveiling of the dark secret- in the same flow of emotions as me. I yelled, inquired, and exploded with the narrator.

However, Never Let Me Go is unique in that it walks the line between a science fiction and an insightful romance novel.  Its setting in the recent past rather than the future emphasizes its social and psychological realism.  Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go is a tale of three friends isolated and protected from the outside world at Hailsham, a place like a man's fist  \\""where all the balloon strings converge,\\"" and who are connected through life and death because of their shared and predetermined fate. Hailsham is an elite \\""beacon\\"" school where they are taught that they are \\""special.\\""  It is revealed fairly early on that the characters are clones, raised to be organ donors for the rest of the \\""normal\\"" population. However, the sci-fi premise serves primarily as a backdrop to explore the minds, emotions and thoughts of Ruth, Tommy and Kathy.             <br /> <br />The novel's language is deceptively simple, and phrases like \\""students\\"" and \\""guardians\\"" are disturbing euphemisms that juxtapose the fairly normal life of the students with the immoral traffic of organs supported by the state and society. It's easy to read the novel on its surface, and to ignore the deep layers of emotional and social commentary that Ishiguro imbeds between the lines. Since Ishiguro, unlike typical mystery or science fiction writers, spills clues to the mysteries of \\""carers\\"" and \\""completions\\"" early on and throughout the novel I was able to re-read Never Let Me Go and concentrate on the nuances of the characters. As the narrator Kathy travels back in her memory to her life at Hailsham and the Cottages, she and the reader gain special insight into a world of uncertain moral grounds.  The kids are forced to produce artwork \\""to prove [they] have souls\\"" to those on the outside and to those at Hailsham. It's a poignant indictment of society's dehumanization of those who are different, and in the process,the dehumanization of society.  Although unfair, people from the \\""outside\\"" are never thought of as more than vague models by those at Hailsham, and the clones are `pushed back into the shadows\\"" by the rest of the population. Though the kids of Hailsham are \\""special,\\"" their desire to peek into their future lives by spotting their \\""possible,\\"" the person from whom they were cloned, is as both heartbreaking and real as any child looking at their parents and hoping to see a glimmer of their future selves. <br /> <br /> The sadness in Never Let Me Go is tinged with hopefulness, even for those whose lives are pre-planned. Ishiguro's true skill is his understanding of the intimacy of the most mundane moments and events in his characters' lives. In a touching and resonant scene, Kathy attempts to calm Tommy during one of his widely infamous rages, understanding how crushed he will be when he sees the mud he has splattered over his favorite blue polo. What's truly spectacular about Ishiguro's writing is that the emotional weight of his characters' and their lives doesn't hit the reader until much later. It's in the quiet scenes between the main action that his views on loss, humanity and friendship are made heartbreakingly clear.",2005-09-07

Ishiguro successfully brought to life a cast of characters each with a soul and the capacity to feel react and change. While Ishiguro's often over simplistic language may distract a reader from the actual complicated nature of the topic, I found that the dialect in fact complemented the intricacy of the subject, giving the reader more room to reflect and ponder at the questions left unanswered.  <br />As I went deeper into the novel it became more apparent Ishiguro's intention to link these clones with the \\""normal\\"" people of the outside world. These students, carers and donators all share the same characteristics of any other person other than the fact that they are told they are special. They look, act, and feel identically to the ways any other person would, yet they choose to succumb to their reality and their supposed chosen path without any attempt to alter it. This notion of simply settling for a life presumed inevitable has distinct parallels to the ways in which we live our lives today. Like Kathy and Tommy who seek answers and then do nothing with the information they are given, much is the mentality of our own lives. While we too have the capacity to feel react and change, just how many people take full advantage of these precious gifts? Like Ishiguro's text, which painstakingly obsesses on trivial details, we in our own lives do as well, making me wonder just how many of our lives are wasted? <br />Never Let Me Go was a truly enjoyable novel capable of providing the reader with a series of emotions. Ishiguro takes the reader on a frequently uncomfortable journey into the oftentimes cruel and selfish nature of our society, while providing a contrasting and more optimistic view of the beauty intelligence and independence we can utilize if we so choose. He demands the reader to spend even more time with the book once the last page has been turned, and take into serious consideration the question of when we must be held accountable for our own lives and our own inactions.

They look at people working in offices and think of them as living in some unusual world, which is probably true in the modern world, which is so results oriented. People do not go out on breaks and so on. Clones looking at the society that made them can be confused by them. The modern world has many things that are perplexing if one thinks about it long enough. While the author does cleverly lead to degredation of hope in the cloning debate - do we want a super race that does everything better. What happens if people fail one another and so on. The novel sometimes almost reads like science fiction and like moral debate.  <br /> <br />This is a clever novel and is not about cloning alone. It is important to understand that we are increasingly a society that is highly task oriented and have little time to go apart until some major catastrophy happens. The main problem I had with this novel is that it does not have the light touch that he had with his great novels. While it was unusual and special, I did not get the feel of reading an outstanding novel. Some of the places may be too long for people who are not fans of such novels.

As some of the other reviewers pointed out, the climax it builds to is not the stuff of Hollywood or pulp sci fi that we may have expected.

Kathy notes the cabin size and condition and it's clear they could take that boat somewhere and be free.  They don't.  They don't even discuss it. They just watch it sitting there.  Kathy and Tommy drive all over the English countryside-- it's clear they have their physical freedom.  They drive to clinics to visit other donors, to stores to shop, cafes to relax in, and hospitals for pre-donation testing.  There are no doors or bars holding these people in.

Disarming enough to let us think that many of our ideas are our own. Protective enough to make us feel that such indoctrinated sacrifice is the natural course of human existence.<br /><br />The curious absence of outright rebellion in Ishiguro's book seems to support this interpretation. Because while it may seem far fetched, most other interpretations that touch on the slow-motion reveals of \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" have already been covered by various authors in various genres. In the most obvious connections, the work of Philip K.

It doesn't take place in the future; instead, advances in genetic engineering have happened at a far more accelerated rate after World War II than they did.   <br /> <br />We follow the conclusion of the career as \\""carer\\"" to her fellow clones of a Kathy H., during which she reminisces about her childhood and young adulthood.  Kathy is a wholly remarkable character who, unlike her fellows, doesn't have lifelong dreams of a \\""normal\\"" life working in an office or become preoccupied with rumored \\""deferrals\\"" of her donation obligation.  You want her to livea great deal more than she does -- not that she affirmatively wants to die, at all, but part of the brilliance of the development of Kathy is that it is truly, and believably, not in her to think in terms of life or death.

Kazuo Ishiguro is clearly a master writer, but he has chosen a subject here that is way, way out of his expertise. Although beautifully written, the basic story behind \\""Never Let me Go\\"" is dull, and goes over a sci fi subject (cloning) that was done to death 40 years ago. Yes, even the idea of adult clones going willingly to their death for the benefit of mankind.     Presumably Mr. Ishiguro was inspired by the cloning of Dolly the sheep to try his hand at something like this. It's notable that when Americans attack this sort of subject, you get a result like the current movie, \\""The Island\\"", which focuses less on introspection than on the rebellion of the clones. It says a lot about the difference in national character! LOL! Plus I see many commenters here are the most disturbed at the passivity of the characters.    I certainly see that as a flaw in the structure of the novel (what would prevent any of the clones from simply walking away from Hailsham or the Cottages? After all, they don't look any different than an ordinary person), however I think there are much more serious flaws in the construct.    The ideal age for a \\""clone\\"" to donate organs would be late teens, not their 30s. That's when all your internal organs are at their healthiest, and you have reached adult proportions. That wouldn't leave time for \\""carers\\"" to develop. And what's with the concept of \\""carers\\""? They aren't even properly trained as nurses or even orderlies. Transplant/donor patients require skilled nursing, not \\""pals\\"".    Then there is the problem of the idea that the clones donate approximately 4 times (if they survive) and then \\""complete\\"" (die). What the heck are they donating to accomplish this? You can live with only one kidney, and you can survive with a partial liver...or lose your pancreas, and survive on insulin. But you certainly can't survive without a heart or lungs, which are among the most desirabletransplant organs. Maintaining a donor clone on dialysis (assuming both his kidneys were transplanted) would render him too weak to donate any of his other organs. From a strictly medical point of view, it would make more sense to kill the clones and harvest ALL the desirable organs, rather than taking one at a time and risking the clone dying from one of those procedures. Or is the idea that the clone is donating only to the individual he was cloned FROM, as that individual has various organs fail? That doesn't make sense either -- nobodies organs fail exactly in a certain order.    Furthermore, the implication is that harvesting cloned organs will cure cancer. I am hard pressed to think of a cancer that could be cured by transplantation -- it would certainly be rare. The problem with cancer is that it spreads all throughout the body, and transplanting organ after organ would be useless.    This is just a few of the examples of why this is a patently stupid idea for a novel. I don't think Mr. Ishiguro has read much genuine sci fi that explores these ideas, or he'd understand how out of date and out of his depth he really is here. As far as the story exploring the way people passively accept their fate, no matter what it is, without fighting back -- well, if he's revealing an inside look at British culture, that's the scariest part of all.",2005-07-20

What rights would clones have, if it ever became viable to make them? Why would we even want to clone a human being? Would that make us less, or more, human? Ishiguro approaches these questions obliquely in his book, \\""Never Let Me Go\\"". The science is never discussed and the focus remains squarely on the human-side of the equation. <br /> <br />The book is written as a narrative of life as a Hailsham student, and later as a carer, through the lens of Kathy's memories. It has the feel of an intimate conversation coming at the end of the narrator's life - a making peace with her past. <br /> <br />Of course, the reader knows from the beginning that Hailsham is not an ordinary boarding school. Something ominous lies on the horizon. And the author doesn't take long to let you know what it is - the \\""students\\"" are actually clones raised to be donors of their vital organs once they reach maturity. What should have been something of a shock is rather less so. Ishiguro's writing is excellent, but his style lends a detached feeling that keeps the reader at arms length. In some sense it matches the isolation of the students from society-at-large; perhaps an attempt to explain how any society could tolerate such a system - out-of-sight out-of-mind. But the lack of emotional attachment to Kathy or Tommy or Ruth, the primary characters, makes them somewhat disposal. Who cares what happens to them? And in a way it dampens any interest the reader might have in what Ishiguro has to say about what it is to be human. And what exactly does he have to say about humanness? His answer is rather muddled. <br /> <br />Are we human because we have the capacity to love? It is love the drives Kathy to seek a deferment for Tommy and her. But their love isn't strong enough to withstand disappointment. Perhaps it never really was love, only mutual affection born from growing up together and sharing a common fate. <br /> <br />Perhaps our capacity for hope, even if only a thin sliver, makes us human. But Ishiguro doesn't give humanity much credit for that. After Tommy and Kathy discover that the deferment was a rumor that the teachers of Hailsham eventually stopped denying in the belief that it provided the \\""students\\"" hope their own struggle to continue living ends. They give up and except their fate. Ishiguro spends little time on society outside of the bubble Kathy lives in. As a consequence the Hailsham proprietor's attempt to change society seems half-hearted and in the end even they give up. <br /> <br />Artist expression is Ishiguro's most prominent answer. Every year an arts and crafts show is held at the school. And every year the best are selected for the proprietor's private gallery; a gallery whose purpose is the source of some speculation as no one has actually seen it. Years later Kathy and Tommy would come believe that this art was collected to prove the love of applicants for deferment by showing their inner selves, who they really were - art as an expression of the human soul. In the final analysis though, as even this has failed to change the fate of the \\""students\\"", rationalization may be Ishiguro's most convincing answer (our capacity to twist evidence to suit already preconceived ideals or ignore it when it can't be bent to our will). <br /> <br />Despite all of this there is enough in \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" to stimulate thought and discussion if only the reader were made to care. Unfortunately, I could never bring myself to feel anything for Kathy. And that is a shame because hers is a cautionary tale that we as a society, and as individuals, should pay attention to. It goes beyond the particulars and delves deep into what makes us special, what makes us human. <br />",2005-07-16

The horror does not consist in the action of the book, which is positively restrained; rather, it slowly creeps up on the reader in the society that underpins the conditions described.    The action of the book takes place some fifty years after a major medical breakthrough: the cure for virtually all disease through therapeutic cloning.  Medical science became able to cure cancer, heart disease, etc., through growing new organs to replace the diseased ones.  But these valuable organs, the promise of life to the previously hopeless, need an incubator in which to grow to the necessary maturity; an embryonic heart is of no use to an adult patient.  Therefore, children are cloned and raised to adulthood, at which point their organs are systematically harvested in a series of operations, culminating in the \\""completion\\"" of their purpose in life.     Other reviewers have found the lack of rebellion on the part of these doomed individuals to be a flaw in the book; to me, it makes the story more heartbreaking.

She describes a fairly typical, genteel boarding-school life, with some important oddities. There is no mention of families, school holidays, life before Hailsham, or contact with the outside world. There is Madame, who visits periodically to collect the best of the children's artwork, which the children assume to be for inclusion in her Gallery. The teachers at Hailsham are their guardians, and the children know, in a carefully vague way, that they are different in some important way from their guardians, Madame, and all the \\""normal\\"" people in the outside world. As Kathy and her friends, most importantly Tommy and Ruth, grow older, they are, as one of the guardians says, \\""told and not told\\"" that they are clones, being raised solely as spare parts for real people. Kathy H., with her career as a \\""carer\\""-a sort of combination patient advocate and designated emotional support for \\""donors,\\"" clones whose organs are currently being harvested-coming to an end, is about to begin her own few years of donating vital organs until she \\""completes.\\"" (The word \\""die\\"" is never used in relation to the clones.)<br /><br />  In many ways this is a good book Life at Hailsham and afterwards is beautifully described, exquisitely detailed, touching but not cloying, with a creepy undertone that's fairly effective. Kathy, the passive good girl whose more stubborn or more persistent than she seems; bossy, manipulative Ruth; Tommy, with a temper he can't always control and baffled by some of the social demands on him; these are kids I knew, though I avoided some of them. The problems here are different, and all the more maddening because some of them would be so easy to fix.<br /><br />  I don't have a problem with the fact that Kathy and her friends don't rebel against their fate. They've been carefully raised to believe it's their natural place in life, they're not taught or encouraged to think critically, and they're given very comfortable lives. Once they leave Hailsham, they go to the Cottages-somewhat less comfortable physically, but almost as sheltered, for their gradual transition from students to carers. What does strain my credibility considerably is that, once they're at the Cottages, living with clones raised in other facilities, some of them far less privileged than Hailsham, and able to watch television, read newspapers, and get out into the \\""normal\\"" world to some degree, the myriad floating rumors don't include any stories at all of any clones having resisted. There is speculation about who they were cloned from, there are daydreams about the lives they might live if they were \\""normal,\\"" there are rumors about \\""deferrals\\"" that allow two clones who can prove they are really in love to put off the start of their donations for a few years. There are no rumors at all about clones actively resisting or attempting to escape-no romantic daydreams of successful escape, no cautionary tales of failed escape or resistance, no stories of some carer-provided with a car and necessarily traveling around the country without close supervision, in pursuit of their duites-mysteriously disappearing or attempting to disappear. Nothing. Given that the main burden of the book is that the clones are just as human as we are, and are being used in an inhuman way, this is utterly beyond the bounds of possibility. Human beings everywhere tell themselves and each other stories that both comfort and frighten them. It's what we do. It's what distinguishes us as a species; there is virtually no other human behavior that hasn't been found in some form in other species. Human beings who aren't telling each other stories in order to frame and manage the most important fact of their lives are just not credible.<br /><br />  There is also, apparently, no real outside resistance to the fate of the clones. There is a terribly genteel and polite movement of which Hailsham is a part, making speeches, raising money, and creating foundations to raise the clones in more humane and pleasant conditions, rather than the factory conditions that prevailed before Hailsham and other foundations of its type, and apparently still the norm for most clones. But, in the land of the anti-vivisectionist movement, animal rights activists, and people willing to demonstrate and even riot over genetic engineering on plants and the creation of \\""Frankenfoods,\\"" there apparently isn't and never has been any more vigorous movement against human cloning itself-either on behalf of the clones, or out of fear of damage to the human race generally. I harbor no excess confidence in the human race; I see no reason why such a movement would have to be successful. It's perfectly plausible that it would attract nutcases who would do something seriously counterproductive. What I don't believe in is an England where such a movement does not exist at all-especially not since the cloning began in the 1950s, in the aftermath of the end of World War II and revelation to the general public of Hitler's concentration camps. That no such movement ever existed in Mr. Ishiguro's fictional England is another item in the \\""completely unbelievable\\"" category. And it could be so easily fixed-the Great Revelation that the book slowly builds toward would be much stronger if the \\""scandal\\"" that did the damage were rooted in a real resistance that backfired badly rather than what it's linked to here.<br /><br />  The final difficulty is Mr. Ishiguro's failure to think seriously about the underpinnings of his fictional world. It's the 1990s, and we've got large-scale human cloning for spare parts going on. It's been going on for decades; in fact, it started in the 1950s. Now, in the real 1950s, we had barely begun to even ask the right questions. It was four decades later that the first successful animal clone was created. We're still finding that cloning is different for each species-Genetic Savings & Clone, a real company, is really offering commercial cloning of your deceased pet cat, but they can't do dogs well enough to offer dog cloning yet. (Next year-they hope.) And not only is the failure rate in cloning quite high; the failure mode is pretty horrific. And even in \\""successful\\"" clones, significant and life-shortening health problems that didn't exist in the original are extremely common. We're not even close to being able to clone human beings who would live to be born, much less human beings who would live to adulthood and be healthy organ donors. So how does Mr. Ishiguro explain this major departure in the history of science? He credits it to the \\""great burst of scientific progress\\"" after the war. Oh, right. Sure. Without major differences in the direction of science before that, it's not possible. The least-major change that would provide a fig leaf of cover for 1950s human cloning have to involve Dr. Mengele making several major breakthroughs in the course of his medical experiments. And that brings us right back to the implausible lack of any resistance to cloning humans for spare parts, and now we need to consider that lack in the light of the science of cloning stemming directly from Hitler's death camps and Mengele's experiments.

I sense about Ishiguro the same lingering Japanese sensibilities around contained emotions and delayed self-fulfillment in the way he develops his stories despite the fact that he has been raised in England since age five. In his latest novel set in late-1990's England, he continues to be a poet for the emotionally inarticulate. As with his masterful book, \\""The Remains of the Day\\"", it takes a while to understand this self-realization gap and even longer for his protagonists to grasp it about themselves. Since it's the nature of Ishiguro narrators to postpone a full reckoning of their place in the world, all we know in the early going is that we don't quite know what's going on. The story focuses on Kathy H, a woman who recalls her strange childhood and how certain interconnected circumstances of her upbringing become foundational to her adult life.<br /><br />The premise sounds like a new millennium variation on Aldous Huxley's \\""Brave New World\\"", but what grounds Ishiguro's book is how he details his characters' emotional situation in meticulous detail, that Kathy is struggling to achieve clarity and contentment in a confusing world that seems disinterested in her fate. Very much like what author Mark Haddon did in creating his autistic protagonist Christopher Boone in \\""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\"", Ishiguro uses Kathy's identity to work out intricate ways of showing the isolated world she has created. Through her naïvet&eacute; and laser-sharp deductive reasoning, it appears that Ishiguro is telling us that what makes us human makes us individuals and that the idea of human beings as products programmed to pick up \\""personhood skills\\"" is a science fiction that may be closer at hand than we realize.

The author takes us inside of a `boarding school' for clones that have been bred to contribute organs to save the lives of regular people.  The apparent approximate lifespan of these clones is about 25 to 30 years.  The clones are bred and kept in various government facilities where they are taught the things they need to know to work as `care givers' for several years, before being tapped to give their organs to others to save lives. <br /> <br />These clones are sterile.  And what Ishiguro does is to capture the intellectual development of one particular clone, Kathy, and those around her in the `breeding/boarding school' that she attends.  The treatment of the subject area is very intricate and subtle.  The morality of the process itself is touched on, and touched on with disdain, but not in a way so as to suggest that such a practice can be changed. <br /> <br />The practice, however, is akin to raising cattle for food.  Yet here, we are raising human beings for slaves and organ donations.  And in their short lifespan of 30 years, they go through an entire emotional development that is significantly different from what a real person would go through.  Because they know they are to shortly die. <br /> <br />Ishiguro leaves most of the ethics and morality to the reader to puzzle out.  What he illustrates is the mindset, the psychological processes of those who are the clones.  How they cope with their 'position in life' so to speak is the focus of Ishiguro's book.  The process is developed with intensely emotional treatment and highly adept intellectual introspection.  The book is recommended to all readers interested in the ethics and morality of society and how it may develop in the future. <br />",2005-06-14

He also asks how much adults should warn children about what life has to offer them, how much should we shelter them from the real world, the loneliness of being different, the uncrossable gulf between the sick and the well, missed opportunities, how the smallest whiff of hope sustains us, the beauty of friendship and lasting love-- and finally, a sweet thought-- that the dead never leave us as long as we remember them. In a poignant passage the narrator remembers Tommy: \\""I half-closed my eyes and imagined this was the spot where everything I'd ever lost since my childhood had washed up, and I was now standing here in front of it, and if I waited long enough, a tiny figure would appear on the horizon across the field, and gradually get larger until I'd see it was Tommy, and he's wave, maybe even call.

The way Ishiguro sustains the voice of the narrator over the course of the story is impressive; Kathy's voice is every bit as distinctive as Stevens' in The Remains of the Day and yet quite unlike it. The book also deals with worthy themes, not least the way we might come to take for granted something utterly shocking and repulsive. One reviewer asked why none of the characters tried to run away. My response is that the reader wishes they might, but the point of the novel is that the characters have been lulled into a sense that their lot in life is inevitable; they have their place and the most they could hope for (a hope that plays out in the final pages) is that there might be a brief respite from what must come. <br /> <br />More below on the psychological plausibility of that premise. My disappointment had to do with what sits in the background. The novel, after all, is set in contemporary England -- or, at least, a version of contemporary England that's supposed to be within a reasonable imaginative distance of the world as it actually is. Perhaps the scheme on which the novel is built could actually emerge from the real attitudes of contemporary Western Europe. The way we are to assume most people view Kathy and her fellow \\""students\\"" is not unlike the kind of racism that's still far too common in supposedly civilized Europe. But even that sort of reflexive racism seldom goes so far as to call into question whether the \\""other\\"" has a soul and, the most vicious aside, most Western racists would still be horrified by the use to which the \\""students\\"" are put. It's true; we are within living memory of the Holocaust. But it's also true that because of those very memories, the Western world, at least, is a different place. Moreover, even though most of us havedeep reservations about cloning, it's not because we think that cloned humans would be any less than human. On the contrary, our reservations are partly because it's so clear that these beings _would_ be humans -- just like us. <br /> <br />Or so one might think. In order to make the case that this isn't so, and that the England he imagines is within imaginative reach, Ishiguro would have had to tell us a lot more than he does about how his dystopia came about. What we get, instead, is a hasty and almost perfunctory account in the final pages that feels unconvincing and blunts the emotional force of the novel's ending.  <br /> <br />That said, there's a coda that honesty compels me to add. When I finished the book, I felt much less moved than I thought I was meant to. But in spite of the clumsiness of the backstory, I woke up the next morning with a real sense of unease. It was not that I was ready to grant the plausibility of the backstory. It was that I could imagine all too easily that the characters might really have been manipulated into accepting the utterly unacceptable lot that they have been handed, however implausible that lot may be. These characters may not be intrinsically less soulless than the rest of us, but we can imagine them being robbed of a piece of their souls -- not by the circumstances of their births but by how they've been schooled to see themselves.",2005-05-25

Like most boarding schools, Hailsham exists in its own enclosed world, with its own philosophy, and its own faintly odd traditions.

For them death is not only inevitable, it's almost desirable. Kathy, Ruth and Tommy often discuss big plans for the future, but because of their preconceived role they stay fearful of the world around them - \\""unable to quite let each other go.\\""  <br /> <br />Ishiguro takes a rather icy, restrained, and dispassionate look at this issue, but he does it from the point of view of the donor, rooting the reader firmly in the mind of Cathy. We get to see her thoughts and views of the world, and throughout, a picture emerges of a passionate, intelligent, perceptive, and also a remarkably sensitive woman, who is unfortunately regarded by the society around her as \\""not quite human.\\""  <br /> <br />Never Let Me Go portrays a new world rapidly becoming more scientific; there are more cures for the old sicknesses, and there are now vast human banks rich in deposits of hearts and lungs and livers. But it's become also a harsh and cruel world full of scientific objectivity, where the donors are housed in government run institutions and where societies are exhibiting a resoundingly deep moral blindness towards the issue. It's a scenario that is chilling, compelling, otherworldly, and also deeply disturbing.  <br /> <br />Beautifully written, with exquisite warmth and tenderness, Never Let Me Go is often disquieting and worrying, but it will also fill you with the bright light of understanding and leave you absolutely enriched for the experience.

That's not really such as problem as some pretty heavy-handed references to the \\""surprise\\"" come in the first few pages, many readers will figure it out in the first few dozen, and Ishiguro himself says he has no problem with reviewers revealing the premise as he \\""wasn't writing a mystery.\\"" But for those who prefer not to know, I'll keep the next paragraph spoiler-free then skip a line and give a spoiler alert before continuing. <br />   Never Let Me Go is narrated by 31-year-old Kathy H, a soon-to-retire \\""carer\\"" who looks back at her time at Hailsham, a strange and isolated English private school where she lived her entire youth. Moving back and forth in time, she revisits the school's strange rules and traditions, the oddly reticent live-in teachers or \\""Guardians\\"", and especially the relationship she had with Tommy and Ruth--her two best friends. The book's strengths are its clear, clean prose; its muted voice, its shifting back and forth in time, its steadily accreting sense of poignancy.  Its weaknesses are several scenes that would read much more tritely were they not bolstered by the weight conveyed due to the as-yet-to-be-revealed-in-this-review premise, a sometimes annoying repetition of qualifiers and reminders that memory is not 100 percent, and a sense that the world created hasn't really been fully thought out or fully stocked.  The book can be moving, but lags in some places and annoys in others.  And that's the vague review you get when the premise can't be discussed:  a mildly pleasing book that disappoints somewhat in the end.  Anyone who doesn't want the premise revealed should stop here. <br />Spoilers below: <br />   It doesn't take long for the reader to figure there's something weird about Hailsham and it isn't that far into the book that the main premise is revealed, that Kathy, Tommy, Ruth and the other \\""students\\"" are clones created to become organ donors.  Kathy has been a \\""carer\\"" (for the clones who donate) for over a decade and is soon to become a donor herself.  She has reunited recently with Ruth and Tommy, both of whom became donors much earlier and both of whom are moving steadily towards their \\""completion\\"" (death) which usually happens after the fourth donation.   <br />    The premise is what gives the book the added weight some of its scenes desperately need.  On the surface level, the book is a not-so-original \\""my life at boarding school story\\"".  Kathy recounts the usual angst of adolescence:  the fear of being isolated, cliques, the exploration of sexuality, the cattiness of friends, the way friendships shift between rivalry and loyalty (especially when there is a triangle involved), the dominant girl and the more passive girl, etc.  All of these scenes are handled deftly and smoothly, but not particularly originally.  There isn't much spark to them, nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before. <br />   What rescues the book from cliche or from triteness of course is the chilling ever-presence of the premise.  These are not normal pre-teens and teens. The fact that they are clones, that they are basically farm animals bred to be slaughtered, that they will almost all \\""complete\\"" at a relatively young age (Kathy at 31 is pretty old in comparison to most it seems)--all of this adds weight to each would-otherwise-be-trivial scene.  When Kathy talks about how the kids \\""collected\\"" small, basically worthless items to mark their individuality, it's nothing more than all pre-teens do, except of course that in this situation it is, and one can't help but feel the echo of similar behaviors in the concentration camps. The same is true for the mysterious focus at Hailsham on producing art, on being creative.  One of the earliest signs of something amiss is that the best kid at football is not honored for his athleticism but mocked for his lack of artistic talent. <br />   The guardians have full knowledge of the truth and it is slowly revealed to the students,  but timed Kathy later suspects so that they were never really old enough to fully internalize what they were being told about their fate.  Some adults show revulsion toward them, some pity, some regret, some anger.  <br />   Among the three kids, Ruth is the dominant one, Kathy the more passive, and Tommy is caught in between, becoming Ruth's boyfriend but also clearly pining for  Kathy, who as a young woman would like to return that affection but doesn't.  Why she doesn't, what happens when the three reunite as adults, what they further learn about Hailsham are all points better left undiscussed, as they drive much of the plot in the last quarter of the book and they, at least, are meant to be somewhat suspenseful or mysterious. <br />   As mentioned above, the strengths of the book are its prose and its premise.  As one expects from Ishiguro, the writing is sharp and efficient, smoothly tailored to its intended effect.  The premise permeates the book and is disturbing not simply for its horror but also for the triviality of its presentation.  This is no horrific dystopic vision like 1984 or the Handmaid's Tale.  What chills here is the banality of the presentation, of the setting and the seemingly trivial activities of the children/teens. <br />  This is both strength, however, and weakness, for it's a very fine line Ishiguro is trying to walk, and if the banality of the conflicts and dialogues and \\""crises\\"" serve to make the premise more chilling, they are also banal and for me at least they never completely escaped that banality.  I see the chilling effect, I understand it, but a part of me kept reacting to the triviality of yet another teen angst book with two teen girls liking the same boy, with boys ganging up on another boy, with girls being mean to each other, etc. <br />  Kathy's voice was also somewhat problematic for me for it was a bit too muted, too matter-of-fact, at least until the very end.  And there was the annoying frequency with which she would qualify her memories by saying something along the lines of \\""of course, memory isn't failsafe\\"", or \\""Ruth (or Tommy) didn't remember it this way\\"", or \\""I thought this was how it happened but now I find I'm unsure . . \\"" and so on.  I didn't mind the idea so much as how often it was thrown at me. <br />   Plot-wise, the ending seemed a bit forced--the search for a particular truth and the way a lot of information is revealed at the end in monologue form by an old woman in a room, much of the \\""mystery\\"" summed up in a few pages of pure speech. <br />   But by far the largest problem I had was how the whole world premise felt only half-baked.  While the self-contained world of Hailsham was well-presented, there were a lot of nagging questions with regard to what was happening elsewhere.  The clones move freely in and out of society once they graduate from Hailsham, but there is little reaction to or from them with regard to \\""normals\\"".  Where are the inevitable extremists from either side--those who would protect them from their fate and those who would want to destroy them?  Who are the organs for?  Why does no one rebel, take a car and just drive away?  How does nobody try to get word to the kids at Hailsham about what they really are and what their future is?  Ishiguro has one Guardian break down and hint/reveal but it's handled more sentimentally than with any anger or sense of rebellion.  One has to imagine there would be others who would take  more active roles.  Not that they had to be on-stage but rumors of such things, brief references to them would make the world seem more real.

Or why 20-yr-old Tommy doesn't just take off once he's free of Hailsham's restrictions. <br />  In the end, the half-nature of the created world, the muted narrative voice, and the surface triviality of the kids' relationships combined to bleed the book of some of its power.  Not all of it.  As I've said, there is a sense of chill throughout, and the end is quite moving, as is the book as a whole. But if the book is greater than its parts, it isn't so by much.

While verbose in its text, and laborious at times in its level of detail, it nevertheless unfolds in a direct manner making it accessible to the reader and allows one to ease into the more complicated ideas that will be explored as the story progresses.   <br /> <br />Obviously, there are various issues concerning the ethics competing against science, and I believe they are swiftly revealed to the reader (in case you already didn't get it) in the ending portions of the novel.  However, I think what Ishiguro was quietly prompting the readers to do is to both forget and consider at the same time the implications behind the role clones play.  Of course science can deliver miracles and great benefits, but at what cost?  Should we care about beings essentially created out of a test tube as if they were human beings? <br /> <br />What I think is interesting to note is that the entire story is told from the perspective of a clone, and the minutia of detail surrounding the love triangle between Ruth, Tommy, and our narrator Kathy.  There is also a great deal of time spent on the minutia of everyday life while at Hailsham, the school where some of the clones are sent to be 'sheltered' and educated.  Ishiguro spends a great deal of time exploring the thoughts, feelings and ideas that consume the daily lives of Kathy and her companions.  It all seems relatively normal.   <br /> <br />But it isn't.  In fact, though, while the reader may know and consider that this is all a disturbing sort of backdrop, in essence, the characters, the clone characters -- they never question the morality or ethics behind their lot in life.  They have simply accepted it.  It is, in fact, unquestioned as to the ultimate morality.  Unlike some of the guardians at Hailsham and presumably other people in society who are not clones, the clones themselves simply acceptthe fact that donations and their purpose is predetermined.  We the readers are left to consider the ethics -- but strangely it is not really explored by those whom it would seem to matter most.  There is no revolt by the clones -- simply a focus on what matters in everyday life. <br /> <br />People are tired.  People fall in love.  People have sex.  People have desires.  People have dreams.  All things the clones feel and experience.  In essence, we are challenged to consider their humanity by listening to a story about something very real and human in its telling.  The book is an exploration of our humanity -- through the lens of a being that may in fact not be truly human.  And a question raised as to what gives meaning to the idea of being human.   <br /> <br />It is those concepts, laid before us in a beautifully written and subtle text, which take this book out of the realm of a good, somewhat enojoyable novel, and to a level of exceptionally high quality.",2005-05-16

I did know the secret beforehand and, to be honest, am glad I did.  If I had not known, then I would have been so busy trying to solve the riddles that I would have been distracted from the meaning imbued within the clues that are dropped.   <br /> <br />On to the book.  There is usually a significant time lapse between scientific advances and a society's social and cultural ability to absorb such changes.  In the area of biological advances in science, issues directly touching on our ability to prolong life have called into question such issues as how valuable human life is and to what extent should we go to save human life.   <br /> <br />The dearth of artistic expressions of such issues has created a vacuum that unfortunately has been filled with the likes of Peter Singer, a bio-ethicist who believes that because what makes humans human is difficult to properly articulate, it must therefore be morally irrelevant.  Taking this starting point, Singer proceeds to diminish humanity with a logic so steely cold that it would make an executioner turn green with envy. <br /> <br />NEVER LET ME GO is a large step towards balancing this disparity.  That is not to say that Ishiguro is particularly interested in bio-ethical issues.  For all I know, he has no such interest whatsoever and simply wanted to write a good book.  Yet any good novelist transcends the specific story he writes and touches upon the zeitgeist of his times.  This Ishiguro does and that he set the book in the near past indicates that this was his intent. <br /> <br />The story involves Kathy telling of her past at a prestigious school called Hailsham.  Although the surface of the story discusses the same mundane childhood events that may be familiar to all of us, there arelittle hints thrown in that something is a bit different.  Exactly what that difference is and how it affects Kathy and her classmates is told subtly, so that by the time we learn the truth, we are sufficietly attached to the characters to view them more personally, more humanly, than we might have had the story been told from a different perspective.  Ishiguro shifts the perspective sufficiently so as to make us examine certain issues anew. <br /> <br />Had NEVER LET ME GO been more bombastic, it would not have worked as well.  Happily, Ishiguro has the talent to present us with a very good read packed with moral complexity.  I recommend it highly. <br /> <br />",2005-05-15

(And the interestingly, the story appears to take place in the 1980's, and in a very recognisable England.) Much of the book charts the ups and downs of their relationships: the petty squabbles, the rivalries and generous doses of adolescent angst bringing home just how very human they are. But how far are the trio prepared to face the reality of their condition, as the evidence gradually falls into place? <br /> <br />Ishiguro of course has always made a speciality of self-deceiving and emotionally constipated narrators, and Kath is no exception - but this serves to make the true pathos of the story hit home even harder. And yes, I confess I cried at the end, which was a bit embarrassing because I was at the hairdressers at the time! <br /> <br />There's plenty of food for thought here.

In Japan, children are first and foremost told that they must be \\""tsunao\\"" (compliant) and where the horrors of life after the four year university vacation are, as at Hailsham, revealed to them gradually until they are virtually unquestionable.    Most importantly, Ishiguro is not wagging a finger about the moral dangers of cloning. He is using the sci-fi element as a metaphor for how societies, especially during times of \\""progress,\\"" are willing to sacrifice people's lives to keep the machine going. This is why the \\""medical advance\\"" of organ harvesting is discovered in the 1950s, a time when so many other monsters and abuses continued in the rush to the future:nuclear proliferation; the radiation experiments on so-called \\""handicapped\\"" kids who were locked away in U.S. institutions; Japan's own destruction of its environment during the post-war \\""reconstruction.\\"" It is about about how large scale \\""progress\\"" asks us, not only to give up our physical parts, but gradually, pieces of our own souls.  When Kathy H becomes a carer, and her life is thrown into a humdrum, yet back breaking routine that essentially robs her and her peers of their ability to think about the reality of their situation, it is like the young company recruit, fresh out of college who is deliberately thrown into the life-sucking monotony before he or she has a chance to figure things out. Their world is kept small at Hailsham, and constrained even further when they reach the outside. Tommy's distancing of himself before his final donation is not unlike the haggard salaryman, who loses all emotional contact with his wife in that final fatigued relinquishment to the corporation.  Some reviewers have complained that none of the students rebel. They need only work in a Japanese school, or nowadays, a test-crazy American school in the age of No Child Left Behind, to understand this dangerously easily instillation of passivity.",2005-04-24

Given a story that might be horrific, Ishiguro achieves the seemingly impossible of combining that Poe-like premise with a sunlit atmosphere of childhood innocence, youthful growth of understanding, and finally, an adult quest. I wonder if this novel will not take its place beside Brave New World and 1984 as a vision of a totalitarian future. And yet, it is set in the 1990's.

At another level it is a nightmarish horror tale whose protagonists have all come to life through cloning, and from day one were then raised at Hailsham, a special \\""boarding school\\"" where, in total isolation, they were being prepared for an early death by organ donation to terminally ill but maculately conceived \\""normal\\"" humans. Though as gothic a tale as has ever been imagined, this novel recounts scenes from the narrator's life, as mundane and ordinary as the comings and goings of some Jane Austen characters. The horror is encoded in the whole, not in its parts. One is reminded of that weird surface known as a Moebius strip, which though weirdly one-sided as a whole, in small regions looks like any run-of-the-mill two-sided surface.  <br /> <br />Stylistically, Ishiguro masterfully manages this large-scale/small-scale contrast by endowing the narrator with a very simple and restricted, yet truly poetic word usage. To emphasize ordinariness on the small scale, short everyday words are the rule throughout, along with some childish idioms, to such a point, that when the word \\""bonhomie\\"" puts in a cameo appearance in this sad tale, it hits one like a bombshell. Besides, the pacing is so perfect, that the book is a real page-turner. <br /> <br />The other remarkable literary ingredient --- maybe the one that attracted Ishiguro to this topic in the first place --- is that in this setting, time undergoes a rescaling. Unlike \\""normal\\"" humans, whose actuarial life expectancy exceeds seventy years, Hailsham graduates can expect to \\""complete\\"" (their euphemism for the verb die) before they even reach the age of thirty. One lives one's life according to the time at one's disposal. It is remarkable how the basic human emotions and interactions get deformed to accommodate the much-shortened lifetime of these characters. At some point all humans become aware of their mortality, but this point obviously gets much moved up when early \\""completion\\"" becomes a virtual certainty. As a consequence, youth loses much of its easygoing freedom of care. This novel explores in some depth the extent to which mortality-awareness affects human feelings and actions. Yes, not only does Ishiguro deal in stylistic Moebius strips and rescaled time, but also in issues of life and death, the deepest human issues.  <br /> <br />The characters' marked humanity and the apparent short-term normalcy of their situation makes one gladly willing to suspend disbelief, even as it is clear that a world in which cloned humans are bred for the sole purpose of mercilessly harvesting their vital organs, is very far from late twentieth century England in which the novel is set. Yet, as a literary device, this fantasyland, or more precisely nightmare-land, comes in very handily for the exploration of some very deep issues. Apart from those I already mentioned, there is also the issue of artistic creation as a manifestation of one's humanity, an issue, which surprisingly turns out to be crucial in driving the most thrilling part of Ishiguro's plot. Some suspended disbelief is also called for when in the middle of nowhere teenage high-school graduates are found debating Joyce and Proust and aptly, if somewhat glibly --- though probably with Ishiguro's smiling approval --- putting down George Eliot's \\""Daniel Deronda.\\"" This is all the more bizarre, given that from the day they were born, these youngsters had been carefully sequestered from any interaction whatsoever with contemporary society at large, let alone with the societies described by all these long-dead writers.  <br /> <br />What I found most surprising, was the meekness of all these cloned humans, not one of whom manages to come up with the idea of fighting those who perpetrate this atrocity on them. Even Tommy, the male of the love triangle, though of a marvelously rebellious nature, does not take his fate in his own hands when it really matters. With an English stiff upper lip he goes through four organ-harvesting operations before he finally \\""completes.\\""  <br /> <br />These are all minor quibbles, given what Ishiguro delivers on the big issues he so successfully tackles in this marvelous and  absorbing masterpiece.",2005-04-20

Unfortunately, this only adds to the disappointment awaiting readers in 'Never Let Me Go'.  Ishiguro is trying to walk a fine line.  His narrator is very much an innocent, as is the way she presents her story.  Barely a chapter finishes without a sentence such as 'which reminds of the time when ...' which then serves as a leaden lead-in to the next chapter.  I think the main reason there is none of Ishiguro's customary lightness in touch present is because stripped bare, the plot's pretty thin.  This has never been a problem for Ishiguro before, but here, he attempts to hide various revelations that most readers will have already guessed by the end of the third chapter.  The denouement seemed to be ripped from the pages of a poor Agatha Christie novel - an old lady delivers a five page monologue to fill the reader in on plot points.  It might have worked, but already we knew way too much.  I kept getting the feeling that perhaps he was too successful in creating a lifeless world, a fair enough aim in creating the dystopia, but it leaves very little that is human in his characters.  And that seems a serious mis-step.  When I think of great dystopic literature, as in Orwell's 1984, it usual involves a character who struggles.

Just as Stevens the butler devoted himself unthinkingly and uncritically to the minutiae of daily life on behalf of his Nazi sympathizing master, Lord Darlington, the main characters in Ishiguro's latest book focus on the irrelevant small details and minor tribulations of their lives without ever once contemplating the bigger picture. In both cases, the author not only conjures the question of the meaning of life, he asks us to contemplate the tragedy of wasted lives.     On its surface, NEVER LET ME GO tells the story of three special young people - Kathy H., Tommy D., and Ruth - all of whom meet as students at an idyllic private school called Hailsham. Kathy H. is the narrator, now 31 years old, telling her story in hindsight. She recalls her student days at Hailsham fondly, filling her tale with numerous minor anecdotes about the most mundane affairs that slowly reveal the nature of the school and its students' place in the world. (...) Ishiguro creates a convincing vocabulary, milieu, and mythology for this setting: guardians, carers, donors, completing, Exchanges, Sales, the Gallery, Norfolk, and an eerie sense of the students having \\""been told and not told.\\""    NEVER LET ME GO accomplishes the remarkable challenge of presenting 288 pages' worth of reading between the lines. Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy are not the real main characters of this story, only the visible ones. The real main characters are invisible, the ones who have not only facilitated the use of cloning as a form of organ farming, but who have created a conditioning environment in which their victims accept their fate without question, as the natural order of things. Kathy, Ruth, Tommy, and their ilk live among normal people yet virtually never approach them, willing segretating themselves from the rest of society as though they were lepers. They live in Skinner boxes without boundaries, conditioned to believe they exist only to sacrifice their lives for the continued life of others. We never see the bioengineers or social scientists who create and maintain this horrifying use of humanity. Instead, they are represented (only on a limited scale) by Hailsham's headmistress, Miss Emily, and the mysterious, art-collecting Madame Marie-Claude.     In 1963, after attending the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Israel, the renowned Hannah Arendt wrote a profound and controversial book entitled EICHMANN IN JERUSALEM: THE BANALITY OF EVIL. Arendt went to the trial expecting to see a monster. Who else could be responsible for such evil as the Holocaust? Instead, she found an accounting clerk. Not only were the most normal of people apparently capable of mindless cruelty, but their evil was senseless, meaningless even to themselves. In this way, their evil was banal. Ishiguro creates a similar feeling, using the triteness of Kathy H.'s reminiscences and Miss Lucy's behaviors and rationalizations to illustrate the banality of their own peculiar form of evil: science practiced for its own sake, without the application of moral standards. NEVER LET ME GO is neither preachily anti-science nor moralistically pro-religion. It is simply a call to include our consciences in the application of science. Perhaps the fact that the first identified character in the book to speak other than Kathy and Ruth is a student named Hannah (who never appears again in the text) is Ishiguro's way of telling us to beware the dangers of banality, that sliding over the edge from ordinariness to \\""Ruth-less\\"" evil is easier than we think.    I puzzled for a while over the setting - England in the 1990's - until I realized that the first sheep clone, Dolly, was created in England in 1996 and died prematurely a few years later. In a sense, all of Hailsham's students are sheep, raised in out-of-the-way rural settings, separated from society and isolated from knowledge of both the practical world and the world of ideas, limited in their human interactions except with one another, and, of course, bred to be consumed (for their vital organs). On several occasions, I was reminded of the cowlike creature in Doug Adams's RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE who greets diners by declaiming the tasty virtues of his best parts and declares: \\""..it was eventually decided to ... breed an animal that actually wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly. And here I am.\\"" Adams presented his creature for comic effect; Ishiguro presents his \\""poor creatures\\"" (as Madame repeatedly calls them) for a low key but nightmarish effect.     NEVER LET ME GO is a transcendent novel, an astonishingly powerful work of literature. The pace is slow and the details seem trivial, but patient readers will be rewarded for their efforts with a thought-provoking exposition on whose life is worth living and who, if anyone, has the right to set the terms and conditions. Arendt contemplated the banality of evil - Ishiguro warns us of the evils that lurk behind banality.",2005-04-13
US,15855795,R1LGQ4NSCNLJ68,1400043395,813354201,"Never Let Me Go",Books,5,15,19,N,N,"The Pointlessness of Life","Critics have been saying that this book is not like any other Ishiguro book. With one exception, the setup is the same; no other Ishiguro book is told with an all-knowing narrator from the start. Alright, maybe The Unconsoled did, but after 30 pages I put it down in disgust and have not picked it up since. The rest of the setup is identical; it is the theme that varies. <br /> <br />What goes hand-in-hand with the all-knowing narrator from the start is that the book all takes place at once. It is still a first-person flashback, but there is no mystery to solve within the life by the person, nothing to do to find anything extraordinary. There are no missing parents like in When We Were Orphans, no letter from an old friend like in Remains of the Day. Ishiguro just has Kathy H., the narrator, tell her story, and reveal the secrets she already knows as she goes along. <br /> <br />More so than in When We Were Orphans (the book I believed is a worthy comparison to Never Let Me Go), the narrator is strong and a solid character to build the story around. Ishiguro does an amazing job supplying the story around Kathy H. while still keeping the full emotional effect. Even though we know this story is impossible, the reader finds it easier to relate to Kathy H. than he did to Christopher Banks, unless the reader actually was an orphan. <br /> <br />The situations are much more commonplace in Never Let Me Go. Ishiguro takes us through the life of Kathy H., from her days at Hailsham growing up, living her childhood to the best possible. Despite the impossibilities of the character, the situations are all realistic. These are normal human childhoods and Ishiguro shows that. It makes it all the more sad. <br /> <br />As I already said, the book crosses the line from plausible like his previous works to impossible, at least with the technology available today. But this is only a technicality. The fact that it is impossible, science fiction as some people inaccurately label it, hasno bearing on the book's quality. The fact that it is impossible fails to enter my mind at all throughout it and I adopt the characters as though they were real, just like I did in his previous works. The impossibility of it is only there on paper. The sad truth is that one day it may be possible. <br /> <br />As strong as Kathy H. is, she and her friends are all equally pathetic characters. They live and die a set life, caring from when they are about eighteen and then becoming donors. Of course they could escape, drive away, but they never even think of it. The only deviance from the norm is the thought of a deferral if you were in love, but nobody knew where to go for that. But these people were created to go a set course in life and though fully capable of deviating from this set course, they all accept it. I have never read of more pathetic characters in my life. Wait, I messed up. I adopted them as I read. Thus I have never seen more pathetic people in my life. <br /> <br />And of note, the only other pathetic narrator Ishiguro has had in my opinion was Masuji Ono in An Artist of the Floating World. That is the only major similarity I could find between the two works that just missed Booker Prize nominations. <br /> <br />When analyzing the book, it is clearly a representation of the meaningless of life. You live your childhood in ignorance of the world. The seclusion of Hailsham almost over emphasizes this, but the fact that it is an over-shielded impression of childhood does not inhibit Ishiguro from his goal. You know of the world, as shown through the pictures the young students see of England, but you just know that they exist. You believe what you are told. You are told artwork is important and you do it. You are then told that there is no need to be worried if you are not creative and you then calm down. The children live their childhood at Hailsham perfectly and thus it is the beginning of part one. But there is no purpose to it except to learn and prepare for future life. <br /> <br />After you grow up, you reach your teenage years. You are still secluded from the world but you are aware that it exists, no longer just told. You understand what you have not seen. You understand that Norfolk is not just a \\""lost corner\\"" in England. You do not have to see it or be told it to believe it. Sex becomes important and Ishiguro's flaw is how he over-emphasizes it. Having just gone through those years, I'm not saying it is not important or anything to that sort, but Ishiguro's reference to the sex the teenagers had at Hailsham makes them seem over-mature. This could just be the narrator's mature recollection, but I believe it is more Ishiguro making the 15-year-olds maturer than they really were. <br /> <br />Part Two brought in the cottages, the intermediate phase between Hailsham and work. There is an air of freedom, but the young adults chose to read and remain trapped in boundaries with limited freedom, more commonly referred to as college. They can escape at any time, but they chose to stay. Some leave earlier to begin training for being carers, some don't. Even before this there are veterans who lead them and make fun of them in shifts, or veterans. We may know them as upperclassmen maybe? But there is no point to it in the real scheme of things. Little that occurs there will really matter when you start your life. You make and break friendships. It does not matter. <br /> <br />Part III skips over a lot of time, showing the blur working creates. There is little to no purpose for any of it, as eventually we will all settle out and die. Some people work later into life than others and watch their friends \\""complete\\"" their lives. Kathy H. is one of these people. But everything she does just continues the circle, continues the inescapable destiny, the continuity of pointlessness that really is life. Some people are better than others at doing their jobs and Kathy H. is just one of these people. But in the end, in about eight month's time, she too will retire and then fizzle out until everything is complete. <br /> <br />But life will still go on the circle will continue. Forever and ever and ever. It is sad. It is pathetic. It is true. <br /> <br />Ishiguro, in his best book since Remains of the Day, shows just how pathetic life really is. He crosses the line from plausible to impossible, but this only makes his characters more relatable. It only makes them more pathetic. <br />",2005-04-10

Although on the surface it appears to be a sci-fi novel, I think sci-fi fanatics would be disappointed - there's lots of fiction, but actually no science. The sci-fi aspects of the plot are so flimsy and so vaguely alluded to that it scarcely matters, apart from one cheesy bit at the end which didn't need to be there because the reader will by then have developed their own ideas of what exactly is going on. He lays the ground so carefully throughout the book that you spend days after reading the book developing the ideas and speculating wildly. What does matter, and what he has achieved so well in this book, is the way he portrays the meaninglessness of beliefs, the balm (and disappointment) that blind faith provides and the ultimate futileness of being alive. But he also portrays the joy that can be gained from the simple pleasures in life, and our ability to cope and adapt to even the most appalling circumstances. Several reviews have described this book as a comment on the importance of 'ethics' in science, but I don't think that's the case. He's just using his plot to miniaturize what happens to all of us - we grow up and then we die, and on the way we usually see terrible things happen to our loved ones, and there's nothing we can do about it, apart from enjoying the good bits that happen on the way, and avoiding the truth by clinging to beliefs that comfort us.

No such luck though.  (SPOILER ALERT)<br /><br />Children in an isolated private school are being raised as organ donors.  That's their only function.  Why do they need an education?  I have no idea.  They go to school until their late teens, at which point they move to rundown (but pleasant) cottages where they just hang out and read and enjoy life.  Some train as 'carers', a sort of companion (with no medical training) for others who are donating their organs.  They donate up to 4 times, recover between donations, and then die.<br /><br />And they don't seem to mind.  Are they lobotomized at birth?  It's not mentioned.  The only hint of objection is that some of the kids fall in love and try to request a deferral so they can enjoy life together for a year or two before dying.  There is, of course, no deferral.  And when they are told that fact, oh well, they go ahead and donate their organs and die.<br /><br />I am sorry, it's stupid.  It makes no sense that they'd just willingly go to their deaths with no fuss.  It makes no sense that the state would provide them with an education just so they can be harvested.  It makes no sense that the 'donations' would be made over a period of time, with the expense of medical care and recovery between each hospital stay.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book because it frustrated the bejabbers out of me waiting for someone, ANYONE to say the word 'no'.",2015-08-20

I think the author is a good writer, but the story was just ho-hum. Ishiguro could have brightened this a lot with more tension, more surprise. More interest. In one part he builds up the characters going to see a boat that washed up on shore who knows when. There are pages devoted to this, and then they go to see it (over an hour's drive away). It's a boat. It's washed up on shore. That's it. Ishiguro takes his time telling the reader about how swampy it was, and the barbed wire fence, and the mud, and having to refer often to the sloppy directions--lots and lots of details about all of this. He does this kind of thing time and again. He works on creating something that seems overly significant to the characters, and the reader (me)feels taken advantage of and let down.<br />The narrator, Kathy, and her friends Tommy and Ruth go through life together and they have the usual teenage difficulties, jealousies and ins and outs. It got to be tedious reading, and I would find myself daydreaming while reading. When they are old enough to have sex, they do, but there's no love or tenderness. Just sex. Even when you think Kathy and Tommy are in love, the sex is still just sex.<br />I thought it was pretty unbelievable how much Kathy put up with Ruth and all her devious plotting. Ruth did not come off as likable at all, and I think she was supposed to be.<br />And then there's the back story: SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />The idea is great--Hailsham seems like a nice boarding school and yes, you do feel there's something going on but it never gets creepy. Not that I'm a fan of creepy but this story would have lent itself to a bit of it. The author tries to hint at things that are going on but the hints are so vague. There is never a sense of the darkness in these hints that youdiscover later on in the story.<br />The minor characters like the guardians, Madame, the veterans are all so very shallow and you never get a sense of who they are and what their role is. And springing Miss Emily's and Madame's roles on us at the very end is just blech! (And why are they living together anyway? What is their relationship?)<br /><br />I, too, had the question of why the students just didn't leave--in the whole history of the cloning program, (years and years) no one ever left. Why not? The Hailsham students were--some of them like Ruth--independent thinkers. She even imagined herself working in an office. Why didn't she leave? I did not get the sense that they were indoctrinated into thinking that being doners was who they were. They had access to music, literature, art. So the question of why no one has ever left is what I am left with at the end of this book. I don't feel the author did a good job of explaining the students' thinking and reasoning on this.",2015-07-08

This could have just as easily been a book about a group of orphans growing up in a boring private school with careers assigned out early in life.  Maybe the book is a metaphor for highly controlling societies? (Although the laid back schooling environment would not seem to reflect those societies.)  Also, while there is some discussion about the characters being &#34;normal&#34; and &#34;complete&#34;, they all acted as if they were medically sedated with an unnaturally low amount of happiness, fear, passion, or love in anything they did.  (Even a group of orphans slated for boring careers would have more anxiety than this group of characters who have been sentenced to death).  The relationship between Kathy and Tommy was particularly flat and uninteresting.<br /><br />No offense to baseball fans, but the whole book was like listening to a baseball game on the radio.  It is relaxing and maybe just keeps your interest, but you probably won't miss much by skipping a bit.",2015-07-07

All I saw were short excerpts of rave reviews littered with the words &#34;moving&#34; and &#34;disturbing&#34;. Then, when I started I found it as a story of children at a nice boarding school in England that appear to live in some kind of futuristic version of the 1990s. What could possibly be disturbing about that?<br /><br />The matter a fact nature of Kathy's narration and almost childlike way of telling her story by constantly going back on herself and explaining the structure of her existence with a kind of nonchalance that can only come from being born into a messed up system makes the story of clones nothing but disturbing. These characters are built to die, to sustain other people. Yet, they love each other, listen to music, and have fits of rage. The ending section of the book made my heart soar, and then broke it. What an awesome story.<br /><br />However, I did find some of the sections in the middle where it was just Ruth being vaguely mean and Tommy not breaking up with her even though he should to be kind hard to get through.

She builds up a history between the characters, and doesn’t shove them into bed the second they meet. I will say however, Jennifer does a fantastic job with the hot and heavy scenes which are splashed throughout the book. They are worth the wait I promise!<br /><br />Celeste is a business woman through and through, she doesn’t let any man stand in her way. She is fresh out of college with an ambitious career ahead of her, but has to take a vacation to Hawaii. Here is where she meets to lovable Kanoe. Kanoe comes and sweeps the strong willed Celeste off her feet, as she has never been to Hawaii and is your typical tourist. One failed surfing attempt is all it takes to drag these two together, and they make one hot couple.<br /><br />While yes, this is novel has some definite erotic tones, Jennifer is able to built a dynamic between Kanoe and Celeste. Kanoe while a macho surf man, has a side that is soft and vulnerable. He’s been burned before and refuses to let any woman get in his way. He battles with himself throughout the novel, it’s like his is wanting Celeste to fail.<br /><br />Celeste doesn’t want to give up her job, but she finds herself quickly falling for Kanoe. What’s a girl to do? Leave the pantsuits, skyline, and high heels behind to stay on an island? Or does she go back home to a building career and many opportunities in the future?<br /><br />I’m going to the dark side here, and saying hot much I loved the surfboard and lava scenes. Holy cow…WOW!<br /><br />Jennifer, great job on bringing together two characters who would never meet. They created a unique story (a hot one) and I was in tears at the end. I wanted so much for their love to last, I re-read sections over and over because they were so good. I would love to see these two continue onto another book in the future,I see so much opportunity for them.<br /><br />In the end I was highly satisfied with this read. It didn’t drag, it pulled the reader through the book…and let’s face it I felt like a voyeur looking in. Fabulous, hot, exhilarating read!",2015-03-17

They are all full of gimmicks; a world populated by zombies, or a moon fallen to the earth, and stock characters going through fantastical characters. Even 1968 and Brave New World are about political situations, satire, warnings. This book is so beautiful because it is not just about the dystopia. It's not just about this strange future world. The world is only a backdrop, a space in which the characters can move and grow and weep. This book is about people, not places. The prose is simple, the words quiet, the progress slow. There aren't any fancy action scenes or descriptions. And yet it is heartbreaking, intensely moving, and captures the truth; essential truths about the nature of the human race, of this world we live in, which is the prerequisite for every great book. It is very, very beautiful, not because of the outside trappings, but because of its glowing core. It is powerful, in a quietly stirring way, which sometimes can do more than all the trumpets and the fanfare in the world.<br /><br />There comes a time when a piece of creation moves you deeply, changes you a little inside...and these shiftings are worth all of the flashy action scenes, the glitter and the gilt. It is like the diamond in the rough among the river pebbles, or the genuine article in a shop full of cheap imitations.<br /><br />Take the same plot, and the same world, and the same characters, and have another author write the book, and it might be transformed into something completely inane and pointless. Sometimes it's not about the story you're telling, but how you tell it. And those two things are the same; identical stories told with different twists on them can become completely different.",2014-10-01

While this (in my opinion) is usually true, there are exceptions. This book is told in the first person and has practically no dialogue at all. But it’s a great book. The narrator grabbed my attention at the beginning and never let go. The mundane day-to-day happenings are realistically portrayed, but behind the sentences and between the lines there is a sense of developing mystery. The mystery is unveiled slowly as the story develops – and the final revelation is not so shocking as it is troublesome. Unanswered questions are left hanging as to how such a cruel life can be considered acceptable, even normal.

So I have been intending to read one of his works for some time. Yesterday I decided the time had come. Unfortunately Kindle and its so-called reviewers ruined the experience.<br />Like many people, I had seen the film version &#34;Remains of the Day&#34; with Anthony Hopkins. Nevertheless, since it had been some time ago, I was ready to experience it anew in its original literary form.<br />But after reading Diane Schirf's excruciatingly detailed retelling of all but the last few pages, I figured what was the point and, disaappointed, decided to pass.<br />Not to be deterred, I moved on to &#34;Never Let Go&#34; but not until submitting a review of Diane Schirf's review hoping Kindle might begin screening reviews for more than just obvious spoilers.<br />Before reading &#34;Never Let Go&#34; I read a few reviews including the one by Steve Koss. The effect of these reviews was even worse. To reveal that &#34;Never Let Go&#34; is about cloning as seen through the eyes of a clone is a disservice to the author, potential readers and even Kindle.<br />The literary strstegem of the book is to give the reader a view of life through another's eyes while only allowing the reader to realize gradually that they are the eyes of a clone.<br />This is a thought provoking book that will retain its value. Eventually it will become generally known that it is about cloning. Then, like Ullyses, it will take its place among those books that are more talked about than read.<br />In the meantime the author's stratagem makes it a pretty good read for those who have not had the secret shoved down their throats by incompetent reviewers.<br />More and more of these &#34;tell everything but the last page&#34; essays are appearing in Kindle in the guise of reviews. They are not reviews. The purpose of a review is to assess the merit of a work by identifying its qualities and deficiencies. These essays are the work of frustrated bloviators who lack the imagination for original creation and so bask in the reflected light of those who possess it by passing off some, but not all, of the author's inspiration as their own original thought. They do not even rise to the level of Cliff Notes, which at least serve as teaching aids for students who are either too lazy or too stupid to glean the content and significance of a book on their own.<br />After reading the Kindle review about this book, especially Steve Koss's, I bought the book anyway but quickly became bored.

I'm in the love camp. It's a book about relationships and about coping with major problems more than it is about the science behind the story. It's also about prejudice, especially the convenienceof prejudice. I wonder how many stars Thomas Jefferson would have given this book, if he was alive to review it. The bigotry in this novel reminded me of the way Jefferson opposed slavery, but kept slaves and even had a long affair with a woman he owned. I don't want to reveal too much about Kazuo Ishiguro's book, but I think I can say the form of bigotry in this story helps the general population of the book's England even more than slavery helped America's economy in its early days – with the same type of moral implication.<br /><br />My wife and I watched the film version of Never Let Me Go on the same day I finished the book, so everything was still clear in my mind. The film was overall a good translation from page to screen. There were times when I thought something important was missing, but each time I checked with my wife, who hadn't read the book, she understood what was happening. I do wish the film had emphasized the relationship between Kathy and Ruth a bit more. Ruth was a more positive character in the book, so her actions and feelings of guilt were less upsetting in the film.<br /><br />I'm not going to write a synopsis in this review, because I don't want to include any spoilers. I'll just say the story made me think. It would be a wonderful choice for a book club.<br /><br />Steve Lindahl – author of Motherless Soul and White Horse Regressions",2014-08-02

Reviewing his books is always a challenge, partly because it is hard to discuss any of them without giving away the plot to some degree -- no, they don't get together in \\""The Remains Of The Day,\\"" no, you never find out what is going in in \\""The Unconsoled,\\"" and yes, \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" is about human clones raised so that their organs can be transplanted into \\""real\\"" people.<br /><br />Don't worry, however.  Knowing that will not have spoiled this novel for you.  That scenario is merely the starting-point for a wonderfully immersive reading experience that is classical Ishiguro -- a dreamy, sometimes melancholy novel in which the banal surface of everyday lives, thoughts and conversations is pierced by sudden glimpses of hideous cruelty and indifference, sudden revelations of rage and despair.<br /><br />Many reviewers on this page have approached the book as sci-fi, and have generally been disappointed that the story seems too simple or hackneyed, or that the vision of human nature is too bleak.<br /><br />But Ishiguro is far too clever a writer to offer something as easily categorized as science fiction.  Indeed, \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" is not set in some dystopian future, but in the Britain of the 1980s, the era of Thatcher governments and socialist town councils, concrete tower blocks, dreary New Towns, institutionalized inefficiency and music cassettes.  It is a kind of parallel universe in which the past, present and future flow together, mingling today's fears with dread of what is to come and regret for what has passed.<br /><br />This, too, is classical Ishiguro country, the emotional landscape of \\""The Remains Of The Day\\"" and \\""The Unconsoled.\\""  The novel is narrated by Kathy, one of the clones, whose task is to provide care for other clones as they pass through successive \\""donations\\"" to their final \\""completion.\\""  Serene and dutiful, Kathy chronicles the lives of her fellow-clones, which are as dehumanized as whoever is in charge can make them.  There are very few points in the novel where \\""real people\\"" express their sincere opinions.  Most of those who do interact with the main characters are in the position of guardians, and in fact the world of \\""real people\\"" is largely faceless and unknowable to the clones -- except that, raised to have a childlike acceptance of their fate, they also develop a child's-eye instinct for the truth, and this is what makes their story so pathetic and so moving.<br /><br />The world of the \\""real people\\"" is thus also unknowable to the reader.  We have to guess what that larger society is like, what the 80s and 90s might have been like for people as alienated as Kathy, Tommy and the other clones, how that parallel universe might have existed, in some sense, even though we didn't realize it at the time.  We have to ask ourselves, could we really have been so cruel?  Were we really so indifferent?<br /><br />\\""Never Let Me Go\\"" is a powerful novel.  It carries with it a sense of gathering darkness as it rolls along, exploring questions that trouble us all in the second decade of the 21st Century.  As with other Ishiguro novels, the real revelation is that the book is not about what it seems to be about.  Each reader will have to decide what the real subject of the novel is.<br /><br />Nothing else to say, except that this is a wonderful book which will stay with you long after you turn the final page.

As someone who has raised and otherwise dealt with small children, I find it hard to believe that adult caretakers regularly exposed to bright, amiable children, especially caretakers who have especially volunteered for such services, could spend years with them and still feel revulsion whenever they saw them just because they knew what their eventual fate was.

That dissatisfaction stays with you, just like the story. Anyway, after reading the reviews, I found myself looking at the docility as the main element of horror in the plot. Others have attributed the blandness of the main characters to the idea of their being sub-human, and someone wondered if more intense emotions hadn't been somehow removed to facilitate their use as donors. I hadn't considered that, but it warrants discussion.

The author packs the story full of vivid imagery and meticulous description of the main character's thoughts and experiences. The interpersonal relationships presented in the book were also very well-illustrated; the author seems to have a good understanding of how people relate to each other, the subtelties of communication between friends and lovers, and how and why relationships change when they do.<br /><br />The relationships were written so well, that the fact that the author seems to have completely misjudged huge segments of human nature bothers me even more than it would otherwise. The story, seen as a whole, is about a small group of people who go through their lives passively accepting an unjust, unethical fate, and making no effort to make any decisions about their own course in life. For all his understanding about very intimate facets of human nature, the author somehow doesn't seem to understand the fact that people value their own free will. They value their own autonomy, and they always have. Watching the characters in this book go from one stage of their life to the next without ever once considering taking more than a vaguely indirect control of their fate is a frustrating experience. There doesn't seem to be any in-story justification for this behavior, and so it chafes. Even in their teenage years, which are described in intricate detail, there was never an inclination to rebel against authority. All of this conflicts with my own experience of myself and humanity in general.<br /><br />The worldbuilding suffers from the same problem. In real life, medical ethics are studied and paid attention to by the professional world. Ethical committees and literature exist because people find them important. Yet in the world of this book, where vastly unethical medical procedures are carried out on a world-wide scale, the ethics question gets hand-wavedaway as if it were a non-issue. But even in science fiction, the worldbuilding has to make sense to be a good setting for the story. Even as awful and selfish as human beings can be sometimes, there is always another side of human nature, a compassionate and thoguhtful side, that asserts itself in real life. But that side wasn't represented anywhere in this story.<br /><br />Overall, I don't regret reading the book. The pacing was slow, there were no exciting events, and it was a rather leisurely read. The writing is lovely, the characters extremely well-developed, the relationships well-written. But the choices the characters make are not believable, nor is the world they live in.",2013-10-04

Kathy had long ago put this idyllic past behind her, but when two of her Hailsham friends come back into her life, she stops resisting the pull of memory.<br /><br />And so, as her friendship with Ruth is rekindled, and as the feelings that long ago fueled her adolescent crush on Tommy begin to deepen into love, Kathy recalls their years at Hailsham. She describes happy scenes of boys and girls growing up together, unperturbed - even comforted - by their isolation. But she describes other scenes as well: of discord and misunderstanding that hint at a dark secret behind Hailsham's nurturing facade. With the dawning clarity of hindsight, the three friends are compelled to face the truth about their childhood-and about their lives now.<br /><br />A tale of deceptive simplicity, Never Let Me Go slowly reveals an extraordinary emotional depth and resonance - and takes its place among Kazuo Ishiguro's finest work.<br /><br />In general I don't read science fiction novels.  They just aren't my cup of tea.  I decided to take a chance with this novel because it was relatively short and the description didn't portray the book as high science fiction as say Dune or other books of that type.  It starts off with Kathy telling the story of her and her friends days at a British boarding school, Hailsham.  At first the book seems like it really is just going to be kind of a contemporary fiction rather than science fiction and I just couldn't figure out where it was going.  I want to make note that I had read NO previous reviews of this book so I had no preconceived notions about what the book was about.<br /><br />Slowly the truth is revealed.  Why are the student's at Hailsham?  Why are they so encouraged to pursue Art?  Why is Art so important?  What is really going on?  This is where the book just got way too difficult for me.  I can't say much more other than this is very disturbing.  I actually tagged it as horror because it horrified me!  I don't want to reveal any details other than novel ended up being very hard to digest and I just wanted to get it over with.  It left a very bad taste in my mouth.

I think it was well-done and could have been explored deeper, but I guess I'm a sucker for this kind of novel that, while terribly sad, makes me feel something so extreme.

However, the story was simply not believable.  Apparently by the end of the story this practice has been going on for at least a couple of decades, and there is no mention of any kind of rebellion by any of the clones.  They know for most of their lives that they are being raised to have their organs harvested, and yet everyone just accepts it.  The clones are raised in a secluded boarding school, but they are well educated about the outside world and have the freedom to go into town when they get older.  Eventually they care for other clones who are in the process of donating, and they are allowed to drive a car and travel great distances.<br /><br />The idea that such a large group of well-educated people who are well-acquainted with the outside world would willingly donate their organs simply because they are told to is ridiculous.  None of the characters ever question the ethics of being required to donate or consider trying to escape or fight back.  Nobody complains about it.  People talk furtively about asking to get a deferral for a few years, but that's as far as it goes.  There is no evidence of brainwashing or trying to rationalize it with religion or anything like that.  Apparently clones are just extremely passive about their own deaths.<br /><br />Also, the way that this whole process works makes no sense.  The children are raised in a very nice boarding school.  Then somewhere in the late teens or thereabouts they leave the school and spend a couple of year hanging around at some dilapidated cottages not really doing anything.  Eventually they care for the other donors as they make up to four separate donations before dying.  Each donation has a long recovery period in between- it isn't clear how long, but it seems like months, maybe loner.  In a dystopian world where they raise clones solely to harvest their organs, you'd think they would be economical and harvest everything at once, but instead they patch up the donor and care for them until they are well enough to do it all over again.  How does that make any sense?  Leaving morality to the side, all of the resources invested in each clone would make the organs incredibly expensive.  This makes absolutely no economic sense, and economics would be the whole reason for the process.<br /><br />The characters and dialog are bland, and the whole story is told in snippets by an irritating, introspective narrator who keeps using phrases that indicate she is just around the corner from revealing something really important that happened- but then you get to the event and it's flat and unexciting. I only kept reading because I thought that at SOME point a really interesting backstory would come into focus with some crazy, provocative ideas, but that was sadly not the case.

It also got me remembering my past experiences and got me thinking and needing to write.<br /><br />I have often told my students that the death knell for a writer is indifference and being ignored. It is far worse than the ability to inflame, incense, infuriate and other in-terms of the negative nature. I'm thinking of this because of my reaction to Ishiguro - I have come out of his books feeling like I've run an unsatisfying race or trekked up a particularly arduous trail and not entirely certain of what I've gotten from the experience. Certainly not simple enjoyment - nothing about his books are simple. Nor have they been uplifting (with the exception of some of the stories in his \\""Nocturnes\\"" the one book I have unequivocally loved).  But there is something about every one of them that is compelling and in case of Never Let Me Go, haunting and troubling.

I remember feeling the same way about When We Were Orphans - which I heard as an audio-book - even if I found so many elements puzzling, even downright bizarre.

Even when it's hard work, he draws you completely into the half-formed worlds of his narrators (virtually everything I've read by him has been in first person).

Kathy H. has had several pieces admitted, but Tommy has a problem with anger and never seems to put his best into his work.  But Kathy loves Tommy and sees the soul that he can hide to others.  It seems the start of many a novel.  But these children are raised as clones to serve as the repository of spare organs for normal people, people who actually have souls.  In their 20's, the students will make donations, usually \\""completing\\"" in three donations..  The unspoken fear is the survival of the body, kept alive on life support, conscious at some deep level, but existing in a dark never land.  The students believe that donation (of organs) will come to be delayed for three years if the art shows that two of them are true soul mates.  They go in search of the school authorities with Tommy's new art so that Kathy H and he will be granted a reprieve.  But there is not such program.  The art was gathered in an effort to prove to the world that they do in fact have souls.<br /><br />Such a world exists in the hearts of evil in all times.  This is a great allegory of the minds of those people who believe that any group of humans is somehow sub-human, only fit to provide the needs of regular people.  This book comes at a point in which created people could conceivably be the next group of beings not granted human status.  Kathy H is one of my favorite characters in fiction.  She is a superior woman who has taken as her job to care for those in the process of having their organs harvested.

It is SO well-written, you won't even remember the author is a man. Mr. Ishiguro gives a perfect voice for his characters, that is for sure. Kathy, the narrator, is a somewhat shy girl, who's always left aside by her bossy friend, Ruth. And the VOICE the narrator has is SO REAL I've often got myself wondering if that's what a real author is supposed to be like, to write like.<br />The book tells the story of Kathy, Ruth and Tommy - three people who are born \\""special\\"". They are clones, made to donate their organs once they reach a certain age.<br />You would think the story would revolve around that - maybe they decide to rebel and flee, maybe they decide to kill themselves for love, or something like that. Well, surprise, that doesn't even cross their minds. Instead of focusing on the drama such a terrible predetermined fate could cause, Ishiguro focuses on the characters' lives and on how they deal with the inevitable.<br />The story begins at Hailsham, a school for special people, where lots and lots of children are raised and educated for the future. However, they are never told directly about their fate, and that prompts one of their guardians to say they 'have been told but not told' about what's in store for them.<br />The first part is pretty boring, and nothing really happens. In fact, it is just a way of presenting life at Hailsham. The children have no parents, and that isn't mentioned once. Where do they come from? Who are they? Why are they special? We are left wondering. But we have 'Madame' and her gallery. Her mysterious gallery. The children at hailsham are supposed to 'create art'. The best 'art' is taken away by 'Madame' to her 'gallery'. And that's one of the most important things in the book.<br /><br />The second part shows Ruth, Kathy and Tommy at 'the Cottages'. It is somewhat of an intermediary place - a place they go before they start their training to become carers (the people who take care of donors, before they become donors themselves). There the teenagers discover sex, and some form of love. They struggle with the agonies of youth, and they fight and argue among themselves over stupid things. It is good to be young.<br />In the second part we are presented to the concept of 'possible', and that's when we discover the children are clones. Not clones of normal people, but clones of 'winos, prostitutes, criminals'. In fact, it is at that point you realise WHY they've never tried to run away or rebel (that isn't even mentioned in the book). At least in my opinion, since they know what they are, and where they come from, they realise they have no place in the 'real' world, beause they are not 'real' people. They were MADE, not born, for the single purpose of donating their organs. And that's what they do.<br /><br />The third part is where it all gets interesting. They begin donating their organs, but there is little focus on it. We learn of the pain the donors have to go through, and of how destroyed the carers become after a while, but that's pretty much it. We are thrown directly into the feelings of the main characters, something that never happens in the first two parts - we only get hints of what was going on.<br />It is at the point we realise how deep these characters are, how REAL they are. At first we notice they are very flat, but that is only because they are still children. Ishiguro presents us with a real portrait of the uncertainties of infancy, the sufferings of youth, and then we get to see real, developed adults, in action.<br /><br />Although the book is marvelously written, and Ishiguro is surely a Virtuoso when it comes to writing (I've never read his other works, though), the book is very boring in itself. As I said at the beginning of the review, this is the kind of book that wins prizes, not the kind that becomes a best-seller. When it comes to good literature, this book is one of a kind.<br />Here's an example: the book is a sort of memoir written by Kath, very unpresumptuous, very simple. It is something she feels she NEEDS to write down before she 'completes' (i.e., dies after donating too many organs).<br />Since it is a memoir, you are taken through her memories, often in a very disorderly way. She remembers something, and that makes her remember something else, and then she remembers what she was talking about, etc. It may be weird at first, but that is precisely how our memory works, is it not? The fact that an author is able to capture that process in words is simply fascinating to me.<br />And that is not all. As I've already said, Ishiguro creates very REAL characters. At first you think he is simply writing things his readers can relate to, but then you realise that's not the case. You can relate to his characters because they are pretty much real people. I think I am repeating myself already, and I don't want to make this anymore longer than it already is, so here goes a TL;DR:<br /><br />TOO LONG; DIDN'T READ - If you want an entertaining book, full of action, adventure and emotion, this IS NOT the book you want to read.<br />If you want a book where you can savour literature at its best, where you can FEEL what's going on and learn how to write properly (or, in my case, just be jealous because you're probably never gonna be that good), then please, GET THIS BOOK.

Then they had a film evening, watched the screen version and didn't like that either. Being the Contrary Mary that I am, when I saw a bargain copy of Never let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro in my local bookstore I had to grab it and read from cover to cover, trying to understand how and why it could have been Booker prize short listed. The answer is simple - it's a masterpiece of subtlety (I still don't understand why the reading group didn't like it). I do realise I'm the last person on the planet to discover this book.<br />Ishiguro's world only differs to reality in one respect; the ethics of cloning and transplants. This novel is all about the coming of age of three key individuals for whom that difference is material. Their innocence and fatalism had a devastating effect on me. Bred and nurtured for a purpose, these young people move towards their end and 'complete' without coercion.<br />Religion has no part in this tale and the time period through which events travel is contemporary. That shook me even more with music, cars and cassette tapes giving time-stamps that moved the start of this alternative reality back to post WWII. If we had emerged from that era with a different ethos, if certain attitudes to genetics and superior / inferior race had prevailed, then who knows?<br />I have to confess I did itch to know the nitty gritty details of being a donor, the fourth donation and completion, but this novel is all the more powerful for avoiding the specifics. Ishiguro does get painfully close to explaining when Tommy and Kathy meet Miss Emily and Madame in their search for deferral, but he recovers the enigmatic delivery style in good time.<br />An analogous interpretation of Never Let Me Go's fatalistic overall theme is not to be recommended unless you're in the company of great friends and good wine, and can face the possibility of life's futility.<br />Not a feel good book, but nevertheless a wondrous read.but nevertheless a wondrous read.",2012-06-01

It is difficult to say much more without revealing a key spoiler, so I'll just say what you learn in the first ten pages or so of the book. Kathy is a \\""carer,\\"" who looks after weak or demoralized \\""donors\\"" who generally donate four times (sometimes fewer) before \\""completing.\\"" Other reviews have called the secret behind these terms \\""unsettling\\"" or \\""shocking,\\"" but I guessed it right away.<br /><br />WHY I WANTED TO GIVE THIS BOOK FOUR STARS: Although I was disappointed that I'd so easily guessed the big secret, I was still blown away by how immaculate the writing is. Kathy's voice is clear and resonant, and she speaks with the kind of language that is deceptively simple. Kathy's no-frills prose is not an easy trick for writers to pull off. At the same time, it means the tale only has as much oomph as the plot.<br /><br />WHY I WANTED TO GIVE THIS BOOK THREE STARS: A story is only as good as its characters, and Ishiguro has created some fully-realized students here. The traditional love triangle of Ruth, Tommy, and Kathy interacts with more than a handful of teachers and peers, and they are all equally well-drawn. However, our protagonists, although richly human, are not particularly likeable. Kathy is almost entirely ineffectual; she exists foremost as a passive observer, and only secondly as the bland pog that bounces between Ruth and Tommy. Ruth is manipulative, selfish, and a habitual liar. Tommy is so socially maladjusted that, on multiple occasions, he even gets on the nerves of everyone else. (Still liked him the most, though.)<br /><br />There are really two parts to the tale. The love/friendship triangle is the core of the book, and although beautifully rendered, I didn't find it especially interesting, unique, or moving. This is probably because it is supposed to be viewed through the second part to the tale, which is the world in which the characters live -- a world of \\""donors.\\"" This world is left intentionally vague for much of the book. Part of me feels that this is partly because too closely examining the rules of Kathy's world will reveal some plot holes (I'd say much more on the subject if it wouldn't spoil the plot). Sadly, even the small doses of information that the reader IS given are parceled too conservatively, and Ishiguro resorts to a character, in a long speech at the end, revealing a few of the lingering questions readers might have.<br /><br />WHY I CHOSE TO GIVE THIS BOOK TWO STARS: The book ends with a quality of poeticism that is rarely encountered in books these days. I found it quite touching, but it also felt like an emotional smokescreen. The book moved me to think -- which is also wonderful -- but after I DID think, I realized that I could find no real value to Ishiguro's tale. Whatever you want to say that the book is about -- humanity, morality, the soul, friendship, hope, love, family -- none of those interpretations has been able to truly mesh, for me, the two halves of the book.<br /><br />There is the Shocking Horrifying Truth of Kathy's world, and then there is the fumbling, bumbling guesswork of children learning how to be people and people learning how to be. The Secret is so vague, and is referred to so obliquely by the characters, that it is not entirely believable nor does it carry the weight of allegory. It wasn't used enough to move, change, or confront the characters, which made it feel almost tacked-on and unnecessary. The second part -- Kathy's upbringing with Tommy and Ruth -- is (as I've said) wonderfully done, but that also doesn't change the fact that it is a basic love triangle, not that much different from what you might find on a soap opera or school-age drama. No new ground was broken, in other words.<br /><br />Stirred together correctly, these two elements might have made for a more rewarding (if not still derivative) tale. The unconvincing dichotomy of it, though, reveals more acutely the flaws in each half. And so, although I really admired the clarity of Ishiguro's prose, it felt like it was used to tell only half of a story.ichotomy of it, though, reveals more acutely the flaws in each half.

Set in an alternative 1990s England, the reader meets 31-year-old Cathy who narrates the stories events. She realistically reminisces over her days at a seemingly idyllic boarding school called Hailsham, focusing on the love triangle relationship between herself and her two best friends, Tommy and Ruth. Although the plot tends to jump around from story to story in no real chronological order, I felt Kathy's narration made the story more personal, as she follows a typically human train of thought where one memory reminds her of something to evoke another memory. Ishiguro does a great job of exploring the human mind and how memory changes as a person grows older. By the end of the book, I felt I knew Cathy, and I cried with her at the devastating and inevitable ending.  You will want to keep reading this book. Ishiguro keeps the reader hooked by gradually revealing important information that gives the story its meaning. From the very beginning when Cathy introduces herself as a carer, she assumes you know more than you do.  You may be confused at first, but eventually the facts come out and you feel a sense of change along with the characters themselves. The book gradually shifts from innocent to dark, without you even having to think about it. I felt like I was a student at Hailsham myself, about so accept my fate with the others. The events, feelings, and relationships are so real (mixed with a touch of science-fiction-esque fantasy) that you can't help sympathizing with the characters and feeling like you know them.   I can't talk too much about the plot without giving it away, and part of what makes this book so special the first time is learning the surprising truths in the characters' lives along with them. But let me just say this. The book's overall plot and personal anecdotes within are entertaining, unique, and real, unlike anything I have ever read. The book might seemlike a simple read; it's easy to understand and simply written. But when you finish, there is a sense of something deeper, something deeply moving and almost disturbing. Ishiguro touches on many themes that speak to us all. What makes us human? To what extent should we be humane? Should we use science for our benefit even at the extent of other living beings? Should we try to change our fate or just accept it? And of course, he touches on basic human emotions and experiences like love, loss, change, friendship, loyalty, memory, the loss of innocence, etc. The list goes on and on. Point is, you will finish this book and have a lot to think about.  It is rare that I have read a book that is so simultaneously entertaining and thought-provoking. I couldn't put it down. The book is haunting and sad, and I know it will stick with me for years to come. The plot is well thought out, the character development impeccable, the sense of realistic voice incredible.

This novel is layered like a rich cake, with multiple relationships in a complicated triangle, love, hate, trust, life, death, and self examination. The story is told by Kathy H. who throughout the novel, recalls tales of her time at Hailsham.<br />  Hailsham, a boarding school set in the picturesque English country side, is home to most of Kathy's memories, especially those of Ruth and Tommy, her closest friends at the school.<br />The novel takes a darker turn as slowly the fate of all of Hailsham's students becomes apparent to the reader. \\""Never Let me Go\\"" is not a novel about \\""the system\\"" or escape or even freedom or even death. No, this is a novel about life. Many may be surprised that no one questions their existence or their death, surely someone in that position would fight, right? Ishiguro did a marvelous job here not getting lost in those details.<br />  Something to love is how little you know throughout the story, and how slowly bits of information are revealed but never immense detail. I think this helps the reader really identify with Kathy, as she never really sees the big picture either. Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy are lost I in their own world and there is no other. Why do you question your life when nothing else exists?<br />  Ruth, is representative of all that is hopeful in life. Ruth, constantly dreaming and never truly wanting confirmation of the truth, just content to know that maybe, just maybe, something full of joy awaits her around the next turn. Ruth, is a stark contrast to Tommy who is the embodiment of doubt in this story. From a young age Tommy has struggled and fought, even with in himself, with things he didn't even understand. Tommy's dreams were so much more than just dreams, Tommy honestly had hopes that his life could hold something more, could mean something.<br />  Finally, we have Kathy, the protagonist and from her perspective the story is told. Kathy is the finite level headed one who sees life very black and white, and is not one who is easily swept up in emotion. That is not to say that Kathy is without emotion, it is there, but I believe the realistic side of Kathy struggles to keep the bubbles of emotion that rise to surface every to often securely hidden from the world's view. In the end, it seems, Kathy seems to even question the existence of her own soul. Only as she poses this question to another does it seem she is also examining it within herself.<br />  Sometimes, I found myself questioning the reality of the interactions the characters had. Some instances just seemed a little too cold and matter of fact, but then I had to remind myself that I was not a student at Hailsham and I have quite a different perspective of my life, of my possible future. In fact, I have no clue how growing up in Hailsham would have formed me into a different person, emotionally, and that is one of the beautiful things about the novel.<br />  \\""Never Let Me Go\\"" isn's about the plot or the big finale, it's all about the journey. And what a journey it is. Full of question about the meaning of life, each humans function, the value of a soul, and the eerie look at just how inhumane humans can be when it comes to regard for another life. Through all three characters we are given a different perspective of how to see and how to validate their own world and their own life. One could continue to wish Ishiguro had thickened the plot but to them I say, it's really all about the emotional journey isn't it? And while the plot could be fascinating it is definitely more intensely focused on friendship, love, life, and deep soul searching.<br />  Definitely, one of the best reads I have picked up this year and I will definitely be suggesting this book to others. I am interested to find out others opinions as I feel this book is to be interpreted differently by the individual reader.

In contrast, the characters of the book don't wonder so much about the mystery of their lives so much as the question of whether or not they're able to just delay their doom.<br /><br />Unlike many dystopian stories that invite us to compare the main injustice of the society with injustices occurring in our current society, the emphasis on this book seems to be the reaction of the clones in this book to their destinies. What I mean is that normally in a dystopian story the thing that makes it dystopian, the idea of cloning someone and taking their organs, or the idea of editing people's use of language (1984), is the main point of the book, telling us we should look in our own society for places of exploitation of some small group of people for the benefit of the majority, or for censure, etc. I didn't get that from this book at all, which surprised my expectations of the dystopian genre. It seemed like the clone thing was thematically irrelevant and distracting, a red herring for the main point, which is that people miss out on chances to love, and there's always a sense of loss, especially lost time, lost love, and people hope to just delay that loss but they don't fight its inevitability.  Ruth was excellently drawn and her land-mine filled dialogues with everyone revealed Ishiguro's understanding of the subtly mean, jealous aspects of human nature. The portrayal of Tommy was confusing and weird. He seemed like an autistic, unknowable ghost until Garfield brought him to life in the movie. I get the sense that Ishiguro is obsessed with the idea of love that is lost for no good reason, because people are too weak or fearful or docile to go for it, that Tommy as a character made so little sense because Ishiguro didn't really have a concrete object in mind for his lost love, just the idea that it was missing. In the movie they include a scene where Tommy begins to scream and I think this makes a lot of sense in terms of finally acknowledging the injustice of the clone thing but this whole closure is absent from the book.

I read the Kindle version of this book, so I cannot accurately estimate how many pages shorter this book should have been. But I will say I almost stopped reading, as so many pages were filled with useless text.

The writer had a tendency to break up the narrator's memories of conversations with trivialities meant to remind us that the conversation was a memory - but all it truly accomplished was the interruption of the book's flow.

In summary, it is amazing to me that someone can conjure up such a brilliant plot and then ruin it with amateurish writing. I heard they are making this into a movie, and I expect it to be very good, as long as Ishiguro doesn't write the screenplay.",2010-11-16

I feel like it was written as a product of the time period and society it describes, so Kathy went into little-to-no detail about what it means to be a donor and what it means to be a student at Hailsham.<br /><br />I was not a big fan of Ishiguro's writing style. Nor was I a fan of the way the plot was constructed. I thought the book would be more about the mechanisms which made the Hailsham students (and others) donors. Instead, the book is about Kathy reminiscing (in no particular order) about her time at Hailsham and her relationship with Tommy and Ruth.<br /><br />The characters annoyed me as well; mostly Ruth. Ruth was an irritating, pompous, selfish, know-it-all b*tch. There's really no other way to describe her. I felt no compassion for any characters in the book, just annoyance with Ruth.<br /><br />This is a book that I think will actually do well in movie form.

I think that the sadness one senses when reading the reviews of those who love this book is that they perhaps dimly realize the real secret (I don't think this is really a spoiler): It proports to be about an alternate reality. It is actually much closer to the world we live in than we can know.    Thus, the correct answer to the question, \\""Why don't they run away?\\"" is \\""Yes, why don't we?\\"" Perhaps with the followup: \\""But where could we go?\\""    What we really see in Never Let Me Go and in our world is that the inhabitants are wrapped in a web that they can't escape or even be fully aware of. Monstrous things are happening and all one can do is try to live a normal life in spite of them.    It is important to the mood of the novel that the characters don't fully grasp their situation as they are drowning in an invisible and irresistible river as it sweeps them towards their doom.

It's a terrific well writen horror story without the bloodiness ever actually being described.  Children, with no mention of parents, are raised in a boarding school by caregivers and teachers. They are given a cultured, perfect closed environment. The reader gradually gets to know these young people are special clones, destined to become \\""doners\\"" - of bodily organs! And they are perfectly contented with their mission in life. Quite horrific!   It is wonderfully detailed, with tantalizing slow emergence of what the story is all about.  Briefly - it is told in the first person by one of these \\""doners\\"" whoes awful destiny is delayed by her \\""carer\\"" status for others who are donating - and suffering, and it ends mercifully just before her own donations begin. Believe me - you've had enough!  Why do I say it is bewildering and tiresome? - because page after page consists of endless monologue and small interactions among the \\""students\\"" much like the windyness of Marcel Proust but without his marvelous imagery. There is no poetry here. It leaves me empty and horrified by the story. Unfortunately I don't thrive on horror novels, even though there is no violence here. None at all - unless it's that dreadful silent violence of the spirit which you do feel here and will suffer nightmares from. I think the last 1/3 of the book is better because you finally know what is going on and the dialogue and description is very meaningful.  5 stars for Kazuo Ishiguro's originality and marvelous progression as the situation's true meaning unfolds.  3 stars for the (to me) colorless prose. story.
