US,53016000,R3BGXA2MT3VVM5,006056492X,837891915,Slaughterhouse Five,Books,5,0,0,N,Y,"Memory and Desire.","I think young people may have trouble understanding this book, which is about the experience of life. Told with great compassion, Vonnegut, in fact and in fiction both, is a mature man looking back on the tragedies he saw in his youth. Being \\""unstuck in time\\"" can be seen as a metaphor for intrusive post-traumatic memories, and dissociated dreams, both of which happen to someone who has undergone great trauma. Vonnegut had the horror of his mother committing suicide when he was home on leave in WWII, and going from there to being a prisoner of war, seeing his friends shot and being forced to dig for rotting bodies in Dresden.  <br />  Ethan Hawkes does a superior job of reading the book, gentle and without irony. I recommend his audiobook. ( Although I think they put pictures of World War One soldiers on the cover for some strange reason. )",2005-03-31

Vonnegut uses his talent to tell me, in a way that I can comprehend, about things I have a difficult time understanding.   This book is about war.  This book is about death.  One of my favorite passages describes the following: Darwin and war are both successful only with mounting corpses.     It was my first Vonnegut book and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",2011-02-05
