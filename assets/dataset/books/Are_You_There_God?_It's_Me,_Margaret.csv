I never had a training bra, I went to a full blown 36C in a few months and stayed there!  I never fretted over getting my period before or after the other girls, I was first in line!  As a result, I went through puberty before everyone else, and they all stayed creepy little kids while I was the blossoming nymphet (once I got past that fat stage).  Because of that I was ostricized.  This got to show me the other side, of what it was like to be a flat chested girl child rather than a Lolita which I never experienced.  I had conversations with myself like Margaret did with God, although I don't know if I ever got anywhere with those self talks.  I wish I had a group of friends like Margaret did though, as it was a awkward time, to say the least; but, as I was the early bloomer I don't think the other girls knew what to make of me and therefore avoided and pushed me aside.  BUT THE BOYS WERE CREEPY AND WEIRD!  And you know what's funny?  I run into them as adults and they're JUST AS CREEPY AND WEIRD AS THEY WERE THEN!  I played those games of Spin The Bottle, 7 Minutes in Heaven and the like, and I can just imagine some of them slobbering over a woman in their 30s today like they were back then.  *Shudder!*<br /><br />But all that aside, this was a nice story and to this day one of the perenial young adult books that girls read.  There are a lot of themes that come into play that a kid may or may not relate to - being uprooted from home to a new surrounding, making new friends, making a connection with new friends, having those debates about religious beliefs, etc.  You are, after all, turning into a young adult and while a young adult may not have the same ideals and situation as a slightly or much older young adult, you start to question many rites of passage and what you have been told in the past.  Some are physical (getting your ears pierced, reaching menstrual age, etc.) and others are emotional, if only it was so easy to make it all work to the best of your ability.

In this book, the main character Margaret faces moving to a new city and trying to find her version of God.<br /><br /> I am a college sophmore and have been meaning to read this book since fifth grade.  My sixth grade sister recently got it and I quickly read it.  It's a short read that will allow both sixth graders and older people to enjoy it.  I understood some of the problems Margaret was going through, but identified with Laura a little too strongly.  Even though I'm much too old to complain about old hurts, it helped to see another person go through that situation, even fictional.  Laura's character brought back memories I would rather not think about, but I thought Blume handled the whole situation well.  Though she did not go as deep as some reviewers would have prefered, she created a realistic situation.  I felt that most of the things she wrote about sixth graders were accurate, though I don't know if it was true in the '70s.  I'll just take her word for it.<br /><br />  The other aspect of the book had Margaret reaching for God.  I enjoyed the way Blume introduced this as well, showing us Margaret's private talks with God.  I was glad to see religion acknoweldged, but not overly praised.

Some people feel the need to point out that the issue of religion may seem out of place in a novel like this. I've always seen it as a girl wanting to explore her place in the world around her. Many young people have the same concerns, so I believe that the religious questions only make Margaret a deeper person. Others tend to criticize the girls' obsession with their bodies and puberty.

At grade six we had fights, we gossipped and spread rumours, slapped our enemies, played chinese jump rope, walked around and did nothing, played on the playstructure, hung upside down on bars... we didn't do any of the stuff that JB focusses on - we were never that open about our period or our boobs.

Making friends does not prove to be a problem after all, plus her entire 6th grade class<br />has to break in a brand new teacher. Still there are two underlying themes which cause her great concern: one is the slow growth of her body into maturity. She and the other Pre Teen Sensations obsess over filling their bras and getting their periods. (This book is definitely not of interest to boys.)<br /><br />The serious issue, however, is her dual religious heritage. The only chld of a Christian mother and a Jewish father, Margaret is a pawn in a tug of war on the part of her grandparents in the opposing camps.  Her parents prefer to raise her to be Nothing--calmly assuming that she wil be able to make up her mind as a young adult without any guidance from either of them.  Meanwhile Margaret carries on private conversations with God in her own mind, confiding to him as if by phone--begging him to reveal himself to her and reminding him to help her body mature. When<br />she has a big fight with God over a grandparent disaster, she stops talking to him. The author does not resolve Margaret's religious dilemma.  How will she make up with God--if she still believes in him? There is also a more subtle theme about not believing vicious gossip about people you don't really know.  Also a mild warning about the issues of pre teen posturing and snobbery.  A good read if you are entering 6th grade.",2004-06-19

Oddly enough, Margaret's concerns placed this book, in the year 1970, under that label.  Whether it be because of sex talk, periods, or Playboy references, this is a book that all preteens ought to read.  Why?  Margaret is a regular girl dealing with normal adolescent troubles.  She's moved to New Jersey, she suspects, because her parents wanted to distance herself from her grandmother, who paid for Margaret's private school tuition, knit her cute little sweaters, and doted on her in a big way.  Now, Maragret will go to public school.  You can already see the transition to a new neighborhood won't be all too rough - she and Nancy Wheeler become fast friends and find they will be in the same sixth grade class.  She, along with Nancy, Gretchen Potter and Janie Loomis, start the Four Preteen Sensations.<br />Blume frankly addresses puberty, as well as religion.  I like the fact that Margaret feels she can talk to God without actually belonging to any particular organized religion.  She is technically half Catholic and half Jewish and a pivotal part of the book is her search to find which religion is right for her.  She visits a synogague and a church, yet does not feel God in either place.  This exploration of faith is actually something I have seen quite a few younger kids go through today in society - it really is no different from 1970!<br />Margaret constantly wants her period.  Why?  I don't know.  It will make her feel more grown-up, more womanly, I guess.  Yes, I know, I know, I just answered my own question!  :)  Margaret also wants the body of a woman.  She and her friends gossip about Laura Danker, a buxom sixth grader with a bad reputation, seemingly only because of her figure.  Margaret wants breasts and goes bra shopping, only because the Four PTS girls are required to wear one as club rules - she doesn't even fill a double A.  As some of the girls begin getting their periods, Margaret wonders when her time will come and we wonder if it will come during the 149 pages of the book.<br />Blume captures the essence of the preteen age in this long acclaimed novel.  Believable characters and a believable plot, as with other books of hers, will make this one enjoyable.  Margaret asks herself questions that we ask ourselves everyday.

It's Me, Margaret\\"" by Judy Blume is a must read for every girl in middle school. It takes you through the eyes of eleven year old Margaret Simon the year that she moved to Farbrook, New Jersey and her life was turned upside down. She encounters many growing of age conflicts like puberty, religion, popularity, boys, friendship and family all while trying to keep up with her secret clubs rules. She and her grandma have a special relationship that keeps Margaret questioning religion and what role it will play in her life as she grows older. This book has a colorful cover with the PTS club on it, but needs no illustrations because Blume's short chapters vividly describe each new conflict leading the reader to be curious about how it will be resolved. The flow of the book is rapid and hard to put down once started, especially if you can identify yourself with Margaret as every middle school girl can. Blume does not beat around the bush on growing pains and informs the reader that eleven going on twelve may not be so easy. This book can really get girls taking about their feelings of growing up and let themselves socially open up to various people like Margaret. This is a contemporary realistic fiction, but may be mistaken for a non fiction because the setting and characters of the book seems so real.",2004-03-24

It's Me, Margaret,Books,2,13,30,N,N,"Anticlamactic ending, bad examples","Excerpted from my review for a college Psychology course.<br />Margaret's family moves from New York City to New Jersey. Margaret suspects that her parents wanted to get away from her paternal grandmother, who was spoiling little Margaret with all kinds of presents. Such a move is probably not wise just before a child is getting ready for junior high school, which can be a disruptive transition to a child about to enter puberty, since she now has to deal with a new physical environment, and also separation from a loving grandmother. Fortunately she is able to form close friendships with three girls at the new school, and this peer group provided crucial support to help her adjust to the changes. This little same-gender clique was also helpful to each other as they experienced the biological transition of puberty; three of the girls \\""got\\"" their first menstruation during this period before enter junior high. Their constant preoccupation about who \\""got it\\"", their breast size, and boys, reflect typical early adolescent concerns. The book's humor reaches a high point when the girls' chant of \\""we must increase our bust\\"" is overheard by the boys.<br />Another major transition during this period is Margaret's growing cognitive skills. She begins to realize that her friends may not be telling the truth, and can start judging boys beyond their outward appearances. She can now also view the adults in her world, such as her teacher, parents, and grandparents, in many dimensions, treating each as an individual with a complex and unique combination of motives and expectations. For example, when her maternal grandparents decide to visit, she begins to dissect not just their motives, but those of her own parents as well, and realizes that she must re-examine some of her long-held beliefs about the complicated factors that influence decisions in the adult world.<br />As part of her social transition into early adulthood, she begins to take on more independent activities. She takes the bus by herself into the city to attend a concert with grandma, and plans on a trip to Florida to visit grandma. Adults in her world are also beginning to treat her more like a young adult; for example, for the first time in Margaret's life her mother solicits her understanding about the complex issues surrounding her maternal grandparents' visit.<br />Margaret's quest to establish her own identity and assert her autonomy.is perhaps the unifying theme throughout this book. In particular, she becomes more and more concerned about her religious identity, since her father is Jewish and her mother is a Christian. All her friends seem to be either Christians or Jews (until she finds out that Laura is Catholic), and she needs to know whether she should join the Y or the Jewish Community Center. She begins her exploration by talking to God privately, then starts attending service at a Jewish temple and a Christian church, and even attempts confession to a Catholic priest!<br />The story becomes complicated when the grandparents on both sides of the family try to pull her in different religious directions. At this point we begin to realize the real motives for their parents' move to New Jersey: her grandma was \\""too much of an influence\\"" because she insisted that Margaret was a Jew, while Margaret's parents wanted her to decide for herself. This is an interesting dynamic that offers many possible developments, but Blume does not explore them as deeply as I thought she would, considering that Margaret's struggle to find God is the title of the book. We only see the various forces influencing her, but there does not seem to be any definite resolution to this quest. At the end, Margaret thanks God not for some enlightening spiritual inspiration or direction, but for letting her have a \\""normal\\"" introduction to menstruation, so that she is not the last in her clique to \\""get\\"" her period. This seems to be too trivial a conclusion, even for an eleven-year-old, after such a long and thoughtful journey to find God.<br />I think this book reflects well many of the issues faced by early adolescents, particularly girls, in a middle-class suburban setting. A 6th-grader reading this book can learn some valuable lessons such as how not to treat an early-maturing girl like Laura. I am not so sure about the kissing game at Norman Fishbein's party: I sure hope that stuff did not go on at the parties my high school daughter went to, and this kind of activity is not something I would like to see suggested in a book for pre-teens. The parents in this book seem a bit too permissive in their parenting styles. For example, there should have been adult supervision in a preadolescent mixed-gender party, and Mrs. Fishbein does not seem to learn this lesson even after the kids made a mess of her ceiling with mustard. Fortunately the activities do not (apparently) get any wilder than kissing in a darkened bathroom. It also seems unusual for the father of a 6th-grader to have copies of Playboy magazine lying around the house. I suppose this is one way to expose the child to sexual content, but there are many better alternative material that are not so exploitative, and at least there should be some communication about the subject, rather than having the child steal quick glances at the centerfold when adults are not present. Margaret seems to learn more about menstruation and human anatomy from \\""adult\\"" magazines and her fellow eleven-year-olds than from her parents!<br />Pre-teens certainly can find out something about themselves by reading this book. Perhaps boys will benefit more from reading it so that they can understand what goes on with the opposite sex at an age when they are beginning to explore the mysteries of romantic relationships. I would have preferred to see more authoritative parenting displayed as models of parental behavior, and a deeper treatment of how Margaret resolves her little identity crisis in faith.ul journey to find God.<BR>I think this book reflects well many of the issues faced by early adolescents, particularly girls, in a middle-class suburban setting.

I think the most major issue is God - most kids belong to a specific religion and don't bounce around like Margaret.<br />The second issue that disturbed me was the way Margaret handled the physical changes she was going through. Even though all girls go through changes which often make them uncomfortable, Margaret is one of many girls who wish they'd grow up faster, but many girls (me at that age, for instance) were the opposite. I was more like Laura's character - being the 'most developed' girl who gets her period first (often much earlier than the other girls) and that can be just as uncomfortable as Margaret's position. But Laura isn't a fully developed character, so I think she's a character that's hard to identify with. This difference between the 'growing rate' of girls comes up in many places in the book. Margaret gets her bra just to be like the other girls and feels jealous of Nancy for having a bigger size. Being one of the first to wear one, and doing it when you can actually fill it out is a very different experience thant Margaret's - you definitelly don't stuff cotton balls into it... Actually, as a teenager I wished I could be like Margaret - in all the things she felt uncomfortable about, and might have wanted to be more like me...<br />I think this book can be a very enriching read for girls that age, and I definitely agree with one of the other reviews that reccomended this book for fathers with daughters that are about to become teens...

Judy Blume takes you into Margaret's life and lets you experience (or re-experience) all of those pre-teen moments. I feel that this is an enjoyable book that adolescent girls could read to help them prepare for their first crushes, their first period, and even their search for a higher power. Through Margaret and her friends young women are able to learn what to expect in those crucial teen years. The teen years are defining years and young women need to find a way to cope with them. This book provides answers, understanding, and encouragement. Although I believe the target audience of this book to be young women, I feel strongly that it would also benefit men, especially fathers because they experience different things during the teen years. The book would help them to gain a better understanding and insight into the lives of their daughters as well as other women. Overall, the book is well written with its target audience in mind, enjoyable, and eye opening.",2002-03-13

Since this novel deals with pre adolesence and the questions about  menstruation, one is able to identify with Margaret, the protagonist of  this novel.  Judy uses questions and answers which are right to the point  that she wants to get accross the reader.  Although there might be a  certain controversial about this novel which deals about menstruating, some  parents might not agree with me.  I have found adolesence to be a human  concern in this novel, and I will quote a part to show an example of it.  &quot;Are you there God?  It's me,Margaret.  I just told my mother I wanted  a bra. Please help me grow God.  You know where.

Judy answers all these questions.

The 11 year old main character, Margaret, goes through a lot of self awareness of herself, her family and her friends, much of which I could relate to at that age. And through it all, she converses with God which amazes me, since her parents have shown no guidance at all in the area of spirituality. In this book it's not really clear what her parents believe but that they expect Margaret to come to her own decisions about God with no input from them. She does, in fact, come to a brilliant conclusion which she so artfully states in the last two sentences of a letter that she writes to her 6th grade teacher.

Margaret makes friends easily and immediately finds herself part of a secret girls club, where they (Janie, Gretchen, Margaret, and Nancy) meet once a week under fake names at the house of one of the members, and have to wear bras and write lists of boys they like and keep the list in order as these various guys' favor falls or rises. It's all very innocent stuff.<br /><br />Margaret is conflicted about all sorts of things, one of which is her religion or lack of one. Sadly she feels she ought to have one, but one her parents hails from a Judaic background and the other from Christian, so they don't attend organized worship services, which is the smartest thing they can do. There's nothing in either religion which demands its adherents attend any kind of church.<br /><br />One thing which bothered me about Margaret was how self-centered she was. All but one of those unanswered prayers was about herself and her needs. The exception was when her dad was clueless in dealing with a lawn mower and cut his finger. She prayed for him then. Other than that, she never did ask for anything for anyone else.<br /><br />Margaret's parents were pretty bland parents throughout this novel until there came a point - inevitably it would seem - where her mom's estranged parents came back into her life. This, I felt, was pure evil on her mom's part. She had randomly sent her parents, to whom she had not spoken in fourteen years, a Christmas card, and suddenly they wrote back announcing that they were coming to visit - they wanted to reconnect with their only daughter and granddaughter. They said not a word about their daughter's evidently despised husband.<br /><br />Of course, they happened to choose to come at the same time as Margaret was scheduled to fly out to visit her paternal grandmother in Florida - the grandmother who had stuck by the family and whom Margaret adored. The ticket was already bought, but Instead of telling her parents that they would have to either miss their granddaughter or reschedule, she chose instead to screw over her husband's mother, and she told Margaret that she could not go. That was unforgivable. If it had been some emergency, or something complete unavoidable, I could have understood it, but it was not. Her mother was just plain selfish and mean over this and that's not appreciated at all. It makes her mom look so awfully bad and there was no reason to write it this way.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this book. I liked Margaret despite her short-comings because she was actually the only real grown-up amongst the adults in her family. She was interesting and fun, and although some of this book was oddly contrived and no doubt far-fetched, in general it was a fun fictional read even for me, and I think those for whom it was primarily written will like it.ughter and granddaughter.

Everything ( including how menstruating feels ) was very realistic and as I read the book, I realized the great amount of information included, without making you feel like you're reading a health class textbook. The plot is fun, interesting, and I absolutely loved it. If you are a young reader and scared about getting your period, I just want to tell you that it is painless and when you bleed, you just use a tampon ( they don't hurt ) of use a pad  and you will bleed for a few days every month.

Possible Spoilers Below!)","I first read this book when I was eight years old. Given the touchy topics, I didn't really understand it, but I remembered liking it. Now, I bought it on my Kindle after I received it for Christmas to re-read it. Understanding it now, a it was even better the second time. I devoured this book in a very short amount of time.<br /><br />Rated one of the most controversial middle grade novels of all time, Judy Blume has raised lots of eyebrows with this book since its original publication in 1970. I can see why, but I enjoyed the book because of this. I enjoy that Judy does not try to censor for her young audience. It's probably a good thing, because girls Msrgaret's age aren't still worried about threads on their teddy bears being loose. They worry about the same things the PTS girls do;crushes, bras, and the like.<br /><br />Although to some Margaret may seem unlikely, her sometimes catty attitude made me like her more. Although, I'll admit, the first time I read the book at eight years old, I probably thought that Margaret was mean for not wanting her maternal grandparents to visit, I understand that they were a bit annoying and highly prejudiced for disowning their daughter in such a way because of who she fell in love with. I would be mad at them, too. They were unlikable this time around, and quite possibly my least favorite characters.<br /><br />I did, however, like Margaret's grandmother on her father's side a bit more, although I did not like how she pushed Margaret to choose the religion she herself had. Margaret should choose herself, unless she asked for guidance.<br /><br />I enjoyed all of the PTS girls, though I definitely funded Janie and Gretchen more than Nancy. As the book progressed, I found Nancy less and less likable, especially towards the end. I sympathized her during the bathroom scene, when I thought that she was genuinely confused, but after Margaret's conversation with Laura Danker, my feelings toward her soured. I think that Judy did a good job on her character, because every now and then, we all befriend a real mean girl.<br /><br />I would recommend this to any girl with questions about growing up or religion.od job on her character, because every now and then, we all befriend a real mean girl.<br /><br />I would recommend this to any girl with questions about growing up or religion.",2015-01-21

Especially because now she doesn't have the chance to see her grandma as often as she likes. She quickly finds a friend, but that doesn't help her to feel less insecure. Religion is important in the town, it helps to define where people belong and as Margaret's father is Jewish and her mother is a Christian they've decided she can make up her own mind when she's ready for it. For a school project Margaret tries to find out which religion would suit her best. Meanwhile she's worried, because she doesn't have any breasts yet and she's anxiously awaiting the day she gets her period. She doesn't want to be a late developer. Margaret shares all her worries with God and asks him to help her.<br /><br />Margaret is twelve years old and she struggles with a lot of insecurities. She moves to a smaller town where things she'd never given any thoughts matter all of a sudden and that makes her wonder about her own identity.

By that I mean her parents have different faiths and rather than raise Margaret to be one or the other, they're teaching her nothing about faith or religion.  She's to figure it out on her own and choose when she's older.<br /><br />On top of new friends, starting to notice and like boys, awkward social situations, and waiting for &#34;get it&#34; like her friends are getting their periods, Margaret has a project to choose her religion.  She has the push/pull of grandparents, and the complete abdication of her parents in this matter.  Whew!  So what does Margaret do?  She does the very best she can and keeps us informed every step of the way.  On irony is that Margaret has conversations with God. Perhaps that's even better than choosing a religion.  She has her own personal relationship with God, and to me, that's the best anyone can do.<br /><br />This is another great middle grade book by Judy Blume that I'm sorry I missed out on till now.

It's the story of a 6th grade girl who is uprooted from her home in NYC and moves to a New Jersey suburb.  The book opens with Margaret addressing God.  She has many of these &#34;prayers&#34; throughout the book.  You can't really say she's having a conversation with God because she never reports that he's speaking to her in return and a conversation is two-way.  Margaret is lost spiritually, having been raised by a Jewish father and Christian mother who have mostly walked away from their faith.  They have not raised Margaret to have any faith whatsoever, insisting that when she is old enough, she can decide for herself.  Margaret desperately wants to find a religious base of her own and decides to visit many churches to accomplish this.  You can read the book to find out what happens in the course of her search.  Besides a focus on faith, the book's other focus is that of pre-teen girls experiencing puberty.  Margaret and her friends speak freely and openly about boy crushes, buying and wearing bras, menstruation, and other changes that occur in their bodies during this time.  The girls in Margaret's clique are so excited and looking forward to beginning menstruation - it's bordering on an obsession.  Believe me, she'll think differently in a few years and realize what a pain it is :)",2014-05-07

I probably read this book three or more times as a pre-teen girl and to this day the story had stuck in my mind.  As I was browsing the library for children’s titles for this week I came across it and I couldn’t resist listening to the audio.  It is still just as good today as it was then and I am very much out of the age range for this one.  LOL.  Are You There God?  It’s Me, Margaret is still relevant for a young girl growing up and struggling with puberty and just where she fits in the world.  I listened to the audiobook which is narrated by Laura Hamilton and she does a wonderful job and the way she portrayed Margaret brought her alive in this book!<br /><br />Twelve-year-old Margaret has just moved to a new neighborhood in Farbrook, New Jersey and she’s not too happy about it.  She’s had to leave her friends behind and most importantly her grandmother.  Margaret is sure that is why they moved as her parents didn’t approve of how Margaret’s grandmother spoiled her with private schools and many more things.  Now Margaret will be attending a regular public  school and she’s worried.  Will she fit in?  Will she be able to make friends?  Lucky for her Nancy, who lives nearby comes over and befriends her.  They are the same age and in the same class at school.  Soon enough Margaret finds herself in a private girl’s group with Nancy, Gretchen, and Janie.<br /><br />The girls decide the first order of business is to get them all in bras which leaves Margaret mortified as she’s going to have to ask her mother to take her shopping for one.  Margaret is pretty gutsy though and goes home and just blurts it out and ends up in a training bra soon enough.  The biggest thing though is they are all so anxious to get their periods.  Margaret especially felt this would be the gateway to making her more grown up.  I found it so funny because it isn’t long before us women are wishing we didn’t have them anymore. Another one that cracked me up was the ‘We must, we must, increase our bust’.  LOL.  I do remember doing that when I was a teen.  Then there was the more serious side of things with Margaret’s confusion over religion.  Her parents aren’t any religion, her grandmother is Jewish, and Margaret is caught in the middle.  Her parents told her when she was old enough she could choose what she wanted and there again the book highlights how hard it can be growing up and having to figure things out for yourself.<br /><br />Are You There God?  It’s Me, Margaret was a trip down memory lane for me but for a pre-teen girl I think it would be a valuable resource.  Margaret is a normal, everyday teen girl making her very easy for a teen to connect with.  She realistically tells of her feelings, concerns, and fears and they are many that all girls go through.  I can still remember when I read it and it made me feel as though I was normal.  All the feelings I had were just the same as other girls had and that had made me feel better.

It's Me, Margaret, is a cute and humorous story of a twelve year old girl  standing at the doorstep of puberty, bursting with embarrassing questions and concerns.  She secretly confides in the only one who she feels could possibly understand her and help her with her plight...God.<br /><br />Margaret's grandmother was a loving constant in her life, until her  parent's decided it was time to move Margaret away from her grandmother's influence. They chose NJ because it was close enough for the father to commute to work in NYC, and far enough away to keep Margaret's grandmother's Jewish influence to a minimum. And even though Margaret's father was Jewish and her mother a Christian, they didn't practice either faith. They felt Margaret should do the same, until she was old enough to decide what faith she wanted. But Margaret wanted a religion now. She desperately wanted to be like everyone else. She wanted to belong somewhere. So when her friend asked her to join a top-secret girls club, she readily accepted.<br /><br />Margaret loved the feeling of being part of a group. But the main purpose of the group, sharing personal details about puberty and experiences with boys made her anxiety skyrocket. Margaret had nothing to report on either one of these fronts, so she started to talk to God and nudge Him into speeding up her adolescent bodily changes. Then as if that was not enough, her new friends wanted to know why she didn't go to Sunday School. Margaret hated talking about her no-religion status. It made her feel different and freaky.<br /><br />So Margaret decided for her yearlong school project, she was going to study religion. She was determined to pick one, by the end of the school year. Margaret attended Catholic and Protestant services and even traveled to NYC to go to the synagogue with her grandmother. It was a wonderful excuse to be able to see her again, because Margaret's parents never interfered with a school project. But as months passed and God stayed silent, Margaret became irritated. She couldn't understand why God couldn't give her a sign or just tell her what religion she should pick. Surely He knew the answer to that question!<br /><br />Margaret's nightly conversations with God started to carry a desperate edge to them, as her puberty development continued to stay at a constant zero. How hard could it be for God to give her a few womanly bumps and changes? Margaret tried her darndest to be patient, but when God started dishing out the goods to her friends and leaving her out, she blew her stack! Margaret told God they were no longer on speaking terms! But Margaret would soon find out that she would miss her confidant and their nightly conversations. A lot.<br /><br />The author, Judy Blume, did a wonderful job with the development of Margaret's character. Margaret is a sweet, innocent and totally lovable girl. However, I think Judy Blume could have added more depth to the secondary characters. As a reader I know I wanted to know more about the parents, and why they would ever take such a drastic measure just to keep Margaret away from her Jewish grandmother's influence. I liked the grandmother, and rooted for her!  But putting that aside, I would have to say that I really enjoyed the book, and would love to see a sequel. I found the book meaningful, humorous, and well written. I would recommend this book to any young girl entering into adolescence.  I know they would not only enjoy the book, they would absolutely love it!d and God stayed silent, Margaret became irritated.

This book is... Different. It tells us (the middle school girls of the USA) that we aren`t alone. We aren`t Â«wierdÂ». We are develpoing. And since we can`t cange that,  we must accept it. We all start at different rates, and we all feel differently about these changes. Margaret is the average pre-teen girl; she is a little weary of what lies ahead, but she can endure it anyway. She, as we all do/did, is a little excited and a little nervous. She is of the many, many, MANY girls who, in America, feel akward during this time. She is innocent and naive at the start of the book, but becomes more aware later on in the book. She struggles with choosing a religion, if any, to partake in. With a Jewish dad and a Catholic mom, she feels cornered. Her Grandma isn't much of a help either, because she pushes her to be Jewish. Everything falls apart when Margaret's Grandparents on her mom's side (who haven't spoken to the parents for 14 years) come and practically FORCE Margaret to be Catholic. When Margaret finally explodes in anger, they take is the wrong way and tell her it's  &#34; Not too late&#34; to help her. Margaret is enraged and decides to stop talking to her private God for a while. She eventually gets her period, and tells her mom, and that's about where our heroic little awesome story ends.<br /><br />  From,<br /><br />Thebartbox",2014-01-06

Once she's in the suburbs, she's pulled into a groups of girls who are curious about everything normal tweens are; boys, bras, friendship, gossip, and so much more. On top of everything else, she is trying to figure out what religion she wants to be, if any of them. Her parents aren't much help, just adding to Margaret's confusion, her mother is a Christian and her father is Jewish. This whole book is surrounded her life and her very one-sided prayers with God. She is very frank as she tries to talk to God about which religion is right for her, and what she's going through. This story is a great example of a little girl trying to figure out her life and what she's looking for in a religion.<br /><br />Entertainment Value: 5 out of 5 - This book is a great read and very relataible. Margaret and her frank personality will keep you laughing throughout the whole story. It has a great storyline full of things that every teen/tween goes through. I highly suggest it to all age group of girls!<br /><br />Educational Value: 3 out of 5 - This book is very helpful in showing girls they are not alone, and that every other girls are going through and feeling just like them. This book is informative and a great relief to some, but does not contain any educational knowledge on an academic level.<br /><br />This review was first published on Kindle Kids' Corner @Kindle Nation Daily.<br /><br />@ebookbelle",2012-08-07

I read it (blushing the whole time), then put it away.  Then I pulled it back out and read it again.  As I grew up, I would still dust this book off and give it a quick read.  It became a way for me to see where life was heading, and then was a chance to look back and think \\""that wasn't so bad\\"".  It basically told me I was normal.  What little girl doesn't want to be assured they are normal?  Growing up is scary!  This book was an honest story about being a girl in those awkward pre-teen years.  It doesn't make light being a kid; it paints a young girls life in all it's not so perfect and sometime scary glory.<br /><br />Now I'm a mother with 2 girls of my own and I will get them each their own copy of this book to read when they get older.",2012-07-17
