Miss Brodie is likable, imaginative, snobbish, charming, cowardly, brave, and believes her influence on her \\""Brodie set\\"" to be goddess-like.      Spoiler alert:  I believe Sandy took the steam out of Miss Brodie's goddess-like pronouncement and intent for Rose to become the lover of Miss Brodie's true love, Mr. Lloyd by herself (that is, Sandy) becoming the lover of Mr. Lloyd.  Thereby, Sandy overcame Miss Brodie and became her successor as well as the unknown and unappreciated savior of Rose.

Miss Jean Brodie teaches at the Marcia Blaine School for Girls in Edinburgh. Miss Brodie is in her \\""prime\\"". And as such all who know her during her prime should feel in some way privileged.<br /><br />Miss Brodie has selected a number of girls whose parents are either uninvolved, too dumb to notice or liberal and enlightened to be \\""her girls\\"". The Brodie set as they are known are given special attention by Miss Brodie. In the course of their relationship the girls begin to come into one's own - of course under the approval of Miss Jean Brodie. She doesn't make the girls do things necessarily, but she discusses what she likes and what she doesn't and what is becoming and what is not, and the difference between little girls and a woman in her prime.<br /><br />The girls are rather devoted to Miss Brodie even though at times she comes across as quite ridiculous. Miss Brodie has also attracted the attention of two male teachers at the school. One of whom she is most ardently in love with, the other is simply fulfiling a need. The man she loves is married and she stays away, but never too far. The man she doesn't love she keeps at the end of a rope about arms length away.<br /><br />The headmistress has been trying to sack Miss Brodie ever since Miss McKay came to Marcia Blaine. And she goes after Miss Brodie through the girls.<br /><br />At some point Miss Brodie is betrayed (you do find this out rather early in the book). What I can never figure out is do I like Miss Brodie, is she ridiculous, is she a good influence, a bad influence, is she too be pitied. She's very hard not to like.",2008-12-03

Miss Jean Brodie is one of the most complex, idealistic, self-deluded, vulnerable, vital, romantic, preposterous, lonely, gregarious, outspoken and solipsistic character you will ever meet. She is the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whereas others are only the squares on the two sides. Listen to her lessons: \\""Phrases like 'the team spirit' are always employed to cut across individualism, love, and personal loyalitiies. Ideas like 'team spirit' ought not to be enjoined on the female sex, expecially if they are of that dedicated nature whose virtues from time immemorial have been utterly opposed to the concept. Florence Nightingale knew nothing of team spirit, her mission was to save life regardless of the team to which it belonged. Cleopatra knew nothing of the team spirit if you read your Shakespeare. Take Helen of Troy! ... Where would team spirit have got Sybil Thorndike? She is the great actress and the rest of the cast have got the team spirit.

That is, its compact style and size are, I suppose, purposefully wrought in this way so that we may come away asking ourselves profound questions on the meaning of a mentor/student relationship, social hierarchies, art, betrayal, pedagogy etc.  It's, you know, like the kind of thing you get from an old white-bearded yogi sitting on the top of some Himmalayan mountain: &quot;The crow flies in square circles.&quot;-Now, what's the meaning of life?<br />  The problem with this type of book is that it never takes the time (or Spark doesn't)to grab hold of your heart and mind for long enough to make you care about the deeper questions involved (and they are clearly there).

As we read the book, we began to notice similarities between our teacher, Miss Sinclair, and Miss Brodie herself. Now, we have the distinct feeling that we in effect ARE the Sinclair set, but we don't seem to get to play very much golf... We were divided about the book. Some of us, including myself, found it very good, whereas others found it a bit stupid and unbelievable. One of the books benefits was it's shortness, as it was just the right length to read over, say, a weekend. However, it is doubtful that a teacher would get away with such extreme actions for so long. We all felt that Miss Brodie was portrayed as a victim of her own strong will, and that some of her thinking and teaching was particularly ahead of her time.",2000-11-29

She is the worst product of Modern Times, a romantic in the sense that she elevates the personal above the universal.

Her writing is unique and intriguing and always thought provoking.  Miss Jean Brodie is in the prime of her life but it slips away as she is removed from her vocation  as a teacher.  This book asks an important question of each of our lives:  do we have *A* prime? do we really recognize it when it comes? are we  bitter when we realize it has passed? or is it the bitterness of betrayal  that tragically steals our prime from beneath us.  This book is present on  many &quot;classic&quot; fiction lists and it is for good reason. A  seemingly simple story, but very far reaching. Just as Miss Jean Brodie's  efforts as an unorthodox teacher reach her students in profound ways, this  book can ask simple questions of the reader and reach into their souls as  well.",2000-03-31
