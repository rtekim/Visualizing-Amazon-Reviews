It is a pseudo-autobiographical work based on Kerouac, and his friends, own travels across America. The story’s main character Sal Paradise (who is in fact Kerouac’s alter ego) admires friend Dean Moriarty for his care-free and hedonistic spirit. Moriarty’s obsession with late nights, women, and “Jazz” become increasingly uncontrollable throughout the novel.  - A famous quote from the novel encapsulates the essence of the novel beautifully: “the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars” - “On the Road,” along with Allen Ginsburg’s “Howl,” is one of the most defining pieces of literature of the post war beat generation. The “beat generation” was a phrase that Kerouac himself coined for the new anti-conformist, hedonistic and existential youth movement of the time. The word “Beat” being derived from the idea of being beaten down or from the musical connotation of being “on the beat.” This is very apt seeing that Jazz is very definitely one of the themes of this novel and seeing that Kerouac’s sentence rhythms even resemble the jazz beat. Kerouac has very beautiful prose and weaves a wonderful web of imagery. This is a story about people, places…middle America, and the road trip that doesn’t end. It is indeed a long and sprawling story of almost Odyssian proportion, and is not without its life lessons.",2015-08-17

The first impulse: a giddiness for life and place, in which all America is sacred and awe can be invoked merely by the invocation of place names (New Orleans, Denver, San Francisco). The second impulse: self-destructive madness that drives men downward into poverty and eventually death. (The life expectancy of a Beat — not so good.) And I do mean men literally: the women act as a battered and long-suffering Greek chorus for decency, common sense and banality.<br /><br />The ecstacy takes an early lead but despair is never far away. Indeed, it’s ever present and it’s reality is only veiled by the sheer breathlessness of the prose. After the dazzling description of the first trip out to San Francisco, however, the sheer misery gets harder and harder to fig leaf, and it’s increasingly unclear what will be triumphant at the finish line.<br /><br />This is not to suggest that these two impulses are unrelated. Rather, they’re like the two helixes of DNA each imagining that they can somehow get ahead of each other but in truth immortally intertwined. (These helixes bolted together by chemicals, especially alcohol, for self-medication and for fuel for euphoria.) If you compare the last couple of sentences of the last two chapters, it becomes fairly clear that Kerouac himself is unsure who won.<br /><br />So, ultimately, what is one to make of all of this? It’s clearly more than just “typing” to use the famous dismissal of it. But there is something literal and relentless about the prose, as if it’s afraid to slow down out of fear feeling the enormity of the pain. It comes across as itself crazed: “We went there. Then we went there. We met so-and-so. We were all unhappy. We stayed a few weeks.” It’s brilliant and exhausting, but perhaps not in a completely good way.<br /><br />My own sense is that the loser in this race was myself. As someone who seems to be repeatedly two or three degrees of separation serious mental illnesses and helping people cope with damage I never see inflicted, as the novel progressed, I found myself increasingly unsympathetic to the “madness as shamanic vision” that sees something holy in the main characters’ inability to keep their act together enough to conform — rebellion ought to be clear eyed — and increasingly sympathetic to the stream of minor characters who voice distaste for and have to clean up after the getting of kicks. In places the narrator seems to feel the same way. Indeed, his own count of the number of kids Dean Moriarity sired across the country is what began the bad aftertaste in earnest. (And yet, I find myself now more disposed toward reading Kerouac.)<br /><br />As an aside, a pleasure in reading On the Road that Kerouac could have never anticipated is the sheer alien quality of the life he describes, in which you buy a newspaper to get a weather report or start off on a road trip in hopes that the hitchhikers can contribute enough toward gas to get you to your final destination. No smartphones and a lot less stranger danger.",2015-06-14

I had heard of Kerouac before and the description on the back of the book attracted me with mentions of jazz, drugs, and the Beat movement. However, On the Road seemed more an indulgence in nostalgia than a celebration of the Beat era. The narrator, Sal Paradise, outlines his wild travels back and forth across the United States and Mexico. Along the way, Sal befriends all sorts of characters, including bums, waitresses, prostitutes, saxophonists, and junkies. The book is paced feverishly, so the reader never really sees relationships develop between Sal and the other characters. I would not recommend this book to today’s young readers. The plot is spastic and glorifies entropy. Apathy prevails as the central emotion to the plot. On the Road is prettily written, but it lacks a sense of purpose. By halfway through the novel, the reader tires of hearing over and over about Sal and Dean’s pointless debauchery and aimlessness.<br />Jack Kerouac’s style is very recognizable. Kerouac uses incredibly descriptive imagery, usually pertaining to landscapes and people. In Mexico, Sal describes how “Dawn came rapidly in a gray haze, revealing dense swamps sunk on both sides, with tall, forlorn, viny trees leaning and bowing over tangled bottoms” (Kerouac 296). Even insignificant characters are described in detail. A man who appears for only two pages is described in this way: “The other cop, Sledge, was tall, muscular, with a black-haired crew–cut and a nervous twitch in his neck…He wore a revolver down low, with ammunition belt, ad carried a small quirt of some kind, and pieces of leather hanging everywhere, like a walking torture chamber” (Kerouac 67).  Kerouac is also partial to long, compound sentences, which often reach paragraphs in length. These give the book a sense of restlessness, like the plot simply does not have time to stop for periods. While staying ata friend’s house, Sal describes the goings-on: “In the house Jane sat reading the want ads in the living room; Bull was in the bathroom taking his fix, clutching his old black necktie in his teeth for a tourniquet and jabbing with the needle into his woesome arm with the thousand holes; Ed Dunkel was sprawled out with Galatea in the massive master bed that Old Bull and Jane never used; Dean was rolling tea; and Marylou and I imitated Southern aristocracy” (Kerouac 148). Kerouac’s attention to detail and long-running sentences require a reader to have extreme patience and a long attention span. Therefore, the book is more suitable to adults than to teenagers, who cannot focus as attentively.<br />Sal’s experiences are semi-autobiographical, reflecting Jack Kerouac’s life as a Beatnik. While Sal’s experiences are filled with more adventure than the average person will experience, his story is still relatable in some ways. I feel, and I know many other young people do as well, the same urge to travel and explore that strikes Sal from time to time. As someone just coming into adulthood, I sympathize with Sal’s feeling of displacement- he feels more at home on the road than he does in his aunt’s house in New Jersey. When Sal and Dean go into fits of ecstasy at jazz clubs, I relate to their euphoria, because I find purpose in music. However, some of Sal’s antics make him difficult to relate to. It is obvious that that author has a fondness for Sal, since Sal is a reflection of the author himself. But Sal’s complacency and lack of motivation make him seem more of a moocher than a drifter. He is barely developed as a character- by the end of the book, the reader still does not know what Sal wants out of life or even how he feels in general about his exploits. Since Kerouac defines his characters mainly through their experiences, the reader pieces together a portrait of the characters very slowly. For instance, Old Bull Lee is characterized in a briefsnapshot: “Bull had found a great big piece of thick rotten wood and was desperately yanking with a hammerhook at the little nails imbedded in it… ‘When I get all these nails out of this I’m going to build me a shelf that‘ll last a thousand years!’ said Bull, every bone shuddering with boyish excitement” (Kerouac 149). From this brief encounter the reader sees that Bull Lee is excitable and impulsive, though it takes many events such as this one to build up a workable image of a character. This method of characterization is effective and interesting, but takes a long while to reach its intention.<br />The plot of On the Road is organized essentially in a chronological fashion. The pacing is very fast, and the book spans many years of Sal and Dean’s adventures. It was difficult to stay engaged with the plot, since events were repetitive in theme and happened with dizzying quickness. Sal is in California when he muses, “I went on the SP tracks and balanced along the rail. I passed a watertower and a factory. This was the end of something” (Kerouac 101). Sal is suddenly moving on to another, unrelated chapter of his life, with little fanfare and not enough transition time. While this spasticity helped me understand the impermanence felt by members of the Beat movement, it was difficult for me to really involve myself in the plot of the book.<br />On the Road is well-written, but in my opinion lacks substance. I would recommend it to anyone trying to understand Beatniks, and perhaps to fans of mid-century American literature. I would not recommend it to anyone else, as I finished the book feeling very little about the story or its characters.",2015-05-21

Much like The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, depicting a young boy’s struggle through adolescence, we follow a different authors non-fictional journey across America in an effort to experience life to its fullest. A young Kerouac in his twenties travels east and west meeting old and new friends, experimenting with drugs, struggling through poverty at times and for the sake of being alive. On The Road is a mandatory read for any young man who has not set foot on their journey yet, but it may be a disturbing and boring read to an older generation who may not relate to the youthful exuberance of Kerouac.<br />It is apparent this book is not a piece of beautifully written classic literature nor does it try to be. Kerouac’s sometimes rickety sentences and jumping storylines may make some english teachers cringe, but it creates a unique style that draws the reader into Kerouac’s sporadic mind. It is also extremely effective at building scenery the reader can become immersed in. Kerouac enters California stating, “I suddenly realized I was in California. Warm, palmy air- air you can kiss- and palms” (60). Using words that do not exist, as Kerouac often does, he gives the reader a beautiful view threw his eyes.<br />Enveloping the reader in a world seen through Kerouac’s perspective, the reader quickly grows attached to Sal, as Kerouac is referred to by his friends. The reader grows close to these characters as if they are friends of their own. Kerouac helps the reader build his or her own opinion on that person by breaking events to flash to a past action or story about someone. For example, Sal’s recurring oddball friend Dean is developed as a madman with a kind soul the reader begins to love despite his often selfish acts. We contemplate with Sal as he tries to figure why Dean is acting out of character. “I tried to remember everything hed done in his life and if there wasn’t something back there to make him suspicious now” (189). The reader may even stop and ponder himself whether a past event told by Kerouac could be coming back into play now.<br />Some may call his writing scatter brained, but one cannot argue that no rock was left unturned. Every alleyway and opened is searched and closed as we journey throughout the book. Kerouac even recognizes his incredible ability to reconnect ideas writing, “Something would come of it yet. There’s always more, a little further- it never ends” (243). Often times, major events are protruded by a several page flashback only to be dropped back into action with a greater understanding than before. Not to mention, the landscape of 1940’s New York, California and America in general gives a younger generation a peek into a time of old.<br />On The Road is more than a delinquents expedition across America. It is the story that all young people create for themselves as they begin to carve out their own tale on life’s road. If you are a young adult asking yourself where will life take me next, or are part of an older generation looking to experience youth with an open mind once again, On The Road is a must read.",2015-01-08

My impression of the beats who were before my time is that they liked to act as if they had found the nebulous \\""it\\"" but simply couldn't describe \\""it\\"" to those too stupid to understand.

I know that this book is well-loved and a crucial part of the American canon of literature. I know that Jack Kerouac worked with Allen Ginsberg and other important artists to explore the meaning behind the Beat generation, to make sure that it lived forever in the literature and art of the age.<br /><br />So, with all this hanging over my head, I began to read.<br /><br />On the surface, I wasn't all that impressed. I liked Sal Paradise; his restless soul and search for a place to belong appealed to me (more on that later), but I was a little underwhelmed by his buddies. There was no responsibility among this group of people and their constant drinking bothered me. At one point, I wondered if I should just pick it down and get another classic to read. So I did a little research into the Beat generation and found some interesting reviews on On the Road.<br /><br />There seems to be a major divide in opinions on this book. Either you love it or hate it. There was one review I found that lambasted anyone who didn't give it a positive review because they couldn't appreciate it from his standpoint. While the review was a little much (and a little reminiscent of &#34;back in my day&#34;), this particular person has a point.<br /><br />Reading my research about the Beat generation did nothing to connect me with the book. I scoured the internet looking for something that would resound with me, to make this book a little more memorable, appealing, or just simply a little bit of context. Without the context and appreciation for such, this is honestly a book about a restless soul traveling across the country an absurd amount of times, living the life of a gypsy.<br /><br />I kept reading for Paradise. The references, metaphors, and images all flashed by (I hate when that happens), but I kept reading for Paradise. I understand that restless soul, that need to find a place to belong and the search that accompanies it.<br /><br />There were moments in the text that were pure brilliance, where the creative language shone through and made even the simplest moment seem ethereal. There's a scene near the end of the book where Sal is lying on top of the car, trying to cool off in the hot night; the narration in this particular scene will stick with me for years.<br /><br />In the end, I don't know where I stand on On the Road. I feel incompetent to make a judgment call. There were parts I loved and others that were simply flat and strange to me. Because of this, I'm not going to officially rate Jack Kerouac's On the Road. It feels like I missed too much context to make a good judgment call here.",2014-07-05

Apparently, living authentically means stealing cars, mooching money from friends and relatives, serially impregnating women and then abandoning the resulting kids, getting drunk or high and generally living like a pig. Moriarty, Paradise/Kerouac's hero in this narrative, does all this and has a rather disturbing interest in underage girls to boot (his first wife was 15 when he first had sex with her, and later he lasciviously eyes a farmer's 16-year-old daughter, a neighbor's 13-year-old daughter and a crony's nine-year-old daughter(!)). But then, he appreciates cutting edge jazz so all is forgiven...<br /><br />Kerouac's 1957 road epic relaunched his writing career after the failure of his debut novel, the Thomas Wolfean snoozefest The Town and the City. Kerouac's approach in On the Road is very similar to the first-person stylings and raucous tone of Henry Miller, except without the rampant sex and shameless self-aggrandizement. It's the same demimonde world of hustlers, users, cheats and naifs with little thought for anything but where the next thrill is coming from.<br /><br />But his is a book review, not a moral evaluation, and by that standard On the Road is a highly readable travelogue of America's back roads and underbelly from New York to Denver to San Francisco and, toward the end, into the back woods of Mexico.

Usually in half a page or<br />less, Kerouac managed to portray the essence of such scenes as upstate New York, the mid-Atlantic countryside,<br />Hollywood Boulevard, the S.F. Bay Bridge ... just to name the places I have been myself and can vouch for.  And he writes<br />with great love for the country, and the countryside and cities that make it up.<br /><br />2) Kerouac here describes an America that didn't - and still doesn't - get much exposure in literature. drama, or film.<br />the America of small time workers and farmhand - the dishwashers, fruit and cotton pickers, temporary construction hands,<br />security guards  (and not the cardboard caricatures of Steinbeck and Marxist writing of the time) - you could sum up by saying these are the Americans who always take the bus when they have any distance to go. I lived in that America for much of my life, and Kerouac's portrayal of these people seem as solid as his portrayal of the landscape they populate.<br /><br />3) And all is written with high-energy prose, full of life, enthusiasm, energy. Some books - even some great ones - are so<br />disillusioned and bored with existence that they actually drain your energy.  This book is a boost = it reminds me of a story they used to tell in the 1960s about Coltrane's fiery lp Ascension: that it was so full of energy you could use it to heat your room on a cold winter night.<br /><br />4) Which makes it a real paradox, that this book is a founding document of the Beat Generation, which was supposedly<br />apathetic, low energy, according to its critics then and now.  The Beats were high-energy people, like Kerouac in their<br />enthusiasm for life and living, and this book captures that spirit.  I remember growing up in the 1950s in a New York suburb,<br />how two-dimensional and dull everything was (and this was a town that was one of the setting for Goodfellas! I got to admit,<br />the Italians, along with the African-Americans, were at least alive), and when I met my first Beats when I was around 14,<br />how alive they were, what an 'up' it was to know them, listen to them talk.<br /><br />5) And while the prose is often uneven - and whose isn't? - a lot of it is beautiful writing.<br /><br />So if you feel in need of a pickup, an energy boost, a reason to go on living, or just a wonderful description of America and its working class around 1948, this is the book for you!",2014-05-21

On the Road.<br /><br />The `road novel' is an essentially American genre and Kerouac's is its prototype.  This predilection for travel is partly due to the vast spaces available and the relative ease of communication networks (including language), but mainly attributable to the essential restlessness of the American spirit. Everyone is from somewhere and about to head for somewhere else. While the railroad facilitated movement the automobile demanded it.<br /><br />Sal Paradise, the narrator, crosses the continent several times, desperately seeking something, he knows not what, probably Paradise itself.  His friend Dean Moriarty is more a god or guru than a travelling pal, sometimes a mere image in Sal's mind, an idealised great human being. Dean's vision and his openness to the vicissitudes of life is the crux of the book, which may seem strange when we learn that he is a compulsive thief, law-breaker and deceiver of women. A truant by nature, Dean lives for kicks, has done time, drives like a madman, takes risks and is up for any challenge. He is also, a very intelligent and, when not too self-wrapped, a caring sensitive soul, but unpredictable and totally unstable.<br /><br />Travel is something that Sal, Dean and a collection of hangers-on are programmed to do.  They need to find out what's beyond the mountains or the desert, how other people live and talk or simply how they stare and listen.  Thus the South or Mexico are revelations. Faced with this collection of Beats, `The Southern folk looked at one another and shook their heads.' The Mexicans on the other hand accepted them as brothers, supplying the necessary anodynes of hash, spirits and girls, revealing a spirit of joy in spite of poverty.<br /><br />The book's final paragraph whose first noun is America and the last Dean Moriarty is like a hymn to a great land and the spirit of a great people, desperate seekers among the wonders of a vast continent: `So in America when the sun goes down and I sit on the old broken-down river pier watching the long, long skies over New Jersey and sense all that raw land that rolls in one unbelievable huge bulge over the  West Coast, and all that road going, all the people dreaming of the immensity of it, and in Iowa I know the children must be crying in the land where they let children cry, and tonight the stars'll be out, and don't you know that God is Pooh Bear? ...

Key points of the narrative such as seeking purpose and meaning outside of social norms can easily be taken for granted, and assumed to be meaningless as protagonist Sal Paradise can seem aimless in his pursuit of adventure. However, the at times subtle connotations conveyed throughout the story can be better appreciated by taking the time to first read writings, which analyse various facets of the book. That said it is too easy for a reader to feel Sal's road trip is fatuous in nature, and the story would have benefited from clearer personal development of Sal and his friends as the travel occurred.

I've been living with Sal Paradise, Dean Moriarty and their far flung friends for about 2 weeks during my daily commute. Patton does an excellent job of capturing the voice and moods of the friends who crisscrossed the country numerous times. He perfectly captures the manic pace of Kerouac's stream of consciousness writing. I think I would have had trouble finishing the book had I been reading it, but being trapped in the car for an hour or more a day limits other distractions.<br /><br />The text is long and rambling and sometimes nonsensical. If there is a point to Dean and Sal's wanderings, other than putting on as many miles as possible while hitting up as many girls as possible, I didn't get it. It's not exactly a coming of age story, because they're no longer in their boyhood. It's not a discovery of America ala &#34;Travels with Charley&#34;, because they didn't set out to commune with the American public. They steal cars, break the law, take advantage of other people, hang out in jazz clubs, get drunk frequently and chase women at every opportunity.<br /><br />Kerouac describes his writing as &#34;spontaneous prose&#34;; &#34;On The Road&#34; is indeed one long outburst of spontaneity, sometimes amusing, sometimes exhausting, and frequently inscrutable. Perhaps the pointless journeys of Dean and Sal are the point - it's okay to go out looking for life with no particular point other than having a good time.

US,32496153,R2UL2MUUVHAWOC,014312028X,303305496,"On the Road",Books,5,7,9,N,N,"A moan for humanity...","I have browsed through some of the negative reviews of this book and a lot of the people who really hate this book have basically the same complaints so, before I explain why I think this book is eminently worth reading, I want to quickly give people who have not yet read this book an idea of what to expect, and what not to expect, and clear up what I think are some common misconceptions about the book. That way, potential readers can get some idea of whether they are likely to enjoy reading the book. The book is not going to appeal to everyone. Our aesthetic judgments are so tied up with our values, our upbringing, our social position, and our general philosophy of life that there are certain people who are probably going to hate this book no matter what. I am convinced that Jack Kerouac was really an excellent writer and his books deserve to be considered great literature but that does not mean that everyone is going to love them. So, what are the complaints that people have with the book?<br /><br />A lot of reviewers complain that the novel has no plot. They are right in the sense that the novel does not follow a standard plot structure. There is no central conflict, building slowly to a climax, and ultimate resolution. The novel is told from the standpoint of Sal, who is a seeker, someone who is dissatisfied with mainstream society, and is searching for alternative life-styles and modes of being. However, in this book at least, he never really finds what he is looking for. Sal takes four road trips with his friend Dean Moriarty in search of some kind of epiphanic vision, in search of \\""it\\"", in search of real living, but they all end in disappointment. So, if you are looking for a standardly plotted novel with a big, clear resolution at the end that wraps up all the loose ends, you are going to be disappointed with this book.<br /><br />It is also clear to me that a lot of people do not like the book because they do not like Dean and they feel that Kerouac is turning a petty criminal into some kind of Messiah figure. There are clearly times when Sal looks up to Dean as a kind of Messiah, a figure who promises to bring the \\""real living\\"" that he has been searching so desperately for, but I think it is only very superficial readings of the book that can maintain that Dean is being portrayed as a Messiah figure, or as a figure to look up to and emulate. Dean represents a kind of energy that is in marked contrast to the dull, conformist society that Sal is trying to escape, but every trip Sal and Dean take together ends in disillusionment. There are places where Sal is quite explicit about this. When, for example, Dean abandons Sal and MaryLou in San Francisco Sal says \\""I lost faith in him that year\\"" (160) Hard to be any clearer than that.<br /><br />Part of the problem is, I do not think Kerouac was quite as successful as he could have been distinguishing between Sal as the narrator of the tale, who is looking back on things in retrospect, and Sal as he was at the time all these things were happening. Clearly, when Sal was running around with Dean he was in thrall with him, and often did view him as kind of a savior, but there are plenty of places in the book where Sal the narrator looks back and, in retrospect, realizes he was deluded and misguided. If Sal wanted us to worship Dean he would have presented him as a less complex character than he did. Dean is actually a very complex character and there are some very poignant and moving scenes relating to Dean (when Sal is harsh with him and Dean goes outside to cry, or when he leaves him in New York and sees him walking away alone, or when he reflects on how, as a little kid, Dean had to go to court to bail his father out of jail). Dean is not a Messiah, he is a complex character, who has had a hard life, and is trying his best to figure out how to live in the world, and not doing all that great a job. He leaves an emotional wreck behind everywhere he goes. So, I think the notion that Kerouac is turning a petty criminal into a Messiah is misguided, though Kerouac also avoids the kind of smug condemnation that the members of bourgeois society engage in with Dean. Perhaps it is Kerouac's refusal to engage in such smug condemnation that people find offensive? At any rate, Kerouac is presenting a more complex picture than either extreme, as I think all artists should.<br /><br />So, those are the two main complaints people seemed to have (no plot, holding up a petty criminal as an ideal). But enough of that. Why do I think this book is worth reading?<br /><br />First, there are plenty of life lessons scattered throughout the book. For example, before his first trip out West Sal spends months pouring over maps, and he has this Romantic image of himself following a single highway (a single red line on his map) all the way out West, but, when he actually heads out he finds that reality is quite different from his dreams. Sal constantly has an image in his head of how things are going to go and they never wind up going the way he expects. The fact is, to live in this world we need to learn to role with things as they come along, to respond spontaneously in the moment, and not become too attached to our fixed plans, because reality will, time and time again, lay the best laid plans to waste. That is just one example of a solid life lesson that can easily be gleaned from On the Road.<br /><br />Second, as I already mentioned above, the novel is a poignant portrayal of damaged and eventually disillusioned characters, but it never collapses into total despair, nor does it get lost in a meaningless hedonism. The novel sometimes gets compared to Hemingway's [[ASIN:0743297334 The Sun Also Rises]] because they both portray a group of people who decide to live life in their own way outside of the established mores of contemporary society. However, Hemingway's characters, in my opinion, are truly lost, more lost than the characters in this book, because they are not even entirely aware that they are lost or, if they are, they have lost all hope of finding a way out of their lostness. They simply accept that life is always going to be a dull round of getting drunk, eating dinner, having one brief romantic fling after another, going fishing to restore their sanity, rinse and repeat, until the end of time. The characters in Kerouac's novel might be lost but they are still holding out some hope for something more than that. They might be looking in the wrong places but how else do we learn? One is not, therefore, left feeling sick with despair, even though the novel basically ends in disillusionment.<br /><br />Third, rather than simply presenting the final goal of knowledge the novel is about the very process of learning. It presents the process as a series of mistakes and experimentation. The worst thing to do in life, in my opinion, is to just sit and try to figure everything out. The only way to figure out what works and does not work is to try and experiment. The novel is really a coming of age novel. It is about the search for wisdom and, like I said, a lot of people think that Sal was looking in all the wrong places, and he might have been, but at least he was trying. Excess is the road to wisdom, to paraphrase William Blake. It is only by heading out and making mistakes that we ever learn anything. While the book is technically a kind of coming of age novel, the fact is, we all still have things to learn, so we are always going to be \\""on the road\\"" so to speak, and this novel is kind of a universal representation of the human condition in its search for wisdom.<br /><br />Fourth, the search for alternative ways of life, which is probably the primary theme of the novel, is still a theme that resonates with a lot of people. Think of the popularity of the movie [[ASIN:B000AP04L0 Office Space]]. The character in that movie is desperately unhappy and is desperately searching for another way to live. The fact that the movie was so popular is a sign that a lot of people feel the same way. A lot of people are unhappy with the kind of life that is, supposedly, the life we all should be aspiring towards: a standard nine-to-five, good paying job, with possibility for promotional advancement, etc.. In the novel these are what Sal calls \\""white ambitions\\"". The term, and his portrayal of African Americans and other minorities in general, is a bit condescending, however, if we remove any racial overtones from the term, it names something real. A lot of people feel themselves out of touch with the values of mainstream society. It is not simply that they tried and failed, rather, even the possibility of success feels hollow and empty. When the best that society has to offer feels hollow and empty that is a problem. That is the kind of thing that leads to despair and even suicide. I am not sure that Kerouac's novel provides any air tight solutions to the problem. That is for individuals to work out for themselves. However, it does grapple seriously with the problem and will be an inspiration to anyone grappling with similar problems.<br /><br />Fifth, Kerouac is a good writer and there are a ton of beautiful, and genuinely lyrical passages in the novel. Kerouac's prose is ecstatic, he eschewed the naturalistic, direct prose of Hemingway and that whole line. When he wants to describe Dean, for example, he does not describe him as he actually looked in real life, he describes him as a demon, flying across the country and leaving nothing but scorched earth in his wake (that is a paraphrase, and a bad one, Kerouac's description is much more lyrical, but I am too lazy to search through the book to find it). I will provide one actual example of Kerouac's lyrical prose just to give a taste. This is Sal describing an ecstatic vision he has on the streets of San Francisco, after Dean has abandoned him, and he is essentially starving, \\""And for just a moment I had reached a point of ecstasy that I always wanted to reach, which was the complete step across chronological time into timeless shadows, and wonderment in the bleakness of the mortal realm, and the sensation of death kicking at my heels to move on, with a phantom dogging its own heels, and myself hurrying to a plank where all the angels dove off and flew into the holy void of uncreated emptiness\\"" (162). There is more but I will stop there. It is the part about the angels diving off into emptiness that I love.<br /><br />Finally, the last and final reason this novel is worth reading, is the same reason that all good novels are worth reading, it presents an interesting story, full of interesting characters, and gives beautiful expression to the human condition. Late in the book Sal encounters a tall old man with flowing white hair who tells him to \\""Go moan for man\\"". That is essentially what this book is: a moan for man. It expresses all the pain, suffering, uncertainty, and ultimately joy of living, in one giant moan, from end to end.<br /><br />Before I end I want to quickly mention a few critiques I have of the book. I already mentioned Kerouac's somewhat condescending portrayal of minorities. He romanticizes the lives of the oppressed and does not seem to have a whole lot of understanding of their actual condition. Besides that, I also feel like Kerouac lacks a real feel for nature. He often presents nature ecstatically, but it feels like he is presenting an idea he has of nature, as opposed to simply presenting nature directly (as in his descriptions, admittedly beautiful and moving, of the Mississippi river). He compares unfavorably, for example, with Henry David Thoreau who was a genuine and patient naturalist. Thoreau watched nature closely and could describe it in its tiniest details as it really was. Thoreau talks about how he would sometimes spend half a day standing in a river observing the behavior of a particular kind of fish. You could never imagine Kerouac doing anything like that. He is too frantic, and he is too in love with his idea of nature. Even in [[ASIN:0140042520 The Dharma Bums]], which I am reading now, and which has a lot more to do with nature, you get the feeling that the narrator (I forget his name off the top of my head) is more interested in Japhy than nature. Which is fine. Kerouac, I think, was probably more interested in people than nature, but his descriptions of nature do not always ring true to me. They feel like the descriptions of nature that a city-dweller would give (which, by the way, is what I am). Nature is an image representing escape from the city but there is no real knowledge or feel for nature in the descriptions. Nature is a mere antithesis to the city.<br /><br />The last small critique I have is with the frantic pace. The writing is very frantically paced and, as one negative reviewer put it, it sometimes feels like listening to a child narrate a story, a child who is too excited to take the time to explain how everything fits together and just starts throwing out fragments. Now, on one hand, the frantic pace is part of the appeal. Kerouac's style mirrors his subject. Dean is really the subject of the book and Dean is a frantic human being. So, I am not saying that Kerouac should have chosen to write this book in a less frantic style. He made the right artistic choice. However, I think the frantic style is really the expression of a kind of despair. Sal and Dean always seem to be chasing something, an ideal that remains forever out of reach, however, I think, in reality, they are probably both running away from something. There is a very strange scene in the book where Sal is in a movie theater and he falls asleep and imagines what it would be like if the usher swept him up with the rest of the garbage and he spent the rest of his life in a dump. Then Sal tells a story about a time he drank too much at a bar and fell asleep around the toilet while all the sailors came and urinated and spit on him.<br /><br />I have a feeling that Sal's desperate search for an identity is really motivated by self-hatred and the feeling that he is garbage. It is hard to imagine a more disgusting scenario than Sal wrapped around a toilet caked in spit and urine or a more powerful image of self-loathing. I think the frantic pace gets in the way of that kind of self-reflection and psychological insight. Sal and Dean are too busy frantically searching for \\""it\\"" to reflect on themselves or what they are doing or how they really feel. In some ways it is a very extroverted novel. The solution is always \\""out there\\"" somewhere on the road, never within. We get a lot of idealized images of the characters, ecstatic descriptions, etc., but not a ton of psychological insight. Sal does not seem all that interested in the real motives driving behavior. He is much more interested in the archetypal pattern that each character supposedly embodies. We wind up losing the reality of the characters to a certain degree. Dean becomes a force of nature rather than a real person at times. There are some exceptions, which I have already pointed out, some hints of Dean's history, and some poignant moments expressing his humanity, but we learn very little about Sal's history, or what has led to his desperate search for an identity. I think detailed psychological analyses would probably have been out of place in this novel, they would have slowed the pace, and subtracted from the overall effect. As a piece of art On the Road is probably as it should be. However, in terms of life, and the search for wisdom, I think his characters need to spend a little less time \\""leaning forward\\"" and a little more time examining the ground beneath their feet. Perhaps Kerouac does more of that in his later works.<br /><br />Despite those minor critiques this is still an excellent book that I would not hesitate to recommend to any and all.vie was so popular is a sign that a lot of people feel the same way. A lot of people are unhappy with the kind of life that is, supposedly, the life we all should be aspiring towards: a standard nine-to-five, good paying job, with possibility for promotional advancement, etc.. In the novel these are what Sal calls \\""white ambitions\\"". The term, and his portrayal of African Americans and other minorities in general, is a bit condescending, however, if we remove any racial overtones from the term, it names something real. A lot of people feel themselves out of touch with the values of mainstream society. It is not simply that they tried and failed, rather, even the possibility of success feels hollow and empty. When the best that society has to offer feels hollow and empty that is a problem. That is the kind of thing that leads to despair and even suicide. I am not sure that Kerouac's novel provides any air tight solutions to the problem. That is for individuals to work out for themselves. However, it does grapple seriously with the problem and will be an inspiration to anyone grappling with similar problems.<br /><br />Fifth, Kerouac is a good writer and there are a ton of beautiful, and genuinely lyrical passages in the novel. Kerouac's prose is ecstatic, he eschewed the naturalistic, direct prose of Hemingway and that whole line. When he wants to describe Dean, for example, he does not describe him as he actually looked in real life, he describes him as a demon, flying across the country and leaving nothing but scorched earth in his wake (that is a paraphrase, and a bad one, Kerouac's description is much more lyrical, but I am too lazy to search through the book to find it). I will provide one actual example of Kerouac's lyrical prose just to give a taste. This is Sal describing an ecstatic vision he has on the streets of San Francisco, after Dean has abandoned him, and he is essentially starving, \\""And for just a moment I had reached a point of ecstasy that I alwayswanted to reach, which was the complete step across chronological time into timeless shadows, and wonderment in the bleakness of the mortal realm, and the sensation of death kicking at my heels to move on, with a phantom dogging its own heels, and myself hurrying to a plank where all the angels dove off and flew into the holy void of uncreated emptiness\\"" (162). There is more but I will stop there. It is the part about the angels diving off into emptiness that I love.<br /><br />Finally, the last and final reason this novel is worth reading, is the same reason that all good novels are worth reading, it presents an interesting story, full of interesting characters, and gives beautiful expression to the human condition. Late in the book Sal encounters a tall old man with flowing white hair who tells him to \\""Go moan for man\\"". That is essentially what this book is: a moan for man. It expresses all the pain, suffering, uncertainty, and ultimately joy of living, in one giant moan, from end to end.<br /><br />Before I end I want to quickly mention a few critiques I have of the book. I already mentioned Kerouac's somewhat condescending portrayal of minorities. He romanticizes the lives of the oppressed and does not seem to have a whole lot of understanding of their actual condition. Besides that, I also feel like Kerouac lacks a real feel for nature. He often presents nature ecstatically, but it feels like he is presenting an idea he has of nature, as opposed to simply presenting nature directly (as in his descriptions, admittedly beautiful and moving, of the Mississippi river). He compares unfavorably, for example, with Henry David Thoreau who was a genuine and patient naturalist. Thoreau watched nature closely and could describe it in its tiniest details as it really was. Thoreau talks about how he would sometimes spend half a day standing in a river observing the behavior of a particular kind of fish. You could never imagine Kerouac doing anything like that. He is too frantic, and he is too in love with his idea of nature. Even in [[ASIN:0140042520 The Dharma Bums]], which I am reading now, and which has a lot more to do with nature, you get the feeling that the narrator (I forget his name off the top of my head) is more interested in Japhy than nature.

Regarding just the plot, I felt a little disappointed.  What was the physical goal?  What was the spiritual one?  Since this isn't a true autobiography, it seems like there was an opportunity to clean up the narrative, make it rise, twist on command, and resolve.  But instead I felt it just rambled, not really getting anywhere, and I often thought \\""haven't I already read this earlier?\\""<br /><br />2) Characters (4 stars) - Although the narrator is Sal Paradise (Kerouac), this is really a story of Dean Moriarty (Neal Cassidy).  And I thought Dean was fantastic.  He burned with energy.  But not just the physical kind--travel, sex, speed--but the mental kind as well--conversations, nuances, relationships.  Dean's energy made him impulsive, and that made his morals and maturity questionable; but it seemed like he realized this and in some ways tried to work on it.  Meanwhile, Paradise is a fine narrator, a calm and observant counterpoint to Dean's fire.<br /><br />3) Theme (3 stars) - There's something about freedom in here, about exploring everything life has to offer and then fully being in it.  But I didn't see much of the other side of that theme--about family and maturity, and how that too can be a part of life to experience and learn from.  So to me, the theme felt incomplete.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - The story of how On the Road was written is well chronicled, and the frenzied, Benzedrine-fueled prose shines and crackles and races.

I would probably have loved this book in  my 20s when the \\""open road\\"" seemed more promising and social conventions more constraining, but I must confess that at my much older age my latent bourgeois values render much of the aimless wanderlust, drinking and hedonism in \\""On The Road\\"" seem pointless and without meaning. The writing is good; it's crisp and evocative, and I particularly enjoyed his descriptions of their all-night parties and the jazz clubs they attended. It's well known that Kerouac wrote the book in three weeks on continuous streams of paper in order, I guess, to keep his stream of consciousness flowing.<br /><br />The characters on their road trips seemed to have no enduring purpose in getting to their destination but simply to party with friends and then to move on. It was almost weird to hear of all-night trips to get to a city on cars that were on the verge of a breakdown, and then they simply moved on, or went back to where they had come from. Much has been written of their irresponsibility, e.g., leaving wives, girl friends, and children behind, working for \\""party\\"" money and then quitting jobs, hustling people for money, stealing from gas stations, but I guess the excitement for the younger reader was the \\""living on the edge\\"" that these highway nomads experienced, like going across the country with only a few bucks, a broken-down car, and the need to find hitchhikers for gas and food money. This book would suggest that the beat movement meant listening to cool jazz while drinking and talking all night with similar-minded friends while finding enough interim low-level employment to fund such low-expense activities, and then driving across the country in two days to do the same thing on the other coast, and perhaps for a longer time if a generous aunt iswilling to provide funds.",2013-06-17

Sure the outlook of \\""new and fresh experience\\"" is great, but the way it's presented here is stale and repetitive. Not to mention the way in which new and fresh experiences are chased after.<br /><br /> Selfishness rules.<br /><br /> What about Deans abandoned children? 4 children to 3 different women criss-crossed all over the USA. What about their experience? Their father is a spaced out bum. And what for? What are his new experiences worth? There are no real life lessons, they learn nothing, Dean and Sal both go on about the majesty and magic in the small things and snapshots of a scene, and Dean runs strings of introspective thought to the point of driving himself mad, but what about the burned bridges? The peoples lives that he drifts in and out of and basically ruins. What about their story, a great writer would have found them more interesting to write about instead of romanticising the instigator of their problems.<br /><br /> There is a line at the end of part 2 where Sal leaves Dean and Marylou, and tells Dean: \\""No, you can't have my packed sandwiches,\\"" and you think sweet finally some conflict between characters but then they just pick up travelling again. It seems Sal just likes being used by dean. Which doesn't make me sympathize with him either.<br /> The fact that I'm analysing the incidentals of the characters, doesn't mean that I'm tricked into the story, I'm merely stating that the characters have no redeemable features, so why should I care about them? Why should I care about the ten thousand towns and roads and spots and sites that are listed in this book?<br />Is it meant to be the point of the piece, that what they \\""are searching for\\"" is a futile and endless dream?

Aside from Sal, the heroes are America, Mexico, the earth, human beings and existence.  When on the road, Sal is a new Beat version of a Steinbeck hero down to the dusty Okies with whom he picks cotton.  Long-suffering, indomitable Sal abandoned delirious with dysentery in Mexico City by the exploding angel he follows to catch burning, falling, fizzling sparks of truth before they burn out.  Now that I've finished, I've resolved to do two things: reread The Dharma Bums, the Subterraneans and Big Sur, to prove to myself that there is indeed Zen in Kerouac; and to listen to the jazz artists whom Sal and Dean dig so righteously everywhere they can be found.",2013-05-07

It could be considered boring since Sal is more of a decoration in the scenes he visits, but he is a man struggling with identity. How could he stand out? That's why he sticks with Dean, it's his ability to be who he is that attracts Sal to him. Finding yourself isn't always an exciting thing and in my opinion, it's a very realistic interpretation of that act.<br /><br />Maybe that's why this book is so powerful with people in their early twenties.

Hailed as a definitive Beat Generation novel, it chronicles Sal's exploration for meaning, self-identity and independence. The search for self-realization becomes a repeated theme throughout, as Sal and Dean experience America through travel and adventure.<br /><br />On the positive side, I found the travel aspect to the novel compelling and interesting. Kerouac's description of the places and the people make the journeys very authentic and real. It's clear from reading that he is excited about the prospects of being on the move. I think readers can readily identify with Sal and Dean's experiencing the world through a road trip, meeting people along the way, and making connections. Sal wants to make his way in the world by connecting to the people in the places he visits and the road itself is symbolic of that freedom and expression. The spirit of adventure, going out on the open road and experiencing the many diverse cities and town, and being a part of the world is something that Kerouac does manage to eloquently capture.<br /><br />However, the primary characters were unlikable and the ideas and philosophies projected were rather shallow. Sal has only flickering glimpses into any deep perspective about what this whole sense of self-discovery is and what life experiences ultimately mean to him; he is way too busy writing in a rambling, mile-a-minute fashion that catalogues everything and every \\""kick\\"" without giving much substance to the moment. I waited for a big revelation at the conclusion, but never really got one. Sure, there are seldom moments where it appears that Sal is pushing away the world of wild, reckless abandon that Dean promotes and settling down to a more stable life, but these moments are rather fleeting and minimal. Sal's inspiration primarily comes through his idolizationof Dean. Dean appears to be the poster child for the irresponsible, immature con-man. He flakes on his friends, cheats on his wife (or wives) repeatedly, has illegitimate children on a whim, constantly is in and out of prison for breaking the law, and looks for others to bail him out of trouble. He is the ultimate man-child, never wanting to grow up. It was difficult to understand how Sal worshiped this guy.<br /><br />Much of the book's appeal comes through its associations with the Beat Generation and the visions this movement projects, but in the end I just couldn't readily identify with On the Road or its characters. Too much cool hipster bravado with little depth.",2013-01-02

Dean and Sal capitol 'L' love each other, even a total prude could see that, unfortunately they are too busy being self absorbed, hopelessly casual trouble makers to really make anything of it. Their longings for some ineffable, epiphanic experience which will lay their lives bare is vastly less interesting and vastly less sincere than their simple longing for each other (their chasing after each other forms the basic motivating action in the book, after all).

Holding Dean in such high esteem, looking up to him as his idol, when Dean didn't make much of an impression on me.

While I feel too much of a cynic to believe that I would have been swept away with its charm and sense of adventure, there was a time of my life where I was swayed by Daniel Quinn's Ishmael.  I wanted to try to read it without cynicism or preconceived notions: this was difficult, of course, because the novel has been heralded by critics and audiences alike.  I'm not sure that I would say that I hate the book, now that I'm done with it, but I really don't like it.<br /><br />Modern Library (an affiliate of Random House) listed the novel in its top 100 novels of the 20th century.  On the Road is listed as #55 on the list.  Accordingly, On the Road is greater than Burgess's A Clockwork Orange or Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye or Joyce's Finnegan's Wake or Hemmingway's A Farewell to Arms or any number of books that didn't quite reach the top 100.  Kerouac's book is also included on Time's list of 100 greatest English-language novels since 1923.  What is it that I'm missing here?<br /><br />On the Road follows Sal Paradise as he meets up with a near-legendary figure, Dean Moriarty.  Moriarty is a free-spirit type who doesn't want to be tied down by conventions like social contracts, civic duties, or families - especially families - children, what a bummer!  The two meet up a few times over the course of a few years, and together, they cross miles and miles of America.  That's about it in terms of the plot of the book.<br /><br />Kerouac's novel was revolutionary at its time - for the straight-laced 1950's, it's spirit of adventure and freewheeling carelessness had to be both exciting and dangerous.  In today's time, the characters come across as selfish, foolish, and irresponsible.  The novel helped usher in a new era of art: the Beat period.  Along with Ginsburg's \\""Howl,\\"" On the Road defined a way of living, and for that, the novel is absolutely noteworthy.  The novel is a great piece of history - a snapshot of a time, or a glimpse at the way things were.  The novel is not, however, great literature.<br /><br />The protagonist and narrator, Sal Paradise, isn't even the main character in his own story.  Through reading On the Road, I felt sorrow, more than anything.  I don't see how this could come across as anything less than condescending, but I felt bad for Paradise, who wasn't even the lead character in his own life.  He is uninteresting, he is overly suggestible, and he is a man of complete inaction.  Almost every moment of the novel consists of either Paradise wondering where his friend Dean is, following Dean around, or drooling over Dean's easygoing, manic lifestyle.  When Dean decided to leave his bummer of a second-wife, who was always crying/screaming because Moriarty wouldn't take into consideration their daughter?  When Dean breaks his thumb trying to beat his ex-girlfriend?  When Dean decided to leave behind his sick friends in Mexico?  This feels hardly like a man who has been taken with the spirit of life and more like a selfish piece of trash.  The half-baked philosophies of Paradise and Moriarty - the musings about life, the universe, and what it's all about - don't even come across as insight as much as just baseless confusion.<br /><br />Sal Paradise is hard to begrudge in On the Road - he's mostly harmless as the passenger to Moriarty.  Dean Moriarty, on the other hand, is pretty despicable.  He's a man with no sense of foresight, empathy, or will.  Life has devolved to a hedonistic adventure for him, and he has to frequently run around town looking for \\""kicks\\"" to entertain himself. These \\""kicks\\"" usually involve using people, spending their money, drinking alcohol, or all three at once.  What makes On the Road unbearable is that the narrator is Moriarty's number one fan: if readers hate Moriarty, they must spend 300 pages with someone madly in love with him.<br /><br />A quarter of the way through the novel, I was hoping thatthe ending would involve Paradise turning his back on Moriarty, through some realization of how absolutely expendable everyone is to Moriarty.  This ending never came though, and in fact, no ending came at all.  On the Road features almost no character development.  Even though it spans the length of years, no one actually changes - we find the same characters doing the same things and falling into the same patterns of behavior.  There was no catharsis, no pivotal moments, no epiphanies, no deep insights, no realizations, no nothing.<br /><br />While reading On the Road, I couldn't help but constantly wonder about why the prose felt so uneven.  There was just something about it that didn't flow well with me.  I love Cormac McCarthy's minimalist writing, and I love David Foster Wallace's maximalist takes - what was it about Kerouac's writing that felt so vague and weird?  Many readers seem to talk about the flow of On the Road as being jazzy, and this to some extent, is accurate: some of the staccato words and abrupt transitions work well to give it the feeling of jazz music, but on the whole, it simply doesn't work.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I realized that it was written over the course of a matter of weeks, and originally, it was just one long paragraph, typed out on a 120 foot scroll of paper.  On the Road is stream-of-conscious, but then again it's not.  The book doesn't mimic patterns of thought, like Wolfe, Joyce, or Faulkner, but instead, it feels more like the writing of someone hurriedly writing, trying to capture everything before they forget it all.  The issue is that it feels rushed, but it's presented as a standard novel.  Had the story unfolded as it was typed (in one long paragraph), I think the flow would have worked for the better, but as it stands now, it feels broken.<br /><br />After hearing about how this novel was (and still is) a life-changing moment for people in their early 20's, and I have to wonder, who are these people?

After completing \\""On The Road\\"", the bittersweet tome to untamed youth, changing social mores, and the erratic genius of Neal Cassady, I thought a review might make a good companion piece to my review of Rand's bulky steampunk fantasy/mindporn for goldbugs. The two books have seemingly little in common other than having been published at roughly the same time. Where Rand rambles, ripostes and repeats herself through over a thousand pages, Kerouac's terse but soulful take on disaffected mid-century youth seeking what Rabelais called their \\""great perhaps\\"" took barely three weeks to write and clocks in at a slender 250 or so pages. Rand's book concerns itself exclusively with affluent businesspeople, Kerouac's with bums, poets and dreamers. But a closer look reveals more similarities than differences between the two. Allow me to enumerate the arguments that have led me to this conclusion. To wit:<br /><br />1. The magnetic yet misanthropic genius anti-hero. Rand's John Galt is a man who has turned his back on a society into which he doesn't fit; he's done this because of what he sees as a lack of appreciation for his vision, ability, and individuality. So goes Dean Moriarty, the erratic, faintly dickish, brilliant and unreliable force of nature at the center of Kerouac's book. Both men draw strict lines between \\""their world\\"" and \\""the real world\\"" and live their lives accordingly - they work in menial jobs that they consider only marginal to the true purpose of their interior lives, they effortlessly become the lead characters in the lives of everyone around them by sheer force of personality, and each has a capacity for the casual destruction of a status quo that is crucial to those around them but that they regard as merely being in their way - and they're adored for it, even as each man watches the world burn in a conflagration that he gleefully started, often with those they love the most bearing the brunt of the collateral damage.<br /><br />2. Lead characters whose every move is manipulated, usually involuntarily, by the anti-heroes who hold them in thrall. Dagny Taggart can't understand why her business endeavors keep failing, unaware that Galt is sabotaging her at every turn. Sal Paradise is initially unable to see that the promise of liberation extended by Moriarty comes at a price he can't afford. Although the outcomes resulting from this misplaced loyalty end up being polar opposites, both Dagny and Sal cannot deny the transformation that their lives have undergone or the lessons they've learned at the hands of these quasi-abusive loves. Halfhearted efforts on the part of both to break away are met with only a further tightening of the hold these charming sociopaths are able to exert over them.<br /><br />3. Hardcore homosexual undercurrents. One of my favorite elements of \\""Atlas Shrugged\\"" was the coyly-presented yet totally obvious homosexual undertones in the relationship between Hank Rearden (switch one letter around and his name becomes \\""Rearend\\"", tee hee)and Francisco D'Anconia. In \\""On The Road\\"", while there's nothing to indicate homoeroticism between Sal and Dean, there's plenty of dancing around on the subject of Dean and Carlo Marx, the smitten gay man who waits around until the middle of the night to steal a few hours \\""mentoring\\"" Dean in the latter character's poignant thirst for knowledge. While the originally published edition of \\""On The Road\\"" is meticulously sanitized of any direct references to the real-life affair between Neal Cassady and Carlo Marx prototype Allen Ginsberg, any reasonably well-read person who knows the real-life back story can plainly see it between the lines. And then there's Old Bull Lee/William S. Burroughs, who appears in a brief but pivotal section of \\""On The Road\\"" - any mention of Burroughs anywhere tends to bring with it all the queer psychological baggage that dogged this particular genius until the day he died.<br /><br />4. Colorado is not just a setting but an actual character in each of these books - Galt's Gulch as the ultimate libertarian utopia in \\""Atlas\\"", Denver and the ghost town/tourist trap Central City as the ultimate hedonistic utopia in \\""Road\\"". Carlo Marx has his Denver Doldrums, Ellis Wyatt has his Wyatt's Torch. Each of these things symbolizes the rape and ruin of the unspoiled Rockies.<br /><br />5. Each book finds its ultimate happy ending in the lead characters' eleventh-hour discovery of the true selves they are seeking - in Dagny's case as a pioneer in a new libertarian society, in Sal's case as a successful writer settled into domesticity with his true love, Laura. Again, these discoveries lead to polar opposite outcomes for both Dagny and Sal vis a vis the chaotic anti-hero. Dagny proudly takes her place permanently by Galt's side, but Sal only achieves peace upon reluctantly cutting Dean loose.<br /><br />6. Both generated controversy (and sales) with their introduction of previously unheard-of concepts in literature, and each in its own way was a philosophical manifesto disguised as fiction. Rand put forth an idea that capitalism isn't just a socioeconomic system, but nothing less than a manifestation of the exultation of the self. Kerouac for his part created a blueprint for self-discovery that is still utilized by youth everywhere - finding inner meaning by absorbing as much of the outside world around the self as possible.<br /><br />As for the current movie versions of both of these books, I've been advised by a number of people to stay away from the multi-part adaptation of \\""Atlas\\"", which is understandable as most of the action in that book doesn't really lend itself to a good cinematic story, apart from the isolated scene hereand there. I'm actually looking forward to the \\""On The Road\\"" movie, mostly just for the lulz that are certain to be derived from watching that grumpy-looking \\""Twilight\\"" actress play Marylou in the scene where she masturbates Dean and Sal simultaneously while riding nude in a moving car.",2012-11-13

The birthplace of Jack Kerouac was and still is essentially a working class town. Blue collar. Salt of the earth.<br /><br />This was the milieu from which Kerouac sprung.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the world would've been like had Ti Jean never been born -- it's not just On the Road that we would lack. But I honestly feel there couldn't've been a Tom Robbins. Maybe Allen Ginsberg would have never developed the confidence in his poetry to show it to the world. \\""Howl\\"" may have never been writ. Think of it: no 6 Gallery. No San Francisco Renaissance, no Beats.<br /><br />You say there may have been somebody else to fill that void were Kerouac never born. But are you sure? Really?<br /><br />Frankly, Ti Jean made the world safe for Ken Kesey.<br /><br />And I hafta tell ya's sump'n. Until I read Ken Kesey, I wrote conventional, expository prose -- with all the proper punctuation and everything. Now some of ya's might've thought that would be pretty neat:<br />me writing all conventional-like and all, putting all my periods in the right places and so on and so forth. But reading Kesey showed me the possibilities -- how to push the envelope a little bit. And what I later discovered is he learned alla that from Kerouac.

After all, he took ordinary folks and made em heroes in his own books. In that way, his novels were incredibly liberating and wonderful.<br /><br />But are the characters in Ti Jean's novels \\""heroes\\"" in the conventional sense of the word? Do they rescue kitty cats from trees and such? Are they suitable role models for kids to emulate ... ? Not really.<br />It really doesn't even matter. Because that's not what those novels were all about, anyway. Dean Moriarty is no more of a \\""hero\\"" than was my dad ... Ya know? I mean, he was just kinda like a bum, on the road. Driving. But see ... On the Road made those kinda things \\""heroic\\"" in a round about sorta way. It made my dad a hero! 'Cos those are the things my dad did!<br />It made what we do matter!! Us.<br /><br />'Cos those novels aren't about larger-than-life types. They are not some untouchable super-hero type guy with the prettiest girlfriend and alla that. Sometimes -- I mean -- they're even kinda a little rough around the edges. They screw up. They make mistakes. They're human!!!<br />But they are so sympathetically drawn that you kinda think, hey! -- that's okay. You just want em -- I mean -- you want em to succeed 'cos they're just like you!! See ... ? That's how profound Kerouac's artistry truly was. 'Cos he'd make you ... he'd make you see the hero in all of us. He made you understand that even our ordinary lives is the stuff of heroic dimension!! He showed us that our lives meant something -- we are capable of redemption. No!! Not that ... ! That we ARE redemption!!!<br /><br />His novels are life-affirming, joyous blasts!! THERE!!!<br /><br />And such joy -- such wondrous hedonism, all the craziness just flew in the face of the dullness and the complacency of the times. It's like, everything was alright with Ike. But the kids were itchin to rock!!! And Kerouac's books, his life, his friends -- everybody!!! -- was a rock thru the shop window of the dull conformity -- the McCarthy fueled fears and paranoia of the mid-1950s. On the Road proclaimed, exclaimed,yelled with a barbaric YAWP -- screamed that YOU can be free (if ya wanna be). Just hit the road, Jack!! Hit the damn road!!! Be a bum, a Dharma Bum.

Set in post World War 2 America, a time when few strayed far from their birthplace, On the Road chronicles years of alcohol and drug fueled adventures and misadventures.  Defining the beat generation, Kerouac's characters shirk all responsibilities, including family, to set out in search of enlightenment.<br />  The character, Sal, is a seemingly lonely aspiring writer who is stuck in a rut and ripe for change and excitement in his life.  A recent illness, separation from his wife coupled with long time dreams of travel have brought Sal to a boiling point.  Sal's life takes that turn he's been looking for when he meets Dean.  Although he's known of him for years, Sal has never physically met Dean before but none of that matters as the two have an instant connection.  Not long after meeting Dean, Sal's life becomes, \\""A mad swirl of everything . . . in a big dust cloud over the American Night.\\""<br />  Dean has committed himself to living a carefree and careless existence void of any responsibility, duty, and at times loyalty.  Even after leaving his wife and child to go on the road, Dean shows little, to no,  remorse.  Dean has a methodical madness about him that almost makes it seem as though his chaotic life is actually going according to some plan.  Sal is initially enthralled by this and is gladly taken under Dean's wing.<br />  What follows are years of roaming, searching for meaning, and looking for and at life through eyes clouded by booze, drugs, sex, and jazz.  Sal and Dean travel the country together and separately at times, neither one settling in one place for very long.  Friendships blossom and wither, love is found and lost and through it all Sal and Dean keep finding each other and pressing on.<br />  Years pass as the two log thousands of miles.  Denver, San Fransisco, New York, Chicago and all points in between.  However, the years and miles begin to take its toll on Sal.  He begins to grow weary of the life and weary of some of the friendships formed along the way, including his bond with Dean.  After becoming ill with dysentary in Mexico City, Dean abandons Sal in order to return to New York for a girl.  It is at this point that Sal finally sees all of the flaws in Dean's character; significant flaws that have had an enormous impact on his own life.  Sal, upon feeling better, returns to New York where he meets Laura, \\""the girl . . . that I had always searched for and for so long.\\"", falls in love and plans a life without Dean Moriarty.<br />  Kerouac's almost manic style of writing serves this book well.  It helps capture the madness of those years spent crisscrossing America.  It makes the book hard to put down as you can almost picture yourself hitchiking alongside Sal in the desert or feel your heart pounding as they drive an \\""old jalopy\\"" as fast as it will go.  This book will make you want to see what's out there, to travel, and to have some excitement in your life.<br />  I first read On the Road when I was sixteen years old and it had a profound impact on my life leading to years of travel, countless addresses and that ever present longing for change and adventure.  I felt that  we only have a short time on this earth and we need to pack as much into this life as possible.  Decades later, it is still a book that I blow the dust off of every few years for another read.  As a teen it portrayed a life of travel, adventure and excitement.  As I age, I see this book not as a search for fullfilment but as a testament to uncertainty and emptiness.  You can spend your whole life searching, but if you don't know what you're looking for, you'll never find it.",2012-10-13

Dialog, though, is not the only period-specific aspect of this iconic semi-autobiographical novel.  Kerouac's fictional name here is Sal Paradise, and his maniacal friend Dean Moriarty stands in for the real Neal Cassady.  These two traverse the country multiple times and finally foray into Mexico so that Dean can get a quickie divorce and marry his third wife.  Their means of transportation varies depending on how much money they have on hand, from GI benefits or short-term odd jobs or the good will of friends and relatives.  If they're flush with cash, they can travel by bus or perhaps even buy a jalopy; otherwise, they hitchhike or join other travelers in a sort of carpool arranged by a travel bureau.  Maybe Kerouac invented this ride-sharing idea for the purpose of the book, because it certainly seems outlandish that anyone would allow these itinerants to drive a Cadillac cross-country.  Wishful thinking, maybe?  I originally read this book in the 70s and don't remember my reaction.  Now that I've reread it, I have to hope that the movie, if it is ever released, will be an improvement, because the nonstop drinking and carousing just didn't make for an appealing story.  Also, there's no plot per se; it's just a drunken-buddies-on the-road saga with exactly zero strong women characters.

Kerouac loved writing poetry as well as writing prose, and so he writes a highly poetic prose, still in a mostly common language, while never ruining the narrative movement of the book. Just dig the words, man, woman, and the way the words are linked to leap up and to leap inside to the depths of soul. Another cool thing about the book is the dialogue. Kerouac does a great job of catching the rhythms of American speech and of his individual characters, especially the speech of madman Dean Moriarty/Neal Cassady. A third aspect of the novel rarely discussed is the humor. Yes, along with the high enthusiasm and the beat downism, you have sly humor--especially in the Bull Lee sections--plus outright jokes.

Tramping both alone and with pals, Sal hitches rides, takes cross-country busses, and uses borrowed cars - sometimes scuffling gas money from odd jobs, sometimes picking up hitchhikers for the same.  Ironically, Sal and his companions never hop any freight trains, the preferred mode of transport for prior generations of hoboes and vagabonds.

Sal has a couple flings in those days before the pill, and perhaps too many (he might say too few) visits to jazz honky-tonks and beer bashes.  Yet just as powerful as these earthly desires is the thirst to keep moving, which Sal does between rest stops at his Aunt's house in New Jersey.

It is an endlessly maudlin, corrupt, and amoral tale that spins in tiresome circles with no point, no plot, no progression, and no pity (for the reader, that is). The story chronicles the friendship---no, the morbid affinity---of Sal Paradise, a fatherless, aimless, brainless writer, and Dean Moriarty, a younger but more accomplished reprobate and profligate, as they embark on series of reckless, misdemeanor-laden, cross-country road trips between New York, New Orleans, Denver, Los Angeles, and Mexico City. To hear Kerouac tell it, the entire American heartland is a barren plateau whose best and highest purpose is to be driven over as quickly as possible. Nothing worthwhile to see or appreciate in the entire country or in the cities just named except seamy jazz dives, migrant labor camps, and backwater hovels of every stripe.     Dean Moriarty is a remorseless womanizer whose unbridled carnality, successive love affairs, and serial divorces, inspire an inexplicable worship in Sal, who reveres Dean as a saint of personal freedom and a visionary of sublime intellect. In truth, Sal is an insipid, undiscerning idiot, and Moriarty is a prodigal, blathering, sociopathic ass. The admiration Sal repeatedly expresses for Dean is as becoming as an adult gushing over the sagacity and free-spiritedness of a hyperactive two-year-old hellion who hasn't mastered basic language skills and destroys everything he touches.     I can think of no novel with so undeserved a literary reputation as this revolting offscouring of Kerouac's drug-addled, booze-soaked mind. The prose itself, in places, is nearly unreadable. As one critic put it, \\""That's not writing, it's typing.\\"" The characters have no capacity for critical self-examination or introspection (except when high) and, thus, are not worthy of serious contemplation by the reader. They are base metals, common shale, chaff, mud. They embody the values of that vast population of incarcerated delinquents that scourge the decent half of society, the spoiled and worthless fruits of an indulgent civilization. What's to appreciate in this sordid account of an incessantly sweaty, crotch-stroking, thieving, dope-shooting fornicator who hurls stolen automobiles along the highway in complete disregard for his own or others' safety?

This must have been in 1959 and I was seventeen or eighteen.  It changed my life, or at least my outlook on life.  I decided to be a beatnik and travel the road like Sal Paradise.  Not long after, I visited a friend at a nearby college and, fortunately, decided instead that college life was for me, Man!  I would spend the rest of my life in, on, or near college campuses.  (But I have been on the road.  I have driven cross country sixteen times, more than old Kerouac, and played at times at being a bohemian.)      Rereading On the Road now as a professor emeritus I do not see the appeal that it had for me and so many others back then.  I mean I do not see the appeal of the lifestyle pursued so frantically by Dean and Sal and their crazy friends.  The book is very sad.  \\""Sad\\"" is the most common adjective in the novel, used on almost every page.  The following passage from the beginning of Part Four sums up what their on the road life comes to:  \\""...the raggedy madness and riot of our actual lives, our actual night, the hell of it, the senseless nightmare road.  All of it inside endless and beginningless emptiness.  Pitiful forms of ignorance.\\""  This is what it comes to.  No more bleak and depressing life can be imagined.      Of course, On the Road is a literary masterpiece and classic of American literature.  It makes an adventure of American life.  It is awash with the vast American expanse.  It does not look to Paris, London, the Old World of Europe for inspiration, but to us.  It represents the exuberance and relief after World War II.  It is written with excruciating intensity and energy.  And of course the characters, drawn from real life, are infinitely engaging if also depressingly adolescent and shallow.    Parts Four and Five are truly brilliant and unsurpassed in literary passion.  They are much deeper, darker, and more gripping than the first three parts.  The description of the trip to Mexico Citystands alone as a literary tour-de-force.    The life, and vision, and passion of Dean and Sal were unsustainable.  Neal Cassady and Jack Kerouac both died in their forties of physical self-abuse.  Was it worth it?  I'm glad I had enough sense not to follow them.

First, Kerouac is a fairly quick read, although I found the book a bit monotonous by the end.  Kerouac wisely ends the book before the narrative becomes too tedious.    Second, after reading only a few dozen pages, you know that On The Road is an important book, since its style and substance have been imitated so many times.  The book that I think it compares most favorably to is Huckleberry Finn.    Third, I really thought I'd be treated to Kerouac's deep immersion into beat culture.  I was, but only to a limited degree.  What I found fascinating about the book was a feeling of distance that Kerouac seemed to convey, as if he was tangent to beat culture, but not necessarily a part of it in the way that Neal Cassady (Dean Moriarty) and Allen Ginsburg (Carlo Marx) really were.  I almost got the impression of Kerouac being an interested observer, but a somewhat wary participant (with some exceptions).  When you compare Kerouac's opinion of hippie culture with those of Cassady and Ginsburg, I think this becomes even more pronounced.    I thought the book had a sense of fatalism:  that Kerouac always knew that these road adventures were only an interlude in his life, but for others, esepcially Cassady, that they were a way of life that probably would lead to a bad end.

Sal Paradise/Jack Kerouac shares with us his search for...I don't know what.  ON THE ROAD recounts some of Kerouac's traveling adventures but the true mystique lies in the fast, reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous lives he and his beatnik buddies lead.  Apparently, in the late 1940's, a broke, semi-homeless hitchhiker was the cool thing to be.  Kerouac's semi-autobiographical prose is quite poetic.  But I hope there is more fiction than fact in this tale, because the characters in this novel are a bunch of misfits.       In the midst of these road trips across America (and Mexico at the novel's climax) there's a lot of drugs, alcohol, womanizing, and stealing going on; all the things your mommy tells you not to do.  Yet what I find most fascinating are some of the characters Jack partied with, some of whom became pioneers in the beatnik literary movement.    Here's a little breakdown on who's who:  Dean Moriarty=Neal Cassady  Carlo Marx=Allan Ginsberg  Bull Lee=William Burroughs      Each of these literary figures partied way too hard and it's their life spans that amaze me.    Dean Moriarty/Neal Cassady was a major drinker and the biggest A-hole in literature.  He's selfish, irresponsible, and untrustworthy.  He was also an absent father and a womanizer, just to name a few.  But you can't help loving the guy because he knows how to have a good time.  Cassady died in 1968 at the age of 41.  The cause of his death was unknown but drugs were involved.  No surprise there.       Sal Paradise/Jack Kerouac died in 1969 at the age of 47 from an internal hemorrhage.  A lifetime of drinking was the cause.      Carlo Marx/Allan Ginsberg, to my shock, also a heavy drinker and drug user, died in 1997 at the age of 70.    Here's the real kicker:  Bull Lee/William Burroughs died in 1997 at age 83.  Not only was he a big drinker, but he was a heroin addict.  He also got away with \\""accidentally\\"" shooting his wife in the head in Mexico during what he says was a drunken game of William Tell.  Go figure.        ON THE ROAD really focuses most on Dean Moriarty.  Sal Paradise is obsessed with Dean's free spirit.  This book deserves to be canonized as one of the best works of modern literature.",2010-01-11

Rather than being brilliant, he found the book to be a collection of insane ramblings and occurances that could only be interesting to Kerouac himself. It was about a man on a search for truth and meaning in the world, but he went about this by getting drunk and pretending that he liked poor people. However, when he saw true poor people in Mexico, he thought about how terrible it would be to be them. This made no sense. The philosophy for a better life was more vapid and meaningless than the life Sal was leading before Dean came around. Rather than changing the emperor's life, it made him long to have 4 hours of his life back. However, he was afraid to look like an idiot, and told the salesmen that it was the best book he had ever read. They were delighted, and told him he qualified for a special fabric...one that was invisible to everyone except those who loved \\""On the Road\\"". The emperor couldn't see the fabric, but eagerly bought it. He then arranged for a public reading of \\""On the Road\\"", and told the townspeople how only intelligent people liked the novella.

I was done before the trained pulled in to Cannes and wanted to get back on the road immediately.

The description of Dean as the best car parker in the world is enough cause to read \\""On the Road.\\"" Bull Lee who is William Burroughs and makes a brief appearance is also one of that generation to influence the next generation. There are never times when you feel trapped in the car with Sal, but rather wanting to see what is around the next bend. His style in his later works goes into a more rant-like-Burroughs-influenced-style but this book is concise and one of his easier reads. There are few books that have a monumental influence on not just one generation but several, this book should be read for that reason alone.",2009-08-28

Reading reviews, you'll encounter that in it, \\""Jack Kerouac captured the spirit that was seething underneath 1950s conformity\\"". This is high praise, and for someone in the 1950s reading this book, or at least someone who understands what the 1950s were in the United States, the praise is probably true.    But for me, reading this book in 2009, and being very far, both physically and philosophically, from the Beat movement, it is difficult to find a lot of appeal in \\""On the road\\"".    Yes, the author did a great job describing the \\""road bug\\"" many of us, regarding of sex, age and location, are feeling from time to time. The need to roam and travel is an ancient instinct buried deep into our genes. But there is travel, and there is travel. I'm all for road-trips, visiting unusual places and meeting interesting people from different backgrounds. But does it have to be accompanied by a constant state of drugged delirium, be it from marijuana ('tea' as they call it in the book...) or alcohol? Does it have to involve hunger, abysmal states of hygiene and personal health? Is it a must to be involved in stealing, deception and other minor crimes along the way? This is hard for me to believe and to understand.    I've heard that the book used to be a required reading in some American schools. I wonder what it really has to teach. It's based on real characters and is semi-autobiographic. I can bet parts of the book were written in a delirious state induced by some kind of drugs, and I've read that the author has died in a young age from alcoholism, which isn't surprising.    To conclude, this book is probably only suitable for two kinds of readers. The first is people who lead the life described in it. The second is people who have some intimate understanding of the life in the 1950s in the USA, who lived back then or just have a historic interest in the Beat movement.

Not only did Kerouac help define the prototypical American road trip saga, but he transformed that motif into a surprisingly melancholy treatise on self-discovery and nonconformity.  Kerouac's Beat slanguage isn't much to get excited about anymore, nor are the characters. It's now quite laughable that people used to worship the scatterbrained deadbeat freeloader Dean Moriarty as some kind of visionary prophet. But Kerouac's real-life road trips through the underbellies of America (plus a comparative sojourn through Mexico) allowed him to shed great light on the outsiders who had been left behind by America's unequal prosperity or who had gleefully rejected the squeaky clean conformity of the post-WW2 years. Kerouac himself represented the sense of aimlessness and failure that was forced upon free thinkers and outsiders - then and now. This book is often lionized for its Beat credentials, but forget that. Any passing fad can deliver a classic that transcends boundaries and delivers a more universal message.

I didn't like it.  I made it about halfway through the book but was frusterated with it because it seemed to lack dialogue as an accelerant for the story.  Instead, it had these long, flowing, poetic sentences...and it all confused me at the time.<br /><br />A few years later I came back to this book, \\""On the Road\\"" and I was able to read it through.  I liked the setting and the exploration of America because I too, love America. This is an America rarely captured. Kerouac's exploration takes place in the confusing time shortly after WWII and the 1950s that everyone assumed that Kerouac was rebelling against.  The America contained in this book is an America that only still exists in small pockets, mostly in the midwest, in small forgotten areas of old highway. Enough of that sentimental romanticism though.<br /><br />I do have problems with \\""On the Road\\"".  Most of these issues are not with the book itself, but with so much that's been said about it and the fact that every hipster owns a copy and so few must actually read it.  Bah! As for the book itself, I sometimes get frustereated with the lull during the period where Sal is working as a migrant farmer.  The story moves quickly until this point... and then there's the rapid speed afterwards.  Maybe it serves a point, or maybe Jack was just so enamoured of that time in his travels that he had difficulty moving onto the book at large.  It is a heartbreaking departure though.<br /><br />In the end, the brunt of the problems I have with \\""On the Road\\"" are apocraphal.  The people contained in this book, especially Neal Cassidy, would struggle with having been defined by Kerouac; living up to a fictionalised portrayal.

I suppose that's fittign though.<br /><br />What do I like about \\""On the Road\\""? I like Kerouac's spontanious prose; the sense that he's across from you and rambling on about these sojourns.

I understand that the depiction of Dean Moriarty (Neal Cassady) is supposed to be representative of life, of the Christ figure, of the wild madness and crazy desire to grasp and understand life's meaning. But, overall, this is a book about some people who, at their core, are sad, lonely, unfulfilled, irresponsible, and out for themselves. At the end of the day, Dean Moriarty deserts his wife and abandons his children on a regular basis. Sal (Kerouac) blows his GI money on marijuana and Mexican whores.

At least one scholar suggests that Kerouac wrote in three phases. First, he captured his experiences as they happened or soon after in notebooks. Second, he wrote about his experiences in letters. Third, he refined it all into his manuscripts. Even the latter he edited multiple times.<br /><br />Regardless, Kerouac set forth - as he stated in his own letters - to invent a new way of writing. Most agree that he succeeded with his stream-of-consciouness style. Some say he changed the American novel.<br /><br />In any event, to really enjoy On The Road as Kerouac intended, just read it. Fluently. Don't try to make sense of it intellectually at every turn. Experience the timing of his writing, how it slows down and speeds up and pauses. How it glides and stutters. How it wanders - just like our thoughts! Re-read sections. Much of it is like poetry - it's not just about the meaning but about the sound and the texture of words.<br /><br />Of course, along the way enjoy the story.

Too much of what was beat seems in retrospect self-promotion. Certainly, Kerouac was a passionate cat, but whatever truths he offered--buddhistic and otherwise--don't fit well with the alcoholic he became, or the anti-Semitic remarks that occasionally burst out of him. Ginsberg, according to Caroline Cassidy, was a misogynist, which the underground movie Pull My Daisy seems to confirm. Kesey, who was a bridge of sorts between beats and hippies, is mightily disliked as a sef-centered creep by more than a few who knew him, including the late Abbie Hoffman.

This book is about the characters, their spirit, their yearnings, and their wanderings.  It's about life.  That's more than enough plot for me!<br /><br />Now, if you're looking for a formulaic book, with a clear-cut rising and falling plot, this might not be for you.  And, if you are bothered by characters that are reckless, irresponsible, and often somewhat childish, this book might not appeal.<br /><br />But if you're focusing on these things, and not on the life and energy of the writing and the characters . . . if you miss the driving spirit behind the cross-country drives, then you're focusing on the wrong things.  At least, I think so.<br /><br />A very good book.",2008-03-30

Sal and Dean hit the road like so many characters before them, both real and fictional, in search of something intangible and not quite conceivable. They are driven by a restless lust for life and for whatever they can find in the next state or country.

Sal and Dean's crossings of America are always both alluring and inspiring, however it is when they cross the Rio Grande that this novel truly kicks into life. Kerouac's prose in describing the Mexican landscape, people and exploits of the pair is quite simply without parallel. The reader is immediately intoxicated by the sun-baked Latin American atmosphere and the tequila-drenched hedonism that it brings.    Throughout the entire convoluted and charismatic tale runs the relationship between Dean and Sal which, some would argue, is the entire focus of the book. It is a close relationship but one that is plagued and damaged, perhaps irreparably, by Dean's impetuous nature and self absorption.

In the case of On the Road by Jack Kerouac, I completely changed my mind on a recent rereading; it is great and will be considered so a hundred years from now.  It’s difficult for people who did not come of age in the years just after World War II and prior to the sixties to understand the ‘Beat Generation’ subgroup of the Silent Generation. Sixty million human beings had been wiped out in anger, including millions exterminated just for being what they were, Gypsies, Jews, Chinese, mentally impaired and others. The first World war ended with the promise it was the war to end war. But before the bodies were cold in the forties, the world was again turned upside down, and huge numbers no longer had faith in their God. Already the great powers were lining up against each other, and many young adults simply could not return home and accept life as it had been.  Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and others demanded something different in such a world, and the result was a generation of artists and ordinary people who would not be satisfied with simply joining the American middle class of the late forties and fifties. These ‘beats’ rejected the dream of the greatest generation to buy homes in the suburbs, reproduce and become great consumers.  As I look back, I can see a faint connection between the beatniks and the American Transcendentalists. In the great novel of the generation, On the Road, Kerouac captures all of the longing and the restlessness of the cohort, the inability set roots, the need for love and sexual experimentation, the willingness to take the risks of drugs for the psychedelic euphoria, the commitment to friends and the rejection of of the unexamined life.  Jack’s style is simple and direct and one can easily enter the beat world and be part of the band as it flies into the new worlds beyond the East Coast and to take up the bohemian lifestyle that few among us dared. The almost nihilistic adventures of Kerouac and his companions as they raced south and west was enriching to read but beyond all but the bravest and most daring, but to observe from the safety of home the travels of Sal Paradise and his wild buddies is to open our eyes to the possibilities of alternate lifestyles without having to scrounge for gas ourselves.

It's tedious in a novel like this - its like someone talking to you forever, telling you stuff, but without any reference points you can identify with. Or something like that - I dunno...    I'm no literary critic, but I am an avid reader. Been meaning to tackle On The Road for years, with the full expectation that I'd enjoy it, based on all I'd heard... Now that I've read it, regretably I must say I feel let down.  Maybe my expectations were tainted by the rave literary critiques I've seen over the years. One of the most notable points was always how this was a rebellion against the conformity of 1950s society, the antecedent of the Hippie movement, etc, etc. True, it was published in 1957 (I think), but the work was actually written in something like 1947, which means Kerouac was identifying with a time even earlier than that...so I don't see how this book can have much to do with the 50s or some kind of conservative-society-rebellion. It seems to me to be just a pointless ramble.    Kerouac himself is a bit of an enigma - he died an alcoholic at at 47, after at least one failed marriage and a nomadic adulthood spent relying on his parents. And the \\""Beat Generation\\"" for which he was the poster child didn't last long.     Somehow, this book just isn't a hit for me.

But it is also possible to read \\""On the Road\\"" as a rejection of Dean Moriarty and the life he represents. I have read this book several times, and with each reading have got something new from it. It is a passionately written work with a tone of poetry, bop, and movement. Oddly, the book didn't impress me when I first read it as an adolescent many years ago, but it has become one of my favorite novels.<br /><br />\\""On the Road\\"" is an autobiographical novel. The two major characters are Dean Moriarty who is based on a figure named Neal Cassady (1926 -- 1968) and Sal Paradise, the first-person narrator who is based on Kerouac (1922 -- 1969) himself. (Some early readers believed that Moriarty was the Kerouac figure, resulting in a serious misunderstanding of the book.) The action of the story takes place between 1947 and 1950. When the novel opens the reader hears Paradise's/Kerouac's inimitable voice: \\""I first met Dean not long after my wife and I split up. I had just gotten over a serious illness that I won't bother to talk about, except that it had something to do with the miserably weary split-up and my feeling that everything was dead.\\"" Moriarty was born in Salt Lake City and had spent much of his youth in pool halls, reform school, and in prison, from which he had escaped. He came to New York City with his 16 year old wife, Marylou and met Kerouac and his friends. In following Moriarty with his energy, restlessness, endless movement, and sexual libido, Paradise thinks he might find his way out of his sadness and purposelessness.<br /><br />The book tells of the friendship between Paradise and Moriarty and of their many reckless journeys back and forth through the United States. Paradise first travels alone, by bus and by hitchiking, to catch up with Moriarty in Denver and in San Francisco. Throughout their trips, Moriarty looks for his elderly father who, as did his son, lived a life of vagrancy and criminality, and was thought to be wandering as a hobo or in jail. The two, in the company of others, travel back to the East coast, to New Orleans, to meet \\""Old Bull Lee\\"" (William Burroughs -- the author of \\""The Naked Lunch\\""), to San Francisco and Denver again, through Chicago and Detroit, back to New York City, to the West coast, and to Mexico City, where Moriarty, for the second time in the book abandons Paradise who has become ill with disentery. In the final scenes of the book, the two wanderers have a reunion of sorts in New York City before Moriarty heads back to San Francisco to resume living with his second wife whom he has just divorced.<br /><br />The book proceeds at a frenetic pace as Moriarty drives recklessly from coast to coast, usually in cars he has borrowed. The book shows the breadth of America as well as the questing of rootless, troubled individuals with no particular place to go. \\""Whee, Sal, we gotta go and never stop going till we get there,\\"" says Moriarty at one point. \\""Where we going man?\\"" Sal asks. Moriarty responds, \\""I don't know but we gotta go.\\""<br /><br />Besides the broad, travel scenes, \\""On the Road\\"", includes detailed descriptive passages of many individuated scenes -- jazz clubs in San Franciso and New York, seedy all-night theatres, small hotels and road side stands, cold water flats in New York, a brothel in Mexico, and much else. There are strong characterizations of several charactersin addition to Moriarty and Paradise, including Moriarty's three wives, Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and Ed Dunkel and his wife Galatea -- who delivers a stunning rebuke late in the novel to Moriarty and his way of life. One of the finest extended passages in the book is the story in Part 1 of Paradise's brief affair with a young Mexican girl named Terry, which begins as the two are passengers on a bus to Los Angeles.<br /><br />But the focus of this book is on Paradise and Moriarty and on how Moriarty changes Sal Paradise's life. Paradise is a writer who has just published his first novel. (Kerouac's first book, \\""The Town and the City\\"".) Paradise is torn between the fast-paced, romantic, woman-filled life he sees in Moriarty and his own feelings for a more conventional, settled life with a purpose -- as represented in \\""On the Road\\"" by the character of his aunt.

The novel is told in the first person by the protagonist named \\""Sal Paradise\\"" (a character who greatly resembles the book's real-life author, Jack Kerouac).  \\""Sal Paradise\\"" travels most of the time in the company of his beloved buddy \\""Dean Moriarty\\"" (a character who is based very closed on Kerouac's real-life travel buddy Neal Cassady).    \\""On the Road\\"" showcases a small group of young men and women (all characters based on real-life acquaintances of Kerouac) who lived and were bored in the America of the late 1940's and early 1950's.  They find their parents' generation intolerably strait-laced, square, and boring.  To shake off their shackles and find their own way, these young people hit the road.  America's highways are their escape route; booze is their fuel and marijuana their elixir.  Sex and live jazz complete the tableau.      WHY THIS BOOK IS HARD TO START/PENETRATE:           REASON #1.  Kerouac as author isn't tidy.  The whole book is sort of single idea (e.g.: society is stale and corrupt, so go on a road trip to numb your pain and possibly find enlightenment), and its 300+ pages do not, in my opinion, push the protagonist into a state of relief or enlightenment.  (Indeed--maybe this circularity and lack of development of Sal Paradise's character was Kerouac's way of saying--like Samuel Beckett in \\""En Attendant Godot\\""--that, essentially, life stinks and then you die.         REASON #2.  The book's structure is sloppy and far from being \\""Type A Personality\\"" tidy.  In other words, while \\""On the Road\\"" is divided into \\""Parts\\"" of uneven length and in turn these \\""Parts\\"" are divided into numbered (but titleless) chapters, this putative organization doesn't really help the reader along in his/her journey through the text.         REASON#3.  Kerouac starts the book \\""in medias res.\\""  There is no explanation at the beginning of the text who precisely the characters are and why they should be important to the reader.          REASON #4.  Kerouac never really announces anywhere in \\""On the Road\\"": (1.) what the book is about; (2.) what it's trying to do; or (3.) how it's supposed to affect its readers.  (And that's not necessarily a bad thing; it's a stylistic choice made by Kerouac).  But woe is the reader who tries to slip into \\""On the Road\\"" without being willing to do some hard, grinding, groping reading during the first few dozen pages.  It's a rough kick-off.     HOW TO DESCRIBE JACK KEROUAC'S WRITING STYLE:      Kerouac's style is intriguing, and has been copied enormously since the publication of \\""On the Road\\"" back in 1957.  (For this reason, it is hard--fifty years later--to see how much of an innovator he was.)  In his first-person narration, Kerouac is noun- and verb-heavy (that is, he goes sparingly on adjectives and adverbs), and composes in very long sentences and beefy, half- or three-quarter-page-long paragraphs.      His vocabulary is banal, ordinary, everyday, and unexceptional. (I doubt this is an accident.) Although he describes a good bit of sex, violence, and argumentation, swear words are nearly invisible, and then only ones found in the text could be uttered today on television without a fine from the FCC.  Although Kerouac has an excellent ear for dialogue, there is very little direct (i.e., quoted) dialogue in the book.  Most of it is paraphrasing or else Sal Paradise's capsule descriptions of discussions that had taken place earlier in time in the novel.    Kerouac's narrator Sal Paradise slips, on occasion, into moments of lyricism.  Cleverly, these moments of verbal purity sneak up on the reader.  They usually involve the protagonist's delight with nature, or with freedom.  Upon re-reading, however, these moments of lyricism seem ever so slightly purple and adolescent.  (Again--perhaps Kerouac styled them this way on purpose).    Kerouac does two things brilliantly.  First, he creates dozens of hilarious or even laugh-out-loud-funny scenes, but the narrator never turns into a hyena over them.  Sal Paradise plays it quiet and wry.  Second, Kerouac's descriptions of jazz music being played live in seedy clubs is fascinating.  Breaking down each musical instrument into a descriptive sentence (often a run-on or otherwise swollen), he threads these instruments/sentences into a single paragraph that, in turn, plays within the reader's mind as if he or she were actually sitting in the club listening to the music.    WHY THIS BOOK WAS RADICAL IN 1957:     America's youth in 1957 was--if we simplify--a repressed, WASPy, serious, no-nonsense, Pat Boone and Mickey Mouse Club brigade of crew-cutted and pig-tailed squares.  And then (like the snarling Elvis Presley just a year earlier) came \\""On the Road\\"": a book about slightly older kids (in their early 20's) who were sassy, rebellious, two-fisted, booze-slurping, Cadillac-trashing, sexed-up good-for-nothings.  What real-life teen can resist a fictitious, super-cool rebel like Neal Cassady?  Keep in mind that none of the main characters in \\""On the Road\\"" ends up getting punished or \\""put in his place.\\""  Certainly the fact that the naughty young people in \\""On the Road\\"" actually \\""get away\\"" with their naughtiness must have been a shocker back in 1957.     WHY THIS BOOK IS A CULTURAL TOTEM:      For the past fifty years (and most particularly from 1957 to the late 1970's), \\""On the Road\\"" has been a sort of Bible and talisman for American high school kids who are fed up with adults and itching with Wanderlust.  Let's call Jack Kerouac the James Dean of the high-school intelligentsia set.  We've now had several generations of angry teens who found in \\""On the Road\\"" a digestable chunk of serious, no-longer-for-children \\""grown-up\\"" literature that, paradoxically, perfectly spells out what it means to be a ticked-off, mad-as-hell, bored young person.    WHY THIS BOOK IS ANTIQUATED (i.e., \\""DUSTY\\""):      Kerouac, during his lifetime, said that \\""On the Road\\"" was about internal quests for truth.  But the thrilling part of the book, at least for me, is the nutty, fast-paced, and often dangerous criss-crossing of the country in speeding and recklessly-driven borrowed or stolen automobiles.  But the United States of the late 1940's and early 1950's is no longer as big, broad, mysterious, and fascinating in 2007.      Think of all the things that have shrunken the physical size and ethereal mysteriousness of the U.S.A.: cheap and frequent **air** travel; an incredibly dense and efficient network of national highways; broadcast television and then cable television; inexpensive long-distance telephone rates, and then cell phones; and a uniquely American habit of children moving far, far away from the city or town in which they were born and raised.      In other words, the whole mystery of hurtling through the highways of America at night is no longer as exciting as it must have been a half-century ago.  In fact, taking a long car trip like Sal and Dean sounds in 2007 kind of like a pain in the neck.    So, just like a Ford Model T, \\""On the Road\\"" was brilliant in its time, but must now be confined to a very honored place behind a museum's glass partition, with full recognition of the greatness it had in its own time and for a few decades thereafter.  We just don't do it like that anymore.",2007-08-16

Certain people will always see this as a monotonous series of meaningless, drug and alcohol inspired treks with no end, rhyme or reason. Others feel that this book in some way speaks directly to their soul.     And never the twain shall meet.     Like many others here, I read this book at a seminal point in my life. I was starting college, had to get a job in order pay for it, and was deeply depressed about that very idea. What had happened to my freedom? Was this the promise of adulthood? Toil, tribulation and struggle, without any bright spot on the horizon? Was I doing all this for something as monotonously dreary as money? I found the notion hard to swallow. Still do. Still do.    To my mind, it is this feeling that ON THE ROAD captures. It is about a generation of young men, just out of World War II, some of whom served and some of whom did not, but all of whom now look at the wider American world and wonder what they are supposed to be doing, and to what purpose? They sincerely want to live settled, happy lives, but fear the loss of freedome that settling means.     The main character, Sal Paradise is constantly hoping to settle down, so that he can help out his aging aunt, start a family, be somebody. But he is also attracted to the perfect freedom of Dean Moriarty - our antihero - whose joyful acceptance of everything life can possibly offer is charming to nearly everyone who meets him, shabby and tawdry though they all really know him to be.     In Sal it is the desire for a home, a family, a life, that wins out in the end, surprising as that may be for so many of you to read.    It is the choice nearly all of us make, sooner or later. But not without some sadness, some looking back, some feeling of regret.     That is why so many of us love ON THE ROAD. if you get that, or feel it, or recognize some of those same sensations in your own guts, the novel has a chance to speak. It's voice is not entirely new. You can find similar in hundreds of books, among them THE SUN ALSO RISES, FAMILY by Pa Chin, LONESOME DOVE, THE HOBBIT, THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH and a hundred fantasy novels that are in reality about the quest for freedom.",2007-08-07

It doesn't sit well with those who've already made up their mind and usually means a quick death on the helpful review mark. But for those of you who have not read the literary masterpiece 'On the Road', I will do my best to offer to you what I have gained from this novel.<br /><br />Like many who've read 'On the Road', I was looking for an inside track on the mentality of the beatniks (or \\""the beats\\"" for those of you taking Enlgish lit) - those neo-philosophers who threw caution to the wind and lived life the way they deamed reasonable and total and true. They were rebels with a cause, and as Jack Kerouac illustrates with his hurried, powerful words, their goal was something both tangible and not, and that, the essence of a moment - each moment, thick with ecstasy and intrigue.<br /><br />He begins his bold story from the narrative of Sal Paradise (a pseudonym for the author himself) on the eastcoast and works his way via hitchhiking across the plains of Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas and onward towards Denver, Colorado, where a number of friends now reside. From that point in the story he and various members of his crew (mostly his best friend Dean Moriarty) explore loose, often meaningless sex, contagious fits of wanderlust, modest drug abuse, and ecstatic lustings for things not yet experienced, all while viewing their world full of lunatics, radiant jazz musicians, scoundrels, loose women and secretive homosexuals as one of delicate beauty. Through the process, Sal tries hard to understand his friend Dean and his often flights of self-sastisfaction and destruction.<br /><br />The trip takes them to the west coast and back again, then down to Florida, and back to Denver, then down and into Mexico, where their trip ends with Sal leaving his friend behind and waking up to the fact that Dean is hopelessly selfish.<br /><br />What I found powerful is what most others found powerful, as I am hardly one capable of the great original thought. These men were defying convention and the powerful thoughts of the day. They, particularly Sal (Kerouac), were setting the table for what would become the nineteen-sixtyish free-style of thought and experience. The beatniks, of whom Kerouac is considered the grand maestro, acted as a bridge for American idealism, leaving the toasty, content town of Mayberry and trading it in for the open-ended suggestion. In a way, Kerouac's road symbolizes the thoughts he possessed and experiences he craved, always extending forever and ever until all society has been abandoned and the road leads to a place where primitive life can be witnessed firsthand (as was the case for them in Mexico). Maybe he was trying to tell us that our ideas will lead us back to their origins and there is truly nothing new under the sun. Or maybe, as I believe, he was trying to tell us that our ideas will tease us with a mirage of something greater in the distance, only to rot away when we actually attempt to lay hold of them. At any rate, you can sense the nihilism thick and heavy as you read 'On the Road'. Ultimately for me, it was proof once again that literary hype is something very real and fixed in our society.

Longer version:  As the first book I've read in stream-of-consciousness format--as well as the first work by Kerouac--this book didn't disappoint, especially since I read it out of a long-standing curiosity.      Despite its modest length and seamless prose, this is a book that takes time and thought.  On the surface, it's a picaresque tale of two friends flitting across the country.  Its deeper meaning, though...one person can see this as an exuberant celebration of freedom and wanderlust, and another as a melancholy reflection on rootlessness and alienation, and both would be right.  Are Dean and Sal really having fun, or are they just running to stand still?  Neither?  Both?  This book will give you no solid answers, just as Dean and Sal have no solid answers.  For the record, I lean to the latter.    Though Sal is the narrator, he's not the real protagonist of the novel; Dean Moriarity completely dominates the text, in page time, dialogue, and focus.  Neither Dean nor Sal are likable characters, and the fantastic places they see and the things they do are little more than a backdrop for the relationship between two codependent individuals.  The text is full of irony--Dean ends up emulating the father he endlessly searches for, and Sal's hidden criticisms of Dean are moot behind his open idolization.  Sal is restless because he's rooted in Dean, who's similarly rootless...it goes on and on.      Enough analysis.  What did I like?  Well, Dean and Sal may not be likable, but they feel real, and I found it very easy to get to lost in the world of descriptions and parties and random insights into America, into modern society itself.  Welcome splashes of humor lighten the generally sad narrative, and the text thrums with joie de vivre, such that I often felt the excitement of getting on the road once more.

I was as impressed with the vividness of the writing as I was unimpressed by the characters and their lifestyles. Kerouac definitely has an unorthodox style, but it works; you get a real and immediate sense of the people, places, and stories.  <br /> <br />Broadly, it is about a couple of guys who like to hit the road whenever they can and enjoy life.  It is about finding out what IT is about (whatever that is), hearing a lot of good jazz, drinking a lot of booze, `making' a lot of loose women,  smoking a lot of `tea', and chaining a lot of abstract thoughts together.  You don't worry about broken relationships, children fathered along the way, stolen cars, lying, cheating, abandoning friends, and vague things like honor. You concern yourself instead with maximizing your experiences and pleasures by visiting as many places and mooching off of as many people as possible. Don't worry about tomorrow; tomorrow will take care of itself. Hey, it even says that in the Bible!  <br /> <br />I can see why Kerouac was an icon of the 60's.  I was surprised that the book took place in the 40's. You can see a good bit of the hippie culture evolve from the life style of the characters.  I guess you could call them proto-hippies. <br /> <br />One thing I found very interesting and subtle is how many times the word `sad' was used, sometimes in surprising ways. He doesn't usually say what is sad though; you have to figure that out for yourself, and I think I did. Basically, the undertone of the whole story was sad. <br /> <br />You will probably ask me why I even read it. Good question! I read it because it is a classic of the 20th century.  I'm even glad I read it, believe it or not. Whether or not I agree with the lifestyles, I really did admire his writing. I was entranced with his layered, sensual, run-on sentences and his poet's eye for every person and place he met.  He had a little bit of William Faulkner in him, and that's a compliment as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br />Go ahead, indulge yourself and read it. It is, after all, about self-indulgence, but it's also a hymn about such. <br />",2007-05-27

The reader is Tom Parker, of whom I admit to knowing nothing. He turns out an extremely competent reading, and manages to hold the attention and the interest of the listener throughout his entire performance, which is something that the previously issued abridged version by another reader failed to do. To be honest, that reading bored me, an effect which, for a Kerouac text, must be difficult to achieve.  <br /> <br />That abridged reading, lasting three hours, obviously omitted two-thirds of the novel. It is annoying when listening for favourite parts of the book to discover that they have been left out. Even the beginning was omitted in that version. With this complete reading by Tom Parker that problem does not occur, and is replaced by the altogether more pleasing phenomenon of hearing passages and details which have been entirely forgotten from previous readings of the book.  <br /> <br />What of the voice? For me, no one reads Kerouac better than Kerouac, so I prefer a Kerouac-like voice and phrasing when listening to readings of his work, and for that reason favor Jack's own recordings, as available on the Rhino box-set. As someone once remarked, hearing Kerouac interpret his own work is like hearing music for the first time, after only having had the score to study previously. Allen Ginsberg also performed Kerouac well, as evidenced by his Mexico City Blues and The Dharma Bums recordings. Graham Parker also does well, on his two-cassette reading from Visions of Cody. Although his voice is nothing like Kerouac's, the boundless enthusiasm and energy he employs over-ride any objections I might have had. Another reader who has impressed me with his treatment of a Kerouac text is Lee Ranaldo (of the band Sonic Youth), whose contribution to Rykodisc's \\""Kerouac - Kicks Joy Darkness\\"" tribute CD was nothing short of brilliant. I'd like to hear Ranaldo read the complete On the Road.  <br /> <br />Tom Parker does not sound much like Kerouac, but he reads with an infectious energy, keeping the concentration, and never flagging once during his ten-hour journey. These readings, which come in a handsome library case, would provide ideal companionship during a long trip, and are an enjoyable listening experience to dip into at any time.

Kerouac feeds the itch within anyone who has a rambling soul, leaving the reader craving for their dreams, ultimately, anyone who gets this, anyone who truly appreciates it, I am confident will never be quite the same. Every scene, every pure, brilliant landscape, every character is crafted with such skill and subtle, tactical brilliance; you fall in love with each one. Sparkling, pulsing dialogue, evocative simple depiction, passion, craving; this book is so powerful; combining enigmatic and isolated reflection with irresistible freedom that reflects the ultimate lifestyle of anyone who just cannot stop moving. It is so modest and subtle...Kerouac is a literary God. Please read this. Buy it. Buy a copy for everyone you know! I can't imagine that I could ever have lived without knowing, without ever realising.... This book should be handed out in schools and workplaces and universities and streets all over the world. Please, just read it!!<br />So, in response to other reviewers, who I can almost believe have never felt the want of freedom, have never felt the exhilarating magic of the road: Can you not see the pure and simple LIFE of this story? I cannot believe anyone could dismiss this. I was devastated to reach the final page; it is so rare to find such a gift. So please, show me a more faultless achievement of a novel, for I would love to read it. But I believe you'll have difficulties- this is as close to perfection as it gets.<br />Andto those who have the soul and the insight into the heart of a real angel of a man, to share in my breathless admiration, there is a poem by William Burroughs that may interest you:<br />Remembering Jack Kerouac<br />Writers are, in a way, very powerful indeed. They write the script for the reality film. Kerouac opened a million coffee bars and sold a million pairs of Levis to both sexes. Woodstock rises from his pages. Now if writers could get together into a real tight union, we'd have the world right by the words. We could write our own universes, and they would all be as real as a coffee bar or a pair of Levis, or a prom in the Jazz Age. Writers could take over the reality studio. So they must not be allowed to find out that they can make it happen. Keroac understood this long before I did. Life is a dream, he said.",2001-04-29

And we moved!&quot; <br />Fans of Kerouac just  aren't going to like me much. <br />Now don't get me wrong, the book was okay  for what it was: a snapshot of a different time. I read over and over again  how &quot;this book changed my life and blah blah blah...&quot; According  to the blurb on my copy, it is, &quot;quite simply one of the greatest  novels and major milestones of our time.&quot; <br />I can't comprehend the  fact that this book could change the life of anyone in my generation. The  characters are not very likable and I can't imagine myself enjoying the  situations they find themselves in. The writing seems extremely average to  me. I have a gnawing feeling I read a different book than everyone else I  ever talked to about Kerouac's &quot;masterpiece&quot;. <br />Several scenes  are fairly strong and memorable, especially when he was hitchiking alone,  and I know that Kerouac is addressing those &quot;wandering spirits&quot;  that exist independant of what decade it is, as well as talking about being  lost as a young adult. Still, I have to wonder how one could identify so  much with any of the characters in the book without being a total moron.  <br />His metaphors are inane, and not even in a good way (&quot;This was a  manuscript of the night we couldn't read&quot;), and he only gives us small  snapshots of the late 40's &quot;underground&quot; - a paragraph about  Wilheilm Reich and his orgones here, a paragraph or two about jazz there.  <br />Perhaps the characters were (lying on their) hip in the 40's and 50's,  but they're just not cool now. They seem like a collection of cardboard  cutouts of parrots. I have no problem with drugs (hell, I like William  Burroughs), but the way Kerouac addresses their drug use seems off the cuff  and almost as if it was inserted extemporaneously to make the book more  &quot;edgy&quot; (or hip, if you insist). <br />Recommendation: If you want to  try Kerouac, read San Francisco Blues or one of his other books of poems  instead.",1999-04-24

Truman Capote called there writing merely &quot;typing.&quot; A traversty! It is a reaction to Kerouac's &quot;kickwriting.&quot;  However, the story for me meant an allegory of discovery. A wonderous journey. Essentialy, I view the &quot;beat&quot; generation as highly religous - a revolution based on jazz and Buddhism.    The story spoke to a whole generation like &quot;Hemingway's A Sun Also Rises.&quot; Thus, for their historical significance are worth reading alone.  But it is not hyperbole to say, &quot;it spoke volumes for me.&quot;    I urge you to read it. Kerouac has a sonorous inner voice. A voice with diction and passion manifested in &quot;Sal Paradise.&quot; A narrator whom for me was far more moving that F. Sct Fitz's &quot;Nick Carroway&quot; of the Great Gatsby.  An important book for &quot;my generation&quot; too. There is nothing like it. It captures the essence of &quot;jazz&quot; and the souls of many beat writers : Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and Neal Cassady.    Neal Cassady is the protagonist and is presented as one of the &quot;Greatest American Heroes of the West&quot; in Dean Moriarty.  So, read read read. My words cannot paraphrase a book. This is not a whim, I am talking about a book I truly love. Hence,  I may rant, I may rave. But please, the ostensible message, is simple and clear : READ.

All my life, I had expected this book to be a sort of hysterical gospel of the beat generation. In a way, it is, but above all it’s a hymn to the United States, its vastness, its sadness, its poetry and melancholy. It’s got something of John Steinbeck’s Travels with Charlie with, in the background, Ennio Moricone’s music for Once upon a time in the West. I’m glad I first went from Arkansas to Missouri, Iowa, South Dakota, then New Mexico and Arizona before I read this book. I can taste the wide open vistas, the mesmerizing monotony of endless roads over perfectly flat land, the sense of emptiness in this under populated country. Also, I understand somewhat better Aaron Copeland’s Fanfare for the common Man. All so beautiful and heartbreaking !  Like Kerouac, but under much more comfortable circumstances, I enjoyed the impact of unexpected encounters : an Indian in New Mexico, for instance, at a service station. He’d noticed my Little Rock, Razorback T-shirt, and we started talking. “I just spent several years in Little Rock” he said. “Now, I’m going home” : a simple statement, as moving as a haiku. You could never be friends with these people ; here now, gone a few seconds later, yet they stay with you all your life.<br />Kerouac’s style has a lot to do with the fascination one quickly feels for the novel. Style can turn an ordinary story into a magic one. Here, sentences are clear, yet enhanced now and then by poetic touches : a misleading simplicity, and no mean feat.<br />The major drawback lies in Kerouac’s obsession with booze, beer and getting drunk. Characters in the novel - including the main character - are always complaining that they are short of money, and it’s very true that they are not exactly rolling in it, but if they didn’t drink so much, they would have enough to get by, most of the time. The story takes place in 1947. By the time I wentto live in North America (Canada is the same) it hadn’t changed. For me, the year was 1963. If a man managed to take a girl to a motel with him, he also had to bring in a bottle of whiskey. Apparently, it’s still like that. What a sad, sad outlook on sex ! Getting drunk on cheap booze instead of getting drunk on each other ! When the body is fighting with 6 shots of Bourbon, orgasms are reduced to the mere release of biological tensions instead of the last movement in a grand symphony of sensations and emotions.<br />In California, Jack meets a lovely Mexican girl with blue eyes, which prompts an old farmer to say that, at some point, “the bull jumped over the fence.” You just know that their affair is not going to last, even if it keeps on for a few weeks. Jack Kerouac’s talent means that, as a reader, you are more in love with the girl than the author ever was. There is great sadness at their parting (there is great sadness throughout the book), but love, real love, deep love is never an element of the story, and that makes it even more poignant. On the Road is a drifting odyssey of self-centred people who are not even aware that they are self-centred. It’s an ode to complicated losers.",2015-08-10

The story revolves around the narrator, Sal Paradise, a twenty-something writer and ex-GI who travels the country by car, bus, train, and hitchhiking.  Along the way, he meets interesting people and a revolving door of friends who are also embarking on journeys of their own.  The book pay homage to the freedom of the open road.<br /><br />While the book lacked a unified plot (it’s mostly strings of stories woven together which make up a patchwork quilt-type book), I honestly have to say that this book had some of the most beautiful writing I’ve ever read.  Kerouac’s description is amazing!  He was able to say in five words what would take lesser writers two paragraphs.  His use of metaphor could have won him a gold metal if writing was an Olympic sport.  I’m not a note taker…not even in school…but I found myself writing passages down to ponder over later.<br /><br />The characters in this book were slightly disturbing, especially Dean Moriarty.  Sal seems to worship Dean in a bazaar and unhealthy way.  Dean is a philandering, pedophilic, criminal, yet Sal sees him as some sort of mystical god-like being.  I don’t get it.  The guy is a creep.  People have to lock up their daughters when he’s around.  He marries women, knocks them up and runs off with another over and over again.  At one point, he obtains a quickie Mexican divorce from his second wife, rushes back to marry his third wife, and that very night, he leaves wife #3 to go back to wife #2.  What a pig!  But Sal sees Dean as some sort of modern philosopher, always taking and eluding to Dean’s deep thinking.  I just saw him as a dude high on pot going, “Whoa, man!” “Yes!” over and over.<br /><br />On The Road wasn’t the most exciting book, nor had it the deepest characters, but it definitely has historic and literary value.<br /><br />Overall, I give On The Road…<br />Plot – 1 ½ bookmarks<br />Character Development – 2 ½ bookmarks<br />Literary Value – 5 bookmarks<br />Historic Value – 4 ½ bookmarks<br /><br />Dream Cast (otherwise known as who I pictured while reading) – Penn Badgley (Sal Paradise), Chris Pine (Dean Moriarty), America Ferrera (Teresita), Anne Hathaway (Camile), Tom Hardy (Remy), Reese Witherspoon (Mary Lou), Viggo Mortensen (Old Bull Lee), Lukas Haas (Carlo Marx)he Road…<br />Plot – 1 ½ bookmarks<br />Character Development – 2 ½ bookmarks<br />Literary Value – 5 bookmarks<br />Historic Value – 4 ½ bookmarks<br /><br />Dream Cast (otherwise known as who I pictured while reading) – Penn Badgley (Sal Paradise), Chris Pine (Dean Moriarty), America Ferrera (Teresita), Anne Hathaway (Camile), Tom Hardy (Remy), Reese Witherspoon (Mary Lou), Viggo Mortensen (Old Bull Lee), Lukas Haas (Carlo Marx)",2014-03-17

I realized a little of the way through that's kind of kerouac's point--life doesn't always make sense. Life &#34;on the road&#34; is a magnifying class for the rest of our lives.<br /><br />In this life on the road, there are so many random experiences, some significant, some less so. I almost feel like I am sal's therapist. he tells me the stories and I am supposed to help him make sense of them.<br /><br />Kerouac wrote the first draft of this novel in 3 weeks. It's based on his own actual experiences, I'm not sure why he didn't call it a memoir or something more non-fiction-esque. When he originally wrote it he didn't use paragraph breaks and wrote it semi-stream of consciousness. I think this is valuable because it lends to the understanding of the book. Which ends up a bit &#34;ramble-y&#34;. That first draft is available as well. Though the common book did go through an editing process.<br /><br />I recommend this book to those who would like to spend some time travelling, looking for some meaning. There is a lot of meaning to be found. This book shares some of that. It also very honest in sharing some of the hopelessness.",2014-02-28

Allen Ginsburg and William Burroughs are other characters in the book. Check out the Wikipedia article about the book to find out who's who.). At his best, Kerouac's writing is exuberant and joyful, reflecting the  excitement off Kerouac and Cassady as they drive long stretches of the open road, admire all kinds of young female bodies, and generally rebel against humdrum daily life. He is masterful at writing about the experience of listening to jazz and watching it being played. The fourth section--in my view, the best--uses wonderfully evocative language to describe a road trip south through Mexico, and contains a rollicking whorehouse scene in which three young American men stoned out of their heads on marijuana have the time of their lives.

US,34605292,RDVTFUN70VAUD,B002IPZFYQ,303305496,"On the Road",Digital_Ebook_Purchase,2,5,5,N,N,"Your ghost","This debatable classic is at best an homage to the uninhibited and partly \\""mad\\"" Neal Cassady (the character of Dean Moriarty in the book), told from the point of view of the writer/narrator. I understand Neal Cassady's desire to live hard and experience things, to push situations and people to their limits. Yet to make an almost pseudo-religion out of such is, in the end, rather shallow and even corny. Whether it be his choice or his destiny, Neal lived from party to party (getting \\""kicks\\"") in a very selfish manner. People were merely diversions to whet his hyperactive, extroverted appetite. Jack Kerouac was obviously in love with Neal on some level and surely idolized him, almost in a starry-eyed way. The author tries hard to elevate his friend to some higher plane, to write him as some seer of visions that Neal simply was not. Kerouac struggles to rationalize and draw inspiration from this eccentric, charming man's somewhat creative ramblings and lack of personal responsibility. What Kerouac seems to glean from the adventures shared with Neal is a sort of nebulous, vague \\""truth.\\"" This truth is definitely hard to pinpoint and seems to stem mostly from Kerouac's own ego, self-indulgent imagination, and deep infatuation. The cloudiness of this \\""truth\\"" actually works in regard to the legacy of \\""On the Road\\"" as it translates into an endless debate regarding the novel's literary merits.<br /><br />The reason that many people have trouble defining the vague feeling of this novel, the whole \\""Beat philosophy,\\"" is based on the fact that it's simply a fancy way of justifying solipsistic, egocentric, self-indulgent, irresponsible, somewhat shameful and often spoiled behavior. A lot of intelligent people pass through a phase like this in their early adult lives, and it's certainly a rite of passage in some sense. Many of us have run with the likes of Dean Moriarty, and a longing for such times is what strikes a chord and draws people to cling to this book. It resurrects our own Dean Moriarty ghosts, long buried by the mountains of time that bury each of us. What's unsatisfying (and quite telling) is that there isn't any real epiphany or truth to be learned here. There is no comforting, elucidating answer by the end of the novel. The \\""truth\\"" remains endlessly elusive, which ultimately becomes dissatisfying and even quite sad. The only thing to be learned is perhaps that time is a juggernaut, and the ecstasy of total freedom is fleeting and comes with a price. To get this rather dark, poignant feeling at the end of 300 pages is better than nothing, I suppose. A short story may have sufficed?<br /><br />Neal's true claim to fame is that he was a walking, talking party. He got drunk. He got high. He gobbled drugs. He had lots of sex, cheated on his wives, and had children irresponsibly. He drifted with the wind and had no barriers. He was an entertainer, a thief, and a con. Surely he was exciting to be around in measured doses. He seemed to live only for his pleasure and immediate desires, and his handsome charisma blinded people into making him out to be much more than he was. People were like moths to his fire, yet unfortunately, individuals such as Neal often come with a cold combination of self-loathing and sheer narcissism. He frostily went through all of his relationships. Even the ever-fawning Kerouac ends the novel finally driving away from him, although he later seems to become haunted by his \\""thoughts of Dean Moriarty.\\"". Many of us can identity with such a longing, and therein lies the interest in this novel. We all have  memories of our own Dean, of an earlier \\""lightness of being,\\"" of someone who stimulated us greatly. Unfortunately, reading about another person's endless binges, sexual situations, and cannabis-born \\""philosophies\\"" just isn't that interesting if you're not actually a part of the fun. The book started to make me feel dirty. Not because of what it did describe, but for what it was missing.<br /><br />So much debauchery and zooming through life is mentioned too quickly, crammed into the 300 pages, that it becomes tedious and empty. Kerouac's self-indulgent stream-of-consciousness writing does not help. In fact, it serves more to confuse the reader and makes the characters unreachable in their empty void of cold, arrogant hedonism. The reader is kept at bay, scratching his head, becoming nothing more than a bored voyeur. It borders on literary porn. None of the endless, faceless parade of brief \\""characters\\"" make any real human impression. As soon as you almost begin investing some feeling in someone (which is rare), they are hastily dismissed from the story. Most characters were nothing more than names dropped into scattered descriptions of smoking \\""tea,\\"" listening to jazz, speeding down the road, seducing naïve girls, and getting really drunk. Many of the descriptions of places are so specific to the mind of Jack Kerouac that the reader has no point of reference to identify with. Unless you are the author or were there, the reader often becomes lost in bars and streets that mean nothing. Again, the reader simply becomes a cold observer who never actually enters the story. The book quickly becomes dull. It's not so much challenging as it is a chore.<br /><br />With age, Kerouac lost the freedom and selfish indulgence of his youth. His wrinkle in time, his charmed days with Neal when he was untethered enough to tackle any adventure around the corner. came to an end like it does for most of us. Again, what maybe strikes a chord with people (and thus made this book popular) was the fact that we all have our Deans. Many of us have a period of time in our lives when we are selfish, pleasure-seeking, and free. Running with those who exemplify this way of living and making them demigods helps to justify and excuse this existence. Creating an almost mystical icon out of the hyper-romanticized Neal/Dean makes our own past indulgences and regrets seem \\""justified\\"" (weakly at best). We growup and have to become responsible to our \\""others\\"" and our own bodies; we long more for real, solid, deep connections with our family, friends, and lovers. With these wiser, more mature goals, we lay to rest a lot of the fun experimentation of our youth.<br /><br />Though we outgrow him, we occasionally feel a longing from time to time for our own Dean Moriarty of yore -to be alone with him again in a darkened room, listening to a new record, drinking, talking. We may privately take him down from the shelf in our mind to be reminded briefly of the sadness of our lost exuberance, our lost connection. Neil became a caricature, a sad, hollow joke in the end. He was perhaps a victim of trying to keep up with his own exaggerated reputation. He has truly become a symbol of our collective ghosts, which is truly more interesting than the book itself.

It was the handbook of the Beat Generation. It is the tale of a restless young man who wanted to experience everything and thought the best way to do that was on the road.<br /><br />The characters in this book are not very likable. They hurt people without remorse, they steal thing along the way, they take advantage of the kindness and hospitality of countless others. They cheat on their wives and girlfriends. And yet, in the characters, we see real people with complex personalities. The same guy, for example, that is married to two women (at the same time) and chasing after several others, loves jazz and is deeply moved by poetry and stories of the road. The main characters all possess a spontaneity, even impulsiveness, that drives them to restless wandering. At a moment's notice, as the inspiration strikes, they often drop everything, abandon everyone around them and head for the other coast. In its realness, this is an incredibly wonderful book. At the same time, it is a picture of humanity in its lowest, most selfish form.<br /><br />In writing this book, Kerouac achieved a new level of success and acceptance for what he called \\""Spontaneous Prose.\\"" It's a form of writing that has some structure, but is very close to a stream of consciousness.
