The language is beautiful, and Waterston brings to the reading of it a surprising, effortless range of voices, from an aging, tentative prima donna to a gruff sea captain to a rich, spoiled contessa. But it's Wilder's ideas, his musings on the butterfly-wing-fragility of life, which make this book a classic. The last couple of pages are as gentle, timeless and moving as anything ever put on paper (thus the title of my review above).",2007-04-04

The novel explores the lives of the five, which touch each other in subtle ways. The ultimate question asked is whether God \\""planned\\"" that this particular five be on the bridge that day to meet their fate. I don't think that question is answered, but a more profound one--whether each person's life is unique and meaningful--is answered with a resounding YES. The unabridged audio version of this book is excellent. Sam Waterston reads clearly and simply, and conveys a tone of respect for each of these diverse lives. Highly recommended.",2002-03-03

This book is only superficially about the  ordinary aspects of a few barely intersecting lives.  It really speaks more  deeply of love and personal agony and human commitment and the powerful  bonds/struggles within relationships.  Every word rings true... and I often  wanted to rewind the cassette and hear a sentence over again.  This  beautiful book needs to be read, slowly.  However, listening to Waterston's  gentle, compassionate voice really brings the characters and their tragedy  to life.  What a hauntingly gorgeous book!",1999-02-20

It's a simple slice of life about an arcane tragedy in Peru  in 1714. It's a novel which will stay with me for a lifetime.",1998-10-25
