This very simple storyline is just as much a thriller as anything else out there.  Even though the story is told as a narration by Ed so you obviously know he survives you have no idea how many or if any of the others will as you turn the pages on this tranquil adventure which halfway through turns into a terrifying read and one that ponders the question of what would you do in order to survive.  The descriptions of them canoeing down the river and rapids really make you believe you are in the canoes with these guys.  A great classic read, glad I picked it up.<br /><br />Deliverance is the story of a trip into the wilderness by four middle aged city guys, Ed, Lewis, Drew and Bobby.  While some of the party are a bit reluctant to make the journey they are all eventually convinced by the fact that not too far in the future this river and surrounding area will be underwater when the new dam is complete and no one will ever have the chance to do a canoe trip like this again.  They take a guitar and an archers bow to do a bit of illegal deer hunting along the way.  The first day and night doesn't go smoothly but there's nothing they hadn't anticipated except an owl roosting and puncturing their tent with its talons as it constantly returns from hunting.  On their second day however they will encounter true evil.  Their stamina, friendship and every other trait will be tested to its extreme if they are going to make it back to civilisation alive.",2008-01-09

How many times have you ever pulled into a small town with your friends or spouse, just to have someone in the car start imitating the opening chords to that banjo breakdown?  Or how many times have you heard \\""this is Deliverance country\\""?  And besides the scene where that huge shark in Jaws clamps down on Robert Shaw, is there anything more realistically horrifying (and simulataneously engrossing) as Ned Beatty's \\""love scene\\""?<br /><br />In somewhat unfairness to the book, it's hard to divorce a reading of this book from the movie.  Like the book, the movie was itself a masterpiece example of what popular culture could turn out in the late '60s and early '70s.  Unfortunately, I could not get elements of the movie of my mind while I read the book, but that is some tribute to the movie.  The casting was masterful, and reading the development of the men in the book only confirmed the perfect match of each actor to his character.<br /><br />Now, about the book.  Dickey was a poet, and his mastery of painting with words is on full display here.  The descriptions of the natural world that these city men thrust themselves into are wonderful.  Dickey's intent, no doubt, is to put on full display the \\""bigness\\"" of the world that these men are in and how truly alien and helpless they are.  The mountain people are decribed with unapologetic candor, and the movie's depiction of them as toothless crackers and inbreds is consistent with the book's.  For our protagonists, the violent foreigness (and beauty) of the land is symbolic of the mountain people.<br /><br />Now, for one of culture's top 100 iconographic images: the cornholing scene.  I was amused to see how Dickey played with that scene all through the book.  There is Ed's (that's Jon Voight) quasi-erotic appreciation of Lewis (that's Burt Reynolds), Ed's doggie-style rendevous with this wife, Ed's (understandable if not justifiable) contempt and disrespect of Bobby (that's Ned Beatty) after his \\""violation,\\"" and the new awkwardness of having to deal with the bodies of other men (like treating the wounded).<br /><br />The book presents a great puzzle of right and wrong.  These four canoers represent four sides of the modern suburban middle class family man.  The strong leader, the thoughtful peacemaker, the pathetic victim, and the conflicted pragmatist.  The latter is Ed, Jon Voight's character.  In him, Dickey succeeded in creating a wonderfully sympathetic everyman (dumb but fitting word) that we can all appreciate.  Things are neither black nor white for him.  The mountain people are still people to him, seemingly unlike Lewis' view.  But the priorities of the situation suspend the normal laws of civilation for Ed, unlike the position that Drew (that's Ronny Cox) would have taken.  We all admire Ed, who under extreme demands and circumstances rises to become the strongest man on the trip.  And is there any reader who questions the choices that Ed makes, at least by the time that Dickey takes us through the tale with Ed?<br /><br />What a book.

Throw in some steamy hot, sexy scenes, add surprises with plenty of twists & turns, and you've got a bestseller in the making!<br /><br />Even though I was given a copy to read in exchange for my honest review, I highly recommend this to all adult readers (ages 18+) who love reading any kind of fiction. I cannot wait to read more by this talented author.",2015-08-03

This book delivers boundaries that have never been surpassed by any author I have ever read. Mac and Pepper are a delightful duo that span the pages of this book. I like my reads dark and Pepper fits the bill here. She surpassed a lifetime of awful treatment at the hands of her many masters. Nothing can get this girl down. She is definitely a survivor. Mac is a specialist at pretty much all cloak and dagger bulls***. He teaches Pepper how to be herself and come out above the rest. Five stars read!",2015-08-02

Unlike the previous books, the H is actually not a criminal! I usually lean toward outlaws but Mac is a fantastic character. Watching Pepper's transformation is riveting. The plot is complex, engaging, and probably more realistic than we would like to think. Adams has amazing insight into people and the dialogue feels so real. My husband does not enjoy romance like I do but this plot is so interesting that I recommended the book to him. Lots of action I know he would like with the HEA I require.

That's exactly what you'll find in this book. Adams has once again written characters that are believable, well developed, and stay with you long after you finish reading. Pepper has suffered at the hands of her masters for as long as she can remember. She has endured, but just barely. Mac is our unconventional hero, taking Pepper in, with the hope of rehabilitating her to a state of being above her engrained sense of subservience. Will he succeed?<br /><br />&#34;I've seen a hell of a lot of bad things, from death by flogging, to cannibalism, but I had never seen such an unholy mess of a girl.&#34;<br /><br />Definite must read!",2015-07-23

This is her fourth book, and all of them seem to follow this basic theme: a young woman finds herself in deep deep trouble, and a strong alpha male comes along at just the right time to save her from whatever mess she's gotten herself into.<br /><br />The thing that makes her books different, is that the men in these books are never knights in shining armor. In fact, they can be quite evil men, drug cartel leaders, enforcers, etc. And the women are usually not angels either. But they all do have an internal code of honor, a code that guides them, and that they'd never break.<br /><br />Deliverance does not stray too far from this theme, but it does in a few key areas. For one, Mac does not work for the drug cartels, and he is basically a good guy, although he's not afraid to do what's necessary to secure his mission. He's a British ex-military man, going undercover to root out terrorists in the Middle East. And Pepper is basically a complete and total victim, at least at the beginning. She has been kept as a sex slave ever since she was a child, she hardly knows anything else.<br /><br />The relationship that builds between these two is wonderful to behold. I love the patience and kindness Mac has with Pepper. At first Pepper is confused by this, as all she's ever known from men is pain and suffering. She hardly knows how to handle his kindness to her, thinking another shoe is sure to drop at any moment.<br /><br />But slowly, he earns her trust, and slowly she begins to realize he's different from other men. They grow stronger together. And when Mac goes off to the Middle East, Pepper goes with him.<br /><br />The book is more than a romance between them, although it is certainly that, but it's also an exciting novel about military men, terrorist scum, and Middle East politics. It's explosive. It's sexy. It's exciting. What more could you ever want in a book? It's also a standalone novel, so no sequel to wait for.<br /><br />The book is due to be released soon, so go put it on your buy list right now. I promise you won't regret it.",2015-07-23
