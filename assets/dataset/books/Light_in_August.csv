US	8625916	R3TCP3RBKBLD7Z	0679732268	161451712	Light in August	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Poignant Depiction of the South	Mr. Faulkner has always had the ability to capture my attention. This novel starts out with a single character along a dirt road (as it perhaps may end too), but at once the reader is taken in by her (Lena's) slow amble and her thoughts about shoes. His characters are always alive and filled with personality; Lena is a white woman looking for her gone lover. As the story continues we are introduced to Bryon Bunch, Joe Christmas and Joes Brown. These characters all circle each other in relationship and plot. At first Christmas is seems haughty and distant, but as we dive into his past we see that he suffered and this has turned him against those nearest him. As the novel progresses, Faulkner turns the novel in a direction well-suited to its environment. Once again the reader sees a world of prejudice and hate. And with this turn comes another character, an old priest named Hightower. He sits by his window at night and looks out into God's world. What is so wonderful about Faulkner is that he connects everything, characters, places, even past novels, to his current story. At times his prose is lovely; particularly when he runs into the steam-of-consciousness (that, I think, is where he shows off exceedingly well). But this tale is not all about abandoned love and racial-dislike, it is really about the effects people can have on others, especially as they grow-up. Although the ending is a bit weak, most of Light in August is emotionally packed and entertaining.	2015-07-09

He reuses the same plot devices, like “will the pregnant girl find a husband (or an abortion) before it’s too late?”  That’s an easy way to generate suspense.  Or, after a long and implausible digression, we discover that so-and-so is really so-and-so’s father – and one-sixteenth Negro!<br /><br />On the plus side, Faulkner deserves credit for creating his imaginary territory, with its families and their histories.  I did notice at least one callback to so-and-so’s father having killed that other guy in the other novel.  You can see that I wasn’t interested enough to remember the names, or how to spell Yoknapatawpha.<br /><br />Maybe, back when the plot devices were fresh, and The South was a thing, people would read Faulkner as some kind of ethnography.  If that’s what you’re into, you might want to check out Tennessee Williams.	2015-03-30

It made me want to dig up the grave of William Faulker and shake him. Shake him for making a book that I presumed was impossible to read. I was frustrated to the point where it honestly makes me cringe to remember. It was embarrassing. I rarely ever feel that stupid. But to me it just made no damn sense. I tried and tried and tried, reread and reread. I just didn't have the patience or the capacity. It went over my head and I gave it 1 star and cursed anyone for pretending they liked it.<br /><br />But it's been a few years and I've slowly built up my tolerance for difficult prose and intricate storylines, and trying to figure out themes for myself, and I've come to realize how fun it is. How rewarding it is. It's made me appreciate books like Moby D__k. Books like Stoner, or 100 Years of Solitude. My favorite books that I wouldn't have been able to read a few years ago.<br /><br />I eventually picked up another Faulker book, As I Lay Dying, and I loved it. I got it. A few months later, and now I've finished A Light in August and I also love it. And now I realize it probably isn't that The Sound and The Fury is bad, just that I wasn't ready for it. I still might not be. Quite honestly I'm afraid to try at least for another year or two. There are lots of things I still don't get. James Joyce frightens me, for one. But one day I plan to get where I need to be to appreciate everything the way it was meant to be appreciated--because these artists poured their hearts and souls into their work, and the least I can do as a consumer is that.<br /><br />As for this book, it's tremendous. Nearly flawless except for one chapter that seems oddly placed, almost like the editors forgot to take it out. I'm looking at you Grimm. But don't let that stop you from enveloping yourself into it.	2015-01-03

In William Faulkner's novel Light in August, the author uses themes and persona that appear in his other work, including As I Lay Dying and Absalom, Absalom.  Uncompromising stoicism, unmitigated rage, hopeless naivete', inexplicable love, and unrelieved absence of mercy pervade Faulkner's novel, as do characters who manifest these qualities.  Most of Light in August seems to be governed by unalloyed adherence to an angry and wrathful God who demands that Whites hate Blacks, Whites hate sinners, Blacks hate themselves, soul-breaking hard work is its own reward, and a near-death sort of stoicism is the only acceptable affect for God-fearing people.<br /><br />One of the central characters, Ellen Grove, emphatically illustrates the imposed barbarity of the human condition in Faulkner's novel.  Hopelessly naive, she had become impregnated by an amoral drifter who is the antithesis of any plausible notion of decency, exactly the sort of man that a wrathful God and his disciples would condemn as unfit but might inflict on the unsuspecting to test their purity.  Ellen's unbounded naivete' leaves her to believe that her lover will send for her once he's secured employment and established a home.  Sadly, however, given our knowledge of Ed Brown, the man who so recklessly used Ellen, it's difficult to imagine how she was taken in by one whom she readily acknowledges was wildly different from the established norm.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Ellen sets out on foot from Alabama to find him, surmising that his communications lovingly imploring her to join him were lost and undelivered.  She accepts what minimal assistance that by chance comes her way, and remains an unblemished model of stoicism and naivete', sure that she'll find her man, and they will be wed before the child is born.<br /><br />Faulkner's description of Ellen's expressionless, smooth-planed face, along with her preternaturally patient commitment to the love and fidelity of Ed Brown, yields a pitiful portrait of a young woman who lives in a hard, unforgiving, and usurious world but still believes in her lover's fidelity.  When she hears that he may be working in the Mississippi town of Jefferson, she heads that way, occasionally aided by strangers who suspect her predicament, find it morally reprehensible though not completely without sympathy, and offer help in spite of her sinful state.  Perhaps they feel they've sinned by doing so.<br /><br />The people she meets are made of the same stuff as Ellen:  poor, stoic, laconic, averse to the commonplace intimacy of eye contact, and seemingly devoid of ways to express whatever it is they may feel. This is typical Faulkner, and the role of one or another kind of Faulkneresque caricature is played by a variety of major and minor figures in Light in August.<br /><br />Hell fire and damnation in a harsh and unsubstantiated religion, along with hatred for Blacks just because they're Blacks, are central organizing principles in Light in August.  Limited expectations and harsh judgments of those who seek something better or just different also pervade the book.  Vindictiveness in a variety of sometimes overtly ruthless, sometimes subtle forms is inflicted on those who deviate from established norms, however ridiculous these strictures may be.<br /><br />Rejection of kindness for its own sake is another theme, though perhaps of lesser importance, as when Joe Christmas denies the help of his adoptive mother who offers a counter to his rigid, self-righteous, and wrathful adoptive father.  I take this to follow from the fact that routine punishment for real or, more often, imagined sins is predictable, something one accepts as customary.  As a result, unsolicited, for-its-own-sake kindness is confusing, upsetting the balance of the world as some of Faulkner's most interesting characters commonly experience it.<br /><br />Faulkner's settings are typically ugly and devoid of comfort, and Light in August provides us with the ugliest and mostpunishing of them all.  One wonders what's the point of living in this place?  Perhaps that's why Byron Bunch fell in love with Ellen when they first met.  An obviously pregnant and unwed woman searching for the father of her child and doing so without cynicism, desperation, or punitive intent, but instead still trusting in the fundamental decency of a whiskey besotted, in-it-for-the-good-times cad.  Ellen was a woman who saw the world as a much better place than it really was, a rare exception to those of harsh judgment and unrelieved hatred and usury, all in the name of a gratuitously wrathful God.<br /><br />Ellen was the sort of person who would have confused, even terrified, Joe Christmas.  He had learned little or no reason to accept trust and kindness that asked for nothing in return.  Much as with his foster mother, the mere absence of wrath and selfishness confused him and persuaded him that he was being set up.  His murderous rejection of God, as offered by Joann Bunden, made perfect sense:  a gift of sorts tendered in exchange for nothing (the sex was gone now) was inconsistent with Joe's experience.  Again, one wonders, what was the point of living a life in these circumstances?<br /><br />Ironic that when former preacher, Gail Hightower, was driven from his church it was, truth be told, primarily for excessive and distorted zealotry, tying religion as he understood it to the South's defeat in the Civil War, a fact of God-governed history he couldn't accept.  His wife's suicide merely provided an excuse for accomplishing what bemused parishioners had long wanted.  Perfectly understandable, however, was the preacher's subsequent turn to flab devoid of muscle, an obese corruption of his former self.  Without his struggle with Godforsaken history and the Deep Southern citizenry that failed to appreciate him, he was devoid of purpose and fell into desuetude.  With no one to actively blame and no long-ago humiliation to rail against, he became inert and lazy, a man who had no strength because he no longer had use for any.<br /><br />Why Byron Burch sought Hightower's counsel is unclear.  Perhaps because they were both outsiders, both incapable of playing the roles that normally would have been theirs.  The Protestant equivalent of a defrocked priest and a man cuckolded before he met the woman he loved, their shared shame and disengagement must have given them a great deal in common.<br /><br />Both understood Joe Christmas quite well.  An escapee from an orphanage, uncertain as to whether he was White or Black, and betrayed by a woman he loved and whom he thought loved him.  One more member of the society of outsiders, the alienated, who were rejected by the people of this spiritually bereft world of pick-choose-and-invent ostensibly God-given principles, governed by a grotesque distortion of the divine.<br /><br />Of the three Faulkner novels I've read, this is the darkest, and the only one whose characters sometimes devolve into caricatures.  I keep coming back to the same question:  what's the point of living in a harsh and merciless world such as that depicted in Light in August?  I'm more cynical than anyone I know, but if the Deep South existed as rendered in this novel, it was a truly terrible place, far worse than I had ever imagined.  A place where being in a good mood was suspicious and no doubt sinful.  All this is worth knowing, and Faulkner is to be lauded for telling the story and telling it well.

Set in &#34;mature&#34; segregated South, the story is not easy to read, but rewards are there.  Its a tale of several outcasts and their experiences in Mississippi.  The story focuses on Joe Christmas, a man of possibly mixed race who is able to pass fro a white person, but is uncertain since his father is not known after being murdered by his grandfather who sends Joe away after birth and allows his mom to die by refusing to call a doctor. Joe grows up and gores into apparent bootlegging business with Lucas Burch (aka Brown) and is implicated in the murder of an abolitionist white woman who tries to set Joe on the &#34;right&#34; way in life.  Its never definitively stated by the author if Joe in fact is the killer and a lingering suspicion is placed on his partner who is an all around miserable character who ran away from his girl friend (Lena Grove)after she became pregnant.  There is also a preacher (Hightower) who is partly disgraced (since his wife had an affair and committed suicide), a local zealous bachelor (Byron Bunch) who tries to marry Lena and some other characters of mostly mixed moral standing...<br />I say the novel is not easy to read for two reasons.  First, Faulkner brings the characters and the plot together very inconsistently (this is intended by the author.  The reader sees parts of the plot and gradually other important plot lines are added to yield the big picture very slowly and throws up surprises until the very end.  This novel is not as disorienting as Faulkner's &#34;Sound and the Fury,&#34;  but it still disorients a lot.  Second - there are no real &#34;heroes&#34; in this story.  The central character, Joe Christmas, elicits sympathy due to his racial background and the treatment he receives from his family and those around him.  Still, he is a brooding and insecure person who has several violent acts and may well be a killer.  The abolitionist woman who tries to set him right is also essentially portrayed as aneurotic carpetbagger  attempting to channel her loneliness into Joe's salvation.  And she is murdered...And its pretty much downhill from here for character...Surely, this is a way of showing just how difficult the segregated South was on human morality, but it makes for a more difficult read.<br />Still, the novel is a brilliant showcase of how an immoral society translates itself into personal action and tragedy.  For those who are willing to read such a story, &#34;Light in August&#34;  provides a read of unparalleled quality.	2014-08-09

Over all, Light in August is not as “Faulkneresque” as one would imagine, as it does have a fairly linear quality compared to some of his other works (like The Sound and the Fury, for example). However, when you take a closer look at the events and themes and how they intermingle, Light in August does become a much more complicated and complex novel to decipher.<br /><br />At one spectrum, Light in August examines the theme of identity; however, this, in its simplest and base form, is really selling the novel and entire reading experience short. Light in August encompasses many roads and paths: alienation, individuals “lost” in the spiritual or physical sense, those who are forced into exile in one form or another. These are repeated patterns within the book. At the forefront of Faulkner’s essential exploration is perhaps a question to consider: How do individuals such as these cope? We (as readers) see the individual response to the community and this very question, as seen in the lives and events of three central characters: Lena Grove, Reverend Hightower, Joe Christmas. At one end is the individual, at the other society.<br /><br />Perhaps most remarkable about Light in August is Faulkner’s way of blending three various subplots into a larger message. Joe Christmas becomes a tragic figure in many ways: he is stuck, through no fault of his own, between the world of white and black. Society implies he has zero identity, and he goes about trying to find an element of who is he is. Faulkner captures this sense of alienation in fine poetic form, as Joe wanders through town: “He went on, not fast, away from the square. The street, a quiet one at all times, was deserted at this hour… In the wide, empty, shadowbound street he looked like a phantom, a spirit, strayed out of its own world, and lost.” Lena Grove’s determination to find the father of her baby, despite the common opinion or gossip of the community,is a journey in itself, perhaps as much spiritual as physcial. Reverend Hightower, rejected and disgraced, ostracized from the community for a scandal caused by his wife, still remains in town, and his pride allows him to experience redemption.<br /><br />There are no easy solutions or revelations in any Faulkner work, and part of the joy of reading Light in August is that each reader will take their own interpretations and conclusions with them. Light in August is very accessible, and I found the final two chapters to be quite amazingly constructed, deep in symbolism, imagery and perspective: a fine way to finish this novel.	2014-06-28

I must admit that my mouse cursor did hover over four-stars for a few seconds, but I could not let the hammer fall there. It makes no difference to me at all if I am in the minority.<br /><br />Even though I finished reading within a three-day span, I somehow feel like a piece of me is lingering there in the past, reading still. I am convinced this will pass with time, but it is a definite first for me. While it is replete with images, wordplays and personal character depth, Light in August leaves me with as many memories of staring at entire pages as it does with images and impressions of the living peoples invoked by the words themselves. So much in this work is stated and restated and restated, not in the realm of detail but with regard to strings of sentences that meander through long paragraphs that are as over-grown as the gardens near abandoned houses. Many times I found myself turning the page and thinking, &#34;still?&#34; We can easily forgive the inconsistent usage of tense and the usage of &#34;lay&#34; when it should be &#34;lie&#34;, but it almost verges on rambling in places. Once I found myself reminded of Thomas Bernhard's two-hundred and eight pages monstrosity of a single paragraph in The Loser. No, it is never near that bad, but if Light in August could have been sans one-hundred pages I could not have given it any less than four-stars.<br /><br />Still fighting the urge to add another star, I am also reminded of the many instances where plot and detail occur as mere necessity and without any natural rhythm. More pronounced that any of Faulkner's other works I have encountered so far, Light in August had a sense about it that the plot and perhaps the entire novel developed as it was being written. Immediately now I begin to wonder just how Joe Christmas ended up with a pistol near the end, how implausible that seemed, and will spare the readers of this review anymore of my wonders for the sake of preserving the story - but there are more that come to mind.<br /><br />Thankfully the depth, the splendidly poetic and enlightened descriptions, those images that were conjured laden with muse, and the delicate wording that many modern readers would find syntactically absurd - all of which I have come to love Faulkner for - were all present, but I am still satisfied with giving this work three-stars. While none of the characters were entirely likeable - which I was aware before undertaking might be the case - that creeping sense comes that Faulkner agrees with the notion that human beings behave the way they do simply because of circumstance, that men (and women) are helpless slaves to the social mechanism and wholly defined by its parameters. It is one thing to view these characters through the lens of fiction, but it is something else entirely to see it come across in third-person. Many professional psychologists - those who tell you what you are thinking rather than discovering it through equal discourse - adore seeing this paraded as fact, something of an Asch experiment itself I would say, because it validates the mechanical inferences of the wooden individual. But Art is the one doing the imitating, and to see this work pander to such a defeatist notion while dealing with such weighty and acrid subjects makes for a hard read, even for me. This, above all else, is reason enough why Light in August could never be five-star.<br /><br />Yet, I am remembering now a certain description, and another, and another - a scene, a relationship between two characters, and two others, and something else that happens - and one can almost imagine a phantom &#34;fourth-star&#34; in my rating of Light in August. Sentences such as &#34;Memory believes before knowing remembers.&#34;, and &#34;He had grown to manhood in this country, where like the unswimming sailor his physical shape and histhought had been molded by its compulsions without his learning anything about its actual shape and feel.

It didn't take me long to get over that fear.  While it's certainly not an easy book, I found it a lot more readable than &#34;The Sound and the Fury&#34;.  As a matter of fact, this book was a page-turner for me.  Wile it still incorporated some of the same stream-of-consciousness writing, this book, on the whole, was a lot more concrete and story-oriented.<br /><br />The story is compelling, but it's certainly not for the faint of heart.  It's both engrossing and shocking.  There's considerable violence, both sexual and racial, and also child abuse.  Overall, though, it's a powerful commentary on racism, religion, and community life in the old South.	2013-08-29

He left her with the assurance that he would send for her when he found steady work, but after months passed she grew impatient and decided to set out on her own to find him.  She has been walking and taking rides from kind strangers for awhile when she finally lands in Jefferson, where rumor has it the father of her baby is living and working at a planing mill.<br /><br />There is turmoil in Jefferson when she arrives.  A house is burning with a dead woman inside.  Two men, Joe Brown and Joe Christmas, who had been living on her property and working at the mill, are suspected of being involved in this crime.  Christmas has fled and Brown pins the murder on him and insists on finding Christmas and collecting the money for his return to justice.<br /><br />Byron Bunch, another worker at the mill, greets Lena as she arrives to ask after her future husband.  Bunch, against his better judgment, falls for her and immediately settles in to help her in any way he can.  Thus begins a convoluted story of intertwined lives and motivations.<br /><br />The characters in this story are fascinating.  They are three-dimensional and complicated, and I liked reading the backstory of how several of them had come to this place and position in their lives.  Joe Christmas is especially intriguing, with his tragic story of growing up an orphan unsure of his heritage.  Reading about how he sabotaged his own life at every turn was devastating.<br /><br />Byron Bunch is another interesting character, trapped in his life and seemingly unable to pull himself away from Lena once she arrives, although she fails to return his affection.<br /><br />This novel is realistic and well written and depressing all at once.  I couldn't put it down.	2013-08-11

I always go back and reread them again. Recently tried rereading Sound and Fury, but the opening after Benjy fell apart on me. Can't get past the first chapter of As I Lay Dying. Deeply intrigued by Absalom, but only getting started there. Light in August seems to be my Faulkner home. Riveting story, breathtaking language. This is the Faulkner that makes my hair stand on end. I wonder about the critical standing of the four novels. It's hard to take Bloom at his word. Someway somehow I think Light in August is the great Faulkner novel. Sound and Fury was transformative when I was  in my twenties, but Light in August always shocked me in every way and still does. Faulkner's poetry at its purest, simplest, most accessible. His heart the steadiest and deepest.<br /><br />Okay, the greatest Faulkner should reflect the intricacies of his method, so that would make it The Bear or (shudder) As I Lay Dying or The Sound and the Fury. But Light in August is akin to when Miles Davis and John Coltrane play Bye Bye Blackbird. They choose a familiar  piece of music so you can see the strange and astonishing things they do to it.	2013-05-25

But as the novel progresses they all go off the tracks, in altogether unfathomable ways.  By novel's end, they all are loonies, some dead, some still alive.  (And they don't include the most unhinged of all the characters in the novel -- Old Doc Hines, grandfather of Joe Christmas.)<br /><br />Each, to varying degrees, has been exposed to three poisonous environments that prevail in Faulkner's South.  First, there is the racial miasma.  Joanna Burden's father had told her as a girl that Negroes were \\"a race doomed and cursed to be forever and ever a part of the white race's doom and curse for its sins\\", and that dual curse pervades LIGHT IN AUGUST.  Second, there is the perhaps even more intractable schism between men and women.  Relations between the sexes are marked by suspicion and misunderstanding, hostility that often erupts into violence, occasional brute sex, but little love.  And third, there is hellfire-and-brimstone Protestantism - which condemns much of life as, in the words of loony Doc Hines, \\"bitchery and abomination\\".  As Joanna Burden once explained to Joe Christmas, \\"a man would have to act as the land where he was born had trained him to act.\\"  In the South, men - and women - are trained by the perverse versions of race, sex, and religion.  Faulkner's LIGHT IN AUGUST is a fatalistic view on life, and a sour one, to boot.<br /><br />There are many tremendous scenes in the novel.  The plot is complicated, but Faulkner handles its telling and the different narrative voices and perspectives masterfully.  And there is much superlative writing.  But in truth, the novel is somewhat over-written.  It is not as compressed, as taut, as Faulkner's two previous masterpieces, \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" and \\"As I Lay Dying\\".  Nor does it cohere; its force is centrifugal, rather than centripetal.  But my main complaint is that the five major characters become undone not through organic character development; instead, it is as if Faulkner were manipulating them like Zeus on high.<br /><br />Still, LIGHT IN AUGUST is a mythic and powerful novel, well worth reading.  Thus, despite my criticisms, five stars.once explained to Joe Christmas, \\"a man would have to act as the land where he was born had trained him to act.\\"  In the South, men - and women - are trained by the perverse versions of race, sex, and religion.

Here we aint been coming from Alabama but two months, and now it's already Tennessee.\\" A memorable line, from a most memorable character, Lena Grove, who is one of several finely developed characters in this literary masterpiece by William Faulkner. I've read most of his novels, and am in the process of re-reading some that were first read some, gulp, 40 years ago, like this one. Reviews have been posted of [[ASIN:B000W4G28I The Unvanquished]], [[ASIN:0679736514 Intruder in the Dust]], [[ASIN:0739325353 The Sound and the Fury]], and [[ASIN:0871403102 Soldiers' Pay]]. Of all his major works, this is the most accessible, while at the same time addressing several of the major themes of great literature. It is quintessential Faulkner, set in the ever-so-well described fictional Yoknapatawpha County, with its county seat of Jefferson (based on Oxford, Mississippi). There seems to be the right amount of major and minor characters, some appearing in other works, who move back and forth across the landscape. Likewise, the author moves back and forth in time, and shifts the perspective among his characters, yet he quickly orientates the reader to the new setting and characters. Faulkner maintains a strong element of dramatic tension; I found the novel to be literally a \\"page-turner,\\" as I sought to determine how he would resolve the numerous conflicts and dilemmas that he developed.<br /><br />Joe Christmas is one of the great characters in American literature, as he personifies \\"The American Dilemma,\\" wrought by its \\"original sin,\\" slavery. Who is he, really? It is the central question of his existence; far more so than for most of us. To say that he is of \\"mixed race,\\" in a part of the world where that really mattered, does not do justice to his existential angst. For, to use the expressions of the time, he can \\"pass\\" for white, even though he has a few \\"drops\\" of Negro blood. On paths that barely intersect, but do overlap, is the aforementioned Lena Grove, orphaned as she was just coming of age, at 12. At 20, she is knocked up by a \\"sawdust Casanova,\\" to use Faulkner's description. She is an \\"innocent abroad,\\" in that the \\"abroad\\" is anywhere further than a day's walk from her place of birth. She doggedly pursues the \\"Casanova,\\" knowing he will do the \\"honorable thing,\\" as he promised, and she relies of the kindness of many a stranger in the process. There is the de-frocked Reverend Gail Hightower, with a misalliance of a marriage, but truly \\"wedded\\" to the town of Jefferson, where his grandfather met a heroic death in the Civil War. Or was it heroic?  Joanna Burden is the quintessential \\"outside Yankee agitator,\\" who is now resigned to living a quiet, unassuming, hermit-like life in the country, showing her support for Negro education through her \\"good works.\\" Yet when the opportunity presents itself, she fends off deepening spinsterhood with some kinky sex. A somewhat lesser, but still strong American Dilemma, the rigid minds of religious fundamentalists are personified, at least in part by Uncle Doc Hines and Christmas' \\"daddy,\\" McEachern. There is even a cameo appearance by the Harvard educated District Attorney, Gavin Stevens, who does the \\"right thing.\\" It is a heady mix of individuals that Faulkner develops and handles well.<br /><br />If individuals can suffer from PTSD (Post-traumatic stress disorder), then surely whole regions can, with issues that reverberate still today. There is the re-writing of history, and the mythology surrounding events in a war, which defined much of Rev. Hightower's outlook. There is the grasping for sure answers that defines so much religious and political \\"fundamentalism,\\" of which the economic relations that race defined is a keystone. Faulkner defined his personal relations with the opposite sex as a \\"lot of time fumbling under women's skirts.\\" Unquestionably, there is an element of misogyny in his writing, and this is reflected to some extent in his depiction of women in in this work (I suspect the subject matter for at least five PhD dissertations). And there are the most profound questions of life: how do I define who I am, and how I will develop (or not)?<br /><br />Not long after I read this work the first time I was in a movie theater watching Robert Altman's superb film, [[ASIN:B008DF1CKQ Nashville]].

The U.S. is a racially intolerant nation, with four centuries of violence toward African-Americans as part of its past and present. \\"Light in August\\" is the story of Lena Grove, a pregnant, unmarried young woman; of Gail Hightower, a minister; and of Joe Christmas, 33-year-old moonshiner. Their stories intersect because the father of Lena's child is also the partner of Joe Christmas in the moonshine business, and Hightower, an isolated outsider, delivers Lena's child. When a woman is murdered, it looks as if Joe Brown (the father of Lena's child) is guilty. But Brown immediately announces that Christmas is black. (We never know if this is true or not, indicating that a person's race doesn't matter.)  That makes Christmas guilty in the eyes of most whites. He is pursued by a national guardsman bent on killing a black man.<br /><br />All the characters in this book, the ones I've mentioned and the ones I haven't, have heavily symbolic names: Grove, Hightower, Brown, Christmas, Burden. I didn't enjoy that part of the story: I felt the symbolic names were too heavy and interfered with my reading the story. Many people consider this the best of Faulkner's novels in plot and pace. It's probably the most accessible, and Faulkner seemed to have fewer flights of language here than elsewhere. If you want to try Faulkner, this is a good choice.	2012-05-01

However, it was sufficiently compelling to ensure that I reached the end of it.<br /><br />Lena is slowly making her way from somewhere in Alabama, searching for the man, who has made her pregnant. He had told her that he had to leave her in search of work. Eventually, she reaches the town of Jefferson in time to see a plume of smoke arising from it.<br /><br />The smoke comes from a house that has burned down with its owner, a spinster, lying dead inside it.<br /><br />Brown falsely accuses Christmas, his friend and workmate of murdering her. He is keen to receive the large reward that has been offered to find her killer.  Christmas, a young man who believes, as do all the other characters in the story, that he has some Negro ancestry, is an obvious suspect. I will give spoil the story if I reveal that Christmas is lynched.<br /><br />Faulkner ingeniously interweaves the stories of Lena, Brown, and Christmas along with that of Hightower, Jefferson's disgraced clergyman, and produces a complex tale in which the reader gradually learns about their tragic lives.<br /><br />Faulkner's stroke of genius in this novel is to make the reader understand that Christmas, who looked just like a white man, had a trace of Negro ancestry. By having all of the characters in the novel believe this is the case, the author is able to describe the innate racial prejudices of many white folk, who lived in the Deep South, in a highly original way.<br /><br />Adam YAMEY, author of ALIWAL	2012-04-27

The back cover of my edition describes this book as being primarily an exploration of the nature of evil, focusing on the story of Joe Christmas.  But while Christmas and his various deeds do provide the primary driver of the plot, I think it is misleading to simply say that the novel is about him.  If that were Faulkner's intent, I'm not sure he would have spent so much time on characters like the defrocked Reverend Gail Hightower, Joe Brown and the unfortunate but determined Lena, Byron Burch (maybe my favorite), and even the victim of Joe Christmas's rage.  Even relatively minor characters have a story to tell, and the story is not always merely a way of finding another avenue back to Joe Christmas, or even to the theme of evil.  Some of them are just about Southern society, and they are as illuminating as the grander moral themes surrounding the crime and ultimate fate of the racially and morally confused Joe Christmas.  Faulkner's style is unique, and while I cannot judge how well it works in other novels, I can say that the portions in which he used stream of consciousness were, in my view, quite effective at opening a window into the inner lives of his characters.  So a style I thought might be distracting actually had the opposite effect more often than not.  This novel is sometimes moving, sometimes humorous, but always careful in its descriptions and pace.  It treats important themes, both at the level of society and at the level of the individual.  I have not read enough of Faulkner yet to put hand on heart and swear that he is one of the greatest writers America has produced (though that is his reputation), but it will not surprise me if I am prepared to do that after another novel or two.  I intend to give myself that chance.	2011-08-14

I guess that what Faulkner intends to indicate with them is that there is a whole section of Southern people who are too poor, too dispossessed, too agricultural and too simple and naturally of good nature and good will to be involved in the delusional historical imaginings, the barren and frigid religiosity, the mindless chicanery, the `abomination and b----ery' of male obsession with female filthiness, and the intractable horror of racism that seems to be the otherwise pervasive set of perversions visited on a backward-looking and decaying society.<br /><br />That's the pit in which every other character seems to be mired.<br /><br />Some of these characters are `no better than they should be.' \\"Grim\\" the National Guardsman who performs the lynching by castration seems to be merely a machine actuated by militaristic racism. \\"Lucas Burch\\" (alias Brown) is just the kind of no-account and shiftlessly useless woman-trifling man to cause nothing but illegitimacy, carry out no decent work, betray even his betrayals of society, and slope away from every kind of responsibility known to man. As Byron observes, he seems handy at nothing but jumping a moving train.<br /><br />The Sheriff isn't an overly bad man, but he's not overly concerned with forms of justice either. The middle class and propertied people of Jefferson are a Greek Chorus of gossip, accusation and assumption that permit or encourage the depradations of the Klan, the shunning of the `different'; they are the judges, andby indifference, communal executioners of many a life. The hard-natured, barren-virtued MeEacherns who adopt a child under odd circumstances, not to love him, but to work him and raise him to an unflinchingly hard standard of bleak morality, slender reward, and frequent whipping are doing only what they have no other opportunity but to believe is right, and the opposite of wickedness to be found in town.<br /><br />Others characters are from a foreign and grotesque world created from distortions of the racial code. Joe Christmas, the central icon of the novel (I don't think it would be really right to call such an enigmatic personage a character) passes for white, and for all we ever really know for a fact, may not possess a drop of black blood (in a society where one drop would be enough to damn him). It's enough that he has absorbed the idea that he is partly of Negro blood--and it is more than enough for everyone else merely to hear that to think of him and treat him with the inhuman cruelty specially reserved for what they think of as (N-word).<br /><br />Everything he is and does is measured and responded to differently just because of the mere idea of his supposed negritude. His relationship to himself is intractably cursed by this idea, his relationship to Miss Burden is based solely on their mutual supposition that he is tinged with black blood, his obdurate attitude to every punishment and equally to every blandishment, all of his utter isolation from other humans, is predicated on his knowledge of himself as someone who passes for white, but really is black, a fate he seems to try to flee, but flees inexorably to find.<br /><br />The mad old man who is his grandfather and yet seems bent on destroying him is turned into a grotesque little scarecrow of hatefulness by his racism and repudiation of his own daughter. His machinations at the heart of the story are as inexplicably and sourcelessly vile as those of Krook in Bleak House. He just wants to see harmcome, and he determines the action so that it will. To my mind he is the biggest reminder that Faulkner loved to read Dickens, since he is a major engine of the plot.<br /><br />Then there are the civilized people who `ought to know better' but seem just as caught up in events as everyone else. Miss Burden (named that way since she is the inheritor of an abolitionist family that seems to have made a career of `bearing the white man's burden' to raise the condition of the Negro in the benighted south) has been utterly isolated from her local community all her life by her family's political / racial stand. She carries on their work, and seems to invite Christmas to be her lover in a sort of general way as part of her racial politics. Then she gets caught up in a perverse wallowing in her action, as if in a gutter of virtue. She is never seen from within in a way that makes her a very convincing character.<br /><br />The real `main character' of the book for me is Gail Hightower, the moral observer. He rails against the idea of being drawn into the events unfolding around him, but is drawn in anyway--not really to undertake any significant action, but at least to be a sentient and unwilling witness.<br /><br />Hightower (a name that nicely indicates his elevated viewpoint but very precarious moral stance) is an old man, long a marginal hanger on in Jefferson, and marginal also in his own life. He contains that essence of the moral conflict and moral decay that afflict the higher, more educated stratum of Southern life.<br /><br />He is shown as being hardly able to possess his own, present, life. This is because he has allowed the semi-real history (too long past for memory) of his ancestry to dominate and overtake his mental and spiritual life. His grandfather was a slaveholding man, an attorney, a bluff man among men, a drinker, a huntsman. He has died before Hightower's birth, as a Cavalryman raiding the Union supply depot in Jefferson under the command of Earl VanDorn. He hasn't died a hero in battle, but has been shotgunned while stealing chickens from a henhouse after the main business of the raid is over.<br /><br />This massive irony dominates and delights Hightower, who somehow still identifies with the old man, rather than with his own father, who turned Presbyterian and Abolitionist, yet served on the Confederate side in the war, and lived on afterwards as a self-taught doctor. Hightower himself goes to Seminary and gets himself called to the Presbyterian Church in Jefferson. There, he gives a free rein to his imaginings about history, a very strange way to fulfill his pastoral duties. He also badly manages his maladroit marriage to a discontented spinster, who dies a suicide in what sounds like a sordidly illicit situation in a Memphis hotel. This debacle has caused his congregation to fire him, and to be outraged that he has nevertheless refused to leave Jefferson. He stays there, decaying quietly in private penury, hanging on at the edge of town, until Byron Bunch drags him in as a help to him with Lena and as at least a witness of sorts to the injustice being done to Christmas, who ends up being slaughtered in his very kitchen where he has run for refuge.<br /><br />The fact that everything culminates in Hightower's kitchen, under the decadent nose of the one man in town who can't fail to understand the moral bloodlines and implications of everything that has been done and is being done, seems Faulkners' gauntlet flung down before all the high-nosed aristocracy of a society that he himself has thoroughly indicted as rotten in its antecedents, obsessions, behaviors and outcomes. Hightower knows that wrong will be done, and is unfolding, but tries right until the last moment to avoid having any part in fighting it.<br /><br />At the end, we know it's a good thing that Lena and Byron are moving not only away from Jefferson, but away from Alabama and Mississippi into Tennessee--further north and west. The novel hasn'tbeen `southern gothic' merely in the name of being shocking. It's grotesque because Faulkner meant to show what grotesque contortions he believed a southern community could entertain, contain, harbor, and cause to flourish. Deadly nightshade indeed.	2011-06-14
US	52562548	R10GDRWNS8SO7K	0679732268	161451712	Light in August	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Great Characters in a World of Racism and Violent Religion	LIGHT IN AUGUST is an involving (but long-reading) novel about the effects of racism and pernicious sexual attitudes in Faulkner's mostly clodhopper and mule-riding South. LiA is considered one of Faulkner's masterpieces and it probably is, although this novel has one paradoxical shortcoming. In a book with MANY great characters, the protagonist, Joe Christmas, is as much a product of Faulkner's themes as he is a personality. Yes, Christmas is a self-hating laconic outsider with a violent streak. But he seems mostly to embody racial conflict and a doomed fate. Compared to other characters in LiA, Christmas is on the quiet side and seems reactive, if not empty.<br /><br />The great male characters of LiA include three Protestant preachers (Hightower, McEachern, and Hines) and one Protestant choirmaster (Byron Bunch). Each is concerned, in contrasting ways, with the issues of adultery and personal responsibility. Meanwhile its great female characters--Lena Grove and Joanna Burden--struggle with difficulties of courtship and motherhood. Finally, Faulkner's minor characters--Lucas Burch, Miss Atkins, Mrs. McEachern, Bobbie Allen, and Mrs. Hines--all make vivid and consistent impressions as Joe Christmas powers inexorably through their lives and towards his wretched fate. If LiA were a movie, these minor characters would be scene stealers who win Best Supporting Actor awards, as the actor playing Christmas makes big statements on racism and moral savagery.<br /><br />Faulkner primarily creates a linear narrative in LiA, making this a much easier read than his other novels--THE SOUND AND THE FURY; ABSALOM, ABSALOM!; and AS I LAY DYING--that are widely considered masterpieces. The book has many pages of jaw-dropping expressiveness, much sly humor, and frequent instances of homespun insight and philosophy, especially from the doting Byron Bunch. Finally, nothing in the story, certainly not the details of Christmas's gruesome end, is predictable. Even so, block out some time if you begin LiA, since Faulkner requires a committed reader.<br /><br />Recommended.if you begin LiA, since Faulkner requires a committed reader.<br /><br />Recommended.	2011-05-12
US	10181599	RSSCG3V9NMQC5	0679732268	161451712	Light in August	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Pretty accessible for Faulkner - this is a novel well worth reading	This is my third Faulkner novel (The Sound and Fury and As I Lay Dying being the other two) and it's easily the most accessible.  Faulkner has a reputation for writing novels that are difficult to read.  It's a lot of work, but for fans of the author, it's worth the effort.  Anyone interested in `testing the Faulkner waters', should consider Light in August a good place to start.  It is about as conventional a novel as I suspect Faulkner ever wrote (I've only read three so I'm hardly an expert on the subject).<br /><br />But a `conventional' Faulkner novel is still pretty unconventional.  Perspectives are continuously shifting from one character to another, but at least in this novel, Faulkner makes it clear whose perspective it is at any given time.  In a number of cases a new character is introduced for the sole purpose of having a portion of the story told through their eyes, often never to be mentioned again.  The story is told in a non-liner fashion but at least Faulkner makes it clear when the story is shifting from the present, to the recent past, to a long ago memory (this isn't the case in all of Faulkner's work - sometimes you're on your own in trying to determine not only who's perspective it is, but when in time the events are occurring).  One of the interesting things that Faulkner does well is to tell overlapping versions of an incident from more than one perspective (and they don't always match, making the `truth' as uncertain as it is in real life).  Faulkner seems intrigued by the idea of looking at events from different angles and showing the reader different 'realities' depending upon the point-of-view and this is something that, as a reader, fascinates me.<br /><br />Some readers might find it strange that the second to last chapter focuses on Hightower's memories of his grandfather in the Civil War and his demeaning death, his wife's infidelity, and his own religious fervor and fall from grace.  This might seem like a strange time (so close to the end of the novel) to delve into the past and provide a detailed history of a character that we've already spent considerable time with, but I think this chapter is of great importance to Faulkner and what he is trying to say in Light in August.  The Civil War's influence permeates all aspects of life in the south and provides context to the racial prejudice experienced by Joe Christmas in the novel.  While the issue of racial prejudice is explored in the novel, I think Faulkner also had something to say about the relationships between men and women and the distortion of religion.  These themes are also featured prominently in Hightower's reminiscing.  This chapter is arguably the most important in the novel because it articulates so much of what Faulkner has to say.<br /><br />I enjoyed Light in August.  It has a surprisingly `active' plot with a lot going on in the present day story which (almost) makes it a bit of a page-turner (well ok, calling it a page-turner may be an exaggeration - but it is a compelling story).  There are multiple engaging characters to connect with and I like that they are fully realized and flawed - even unlikeable.  The characters in Light in August are all outsiders.  The prose is extraordinary and poetic at times.  Of the three Faulkner novels I've read, I rank this one in the middle.  Like many people, I struggled with The Sound and the Fury and while I caught glimpses of brilliance in it, my overall reaction was lukewarm (I should probably re-read it to see if my opinion changes with a second reading).  As I Lay Dying on the other hand really got under my skin and I was mesmerized by it.  Light in August was not nearly as obscure as Fury but it didn't resonate with me the way Dying did.<br /><br />Faulkner isn't for everyone.  He's intentionally abstruse.  His novels are demanding and can be bleak and difficult to read.  But if you are willing to wade through them though, they can be very rewarding.  If you are interested in reading something by Faulkner, this is probably the best place to start.  Light in August is one of his most accessible novels, but it's also a very good one. I'll be moving on to Absalom Absalom next.g something by Faulkner, this is probably the best place to start.  Light in August is one of his most accessible novels, but it's also a very good one.

Thus we must turn to him for that continuity of moral purpose which made for the greatness of our classics.\\" --Ralph Ellison<br />(Note: This quote is taken from the product page for this version of \\"Light in August.\\" It led me in the direction this review takes.)<br /><br />Light in August. Somewhere recently I read that Faulkner heard his wife use that line to describe the light in August in Mississippi where they lived (Oxford, not far from the border with Tennessee). Her line was the catalyst to this novel, not about race, but about \\"the nature of man,\\" his striving for \\"that continuity of moral purpose.\\" A third source for this review is Jung's collective unconscious. That \\"light in August\\" is a common denominator for Southerners, who instantaneously envision that \\"slice\\" of light, that particular way the light bends in August. That same light (enlightenment or the lack thereof) also wreaks havoc in the Southern collective unconscious concerning race, not as prejudice, but as a fact of history. I, too, a Southerner, see this light, archetypically and symbolically, in my mind's eye.<br /><br />As a master writer and thinker, William Faulkner took all these elements: that slant of \\"light,\\" the concept of race, and moral purpose and wove them into a masterly novel about Man.<br /><br />Take the characters' names. Those alone should signal to the careful reader that a writer of intentionality is at work. Let's begin with Lena Grove. Faulkner named his house in Oxford, Rowan Oak. The word \\"rowan\\" is in reference to the rowan tree, which originated in Ireland and has safety and protection as its legend. A rowan is part of a grove. Thus, Lena Grove is a source of power, and in her case, self-protection. She has strength on the basis of her own identity. A single, unwed mother-to-be makes her way from Alabama to Mississippi on foot to find the father of her baby. After all, he promised to return to her. Instead, she comes to claim him. The power of a grove.<br /><br />Who is this young man, this n'er-do-well who audaciously leaves her? Why, his name is Lucas Burch, one tree to her grove, but it's a twisted tree, burch, instead of birch. The man who does fall in love with the solidness of Lena's demeanor and self-confidence is Byron Bunch, a solitary man who has been living and working in town for four years now. His life is bunched up, he is unable to untangle, unravel, but just exists in a wad until the powerful Lena Grove \\"unbunches\\" him or perhaps bunches him more.<br /><br />Byron's friend, Rev. Hightower, does what his name implies--he lives in a \\"high tower\\" of his own making, like Bunch does in the sawmill. What Faulkner does is imbue all his characters with a history. We learn Hightower wanted to be a preacher early on, but the Civil War caught him. Afterwards, he marries (another vivid character) and takes her away to this town where he wants to have his \\"calling.\\" Each is a pawn to the other in the game of life. Hightower crashes fairly early on to join the dust of the world, but lives an isolated life in the window of his house (like a high tower), as Byron does. Faulkner makes sure the reader understands this by making Hightower into an obese, pallid creature, as if he does not live, but is a statue. The fact that these two self-isolated men, one intelligent and educated, the other intelligent and very common in his beliefs, befriend each other is inevitable.<br /><br />There are two sets of highly cruel, fundamentalist men in the novel:  Doc Hines (think of your rear-end) and<br />Mr. McEachern (each to his own). Both are adult males who interact with Joe Christmas, the central figure, the source of that \\"light\\" that slants on Mississippi. Left on orphanage steps on Christmas Day (thus his name) and named Joseph (get it?), Joe Christmas becomes one of the most controversial figures in American literature. He is the child of an unwed white girl, herself the daughter of a fundamental, racist preacher. She tries, as do many tightly controlled girls, to fight for freedom, for breath, for life through \\"love.\\" The boy is a circus worker, perhaps Mexican, perhaps part Negro.<br /><br />It is at this point that the reader must understand the laws at the time. (Understanding does not connote condonning.) Jim Crow laws of the South stated that anyone born with any part lineage with Negro blood was deemed legally Negro. Thus, Joe Christmas, for all visual identity purposes, was White (the legal term at the time), yet that ambiguous paternity factor rendered him black (yes, Faulkner uses the n word as a document of history, whether his intention or not). To Doc Hines, the preacher, later \\"doctor,\\" the baby was a n-word, therefore he was unworthy to live. Doc wanted him \\"gone,\\" and finally wanted him \\"dead.\\" This history of the South does, indeed, stink, but, nevertheless, it remains history. Faulkner records it in all its detritus.<br /><br />Later, McEachern, another fundamentalist bible thumper, adopted the boy when he was five years old and trained, or tried to train, him as another fundamentalist. Joe resisted forced religion, even unto beatings. Some critics make Joe into a Christ figure, but after my recent reading, I can no longer follow this line of thought. However, I will present one parallel. Public religious figures of the day of both Jesus Christ and Joe Christmas wanted to eliminate each from the earth, each for different reasons, but both out of hate and ignorance, nonetheless.<br /><br />I have read of the charge of Faulkner as racist in other reviews. However, as Ralph Ellison points out, Faulkner is concerned with moral purpose much more than racism. Each of the two most racist characters in the novel suffer the consequences of their hate. Hines becomes a virulent, scorned, occasional blathering idiot by novel's end, while McEachern's own excessive hatred causes his own murder.<br /><br />Faulkner is also accused of being a misogynist. The wives of each fundamentalist are wooden creatures with limited access to freedom, with each wife taking it passively and secretly. Again, history is part of this story in that women had limited rights during the America of the early 1900's, with African Americans even less, including the right to life if caught in particular circumstances. Does history make those actions right? What an absurd question. But Faulkner faithfully documented the America of his time.<br /><br />Two women in the novel do have power, one legally and one by chance. Joanna Burden--my gosh, but these names are so obvious--is the other central figure in the novel. She is a free woman, who inherits a legacy and never marries, thus never losing her rights to ownership--to her land, her name, and herself. As a foreigner to the South--her ancestors hailed from New Hampshire--she does not inherit that blight of racism that comes with being Southern. Black people are ones she helps with her money and legal advice. She, ahem, embraces Joe's Negro-ness. Their coming together is both perverse and beautiful: perverse in their approach to each other, yet beautiful in their acceptance of each other. Of course, such a relationship in such a time is doomed.<br /><br />Moral purpose? What could Faulkner be saying through this relationship? Out of the context of history, it could have been extraordinary (if indeed it isn't already!), but in context, it must suffer the way of any mixed race relationship of the time. However, the very fact of ambiguity of Joe's racial makeup, allows no one to know what Joe could have been, certainly not Joe himself, not Joanna (although she tries), not the reader, and not even Faulkner, for he, too, is part of history.<br /><br />The second woman of power? But she has no man, no home, you might say. No? Just wait, she will, whether it is Bunch or someone else.<br /><br />So, is Faulkner racist? Allow me the space for onesection of Faulkner's acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in Literature:<br /><br />\\"I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail.

The plot of this novel is dominated by race and racism.<br />I am revisiting `LiA' after 30 years. I remember that it left me then without deep impressions, apart from the general thought that I should get to know more by Faulkner to understand him better. So far I have held back with this intention, not out of any specific reason.<br />Now I go there because some of my Amazon friends have started a battle over Faulkner. The arguments have become deeply personal, and I thought, now I need to know why that is so.<br />A key question in the disagreements is whether WF was himself a racist or not. Or on a more complicated thought: was he a `racialist' in the sense of a conviction that race determines character, abilities, personality...?<br /><br />Light in August is essentially about perception of race. The main protagonist is a man who is assumed to be mixed. He thinks so himself, but doesn't know for sure. (`If I'm not, damned if I haven't wasted a lot of time.')<br />We don't know for sure, as he was a foundling, one Christmas at the steps of a white orphanage. How people see him and how he sees himself is largely determined by whether they know that he is or may be mixed or not. The man himself is deeply divided about himself, he loathes himself at times. He is emotional, irrational and destructive.<br /><br />The story begins with Lena, a pregnant unmarried young woman leaving home in Alabama in search of the man who fathered her baby. Everybody but her knows that he ran; she is a good girl and believes in him. She finds him in Mississippi.  We enter a world of saw mills, bootlegging, arson, murder, radical Christians... Her man turns out to be hero Christmas's partner in crime.<br /><br />The world is commented upon in the words of various protagonists. There is e.g. Byron Bunch, a mill hand with religious tendencies, who takes his own racist attitudes for granted. Gail Hightower, the former Presbyterian minister who got fired after the death of his wife under embarrassing circumstances, but hangs on in the town, is dreaming his time away with fantasies of Confederate warfare and has despicable racist thoughts, but at the same time charitable abilities.<br /><br />The townspeople keep up their KKK civilization and have tried to run the former minister out of town, because he had a black cook, who was suspected to have done other things, `bad things'... The sheriff seems to think that a man's being part black is worse than being suspected of murder. A lonely Yankee `immigrant' woman, a descendant of an abolitionist family, gets killed in her house. Her house gets burned down. It had been used, without her knowledge, as basis for the bootlegging operation. The murder suspect is the bootlegger, the man who is also suspected to be part black...<br /><br />We learn about the man's childhood in an orphanage, about his adoption by a harsh Christian father. The orphanage chapter is strong and could stand alone as a short story. It is hard to see Faulkner as a racist if one reads texts like this chapter.<br />Christmas becomes a drifter and mover between worlds.<br /><br />We meet Doc Hines, Christmas's grandfather, one of the most evil creatures in literature, a religious fanatic on strict Old Testament standards. For Hines, Christmas is evil, because his father was, maybe, part black. Not even the devil knows for sure. Hines is the devil for all practical purposes of this story.<br /><br />No need to post a full summary, that can  best be found in Wiki, which also gives some interesting hints at structural aspects: the biblical parallels are intriguing, but not in the line of my interests. (On second thought, the idea of JC dying at 33 and prior to that giving himself in and the book having 21 chapters like the Gospel of John ... all these thoughts may have a point and may possibly be what the author intended, but they don't make me like thebook better. I choose to ignore that line of analysis.)<br /><br />More important: was WF a racist or was he only describing a racist society? Based purely on this novel, I see no basis to accuse Faulkner of being part of what he described.

I read it many years ago and was excited to hear it on a CD-set. It was excellent companionship for my daily walks.<br /><br />It was the story of a seemingly white migrant worker who had `a drop of Negro blood' in his veins, parallel with the story of a young, pregnant white woman who runs after her apparently useless husband-to-be to try to get married. The stories intertwine as the associated racial tones and attitudes play out in early 20th century South.<br /><br />Faulkner, by the way, I believe was ahead of his time in attacking the racial prejudices, and his use of offensive racial epithets in the dialogue give the stories a raw, genuine flare.<br /><br />I am stilled awed by the power and mastery that Faulkner has over the language, even with the fearless punctuation and spelling. He knows how to create a mood while telling a compelling story. His run-on sentences have a purpose!<br /><br />I do have a definite problem with his hopelessly depressing existentialism.  You just want to shake some of his central characters out of their malaise, but it does make for some great story-telling.<br /><br />The CD reading was excellent. The recitation was well-acted and directed, and accessible, with different intonations for the different characters. The story is fairly complex, but the tracks are short and you can replay when necessary.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.	2009-10-07

I read this book for an American Lit course in college and I'm so glad I did because this is one of the books I refuse to put in storage with the rest of my thousands of books because I find myself wanting to go back and read it over and over again. I think if you buy this book you might feel the same way. If you've never read Faulkner before, he's the toughest author I've ever read hands down, only second to maybe Dante or James Joyce.

I don't have the time to get into how great it is because I'm at work, and that would take all day.

I'm glad I waited.  This book is way too powerful and complex for a High School mind.  Maybe wait until after college too!  I am looking forward to the chance to read it again.<br /><br />This book is a massive tour de force, inexplicably underappreciated in American literature.  In LIA, Faulkner exhibits throughout the book the ability to lead you exactly where he wants you to go.  You feel totally enraptured by his storytelling, and eagerly await his guidance at every turn.  There were several occasions where I felt so totally struck by his words, or the turn of the plot, or a characterization, that I just plopped the book down and screamed out lout, \\"Oh, MAN!!\\"  One of my favorites is when the sherrif discovers a body and says \\"if she had been able to that alive, she wouldn't be dead now.\\"  You'll have to read the book to find out what she was \\"doing.\\"<br /><br />The book begins with a young woman walking down a dirt road into town.  It ends with her riding out of town with a husband.  Simple enough, but in between there are 500 pages in which she barely appears!!  It's all a whirlwind examination of racism, regret, and the many complexities of the human condition.<br /><br />Pick it up and you won't put it down!!	2008-07-28

This is a wonderful book which should be a pleasure to read. My one concern, and I am not alone in expressing it, is that the 'corrected' text is to some extent a reversion to a draft that Faulkner himself (as I understand it) agreed to change in the light of editorial suggestions which, in many cases, he accepted as improvements. To correct back to an editorial stage before the involvement of an editor is an odd editorial practice and, when a writer has been as tactfully and agreeably edited as Faulkner, rather a doubtful one. A parallel text, or a fuller description of the logic of the Polk emendation, would have been useful, for the general as well as the specialist reader. All the same, a wonderful edition to read.	2008-07-27

I will let you in on a little secret, though. I have found that Faulkner is much better to LISTEN to than read straight. I'd read several of his books when I discovered my local library had a number of tapes and CDs of his work. Those read by Mark Hammer are in a class by themselves. Not only does he have the proper accent, but his pauses in Faulkner's often long,involved sentences show a great familiarity with the work and add a strong element that make his words sparkle like jewels with brilliance and an uncanny insight into the characters he displays for us. After that, reading Faulkner is never the same.	2008-05-14

First off, I found it extremely annoying and confusing that there were several characters who had the same or similar names; it was kinda hard to keep track of who was who or what was going on. Second, and my main problem with the book is that I just could not relate with or even like one character in this book. I can't connect with a book if I hate every single character. Overall, this book was just dismal, although its one redeeming quality was its narratives about racism and the differences between whites and blacks. That is the only thing keeping me from giving this a one star review.	2007-12-19

Although a bit easier to follow having less stream of consciousness it still requires some patience and appreciation for nuance. Further, if you take the story at face value you will be missing out on 90% of what it has to offer. The themes run deep and the characters symbolic. I'd recommend reading exerpts from One Matchless Time by Jay Parini who provides some good insights into Faulkner's life and his writings. I'd also read the review written by A.Mason (below). This was one of the more violent and sexual books that I have read of Faulkner.  Although I was surprised, I was in awe of his tact and style in portraying these events in a subtly gruesome way that takes the reader off gaurd. The climactic scene of Joe Christmas's undoing was Faulkner at his best. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves good writing and is fascinated with the tragedy of the post-Civil War southerner.	2007-08-12

That was the case here.  Faulkner's prose is often like poetry and his use of the language is unquestionably masterful.  He shows his talent not so much in the words he uses - the vocabulary is actually quite plain - but rather in the way he combines those words. Simple adjectives are used to create compelling scenes and even more compelling characters.<br /><br />Faulkner strikes me as the consummate observer.  He doesn't moralize, he doesn't become overwrought, he doesn't offer judgement.  He simply observes the way things are, not the way we want them to be, and there is a sense that we are being propelled towards not tragegy but simply reality in his writing.<br /><br />Light in August is ostensibly about Joe Christmas, a headstrong and mysterious drifter in the 1920s deep South, but surprisingly we aren't introduced to him until several chapters into the book.  The book chronicles the intersecting people and events that surround Joe Christmas in Faulkner's fictional town of Jefferson, Mississippi.  However, the author introduces us to so many other non-incidental characters that it is often hard to separate the leading from the supporting cast.<br /><br />If I had to describe the characters in this book in a single word it would be \\"trapped.\\"  There is an overwhelming sense of stuck-ness we get in observing their lives.  One does not necessarily get the impression that they saw themselves as stuck and hopeless - indeed many seemed to exist in frustrating ignorance of reality.  But for the outside observer to whom Faulkner tells this story using his rich narrative, it is obvious that to a person, every character in this book is indeed on a treadmill.  Slavery may be over, but the people that populate these pages are in very real servitude to themselves and their pasts.<br /><br />The book is a glimpse at the deep South immediately prior to the depression era.  We're presented with a culture that still hasn't quite come to grips with life on the other side of the Civil War and racialism is so deeply ingrained that although slavery is no longer law, the caste system it birthed lives on in the arrogant attitudes of the whites and the subservient squalor of the blacks.<br /><br />The loyalties and alliances and relationships in this book are complex, as are the characters, and more than once I found myself wanting to slap these characters into sense.  Without exception, each was their own worst enemy and managed to almost single-handedly sail their lives into the rocks.  Although many were admittedly pointed rock-ward via their upbringing, they had ample opportunities to change course but continued sailing directly for the cliffs.<br /><br />Although I have not yet read other books by Faulkner, I'm told this is the most approachable of all his writing, reading the most like a traditional novel.  There is plenty of tension in the story, as the saga of Christmas and the other characters unfolds dramatically.  Consequently, most people will find themselves turning the pages in anticipation of what happens next.  Faulkner takes the reader on numerous side journeys, showing how the characters came to be what they are, and those characters often share certain aspects of their history in common, not just their present circumstances.<br /><br />As the book draws to a close, the treadmill keeps turning with characters trudging futilely into the sunset, still stuck in the same ruts in which the beginning of the story found them.  I'll say little more.  To do otherwise is to risk spoiling the plot.<br /><br />I can perhaps describe the overall experience here as bittersweet.

US	9998487	R2VA5Z6BE50GPS	0679732268	161451712	Light in August	Books	4	9	18	N	N	Major but Flawed	Faulkner's was a self-indulgent, irresponsible, uneven gift. But at his best, as sometimes in these pages, he is a poet and rhapsodist without equal, and we continue to read him.  As a rational thinker he was a nullity; he had no practical insights, no social program, no agendum, no framework that could serve as a starting point toward a solution of the problems he so tellingly describes.  This became abundantly clear around the time of his winning the Nobel prize for literature, when he disappointed and exasperated followers who were looking to him for guidance as to a beacon.  At least Faulkner had the self-knowledge to know that he did not know, did not in fact even want to know.  For knowledge was inimical to his art, not-wanting-to-know a precondition for it.  That, and bourbon. The bourbon released his inhibitions and silenced his inner editor (its voice had never been loud), unleashing a torrent of words, much of it bilge but some diamonds too.  The result in Light in August is an exasperating novel that contains some thirty scattered pages of the highest poetic value and one potentially great character in the person of Joe Christmas.  I say this as a man of 54 who has read the book five times in the course of his life, having been introduced to it in high school.  Of course I didn't understand much of it then, but its inimitable style and voluptuous confusion have beckoned me back to it.<br /><br />One is attracted above all by the descriptions of the simple processes of life in all their earthy particulars, the negro cabins, the town lights, the smells, everything rank and dark and elemental.  Except for Joe Christmas and possibly Gail Hightower, the characters are all stereotypes, especially the women.  Intellectually, there is little of substance in the novel, its appeal is entirely emotional.  There is a clean, bracing no-nonsense description of hypermasculine elements and experiences to which Joe seems to gravitate naturally.  For instance, of McEachern's harness strap (\\"clean, like the shoes, and it smelled like the man smelled: an odor of clean hard virile living leather\\") and Joe's rapt expression when being beaten by it; of Joe's preference for the clean, hard air of men.  Given his latent homosexuality, one feels Joe would have done much better as a votary of the strap. But there was a problem.  Biologically he was wired for pussy, and no mistake.  Even as a child in the orphanage with the dietician he showed this susceptibility: \\"On that first day when he discovered the toothpaste in her room he had gone directly there, who had never heard of toothpaste either, as if he already knew that she would possess something of that nature and he would find it.\\"  He was still too young to understand what Charley was enjoying, but when he came of age he learned that it too, like the toothpaste, was not always sweet (\\"periodic filth between two moons suspended\\"). Unfortunately, Joe had no use for the rest of the package and never learned to like and appreciate women as people. This was the root of his troubles with women and by cutting him off from a source of life helped to seal his doom.<br /><br />Several reviewers have stated that Joe had some negro blood. This is an error and is refuted by the evidence given in the book, although it suits Faulkner (if not Joe) to make Joe out as a possible negro and even to foist him off as one.  I think Faulkner's device here, of using the negro as the ultimate symbol of the outcast, is a dreadful mistake, so serious as even to call into question his integrity as an artist and his understanding of his greatest character. Why?  Partly because it is too easy, too cheap a shot.  It's also overkill, since Joe's alienation has already been powerfully delineated by other, artistic means.  But the main, the fatal objection, is that raising the N question does great damage by introducing confusion precisely where the novel demands clarity and restraint -- it entangles Joe's problem of identity with something completely separate and other. This other is a serious communal problem in its own right and certainly should not be abused as a symbol in the way that Faulkner abuses it.  Faulkner is monkeying around with things bigger than himself, things he does not understand, in an attempt to endow his work with a greater significance than he was capable of developing on his own horsepower as a creative writer; this is what I mean when I say he is irresponsible.  Joe's problem is in fact his alone.  Damaged in childhood and partly cut off from the sources of life, he has to renew and rebuild himself to a degree not necessary to his complacent countrymen, who by virtue of their utter mediocrity are granted automatic membership in small, stultifying, inbred towns like the one in which the action unfolds. Faulkner's punishment is swift and certain -- it is precisely here in the book that he begins to stumble, to overreach for a grand synthesis that isn't there.  The performance is increasingly over-the-top until eventually artistic control is lost.  He doesn't seem to grasp the limitations of his creations, and the book becomes a stew.  Faulkner was nothing if not confused, and here alas the confusion damages the work. Where was that inner editor?<br /><br />After the murder, a building momentum sweeps the reader on to the end.  However, there is no true catharsis and no real tragedy, only an overreaching for a grand synthesis that fails.  The reader is struck by the feeling that something has gone wrong, and on going back finds he has been the victim of a swindle.  The book closes with that sucker Byron Bunch in tow with his damaged goods in the form of Lena Grove and her bastard infant.  Faulkner seems to be saying that in spite of some mistakes, life has returned to its immemorial path.  But if this is salvation, one must be glad for Joe that he is safely dead and out of harm's way.  Not everyone is cowed by the eternal feminine, and Joe himself would have no trouble giving the Lena Groves of the world what they deserve -- the back of his hand.<br /><br />So after forty years and five attempts at this book, what of value can I take away? Perhaps some thirty pages of beautiful poetry, and the memory of Joe Christmas.  He sought to rebuild and renew himself through the transformative power of hard physical labor and I would like to leave him there, continuing now and forever on the roads he freely chose for himself, that run \\"through yellow wheat fields waving beneath the fierce yellow days of labor and hard sleep in haystacks beneath the cold mad moon of September, and the brittle stars.\\"ntity with something completely separate and other.

Light in August by William Faulkner is the book for the first time Faulkner reader to start with. The book is very readable. Unlike some Faulkner stories, the story line is easy to follow. His verbosity is not as apparent in this work as in some of his others where lengthy sentences and tangent monologues within the story derail the reader.

Faulkner and his wife are sitting on the verandah sipping bourbon or whatever in the late afternoon. She says something like \\"Isn't the light in August like no other\\" to her laconic husband, absorbed in his literary world. He suddenly stands up and exclaims \\"That's it!\\" and disappears for a time.<br /><br />At first, the thing that was so striking to me upon rereading this book was the feel the author had for nature and the elements, and the way he used words to evoke the actual presence of the place. People in this day and age of information technology tend to be very insulated and protected from the outdoors. The experience of Lena Grove in walking and hitching rides on mule-drawn wagons from Alabama to Mississippi takes us to a different world. The writing is so evocative and interior - it seeks to show the point of view of the characters, who though they may not be very sophisticated, still face conflicts that are timeless and heartrending.<br /><br />The novel revolves around a kind of ultimate outcast in Joe Christmas and involves four other major characters: Lena Grove, Byron Bunch, Rev. Gail Hightower, and Joanna Burden. Contrary to the wonders of nature and the mysteries of creation and birth, the characters find themselves subject to a strict moral order apart from nature. In particular, we find a rigid system of segregation that separates everything according to race and a Protestant religion that features an inflexible code of ethics. Joe Christmas does not know what his heritage is, whether he has a black lineage or not, and he does not fit on either side. The efforts of his religious-fanatic foster father to beat into him a strict catechism leave him further alienated, as it results in his denying the vitality and importance of the female - as something that weakens his own masculine will, the only thing that he has left to survive.<br /><br />The story proceeds in a complex fashion. There are flashbacks and stories from the past, and all the events converge to Faulkner's mythical town of Jefferson. Lena Grove and Byron Bunch are relatively simple, earthy characters, but the other two, Hightower and Joanna Burden, are definitely more complex, at least partly owing to the fact that their family heritages contain a lot of conflict with slavery.

With its three interwoven plots, its use of flashback, and its family secrets, the book reads like a multi-generational saga--even though the main storyline occurs over a mere nine days. It deals unflinchingly and unsettlingly with such complex themes as isolation and bigotry in small-town life, race relationships (and, particularly, the meaning of race itself), the constrictions of a strict religious upbringing, and the terror of sexual pathology. And, like Faulkner's other work, it paints an often unsettling, occasionally gloomy, and even comic portrait of the American South.<br /><br />The lives of several initially far-flung characters overlap in the novel's complex plot. First, the naïve Lena Grove arrives in Jefferson, searching for Lucas Burch, the man who abandoned her after getting her pregnant; she meets instead Byron Bunch, a quiet man who believes working on Saturdays will keep him out of trouble. Unrelated to Lena's personal calamity is Bunch's friend Reverend Gail Hightower, who lost his ministry and became a reclusive outcast when his wife openly cheated on him and eventually killed herself.<br /><br />But the most powerful and memorable character is the mysterious Joe Christmas, a brooding wanderer whose ancestry is unknown and who finds work (and more) from Joanna Burden, a descendant of abolitionists who continues alone her family's historical advocacy for civil rights. Bringing the stories full-circle is Christmas's relationship with the elusive Lucas Burch; the two drifters operate a moonshine business while they live on Burden's property.<br /><br />In the character of Joe Christmas, Faulkner has invested all his own conflicted feelings and insecurities about race and religion. Raised first in an orphanage and later by an abusive and fanatically religious man and his doting and pious wife, Christmas believes he may be part black, but, since he can \\"pass\\" for white, it's never made clear to him whether this is true. After the book was published, Faulkner claimed that \\"the tragic, central idea of the story [was] that he didn't know who he was, and there was no way for him to find out.\\" Uncontrollable, random, and violent forces form Christmas's personality and cultivate his personal demons, but in the end the reader is undecided whether Christmas is a monster or a martyr.<br /><br />The book's deliberate ambiguity is what makes it so potent, but there's enough mystery, murder, madness, and mayhem to keep it from being an aimless morality tale (and it is one of the easiest Faulkner books to read). It's the type of book you think about after you finish, and then flip through again to flesh out all the secrets and uncertainties you missed the first time around.o him whether this is true.

Also, with dark themes and exploitation of racism throughout the book, it might not be fun to read. Light in August portray human dilemmas with issues of moral ethics that cannot be debated by politics. The book starts out with Lena Grove, orphaned at age twelve and she is pregnant, searching for her child's biological father because she wants what is good for her soon to be born child. She later gives birth to the child in a cabin. Later in the child, the father of her child, Joe Brown, sees her holding the baby and runs off. The story changes its views from Lena to Joe Christmas, a protagonist and an antihero with biracial background, who is first seen as a martyr but the violence and his development of becoming a thief, bootlegger, sex fiend and a murderer. He develops an affair with Joanna Burden, who later tries to help him but he ended up murdering her. Afterwards, he is jailed and later he escaped, found, shot and killed, and castrated by a bounty hunter. Another character's viewpoint that the readers know is Reverend Hightower, a preacher who is obsessed with the past of the Civil War, and he stands as moral or philosophical center of the novel. There is a scene where he vividly recalls a scene where the cavalryman falling off his horse. Later he prepares to kill himself after recalling the past. The book ends up with Lena and her companion, Byron Bunch, a good honest hardworking man, who falls in love with her, in search of her child's biological father. There are many moral issues in this book that are undebatable, which I believe Faulkner intented.	2006-06-07

Overall, it is his most readable and likeable masterpiece. And it leaves you wanting so much more.<br /><br />The complex and ambiguous character of Joe Christmas alone could have been the source of three or four novels detailing different times in his life. While Christmas is hardly a likeable person, he is fascinating, hypnotic, a train wreck; you can't keep your eyes off him. His actions are morally ambiguous and inconsistent and yet fully understandable within his nature. As a creation he deserves to rank with Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer, Captain Ahab and Jay Gatsby in the pantheon of American literary characters.<br /><br />Faulkner has a big mission here. The novel exposes the evils of racism both in the South and among white, northern abolitionists. It traffics in religious symbolism while savaging religious fanatacism. And it leaves one with a great deal of memorable violent and sexual imagery. And that's just for starters. This book is deep, and while its storytelling is largely non-linear, it is far more palatable than the other three, which tend to be confusing and obscure. Enjoy this one. If you've never read Faulkner, it's a great starter.	2006-04-01

The antihero is Joe Christmas, a man who looks white and can't deal with the racial identity he is assigned under the \\"one drop\\" rule.  Christmas endures terrible hardships in his youth and these make him into a violent man.  After striking down one enemy, he drifts aimlessly for 15 years until he meets a woman who tries to reconcile him to himself.  Besides Christmas, there are some appealing supporting characters: a young, uneducated, and unmarried woman who is about to give birth, a hard working man who cares for her, and a ruined minister who observes the others and reflects on their predicaments.

As such, most of the narrative is a long flashback detailing what has happened to Joe Christmas that defined he as the person he is. Readers can follow the ups and downs in his life and the search of his own identity. There something deterministic in his story, since this man is the result of the environment he was brought up.<br /><br />Christmas's story is intertwined with two other characters': Lena, a pregnant girl in search of the father of her child; and Reverend Gail Hightower, a former minister that has faced hard times and now is haunted by ghost from the past. But for most of the middle section of \\"Light in August\\" Faulkner focus on Christmas that is, indeed, a very peculiar and extremely well developed character.<br /><br />Compared to other books by Faulkner, such as \\"The Sound and The Fury\\" and \\"Abasom, Absalom\\", it is an easier and minor work. Here, his devices such as stream of consciousness is not as present as in the other novels. Therefore, reading it is `easier' -as far as reading Faulkner can be an easy task. It is an interesting form of start reading Faulkner for those who are interested and haven't read any yet.<br /><br />Even tough the structure is not as complex and difficult as \\"The Sound and The Fury\\", \\"Light in August\\" has tools that are common in Faulkner's style, such as digressions and flashbacks. This is one of the reasons why reading this author requires double attention. Scenes from the past pop up throughout the narrative out of the blue. At the same time, he is more interested in the interior life of his characters, and for the reader understand that, he provides a thoroughly depicted background. Moreover, his prose is poetic and his text laboured.<br /><br />In his work, Faulkner created another universe that is at the same time a mirror and a microcosm of the South of the USA - and that can be applied to the whole world as well. His characters are trying to get out of this world, but hardly can manage to escape, due to exterior factors, such as racism, violence and so on. \\"Light in August\\" is a good example of book that summarizes his interests and provides an unforgettable piece of literature.SA - and that can be applied to the whole world as well.

Readers familiar with James Joyce's \\"The Dead\\" may recall the earth-shaking, redemptive epiphany of Gabriel in the last two paragraphs of the novelette (I usually work through the paragraphs with students sentence by sentence if not word by word as he keeps oscillating back and forth, making us wait until the final word of the story before, like Dante at the end of \\"The Paradiso\\" attaining the glimpse of the force or power of grace that shatters his pride and unites him with all humanity.  Faulkner offers a similar critical moment to Rev. Gail Hightower in the penultimate chapter of \\"Light and August\\"--but with a different result.  As I grow older, that moment, its universality and present applicability loom ever larger in personal consciousness, making me question my own life and motives--am I still clinging to the outdated, Romantic and enchanted notion of heroic but highly problematic chivalry, dominance and fame?  or have I learned to renounce, completely and irrevocably, the white Knight fantasy that once seduced me into regarding it as a worthy model?  (Considering for a moment three other prototypal protagonists in American literature and film--Jay Gatsby, Willie Loman, and Charles Foster Kane--they all come to the end no more self-enlightened than they were doing the periods of their greatest, but adolescent and ultimately destructive, self-delusions.)<br /><br />At first I was skeptical of Oprah's recent choice of a third Faulkner novel, since \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" would have introduced readers to not only Faulkner's masterpiece but perhaps the \\"Great American Novel.\\"  Upon second thought, \\"Light in August\\" makes a lot of sense.  It's more accessible even than \\"Sound and the Fury\\" and \\"As I Lay Dying,\\" with an action-packed, frequently suspenseful multiple-threaded plot.  In the character of Joe Christmas, moreover, the novel begins to confront the inescapable, universal yet personal, questions of race that \\"Absalom\\" explores with the introduction of the Octoroon.  Moreover, the novel's plotting is likely to \\"hook\\" the majority of readers until that challenging penultimate chapter, at which point no reader in his right mind would dare quit on the story.<br /><br />Suspicions to the contrary, Faulkner doesn't waste words, and the reader must have in the back of his mind the early reference to Hightower's sermons about a cavalry officer being shot off his horse.

If \\"Light in August\\" lacks the epic sweep of \\"Absalom,\\" along with the intense interior monologues of the female characters, it offers what might be considered Faulkner's most \\"theological\\" view of a fallen but redeemable humanity.<br /><br />Highly debatable is the question of Hightower's \\"salvation.\\"  Even as readers, we may feel that we along with Hightower deserve some sure sign of the character's redemption.

There would be no problem whatsoever were it not for that final paragraph (if only I could erase it) alluding to the distant sound of galloping cavalry still resonating in Hightower's consciousness.

I have to be honest that the structure threw me off.  There are so many important characters, and FAulkner doesn't want us to miss any one of their life's story.  So he gives a huge biography of each character, which sort of messes up the flow of the main story, and you get lost who's story you're reading about or what it is all about, at least for a moment.<br /><br />But the issues that he's dealing with is so serious and heavy, and despite his thick and overnarrative writing, the subject itself captivates you and gets a grip of your mind.  Thus I couldn't put the book down.  I said, \\"Never mind if he's a scattered brain.  Finish the book first and then try to understand why he wrote this one in such a screwed up structure.\\"<br /><br />Victor Hugo does a lot better job weaving the lives of many characters and putting them together as one work.  Hugo is a magician.  This book of Faulkner's doesn't have that kind of magic.  The lives of his characters aren't woven finely, like here's one huge block of life, there's another huge block of life, and just when you thought you figured it out, you come upon another huge block of life, which makes it really hard to read.  But each characters is unforgettable, as some of the reviewers wrote, and the issues that Faulkner is tackling with is monstrous.  Considering the weight of the task, I think he did a great job.<br /><br />Until the end, I didn't understand what Lena Grove's role was.  She conceives a child of a scoundrel who has abandoned her, and she leaves her village to find him by trusting strangers.  And the strangers she encounters all voluntarily helps her.  All the characters in this story are social outcasts one way of another, and Lena is the first one.  She trusts, but one begins to wonder what it is that she trusts.  The other outcasts, especially Joe Christmas, or Rev. Hightower, or Miss. Burden, act totally different from Lena does.  Faulkner deliberately starts the story with Lena, and ends with Lena.  In between, he throws in the tragic lives of the other outcasts.  Not only that, he lets a totally unimportant stranger, who has never even mentioned previously in the story, tell about Lena to his wife.<br /><br />Since I'd never read Faulkner before and wasn't familiar with his style, this was probably a rough start, and I still think he could have done a better job in structure and organization.  There were a lot of duplicated tellings, wasting pages by repeating the same episodes; he could have eliminated at least 100 pages if he organized it better.<br /><br />But the story was told in great depth, very satisfying and intense, and you get to know the characters very well.  I liked it a lot better than Hemingway's detached way (I can hardly get through Hemingway!).  Just read it when your mind is clear and ready for a heavy task.	2005-05-20

William Faulkner's Light in August is not a cheerful, lighthearted book like the title might lead you to believe.  It might as well be call Dark in September.  Despite the misleading title, Faulkner has woven together another dark, stunning, and great novel.  Any other author could not have achieved what he has done, which is, told an ordinary story in an extraordinary way.  If you have ever read anything by Faulkner, however, this won't surprise you a bit.<br /><br />The story opens on the dusty roads of Alabama.  A young girl, Lena, has just left her home and is searching for the father of her child.  She picks up a ride from a fellow who takes her to nearby town where she heard her former lover is living.  She asks all around, but alas, she seems to be mistaken.  Instead she encounters a man with a very similar name and he ends up taking care of her.  His name is Byron Bunch.  Ironically, the man she is searching for does happen to live in the same town as a bootlegger, but she won't find that out until later.<br /><br />The story next shifts focus a Reverend Hightower.  He was a former preacher who is haunted by visions of Confederate horseman.  He used to have a congregation but they left him because of his adulterous wife.  Byron Bunch visits him often and tells him the story of Joe Christmas, a drifter that he used to work with.<br /><br />Next, and for the core of the novel, the story shifts focus to Joe Christmas.  It tells of his abandonment at birth, his abusive, adopted parents, and his troubled teenage years.  Eventually, after a tragedy occurs, he becomes a drifter on the road.  No one cares about him and he doesn't care too much about anyone else either.  Joe ends up making friends with a guy named Brown.  Ironically, this guy named brown is the same person Lena is searching for at the beginning of the story.  Brown and Christmas live in a cabin isolated from the rest of the town and engage together in the bootlegging business.  Also, Christmas has a love affair with a woman who originally inhabited the isolated cabin.  He and Brown stay there for a time until the major misfortune and plot twist take place.<br /><br />The main issue Christmas faces is identity confusion.  Supposedly he has black blood in him but looks like a white man.  All of his life, this has scarred him deeply.  He has never had an identity of his own.  Is he white or black?  The evils that happen to him revolve around this whole issue of race.  I won't reveal how exactly the story unwinds itself at the end.  All of the characters lives become connected in some way when the climax hits its peak as we take in the catastrophe that occurs.<br /><br />Light in August is strewn loosely together in third person.  Much of the story takes place in flashbacks.  One of the pure brilliant elements of the novel is the matter of fact way Faulkner throws the issues of race, abuse, and loneliness at us.  Among Faulkner's many geniuses is letting the reader decide how to react to the issues and situations presented. This novel is another shining example of this.  It is as well written, unsentimental, and uncompromising as any of his other works.<br /><br /> Most of this novel is about a hard hearted drifter, but Faulkner also develops his supporting cast.  The characters are as rich and deep as any Faulkner novel (perhaps part of the reason is that it is almost 200 pages longer than his average novels.)<br /><br />Another praise of the novel is Faulkner's description.  He paints strikingly original scenes with his words.  Sentence fragments, jumbled together words and phrases, complex mixed with simple vocabulary.  It has to be read to be believed.  Faulkner has created another world of his own in this simple story.  It has to be read to know exactly what I am talking about.  Some of the passages will leave you breathless.  I have never read an author that can create so much uniqueness with his words.  This is not his most powerful or creative work, but it is a polished, sparkling gem in its own right.  Light in August flows more like a collection of well drawn out scenes that a straight forward story.<br /><br />Getting back to its title, Light in August, I wondered what it meant.  After some research, I learned that Faulkner's wife used to comment that the light in the south seemed a bit different in August than in any other month.  Perhaps this is what he had in mind when he named the novel.  It is bit different than most reading you will ever do.  This is the darkest Faulkner novel I have read, but it still has a certain glow to it, much like August days in the South do, I suppose.<br /><br />Grade: A	2005-03-04

As with Faulkner always there is the ongoing romance with the neverstopping prose which keeps the reader moving on and on as if the reading itself were one great adventure story and Faulkner had himself invented a technique so powerful as to be the rightful legacy of all writers who wished to enrapture their readers with a poetic philosophical or pseudo- philosophical prose which never stops entertaining us with new descriptions and feelings, as if too then the others, the preacher and the do- gooder and the whole book itself were telling us that this literature is redeemed only as itself and not as any social message it gives but in the life of its characters and in its language which in Faulkner is always great. And I here must apologize and say that there are a few very good reviews on this book on Amazon written before this one which tell far more about the work than this one and might be better read in helping to understand it.	2004-10-28

Overall, it is his most readable and likeable masterpiece.  And it leaves you wanting so much more.<br /><br />The complex and ambiguous character of Joe Christmas alone could have been the source of three or four novels detailing different times in his life.  While Christmas is hardly a likeable person, he is fascinating, hypnotic, a train wreck; you can't keep your eyes off him.  His actions are morally ambiguous and inconsistent and yet fully understandable within his nature.  As a creation he deserves to rank with Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer, Captain Ahab and Uncle Tom in the pantheon of American literary characters.<br /><br />Faulkner has a big mission here.  The novel exposes the evils of racism both in the South and among white, northern abolitionists.  It traffics in religious symbolism while savaging religious fanatacism.  And it leaves one with a great deal of memorable violent and sexual imagery.  And that's just for starters.  This book is deep, and while it's storytelling is largely non-linear, it is far more palatable than the other three, which tend to be confusing and obscure.  Enjoy this one.  If you've never read Faulkner, it's a great starter.	2004-07-29

It could just as well be a work of science fiction, set as it is in a post-apocalyptic world, where cast-up survivors stagger about in a frightful disconnect, trying to reconstruct meaning and a code to live by.  Of course, they are doing a terrible job.  This is no nuclear winter, though. It is the rural south of the early 20th century where the Civil War happened yesterday and the failures of Reconstruction continue to take their toll.<br />The plot lines are not easily sorted out for a capsule account.  It is tempting to begin, \\"At the heart of the book . . .,\\" but Faulkner would be the first to respond, \\"how do you know with any certainty that that is the nucleus, that is the real truth?\\"  The tattered social code that these people have snatched from the fire of the Civil War comes down to a few \\"givens\\"- white is supreme, black is untenable, men must be strong leaders unbent by lesser forces, women must be virgins until they marry and true to their husbands, and murder, especially of white by black, must not go unpunished.  Truth is at once harshly stolid and easily muddied.<br />The author devotes the greatest amount of energy to the grizzly murder of a spinster, ostracized by her Mississippi community by virtue of her Yankee heritage and her social ministerings to the black community.  That she is white and the accused is assumed to have partial black heritage gives the white populace something with which it can define itself, a fierce, righteous drive to avenge the death.  Faulkner sorts out the histories of the players to determine why they have become involved, the truth of their individual existences as well as their knowledge in respect to the case. Weaving in and out, like a stupid Cassandra, is the very pregnant Lena, who begins the book by pursuing on foot her missing boyfriend out of Alabama, and continues to pursue him even while it is obvious he is a lost cause, even when there is someone else willing to assume responsibilities.<br />Faulkner's use of language and symbolism is breathtaking.  This is worthy reading, but do be warned, it is not for the faint of heart.  Seventy-five plus years later, it causes you to ask the disturbing question, have we come far enough away from the cave of dark violence and ignorance he depicts?	2004-05-18

He had been the Presbyterian minister.  Even the Ku Klux Klan had not managed to persuade Hightower to leave Jefferson.<br /><br />Hightower and Byron Burch commence to discuss a fire at Mrs. Burden's house.  Christmas and Brown lived in a structure in the back.  Mrs. Burden had started praying over Joe Christmas.  It was not her fault she had gotten too old.<br /><br />Joe Christmas went from an orphanage to the home of the McEacherns, a Presbyterian couple.  As a teenager he started to see a waitress in town.  McEachern watched Joe.  He ordered the waitress away.  Joe went to Chicago, to Detroit.  Finally, age 33, he was on a Mississippi country road in the vicinity of the Burden house.  During the first four or five months of his stay in a cabin on her property, Joe and Mrs. Burden would stand and talk like strangers.  Later she told him she was pregnant.  Now he had a partner in the whiskey business--Brown.<br /><br />After the fire and Joanna Burden's death, the people searched for Christmas.  Brown was placed in jail for safe-keeping.  Christmas ran off to Mottstown.  He becomes obsessed with getting food.  Joe Christmas is killed.  He is sent across the square with a deputy and unidentified men take him.<br /><br />Gavin Stevens is the district attorney, a Harvard graduate.  Stevens tells the authorities that Christmas will plead guilty and take a life sentence.  His death follows.  Lena's baby is born around the time Joe Christmas dies.

I do not wish to rhapsodize on the story of race--that is evident within the text and, honestly, is not the main point or the actual sin of the story.  Race is less concept then consciousness in this book and the idea of 'racism', here, is more inbred than an actual physical hatred: a part of tradition and learning than something violent people go crazy about.  Joe Christmas is someone torn, who is constantly choosing sides until he can no longer be anything.  This, as a result, makes him an actual individual, a person outside such superficial considerations and therefore not really qualified to exist in this world.  All of the primary characters are outsiders of one sort--all of them are equal and all are fundementally the same in their yearning.<br />A very powerful book with a unique vision of the way the world works . . .	2004-02-26

Days later, I finished it and threw my copy into the trash, having concluded (in pity, despair, and utter revulsion) that Faulkner was after all of sound mind and still possessed of his literary genius as he wrote.<br />Unquestionably, the text is illuminated with his gift for words and the rhythm of his sentences.  Short sections of it sing, as does the work of no other living author.  The theme too (racial identity and its problems both for individuals and for the world) ix a familiar one today, and so appeals to modern readers. Faulkner brings the sufferings of Joe Christmas, his protagonist, to vivid life.<br />But all of this, for me, was washed away by the increasing incidence of sadism as the story continued, sadism so vividly and seemingly enthusiastically repeated as to repel even this hardened reader. As it all went on, I entertained the thought that Faukner working on it must have been teetering on the verge of a nervous breakdown! The theory was dispelled in &quot;The Oxford Companion,&quot; which devotes much space to a plot synopsis of the book. (Even this laborious task, however, flags in its basic effort to summarize the novel's plot--some of which came to me as a surprise!) I will read with interest other (and differing) reviews.	2003-11-20

Light in August is no exception. It is a truly remarkable story. The 4 stars simply differentiate the best from the very best. Although this book is not as complicated as As I Lay Dying or The Sound and the Fury, it contains many of the same ingenious qualities regarding point of view and time.<br />The real difference here is that in those books, Faulkner was concerned with the consciousness of the individual characters themselves while here we are dealing with the relationship of the consciousness with the external forces of nature/nurture and the outside world.<br />This is a story about racism in the south. Although the story line itself covers only a few days, the book refers back two generations. Each of the main characters, Christmas, Hightower, and Burden are dominated by racism in different ways. It is racism and their reaction to it that brings them to their ultimate end. Most of the other characters and the town itself are also driven by the same demon. It boils down to the simplicity of white is good while black is evil with the shades in between being a transition from one to the other. When Christmas puts on the black boots of a negro, his transition from white to black is complete and he is then prepared to accept his fate.<br />The only character untouched by racism is the unwed and pregnant Lena. Interestingly the white father of her child who runs to escape his responsibility is called Brown(the one truly unlikable character in the book). Lena literally strolls into  town and the story at the beginning and strolls out at the end, untouched by the happenings. Her ignorance of her personal moral shortcomings also insulate her from the moral shortcomings of a racist society.<br />Does this storyline make this novel outdated today? Absolutely not. It may be even more true today than then. Today people's reaction to racism or perceived racism is driven more by outside influences than internal feelings or experiences and those who ignore those influences are like Lena and go on with their lives not to be dominated by it.<br />Faulkner is one of the truly great American writers. I ignored him for 50 years and have now read 4 of his novels in the last 2 years. I've enjoyed them all.	2003-09-24

What seems to be a tale of an ambitious, determined pregnant woman hitch-hiking out from Alabama to look for the child's father evokes the lives of a skein of interesting characters whose lives readers will not easily forget.<br />Lena Grove was pregnant with Lucas Burch's child. She set out from Alabama for Jefferson, Mississippi to search for the man who promised to send for her as he settled down with a job at the mill. Welled with anticipation and hope, Lena arrived at the plant only to realize that she had mistaken Byron Bunch for Lucas Burch.<br />As soon as the search shed lights Faulkner takes away Lena from his readers and defers her until the end of the book. Joe Christmas, a man with mixed ancestry (part white and part Mexican) somehow befriended with Lucas Burch who carried a fictitious identity &quot;Brown&quot; and colluded in bootlegging whiskey.<br />A substantial coverage of the book recounts Joe Christmas's childhood in an orphanage, his abused adolescence under the McEacherns, his mystifying affair with a slave advocate Miss Burden, and his apprehension after he allegedly burned down the house in which Burden resided in and thus murdered her. Brown sold him out for the thousand-dollar reward.<br />Byron Bunch, if not dredging overtime at the mill, would visit and keep accompany of Reverent Gail Hightower, who had be expelled by the elders in town after his adulterous wife committed suicide in Memphis. The ex-minister inherited a small income, gave arts lessons and handpainted Christmas cards. He was constantly plagued by visions of Confederate horsemen who killed his grandfather.<br />So go back and forth the narratives of the book, over vast intervals of time. Byron Bunch, who was in the know of Lucas Burch's dual identity from the beginning, deftly dodged Lena from the truth but arranged her to settle down at Burch's cabin. Together with Lena, Byron also ascertained the identity of Joe Christmas when the Hines, an old couple from Mottstown, arrived in Jefferson.<br />I don't want to elaborate on the aspects of symbolism (this book has an abundance of them). The names could be symbolic (Christmas, Burden, Bunch, etc). The notion of race and skin color is outrageous in this book. Joe Christmas led a tragic life as a desperate, oppressed, enigmatic drifter who was irreparably consumed by his mixed ancestry. His very own grandfather talked of lynching him because of his copper, parchment-colored skin.<br />Political overtones seep through the book. Miss Burden's father moved back south from California and spent much time cursing slavery and slaveholders. I get the impression that the curse of the black race is God's curse, while the curse of the white race is those whom the white race has suppressed. The chapter on the reverent is so obscurely filled with dissertation on sins (some of the most arduous, tenacious reading of the entire book).<br />The structure of the novel is worth a discussion. With 21 chapters, Lena Grove's search for the father of her child is deferred until the very end. Faulkner barely mentions her in passing in Chapter 14 when she settles down in Jefferson. The third and the second-to-the-last chapters devote to Reverent Gail Hightower. From Byron Bunch seems to be sewing all the pieces together as he recounts all the happenings in town and Lena Grove to the reverent. So everything in between shrouds the story the Joe Christmas. The result is a concentric ring structure Faulkner has astutely and deftly constructed in the novel.<br />Light in August deftly captures the Southern life focusing both on the personal histories of his characters and the moral complexities and uncertainties of an increasingly dissolute, diverse (of which Joe Christmas is an epitome, nobody recognized him as part Mexican) society. The book is a unique combination of a plethora of symbolism and a stream-of-consciousness technique. The characters stay with readers. 4.0 stars.	2003-07-18

The story is set in the South, in the early 1900's I believe. The main character is Joe Christmas, a very complex character who seems to have trouble fitting in, perhaps on account of his being of mixed race. But, there are other interesting, well-developed characters such as Reverend Hightower, Lena Grove, Joe Brown and Byron Bunch.<br />It's kind of hard to describe exactly what the plot of the novel is. But basically, it intertwines the tales of the aforementioned characters in Jefferson, Tennessee. A large portion of the novel concerns Joe Christmas' pursuit by the law after his suspected murder of a middle-aged woman.<br />The writing style in this novel is very interesting. It tends to delve into the mind of each of its characters, giving the reader a sense of the motivations behind their actions. As I said, the novel intertwines story and so it tends to jump back and forth in time shedding light on events and people in a very interesting manner. Faulkner does this very well, without doing it so much it becomes confusing.<br />I had originally read this novel 3 years ago as a junior in high school and for some reason I can't really explain, I just kind of felt I should read it again. So, I did and I'm glad I did because Light in August is a great novel. I haven't read anything else by Faulkner, so I can't compare it to any of his other works, but this novel is a pretty good read.	2003-06-29

I love the style this book is written in, Faulkner's writing never disappoints in terms of vividness and the use of beautiful metaphors. Some parts, like the description of Lena's journey and of Joe Christmas' relationship with Joanna, were very captivating. However, I object to the whole premise of the novel; Faulkner tries to play psychologist in his writing, and it simply does not work.<br />  Basically, it is a story of &quot;victimization.&quot; Joe Christmas is the product of racism and of a bad childhood, and everything he does is rooted in his past problems. This book suggests that a human has no conscience of their own and cannot rise above their upbringing. &quot;Light in August&quot; seems to insinuatine that we should excuse murderes and rapists because they were mistreated at some point in their lives. Maybe for someone who is sympathetic to that sort of view the book would be a good read, but the fact that I strongly disagree with Faulkner kind of ruined this one for me.	2003-05-17

Along the way, she ends up on the fringe of what is the main body of the story--the confused and confusing fate of Joe Christmas, a man of unestablishable racial heritage in Faulkner's fictional town of Jefferson, Mississippi.  Along the way, we meet three of Faulkner's most famous minor characters--two religious maniacs, and a white supremacist--along with a host of locals, so that the town itself becomes a character in the novel. Central to the story is the relationship of Joe Christmas with Joanna Burden; a relationship mordantly confused by the simultaneous attraction and repulsion of Joe's uncertain racial background, as well as the additional issue of Joanna's masculine personality compared to Joe's sometimes passive nature. (Naturally, it is no accident that they are both named Jo.  The last names Burden and Christmas are self-evidently suggestive enough, and the JC of Joe Christmas has prompted comparisons with Jesus, at least to the extent that both men die as a result of the sins of society.)<br />\\"Light in August\\" is not always a cakewalk though.  Organized like concentric rings (the first and last chapter are about Lena, the second and next to last about Rev. Hightower, and all the rest of the inner \\"rings\\" concerning Joe Christmas until you get to the center chapter, or hub, the murder of Joanna), the two chapters on Rev. Hightower serve as \\"spokes\\" that connect Lena to the Joe narrative.  The fit is rather casual, although one can draw the obvious conclusion, since the white father of Lena's child is named Brown.<br />The most difficult parts of the book are definitely the Rev. Hightower chapters.  Not even Faulkner seems to have satisfactorily explained what he was getting at with them, and the truth is that it's a bit hard to really feel compelled to figure it out.  My advice would be to just read it through, get what you can, and not worry about it's supposed to be.  Because the rest of the book is definitely full of rewards and has some of Faulkner's most compelling prose.  In particular, in the first few pages of the book, Faulkner imaginatively raises up the image of a mill with an especially good description, only to tear it down by the end of the paragraph by \\"the hookwormridden heirs at large\\" who dismantle the mill and carry it away for firewood; an image that does more to illustrate the transitory nature of the mill industry than a whole novel about the topic would.<br />It is certainly fair to say that the Lena Grove and Rev. Hightower elements of the novel are perhaps not satisfactorily integrated into it. And it is certainly fair to say that the Rev. Hightower portions are as unforgiveably abstruse as that notorious section of \\"The Bear\\".  Even so, these are defects of a genius, and as such are still considerably more interesting than 99% of most of what's written.  It also serves as a way to be introduced to Faulkner's demanding prose without also having the extra task of trying to decipher the plot or meaning of his two most famous novels.<br />The title supposedly refers to the quality of light in August, though it has also been suggested that Lena will be light in August after the birth of her child.initely the Rev.

It tells the story of four very different characters:<br />Lena Grove, a young pregnant woman, searching for the deadbeat father of her child; Byron Bunch, the man she meets in her search who falls in love with her; Rev. Hightower, Bunch's friend, an ostracized cleric; and Joe Christmas, a man of dubious racial origin.<br />Faulkner tells each story with the ease of a great storyteller.  He moves the story back and forth in time, although the actual time elapsed from the beginning to the end of the novel is a few short days.  Each of the stories intersects the others and a complete world is woven from their details.<br />Lena is looking for her \\"fianc&eacute;e\\", a man named \\"Brown\\" who left her as soon as he heard the \\"happy news.\\"  She is capable of enormous perseverance and is determined to make a family for herself and her child.  Against all odds, she seems destined to succeed.<br />Byron is biding time, waiting for his life to begin. His love of Lena gives him his purpose in life, and starts him on the journey to becoming a man.<br />Rev. Hightower is biding his time, also, waiting for his life to end.  It ended many years before when he lacked the courage to help or deal with a wife who went insane.  He finds his salvation at the novels end when he finds the courage to try to help someone, even though he fails.<br />And Joe Christmas - a man who pretends to be have black blood in him, and lives in both the white and black worlds.  Most reviewers mistakenly believe that he is half-black.  In fact, his father is described as a foreigner, and may or may not be black.  It doesn't matter because Joe has come to believe that he is part black.  The perception has more reality than the truth.<br />The novel streaks through the central events of the book - including sexual depravity and a  gruesome murder.  There are dozens of minor characters who have more life to them than in a dozen novels of a Grishom or King.<br />This book should be read and re-read - just for the fun of it.  It's a great book because it is a page-turner, a romance, a character study, a ... well, a great read!	2002-03-03

It thrives on restlessness, desperation, confusion:  One man, named Joe Christmas, has spent his whole life trying to escape his identity; another, named Lucas Burch, is trying to escape responsibility.  It all culminates in what turns out to be one unforgettable August in Jefferson, Mississippi.<br />Lucas has gotten his girlfriend Lena Grove pregnant back in Alabama; he moves to Jefferson and gets a job at a planing mill, intending never to see her again.  However, Lena manages to track him to Jefferson and arrives in town just in time to see the rising smoke from a burning house.<br />The house belongs to Miss Burden, a charitable spinster who had let Joe Christmas live in a cabin on her land.  Christmas used to work with Lucas at the mill, but the two of them went into bootlegging and roomed together in the cabin.  When it is discovered that Miss Burden was murdered before the fire broke out, Lucas accuses Christmas of the crime, hoping to collect a generous reward offered by Miss Burden's nephew.<br />Most of the novel is concerned with the events in Christmas's life that brought him to this predicament.  Christmas, the offspring of an interracial relationship, has known nothing but rejection and ostracism since his birth.  He was raised in an orphanage before being adopted by a strict religious couple; as a young adult he became a vagrant, drifting from town to town doing menial jobs, getting into trouble, always with a sullen chip on his shoulder, nursing enmity for the whites who consider him a \\"negro\\" when he reveals his ancestry.<br />Too dense to understand that Lucas doesn't want any part of her or the baby, Lena is willing to follow or search for him anywhere, accepting any help she can get from strangers.  One of these strangers is another mill worker named Byron Bunch who falls in love with her.  Byron has a friend named Reverend Hightower, a former Presbyterian minister who was evicted from his church because of suspected insanity.  Byron wants to help Lena and consults Hightower about the right course of action, but his solicitousness is misdirected; he's like Faulkner's Mississippi manifestation of Don Quixote.  Hightower, in turn, tries to be Byron's moral compass, but his own needle has gone haywire in its frantic search for magnetic North.<br />\\"Light in August\\" features a more straightforward narration as opposed to the experimental prose styles that characterized \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" and \\"As I Lay Dying.\\"  However, there are still some colorful narrative techniques, such as information delivered through monologues by minor characters outside of the main plot.  The characters are so lively and the story is so absorbing that the obvious statement about bigotry -- how white people attribute the crimes of Christmas, who is outwardly a white man, to his \\"negro blood\\" -- seems almost standard issue.  But the history of the old South provides so many facts with which Faulkner can support his point that he doesn't have to exaggerate the irony.	2002-02-26

The American novel, or more precisely the Southern Novel, differs in some important ways from its parent the European novel. The American novel is often daunting to those who have had little experience with serious literature. The Southern novel has a tendency to work the Aristotelian diagram to its most complex, while still playing by its rules. There is conflict and rising action, there is a moment of recognition, and there is a conclusion. But the dark world of the American Southern writer is often more complex and metaphoric than the world of earlier novelists like Cervantes or Flaubert. Their is a grief of and for the human condition embodied in the Southern novel that is more rich and painstakingly portrayed than in any other genre of fiction.<br />Faulkner is no exception. His novels are dark and verbose, embedded with a sense of doom. Though a few of the trials around which Faulkner arranges his novels may seem trivial to the modern reader it is the metphoric content of these trials that makes them more poigniant and infernal than any fiction being written today.<br />While 'A Light In August' is not without this sort of depth, it is not so heavily clouded with a complex format, or philosophical prose. A Light In August is principally about four characters. Faulkner weaves these characters past and through one another to sketch a world governed by fortune and the will  of man.	2002-02-04

While this may be true in some aspects, there are a few books that are somewhat easier to read while keeping intact all that is William Faulkner. Light in August is one of those novels.<br />Light in August is a long read, over five hundred pages, but it is worthwhile. Faulkner ties together a group of unforgettable characters into a story that shows the range of human emotions. Lena Grove, a pregnant girl from Alabama, who has come to Jefferson looking for her soon to be husband. Byron Bunch, a hard working man at a planing mill, who ends up falling for Lena. Gail Hightower, a former minister, who seems to have forsaken religion to sit in the study of his house, gazing from the window. And Joe Christmas, a man who is caught between two races (black and white), and struggles to find his identity.<br />A large portion of the novel centers on Joe Christmas and while reading the story I ran through a range of emotions regarding him. He can be both kind and sinister. I liked Bunch most of all. He is a simple man, shallow on the exterior but deep in understanding and compassion, who is just trying to do the right thing. Aren't most of us?<br />So what befalls these characters? How does their story end? It's rather easy to find out. Give Light in August a try and you'll be swept away into one of those stories that William Faulkner seems to do best....Enjoy.	2001-06-12

The novel depicts Christmas's struggle for acceptance not only from the 1920's southern United States, but also from himself.  Faulkner's use of picturesque diction and his accurate use of both white and black dialect in Alabama heighten his dramatization of Christmas's strife.<br />Faulkner brilliantly presents four of the novel's main characters and their relationship to the community and human beings within the first four chapters.  Oddly enough, all four of the characters are isolated from society in one way or another.  Society isolates Lena Grove due to her illegitimate child; however, Grove also isolates herself because of her constant travel in search of the child's father.  Reverend Gail Hightower is isolated from Jefferson, the small Alabama town in which most of the novel takes place, because of his wife's adulterous affairs.  Byron Bunch, whose only friend is Hightower, isolates himself by choice in order to keep himself out of mischief.  Finally, Joe Christmas isolates himself from the rest of the workers in the planing mill because of his mixed racial heritage.  Christmas haughtily wears his city clothes in the midst of the other workers' overalls, and is therefore an easy target for ridicule and resentment.  Throughout the novel, Faulkner utilizes the simple, irrational, and slightly ignorant white members of the community to contrast the respectability and hardship of the local blacks.  Characters such as Joanna Burden, whose last name is synonymous to Rudyard Kipling's \\"white man's burden\\", represent the consequences of white society mixing with black.  Faulkner uses biblical allusions throughout Light in August, which mostly surround Joe Christmas.  Christmas's name symbolizes that of Jesus of Nazareth.  He was born three days before the holiday of Christmas, and on Christmas Eve was found in a basket on the doorsteps of an orphanage.  Christmas's adoptive father was a strict, white Presbyterian farmer named McEachern who often abused Christmas.  Unbeknownst to McEachern, his wife secretly fed Christmas when her husband restricted him from eating and often gave him money.  On one particular occasion after Mr. McEachern had beaten Christmas, Mrs. McEachern went up to Christmas's room and took off his shoes to wash his feet, just as Mary Magdalene did to Jesus when asking for forgiveness of her sins.  After the murder of Joanna Burden, Joe Brown, Christmas's supposed friend and accomplice in their business of illegally selling whiskey, turns Christmas in for the murder in hopes of receiving the money reward for the murderer's capture.  Here, Brown serves as a figure similar to Judas Iscariot, the disciple of Christ who eventually turned Him over to the Pharisees for a price of forty pieces of silver.  Also, Reverend Hightower serves as a godly figure throughout the novel, keeping a moral balance over the other characters (especially Byron Bunch).  Hightower even turns his back on Christmas when the police find Christmas in his home and is caught, just as God turned his back when Jesus was crucified.  Written within only seven years of each other, Light in August can easily be compared with John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.  Both novels depict the failure of the American Dream.  Steinbeck utilizes the failure of the American Dream in his story of the Joads, a poor farm family from Oklahoma who travel to California in hopes of finding prosperity to escape the Dust Bowl.  The Joads's dream ends in lost hope, however, when they find that California was a deception.  Faulkner presents the failure of the dream to another underprivileged group in 1920's America - the African Americans.  Even though Christmas is only half-black, Faulkner uses him to represent the negligence of justice presented to blacks in the southern U.S.  Also, both authors display a slight similarity in writing style.  Both authors appear to be excessive in words and have \\"middle\\" chapters in which they use for flashbacks and character and theme development.  Although Light in August has over 500 pages, Faulkner employs each word and chapter.  With his use of diction and the radical allusion of his main character Joe Christmas to Jesus Christ, Faulkner effectively introduces the themes of Light in August, which include the racial injustice among the South's black population, the conflict between the individual and the community, and the hardships of finding self-identity.  Also, Faulkner captures the reader's attention with his characters in Light in August by giving shockingly realistic cases of religious fanaticism, racial hatred, and brutal violence in an attempt to accurately depict the moral and social psychology of human beings.	2001-05-03

His first published work was a collection of verse entitled The Marble Faun.  His failure as a poet outright may help explain why his prose is so turgid, convoluted but also profound and insightful beyond MERE prose.  It's as if he's trying to correct his initial failure as intensely as posible.  In the process of doing so, he became one of the gratest novelists in 20th Century American Literature. (Second only to Thomas Wolfe in my opinion.)-I guess the reason I like this book less than the aforementioned Faulkner works is the same reason most of the other reviewers like it more: It doesn't have enough of that turgid, mystical omniscient kaleidoscopic introspective prose that make the other novels so brilliant; But also, I admit, harder to plough through for a beginner.-Here's an example of what I'm talking about: Joe Christmas is observing his mistress in the daylight, &quot;Meanwhile he could see her from a distance now and then in the daytime, about the rear premises, where moved articulate beneath the clean, austere garments that she wore that rotten richness ready to flow into putrefaction at a touch,like something growing in a swamp, not once looking toward the cabin or toward him. And when he thought of that other personality that seemed to exist somewhere in the darkness itself, it seemed to him that what he saw now by daylight was a phantom of someone whom the night sister had murdered and which now moved purposeless about the scenes of old peace, robbed even of the power of lamenting.&quot;-It's this eerie poetic perspctive that make Faulkner not just any writer, but a great one. It captures how fleeting identity and, indeed, life is. His language can make the characters vacillate between flesh-and-blood and psychopathic visions at the stroke of a pen.  If you're new to Faulkner, read As I Lay Dying next and his perturbing magic will continue to grow on you.  Perhaps, &quot;like something growing in a swamp.&quot;-rare, foreboding, and to be approached circuitously, lest you slip into murky depths!at the stroke of a pen.

It reads wonderfully, in contrast to some other modern writers such as Joyce and his friends, but has an amazing complexity.  The characters are entirely unique and fascinating in there own right--both the central characters (Joe Christmas!) and the more peripheral characters.

This novel, in my opinion, surpasses his ( and  critics's ) favorite &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, and, together with  &quot;Absalom&quot; and &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot;, is the center of  faulknerian cosmos; cosmos, I'd say contrary to a famed critic Weinstein,  no one not owns, but no one *knows*.  While whole other novels could be  written on Hightower, Lena or Joanna, Christmas indisputably remains the  center of the novel;  he is the cause of all action &amp; tragedy, the  center without which the novel would dissolve.<br />I'd say that Faulkner's  main intention was to convey convulsions and victimization in the fierce  struggle for self-identity. That's why he deliberately left unresolved the  central ambiguity of the novel- Christmas' inability to overcome his  maniacal racial obsession and his pushing self-confrontation to a deadly  conclusion are signs that something was wrong with him, but also with the  society which warped and infected him with self hatred. There is no  substantial reason, apart from psychological, to believe that his racial  status is based on anything more than socially induced projections. On the  other hand- some nagging mystique hovers over him; though  we frequently  get the entrance into his consciousness, the whole  matter with him remains  grotesque and hyperbolical: his childhood  history can be easily accepted  and explained in Freudian terms;  but his relentless,  &quot;unflagging&quot; solipsism frets his whole life-  one would expect  either an ordinary vagabond-criminal career  like Popeye or soul-searching  struggle to solve the riddle of  his ancestry or to dismiss the whole issue  as irrelevant.  The mystery is that he is too rich a character to be  reduced  to ordinary &quot;sins&quot; (fornication &amp; bootlegging)-there  is always  a presence of some &quot;greater&quot; life he is a part of.  I  consider that the central Faulkner's intention with his main character was  to put not only white racism, but what we could call extreme white racial  con sciousness to the front plane. Another theme is Joe's alienation, his  not knowing who he is and what to do with his life ( there is a resembla  nce with Camus's Mersault in &quot;Stranger&quot;). Faulkner's main hero  cannot escape circumstances, cannot find liberation in universal human  values, cannot get rid of his obsession with racial identity. That's what  Andre Gide meant when he said that Faulkner's heroes had no soul. Oh- they  have. But theirs is a soul  where passive, receptive consciousness suffers  &quot;invasion&quot; and, ultimately, corrosion from  the hypnotically  powerful &quot;outer&quot; world; Faulkner's novels are transcripts of the  flood of impressions drowning  psyche of his heroes ( or hero-villains )  unable to resist the magnetic force of a stupefactive external nexus of  events. Time and Fatality crush them all.<br />  What I consider the most  shattering theme in the novel ( apart from the incredibly forceful passage  on Christmas's last passion... reminiscent on Dionysus...)  is Joe &amp; Joanna &quot;love story&quot;. On a more  human level, what happens here is the most exalted and passionate love  story in entire Faulkner's work. Of course, it lacks tenderness and  fruitful perspective of life. It is overloaded with meandering  perversities. But, in portrayal of a woman who desperately tries to make up  for things life had not let her have, Faulkner achieved profound, and in  his work unsurpassed, pathos and compassion..	2000-09-01

Like other Faulkner (The Sound and the Fury comes to  mind), the reader needs a degree of patience since with continued reading,  his qestions will eventually be answered. In this lays the only flaw of the  book - a synopsis is given where the reader knows what happens, leading  Faulkner to flash back to the details almost immedaitely following. Among  the themes one may be able to read into is the representation of man by Joe  Christmas. The fact that he MAY have black blood and his death at Christ's  age of death may question whether Faulkner saw him as a Christ- like figure  and what would happen if Christ had arrived in the South in the early 20th  century (after all there is some question whether Christ was actually dark  skinned, which would be read as  having black blood in 1930  Mississippi).<br />At times a bit long winded, nevertheless a interesting  read.	2000-04-30

Light in August is a very excellently  crafted work, and I liked it because of my bias against those  overly-religious, self-righteous individuals who experience the character  flaws of all of us, all the while attempting to cover them up.  Gail  Hightower should be given much attention when you are reading this book.  Faulkner's ability to create setting and mood is exceptional, and this is  important in the development of theme and the development of Christmas, the  story's main character.  If you get through this book with no trouble, I  suggest you try reading Absalom, Absalom!  Most reviewers comment that it  is &quot;unreadable,&quot; but I have not found that so, for Faulkner  writes with such a unique and moving prose style that I am compelled by his  stream-of-consciousness and peculiar mechanics.

It's the place to start on Faulkner.	1996-06-26

The book did jump around a lot in time and place. The story was disturbing, especially in its depiction of the seldom-challenged racism and violence of the Jim Crow South (the book takes place in the 1920's, with some of the older characters having childhood memories of the Civil War). Sometimes the historical truth hurts. There were several fascinating characters that keep you wanting to read more.<br />It should be noted that I read a bargain-basement Kindle edition that had numerous typos, although none of them made the book harder to understand; they were just mildly annoying.  I would assume that the full-priced edition is much cleaner.	2014-08-22

The main characters in this book live on the margins of white Southern society, excluded in one way or another by petty and perverse judgements of powerful individuals or groups arising from obsessions about \\"otherness\\" be it race, poverty, religion or plain misfortune.  For each perceived \\"crime\\" of this kind, there is punishment, most of it brutal.  The various victims react in different ways -  among the men, Joe Christmas is totally brutalised by a series of experiences and tormentors, Gael Hightower isolates himself from all human contact and Bryon Bunch cares too much and is in turn hurt even more.  Among the women we are given even less to draw hope from - mothers and lovers who include the weak and pitiful and others just making the best of a bad hand dealt them by fate. William Faulkner leaves us to make whatever sense we can of the stories he tells, casting no judgement of his own and offering little by way of resolution to each of the personal tragedies he recounts.  For all that, it remains a powerful and moving read.	2014-02-20
