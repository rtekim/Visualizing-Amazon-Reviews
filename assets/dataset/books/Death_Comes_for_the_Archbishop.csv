Anyone familiar with the land will be warmed by the imagery discovered by thoughtful men of faith.  This book is not a &#34;page turner&#34; in that there is a strong plot line.  Rather, it is like a biography with multiple vignettes, woven together to form a story.  The death of the archbishop is not tragic but a natural progression of his life.  Throughout the book, the author creates contrasts.  Initially the contrasts are between the older European civilization and the new raw territory of New Mexico.  As the story progresses, the territory of the New World is seen as the old and established land only to be transformed to newness by immigrant Europeans.

Willa Cather is a writer that not only creates a vision but catches the soul of the people, period, and settings she writes about.  Death Comes for the Archbishop is a book for readers and writers.  It is especially meaningful if you have ever visited New Mexico and Santa Fe and treasured its rich history.  The simple elegance of the author's style is what has made this book a classic.",2009-08-11

I first read Nichol's book  and loved it, but procrastination set in and it has taken me almost twenty  years to get to Death Comes for the Archbishop.  After finishing the novel,  I am uncertain as to whether its merits are in line with its  reputation.<br />The novel is based (some would say loosely) on the life of  Archbishop Lamy and his efforts to increase the authority of the Roman  Catholic Church in New Mexico after the Territory was ceded to the United  States.  As such, Cather paints the picture of a missionary church on the  American frontier making in-roads into the native Mexican and Indian  populations while increasing the reputation of the new Diocese in Santa Fe.  The story telling is straightforward, written in unabashedly simple  language with hagiographic tinges.  Unfortunately, the characters of the  novel are never developed (with the possible exception of Father Vaillant)  and remain as either stolid churchmen or stereotyped parishioners.  Indeed,  the main character of the novel, Bishop Latour, is more similar to the  statue of Lamy in front of the Santa Fe Cathedral than to any flesh and  blood model.<br />There are passages of profound beauty in the novel,  especially when the author is expressing her own feelings about the special  and un-definable qualities found in New Mexico.  In these instances, the  reader gets a vivid picture of the wide spaces, mountains and light that  have captivated visitors and residents for centuries.  However, I found the  book to be episodic to a fault.  The action jumps about, chronology is all  but dismissed, and the novel never achieves a tightness which characterizes  the great works; instead of a great novel, I was reminded of the  &quot;picturesque&quot; novels so popular in 18th Century England.",2000-06-07

The language employed is the most clear and beautiful I have ever read in prose--it's closer to poetry. The philosophy Ms. Cather espouses is simple enough for the peasant to understand, and too complex for the wisest scholar.<br /><br />This book just baffles me: it's not a novel, per se, nor is it a biography--it's more like an etching of time and place; of ideas and people who travel through the arid, beautiful dreamscape of New Mexico.<br /><br />Ms. Cather wrote part of this novel in Santa Fe, New Mexico. She got the idea of the novel from seeing a statue of Archbishop Lamy in front of St. Francis Cathedral in Santa Fe, and meditating upon what his life must have been like from her balcony at La Fonda hotel that overlooked the Cathedral.<br /><br />Ms. Cather spent months in New Mexico and the Southwest, and truly loved this land, which is reflected in her book; she was a woman of faith, which is also reflected in this book, and although not a book about religion, religion nevertheless permeates it. More, this is a book about the beauty of a life lived well, with hard work and faith, and the land which touches all who touch it.",2000-04-30
