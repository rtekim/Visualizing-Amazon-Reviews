I have read Borges and Sorrentino and Nabakov and Derrida and have seen lots of play with footnotes. Two, and this is more difficult case to make, but David Foster Wallace was extremely sophisticated in his thinking, but he was fundamentally wrong about life. He was a guy at tragic odds with himself. In a way, he explored all the possible answers ... there is a mania to this novel as he looks again and again for answers, trying to figure out where it goes, where life leads. He hits on the right answers and then just keeps going and moves on. He can't resolve anything. And he's screaming for truth, but has trouble finding how that can be done. Harold Bloom said Wallace couldn't write and couldn't think.Sadly, I agree. The social point Wallace is trying to make can be found in Smells Like Teen Spirit and Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death. The commodity world is a well-known trope, though Wallace takes it a step further with the naming of years. His straight-out grabbing of other people's stories from AA -- well, you can hear those stories in AA. The drug stuff from Merck manuals. As I said, it's a homework assignment. Lots and lots of work went into it. Definitely, A-plus as a homework assignment. But as a novel, I believe it's fundamentally wrong-headed. The &#34;entertainment&#34; ending, oh, who cares? I will give it three stars for generating interest and discussion. You want real world -- you can find more gut-level truth in a single Jimmy Breslin column. Wallace was fundamentally a religious writer who was an agnostic/atheist, and could never reconcile the two. My two cents.",2015-08-29

Worse, its conceit and mise-en-scene, so to speak, is too Pynchonesque to feel original and its language, on the whole, is too stressed to feel comfortable or even look comfortable on the page.  It is not especially funny, its similes and metaphors do, occasionally, work quite well.  But, the book is boring to the point of distraction....real distraction.  Any distraction---just picking up loose fur off of my dogs was a richer experience than reading the book.  Had I not been able to do both simultaneously, I would never have gotten as far as I did.

The reason I am writing about Wallace is that I paid a visit to Wikipedia and found out that, although Infinite Jest received many enthusiastic reviews, it didn't seem to get the recognition it deserved, in my opinion, compared to things that have been said about the works of Pynchon.Worst of all, a certain Harold Bloom who believes he is the God of literature, having written nothing remarkable himself, totally condemns Infinit Jest and thinks Maison and Dixon as probably the book of the century(twentieth). I really can not but express irony to anyone who suggests that Infinite Jest is pretentious and at the same time Maison and Dixon a masterpiece.Pynchon never impressed me as great, as, despite the complex use of language, never really had much to say, except from trying to impress or maybe have fun(which is alright with me, up to a point).On the other hand, Wallace,like Kafka, used to write with his soul, or rather, one should better say, with his body, as it is obvious on every page of Infinite Jest, without needing to insert loans from eastern philosophies to prove he is extenting our touchable reality.Wallace, in many of his writings-finished or unfinished-but especially in Infinite Jest,as a whole, defines Writing-together with Kafka-as a certain act, self-contained, that aims at redistributing one's self(the writer's, the reader's)to the world through words.There are great story tellers, great writers and masters of language, but Writers, in my opinion, were only two(not even Shakespeare, not even Joyce):Kafka and Wallace.They represent the limits of writing as life itself, and in a way were both sacrifised in the name of literature and humanity.And yes I know what I 'm saying and I 'm not becoming delirious(altough Psychosis, one might say, and I say it as a psychiatrist, is also a limit to thinking, our universal limit that guarantees our sanity, albeit a conventional one;a limit to pleasure as well, as Lacan used to say that the psychotic enjoys infinitely, we don't).

I also read his collection of Essays: A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again (I bought these both at the same time) and it is poorly worded trite observations, unfit even for Rolling Stone articles, the type of juvenilia written by wired rimmed spectacle modelers with posters of Lord Byron on their walls.

He name drops authors read that fit all the college trends, when he should have spent some time reading contemporaries who've actually succeeded in this style of writing like Philip K. Dick, Kurt Vonnegut and Italo Calvino, people who explored his ideas years ago and exhaustively in what amounts to their footnotes...I was excited when I heard this author was being recreated by an actor I enjoyed, but I realize now that enjoyment of his novel lies with middle level readers just being excited they could finish it (ala Pynchon). How much did this author's teachers fail him by not giving him the appropriate criticisms when he needed them, in his youth.

I cannot say if it is the best book I have ever read, but it is certainly close.  The first time was in the late 90's, and I read it for its occasionally lyrical writing, its voices of drug addicts and a beautiful Joelle Van Dyne, the intricate plot of a wild story about corporate-sponsored naming of years in a badly-run dystopia of a polluted America, a halfway house and a tennis academy, Canadian terrorists, optics and holography and a macguffin of a videotape that nobody can look away from maybe as a metaphor of a permissive sex-addicted culture, and ultimately a mesmerizing tale of a ghost of a flawed father who has made everything possible.  That first time I understood that maybe I was missing something along the way, but I just wanted to finish it because it was too much fun.  The second time, I became a contributor to its wiki, and I read it to understand its complexities, the recurrence of its characters, what happened to make Hal the way he is at the beginning of the book, and how everything fit together.  I can see, in retrospect, the dark humor that might presage Wallace's suicide, with many obvious linguistic variations on ways to describe ending one's own life.  The sadness of the book is what makes it so addictive.  My other best books are Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow and Against the Day, John Barth's Giles Goat Boy and The Sot Weed Factor, Saul Bellow's The Adventures of Augie March, and anything by Henry Miller.<br /><br />It happened after that I became somewhat of an obsessive of David Foster Wallace.  Neal Stephenson, in his introduction to Everything and More, Wallace's ambitious attempt at a philosophical/mathematical description of the history of the concept of infinity, gives a good explanation of what Wallace's genius and voice actually was: a product of someone whose parent taught at a midwestern state college.  Here were people that were sometimes very smart, but that they unpretentious about it, so that they would try to explain complicated and advanced ideas in a simple vernacular.  And I believe it was in David Lipsky's book of his interviews with Wallace that David told how Infinite Jest was written.  Wallace was living in one room in Syracuse, New York, and he would have reference books lying all around the room that he used to help him write it.  In the morning, he said, he would pile the reference books on the bed, and in the evening he would put the reference books on the desk because basically there would be no room in the room otherwise.  So, you can understand how Infinite Jest was created with this kind of intense single-minded dedication to a purpose that brought it into focus, but was difficult for him to replicate.  Some of Wallace's subsequent writing is good -- I've read the Pale King and many of his short stories -- but Infinite Jest is just light years better than anything else.",2015-01-18

The paintings of Caspar David Friedrich, the symphonies of Schumann, and the works of Schelling are the magna opera of German romanticism. Joyce's ULYSSES is the magnum opus of European modernism. The poems of Trakl, the paintings of Kirchner, and the dramas of Wedekind are the magna opera of German expressionism. The films UN CHIEN ANDALOU, L'AGE D'OR, and VIVA LA MUERTE are the magna opera of surrealism.  INFINITE JEST (1996) by David Foster Wallace is the magnum opus of American hipsterism.  What is a &#34;hipster,&#34; you ask? A hipster is one who has what Hegel described as an &#34;unhappy consciousness&#34;: He is a self that is at variance with itself.  * * * * *  Anyone who has spent any time in academia will instantly recognize Wallace's pedigree upon opening this book. Wallace was an academic writer. Unhappily, all connotations of &#34;academic&#34; are intentional. That is to say, the book is both fantastically banal and seems to have been composed, disconsolately and mechanistically, in a registrar's office. It is not arbitrary that the narrative begins in the Department of Admissions of a tennis college. The language here recalls the world of registration and withdrawal forms and the world of classrooms where works such as this are spawned, dissected, and pickled -- the world of the academic industry.  Wallace: &#34;Matriculations, gender quotas, recruiting, financial aid, room-assignments, mealtimes, rankings, class v. drill schedules, prorector-hiring... It's all the sort of thing that's uninteresting unless you're the one responsible...&#34; [451].  I wonder if anyone besides Wallace has ever found these things interesting.  Since no one else has taken the trouble to encapsulate the narrative, permit me to attempt to do so here. The novel seems to have two diegetic threads and a meta-narrative. The first thread concerns the incandescent descent of Hal Incandenza, teenager and tennis student, into drug addiction. (Well, no, it isn't quite incandescent, not quite luciferous, at all, but I liked the way that sounded.) The second outlines the shaky recovery of Don Gately, criminal, from Demerol. The &#34;woof,&#34; I imagine, details the efforts of a cabal of Quebecois terrorists to inject a death-inducing motion picture of the same title as this book into the American bloodstream. All of this takes place in a soupy, fuzzy future in which Mexico and Canada have been relegated to satellites of the onanistic &#34;Organization of North American Nations.&#34; Predictably, and much like NAFTA, America is at the epicenter of this reconfiguration.  It is hard to care about any of this. If Wallace had written fluidly, things would have been otherwise. It is not that the book is complex, nor that its prose is burnished (if only it were!). The problem is much different: The sentences are so awkwardly articulated and turgid that the language is nearly unreadable. You wish that someone would fluidify the congested prose while struggling with the irritation and boredom that weave their way through you.  There is literary litter everywhere. No, &#34;nauseous&#34; does not mean &#34;nauseated.&#34; No, &#34;presently&#34; does not mean &#34;at present.&#34; Such faults are mere peccadilloes, however, especially when one considers the clunkiness of Wallace's language. A few examples:  1.) &#34;The unAmerican guys chase Lenz and then stop across the car facing him for a second and then get furious again and chase him&#34; [610]. I am having a hard time visualizing this scene.  2.) &#34;Avril Incandenza is the sort of tall beautiful woman who wasn't ever quite world-class, shiny-magazine beautiful, but who early on hit a certain pretty high point on the beauty scale and has stayed right at that point as she ages and lots of other beautiful women age too and get less beautiful&#34; [766]. It would take more effort to edit this see-Spot-run sentence than it did, I suspect, to write it.  3.) &#34;The puppet-film is reminiscent enough of the late Himself that just about the only more depressing thing to play attention to or think about would be advertising and the repercussions of O.N.A.N.ite Reconfiguration for the U.S. advertising industry&#34; [411]. This is a particularly representative example of Wallace's heavy, cluttered style -- a sentence larded with substantives.  4.) &#34;So after the incident with the flaming cat from hell and before Halloween Lenz had moved on and up to the Browning X444 Serrated he even had a shoulder-holster for, from his previous life Out There&#34; [545]. So... Lenz moves &#34;on and up&#34; to a knife... &#34;from&#34; his previous life? If this is a sentence, it is the ugliest I've yet read.  To say such a thing would be to say too little. Nearly every sentence is overpoweringly ugly and repellently clumsy. Not a single sentence--not one--is beautiful, defamiliarizing, or engaging. I am sorry to write this, but INFINITE JEST is a joylessly, zestlessly, toxically written book and the poisonous fruit of academic bureaucracy.  * * * * *  A few valedictory words: It would be tasteless--raffish, even--to malign the literary estate of a recent suicide. Wallace was nothing if not intelligent, and his death is a real loss. Had he lived longer, he might have left us books that impress and delight. Let me advise the reader to avoid this plasticized piece of academic flotsam and pick up and at instead BRIEF INTERVIEWS WITH HIDEOUS MEN, his true gift to the afterlife and the afterdeath.

There were some obvious criticisms of modern society that you will find throughout his writings as well as those who influenced him like DeLillo.  However, Wallace offers no solutions to anything himself.  Frankly, he offers very little hope for a meaningful life.  It is a novel full of totally lost people.  They begin lost, they remain lost.<br /><br />The largest theme in the book is a disdain for entertainment.  Ironically, however, it turns out that that is all that Wallace offers with this book.  Entertaining stories, entertaining writing, nothing meaningful.<br /><br />While the book has some interesting characters and bits of fantastic prose, I can say firmly that I don't think it was worth the time it took to read it (which is undoubtedly a great deal of time, deciding to read this book is a large time commitment).  If you want to read a book of similar length that actually does have a lot to say, a lot of great insight you may find useful in life, read War and Peace by Tolstoy.  DeLillo's Underworld, published around the same time as this, is similar to Infinite Jest in more ways than just length, and also better.<br /><br />My feeling is that this book rode high on a lot of fake early praise (you can see interviews where Wallace himself speak of his disappointment when seeing many positive reviews come out very shortly after the book was given to reviewers, in a time far too short for them to have actually read the book).

The Incandenza family is immaculate on the surface.  They are all exceptional talents.

My first attempt brought me to about page 700, I than took some time off from the book, for reasons that had nothing to do with not be completely absorbed in the text, and than came back to it a month later.  After a month away from the book I decided that I hadn't retained enough information (there is a lot, after all), and I decided to start over again.  This was the right decision.    What I want to try to accomplish with this review is not to try to convince anyone to read it, because if you're reading this, you already are interested in reading it, rather, I want to relay assurance to those who may have been, or are being put off of the book by other reviewers who say that the book is too \\""difficult\\"", or too \\""long\\"", or there are too many footnotes, or it's a huge mess.  The book is long, but I assure you that it is not long enough, the book is difficult, but not difficult in the sense of being hard to read, it's difficult in the sense of narrative content, if this book speaks to you, it speaks to you because you have felt these feelings, you have thought these thoughts, you know these people, you have been in AA, you feel alienated by society, you feel that you were the only one who thought this way.  There are a lot of footnotes, and all of them are essential to the story, and completely absorbing to read.  The book is messy, because life is messy, and this book takes on a life of its own.    Why do we read?  I can tell you why I read.  I read because of the special relationship between myself and the characters who inhabit the worlds, in a sense I become these characters.  I read because of the intimate relationship between myself and the author that can only be achieved through the medium of great literature. I don't think that David Foster Wallace was the greatest writer of all time (maybe of his generation, maybe of being able to encompass an entire generational feeling, period, etc.), I still give that nod to Thomas Mann in the sense of writing novels.  Infinite Jest is not a novel, it is a book.    And so but what DFW is is the greatest observer who ever lived, and he had a special talent of conveying those observations and feelings in a way that nobody ever has, or ever will again.  Please do not let negative reviews turn you off from this book.  You have to work hard at it, but doesn't everything good require hard work?  I mean seriously, think about how simplistic and easy it is to just give up, or not even begin because something looks daunting.  This book will make you a better thinker, a smarter person, a more heartfelt person, and ultimately a better person.  It won't speak to everyone, that is impossible, but if it speaks to you, it will speak to you loudly.    If you read it once, you will have to read it again, it's that special.  One of a kind, never to be duplicated, and like Eggers says in the forward to the book, it will be here, studied and dissected long after we are gone, so give it a shot, it's not as difficult as you may think, and it's actually the most fun you will ever have reading.  Thanks for listening, I hope this helps.",2014-08-12

There are the traditional forms of addiction--drugs and alcohol--but also addiction to winning tennis matches, addiction to old sitcoms, addiction to the taste of others' sweat, or addiction to a particular video that renders its viewers so mesmerized, they eventually die in front of the screen.<br /><br />Despite their addictions, the characters muddle through life.  The book takes place sometime in the future, in a United States that holds a tenuous peace with Canada, although the dual spies who meet to compare notes show that there may be more conflict between the countries than the citizens might think.<br /><br />Hal is a student at an elite tennis academy founded by his late father.  He is an intellectual genius as well as a near-genius on the court, but he struggles with his own addiction.  His oldest brother gave up tennis for professional football and is addicted to relationships with young mothers.  Hal's middle brother is severely disabled, requiring special equipment to walk and even to stand still in one spot.  He is addicted to continuing their father's filmmaking legacy.  The entire family is hugely dysfunctional, both in the present as well as in flashbacks to the time when their father was still alive.<br /><br />Don Gately is a recovering drug addict working at a halfway house next door to the tennis academy.  He clings to sobriety with every fiber of his being as he tries to guide the new residents down the right path to reclaim their own lives.<br /><br />Through vivid and detailed stream of consciousness passages, these characters and many more live their almost-overlapping lives and try to puzzle through what everything might mean and how to survive one day at a time.<br /><br />I loved the various plotlines this book followed.  Hal's life at the tennis academy is intriguing and somewhat surrealistic, as are his relationships with his family members.  The AA passages are gritty and sometimes difficult to read, but fascinating in their depth and insight.  Ferocious Francis, the AA crocodile, is my favorite minor character in this book.<br /><br />I would have loved a more concrete ending than this book offered, though.  Although it was possible for me to figure out what probably happened, I would have preferred to have it wrapped up by the guy in whose mind the story bloomed, to see what his vision for the characters was.",2014-07-24

The book, they say, just stops, as if Wallace--after 978 pages of narrative plus 96 pages of often hilarious and must-read footnotes--simply ran out of gas. Well, my reaction is yes and no; yes, there are no concluding chapters in which Wallace provides explicit outcomes for the main lines of his narrative; but, no, the endings for his three primary narrative lines are reasonably clear, albeit implicit. IMHO, this just shows Wallace's complete mastery of his material--that is, he doesn't have to spell everything out to have his ending.<br /><br />INFINITE JEST is about addictive behavior--mostly drug addiction. In examining this subject, Wallace follows the experience of Hal Incandenza, a teenage pothead, genius, and junior tennis player with a not-bad national ranking; and Don Gately, a drug addict (Demerol is his choice) who has a responsible job in a recovery program. Connecting Hal and Don is a Quebecois terrorist group that has copies, but not the master cartridge, of the film \\""Infinite Jest.\\"" Somehow those viewing this cartridge reach an ecstatic state, not dissimilar from the perfect high of an addict, and, thereafter, never leave their barcaloungers. These terrorists imagine America mass-mailed with IJ cartridges and incapacitated by its drive for addictive pleasure.<br /><br />So, what denouements are implicit to these three narrative lines? Without saying too much, I point out that most of the narrative in IJ, including a climactic terrorist act, occurs in the year of the Depend Adult Undergarment. (In IJ, the years are subsidized by corporations or their products.) But the first chapter of IJ occurs in the Year of the Glad, which is the year following the planned terrorist operation. Chapter One, in other words, is media res and it shows the sympathetic Hal as a survivor with intensified problems.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the fate of Don Gately implicitly resolves in the office of Pat Montesian, the executive director of the recovery center where he works, as she meets with an angry and troubled Assistant DA. At the time of this conversation, the severely injured Gately is hospitalized and unable to speak because of intubation. But he worries about an overhang of serious legal problems and the possibility that a careless doctor might give him a painkiller, thereby spiraling him back into addiction.  After 900 pages of IJ, a reader will know that a relapse is always a possibility for an addict and, therefore, Gately.  But the legal problems? Well... in recovery, people are urged to forgive and forget...<br /><br />Finally, Wallace manages his Quebecois terrorists skillfully. Here, I don't think I'm revealing too much by saying that, in their last appearance, the terrorists are insane, vicious, and relentless. This scene evokes [[ASIN:0451524934 1984 (Signet Classics)]] and Winston Smith, which suggests Wallace probably thinks dark ideologies will always have a hold on society.<br /><br />When I began IJ, my thought was: How will I ever keep track of developments in such a big book? My strategy was to write Amazon.com reviews after completing 300 and then 500 pages of this novel.  These, I attributed to my [[ASIN:B000YKRGYO Paper Mate Sharpwriter 0.7mm Mechanical Pencils, 5 Yellow Pencils(3037631)]] and [[ASIN:B002S6CF0M ORE International 3030BK 190W Halogen Torchiere, Black]]. But guess what? The reviews weren't really necessary since IJ exhibits the entertaining narrative skills of the best big fat Victorian novels. This novel has walls of words. But it never reads long and Wallace--maybe a genius but not an egotist--is mindful and considerate of his readers.<br /><br />Highly recommended and enjoy./><br />Meanwhile, the fate of Don Gately implicitly resolves in the office of Pat Montesian, the executive director of the recovery center where he works, as she meets with an angry and troubled Assistant DA.

Simultaneously, though, I wonder if I'd ever choose to pick up this massive volume on my own. Just browsing through Goodreads briefly shows that a lot of people love and highly praise this book. I for one think it was far longer than was necessary to convey the themes and ideas that Wallace held.<br /><br />I just didn't enjoy the writing style. There would be endless pages of useless information, clumps with no breakage into paragraphs. That was tiresome to get through and I would never remember all of the information in there, whether it's important or not. And a lot of it was important and ended up going right over my head.<br /><br />I was particularly frustrated with the ending, mostly because I had to look it up to see what connections I was supposed to have made that didn't really happen for me. If I'd wanted to learn all of that I would have had to start re-reading the book, which I really don't have time to. This book is not only massive, most of the text is very dense and hard to get through. It takes hundreds of pages for you to make connections between the different scenes shown and for progress to happen. I didn't find the endnotes useful, either; half of the time they were just distracting and didn't provide much information alongside the text so I stopped using them.<br /><br />If you're up for a challenge I'd definitely say to go for this book, but you'll need to have plenty of time and patience on your side. This is going to take a while to get through and once you're finished you'll probably want to start reading it again-not for enjoyment, but because there are some hints at the ending that only show up in the beginning, when you aren't ready to process them.",2014-02-09

I thought for sure I would love this novel, I hold D.F.W. in high-esteem even though he committed suicide. I really tried reading this book with an open-mind, its length doesn't intimidate me since I'm at the moment reading 11 books simultaneously. In my opinion this book is just a very long suicide note. There's many references to nooses and hanging in the book. Is it only a coincidence that Wallace hung himself? I can relate to almost all the characters in this book, I know what Wallace was trying to achieve with Infinite Jest but I don't think he succeeded even though I really wanted him to. I feel this book could have been edited considerably, there's hundreds of pages of nonsense, bad grammar, at times annoying narratives, hundreds if not thousands of abbreviations which can get annoying since Wallace expects you to flip to the glossary every time you find a footnote, there are exactly 388 footnotes. If this isn't an Infinite Let Down then it is a monumental exercise in absolute patience. In some sense I feel like the novel is one big joke, like the joke is on us for reading it. I feel the remaining 715 pages will be no different from what I've already encountered in the first 300. Is it a brilliant novel? It's nowhere near brilliant, it could have been brilliant without the 300+ footnotes and the who knows how many pointless abbreviations. Is the novel really a literary representation of a Sierpinski gasket as Wallace himself claimed? It is no fractal, it's more like an obscenely splattered painting that is so obsessively structured it's absurd.",2013-10-05

Go Read It...It's Beautiful","\\""What's it about?\\"" Vague questions deserve vague answers. I like to answer this one (Infinite Jest being one of the longer novels ever written, and my having finished it), with my legs crossed, cigarette in hand, looking off into steely midday overcast-type clouds and say, \\""the human condition, man.\\""<br /><br />  But it is, really. Silence any anxiety-inducing hype you may have heard about it's impossibly long, the word choice is esoteric and overbearing, it's just terribly smart, etc... Hmm... it is lengthy, it might send you on some internet/dictionary searches (I have a steno book full of definitions of new words that I couldn't just let slide, a pretty good idea if you're like me and can't bear passing over unknown words), and yes it's clever. What this means is you have to read this book with your full attention. This isn't a Ray Carver short story that you can read hungover w/coffee and then put down with some vaguely satisfying furthered knowledge of what it means to be in love. You have to have your brain into it.<br /><br />  After adjusting yourself to David's style, Infinite Jest reveals itself to be a vividly lucid read. He writes so clearly and misses not one section in time of the mind of his characters. Everything is honest, and as Dave Eggers points out in the foreword to my edition, there is not one lazy sentence. Jest's clearness heightens the joy of reading how-did-you-think-of-that descriptions of e.g. young American boys' penchant for getting underneath tunnels and caves v. older American boys' penchant for getting on top of things to look out over large expanses of territory. It magnifies the tragedy of passages about child abuse. It sends you deep inside yourself when he's describing depression, or filial love, or loneliness, or what it means to be an addict.<br /><br />  It's maybe more accurate to ask what it isn't about. That's easier to answer; there's not much it doesn't cover. It has mesmerizing takes on philosophy (the inner monologuesof a neurotic tennis academy student who enjoys the secret of getting high as much as the high itself and ruminates very deeply about what it means to be), political philosophy (via a mountaintop discussion between a paraplegic wheelchair assassin and a cross-dressed U.S. Agent), sexuality, dependence, comfort, horror, drugs, corporate desire, etc... All of this in fascinating, clear clear clear prose. It's really ridiculous.<br /><br />  Get into it - it's easy to do. It is heart rending, and hilarious, and in ways that I have not experienced before. Reading it is a magnetizing experience, it's consuming, it's a pleasure and a challenge.

US,32614102,R34X7ZKDDWIFXR,0316066524,669738240,"Infinite Jest",Books,4,18,19,N,Y,"The Problem With Unbridled Brilliance","Wallace was a brilliant man. No contest. His vocabulary was prodigious, and his ability to write -- to describe people and things inside and out -- was truly gorgeous. If you are a fan of literature -- not so much for stories, plots, and characters, but for the basic pleasure of the language -- then you'll like this book. It is page after page after page of rich, sumptuous writing.<br /><br />If, however, you are the type to interest yourself in things like plots, you might need to reconsider. If the book is about anything, it is about a dangerous movie called INFINITE JEST, a film so entertaining that, when you watch it, you lose the will to do anything else, eventually dying from malnutrition and dehydration because you will refuse to move from the screen.<br /><br />If that kind of symbolism seems a little too on-the-nose for you, then you should avoid the book, because it's not the only time Wallace uses a heavy-hand with his point. The book follows all number of people who are killing themselves with \\""fun\\"" -- drug/alcohol addicts figure prominently in the story, as do the squeezed-dry students of a tennis academy. Depression, communication, choice, suicide, and self-awareness are all also major themes in the book, dealt with in sometimes excruciating detail, and belied by the bevy of rather silly plot elements Wallace occasionally throws into the book (a kid gets a computer monitor stuck on his head and it takes days for him to get it removed; North America is now a united organization known as O.N.A.N.; an addict is injured in a limbo contest and spends the novel scuttling like a crab, bent over backwards on his hands and knees). All of these (often eye-rolling) attempts at humor barely disguise the fact that, as the novel says, \\""What we're basically talking about here is loneliness.\\""<br /><br />He talks about it in a riveting, gorgeous, unflinching way, but it is taxing as well, and that's not just because the book is 1,100 pages long. James Incandenza (the name another of Wallace's too-weighty jokes) is the maker of the titular film, and the rest of his body of work is often described as being equally torturous, cerebral, too focused on technical elements and not focused enough on being entertaining. The parallels between James and Wallace himself are impossible to miss. There are a lot of ways that books can satisfy readers, but unless you choose to enjoy this novel solely for its virtuosity, the only other way to enjoy it is on a rather coldly clinical level. \\""I see what he did there,\\"" you might say knowingly, but it's not like seeing is the same as feeling. It's the difference between enjoying the mathematical formula for a fractal versus that fractal's spiraled, endless visual representation.<br /><br />Which is a shame, because the book is all about feelings. It spends so much time detailing the viscera of so many characters, but it ends up seeming almost like a flippant dismissal of them. For instance, the book has no ending. Wallace has stated in interviews that the book has an obvious destination -- that if readers really paid attention to the ways certain narratives were progressing they could see their converging endpoints and figure the ending out on their own -- but for a book that spends so much time describing every mote of dust and shaft of light, the huge gap left by the ending is very much like a slap to the reader. Or worse than a slap: a cold shoulder. Yes, intellectually, I can see how the ambiguity, the forced academic digestion is in fitting with the book's themes, but I also see how it is evidence of a writer who uses his brilliance to further distance himself from an audience (maybe world) that he ultimately turned away from for good.<br /><br />This is not to disparage Wallace's memory or condemn his suicide: the book is very much a treatise on both depression and self-immolation, and although it can very easily be read as a suicide note, it's not the balefully pitying kind. This is just to saythat -- as much as I loved and enjoyed the book for all of the ways it was amazing -- I also saw that, ultimately, this is what happens when someone is so brilliant that they refuse to allow any kind of limitation to make their light (their incandescence) accessible or to give it any kind of proper meaning or use. Books are meant to be bridges between authors and readers, and this book feels more like the Grand Canyon. Gorgeous. Stunning. Huge and almost unreal. But also, in the end, less of a bridge than a gap, and almost a condemnation of anyone who feels compelled to cross it alive.that -- as much as I loved and enjoyed the book for all of the ways it was amazing -- I also saw that, ultimately, this is what happens when someone is so brilliant that they refuse to allow any kind of limitation to make their light (their incandescence) accessible or to give it any kind of proper meaning or use.

I had been impressed by the phonebook-esque length, the tiny, crimped font, and enticing plot described on the back ever since I spotted it on a shelf at Hastings during my high school years. My copy had been purchased in 2006, the ten-year anniversary of the book's publication, and it had been marked down to $10 versus the typical $16 price tag; it had also been stamped as a special &#34;anniversary copy.&#34;<br /><br />Sadly, a few pages in, I just didn't get it and resigned, eventually giving away that particular edition to a local used bookstore. The narrative described a plethora of details that seemed unnecessary to the plot (what plot? har-har) and I stopped reading once I encountered a sentence that made zero sense to me: &#34;I would yield to the urge to bolt for the door ahead of them if I could know that bolting for the door is what the men in this room would see.&#34; Like, huh? What else would they see, Dave? I just couldn't bring myself to read another word. The book had already stopped playing by one of my cardinal rules, which was to always make sense to the reader, always.<br /><br />In a couple of years, things changed. Because of my college English lit classes, I was soon subjected to a barrage of mind-melting literature capable of completely changing the way I looked at fiction, especially the one-two punch of massive prose bricks Ulysses and Gravity's Rainbow, both of which had been paired with separate books written by scholars just devoted to explain the avalanche of random references and symbols. It soon became apparent to me that just because a book didn't always make sense or hit the usual narrative notes, it didn't always mean that it was an inferior work. Both Ulysses and GR equally frustrated and astounded me depending on which section I was reading, and they both eventually made their way onto my &#34;favorite books&#34; list due to their complexity and inimitable composition.<br /><br />And but so I went ahead and gave IJ another chance. For a college graduation gift, I had received my requested present of a 2nd-generation Kindle. I downloaded a free sample of IJ and found that it was the longest sample Amazon had (and still has) ever sent me - it hit close the 70-page mark in the physical book. I started reading and kept on reading until the end of the sample. Like a spaceship gravitating toward a gaping black hole, unable to turn itself away from the hole's crushing pull, I was compelled to outright buy the book and read the rest of it.<br /><br />I won't bother to waste my words here on the peculiar and sprawling plot, as it frequently defies description (and can be summarized in other reviews here). Same goes for the unconventional structure: most people know about the voluminous collection of footnotes, but there's far more intricacy to it than that. Instead, I will keep it brief and to the absolute essential of what you should know about this book: It is amazing. It really is. Ever since I read it, it still remains the best novel I've ever read. And a lot of people (including those who choose to read it as a part of &#34;Infinite Summer&#34;) feel or will feel the same way.<br /><br />A lot of times, when I read a book for a certain length of time, I start feeling the itch to just hurry up and finish it as soon as possible so I can get onto the next book. It must be an addiction to novelty and newness or something, but it happens with almost every book I read: a desire to read every last word so I can soon stand in front of my bookshelf, twiddling my fingers with glee whilst weighing the options of what I'll read next. With IJ, that never happened. During the three months that it took me to read it, I had the sensation of feeling like 1100 pages were just not enough. With characters and concepts this unique and compelling, I needed at least another 2200 pages, minimum.<br /><br />Oddly enough, even though this is my favorite book as yet, it is by no means perfect. As hinted at by the &#34;bolting for the door&#34; line above, DFW does not always make complete sense and sometimes leaves you scratching your noggin, wondering what he meant. Nor is every single passage golden and hallowed: some sections go on and on to your detriment and consternation (I'm thinking specifically between the long-winded, philosophical conversations in the desert shared between Marathe and Steeply, easily the worst and most boring sections of the book).<br /><br />In addition, the book ends on an apparently random and unsatisfying note, leaving a lot of unresolved plot points and likely serving up a cold helping of dissatisfaction upon the first read-through -- the opposite of the warm and fuzzy feeling avid readers have of closing a book and thinking, &#34;There was absolutely no better way that could have ended.&#34; (I'm planning on reading Chris Hager's lengthy and reference-laden undergrad thesis which defends and explains IJ's ending -- I just recently found it on DFW website &#34;The Howling Fantods,&#34; but I haven't got the time right now to plow through it and underline important points with a pen.)<br /><br />Despite these downsides, however, there is so much stuff that just works: the chilling, deadly methods of the Wheelchair Assassins; Poor Tony Krause's nightmarish drug detox in a public library bathroom; Joelle Van Dyne's attempted suicide in the bathroom of a party; the apocalyptic Eschaton match; a hilarious description of the rise and subsequent failure of video-phone technology; Gately's robbery and accidental murder of M. DuPlessis early on in the book; and so much more. Joelle, Orin, Mario, Pemulis, John &#34;No Relation&#34; Wayne, and especially my main man Gately are all ranked among my favorite fictional characters ever written.<br /><br />One thing I dislike about some post-modern authors is their apparent clinical detachment from their own characters; while everything is beautifully and eloquently written, I often get a sense of coldness, as though the writers do not feel very much for or through their own characters. In this, there is a heavy lack of what I think of as &#34;heart.&#34; (I sensed this frequently throughout Don Delillo's &#34;White Noise,&#34; whose characters seemed kind of flat and emotionless.)<br /><br />DFW, on the other hand, put so much heart in this particular work that it's sometimes too much to take. Whether it's addressing the pain of addiction, the heartbreak of losing a loved one, the horror of child abuse, or the pure inability to connect with others or experience happiness, it's clear that DFW surely channeled many of his own fears and insecurities through his fictional creations and put much of himself down on the page as a result.<br /><br />In contrast, there are also many parts of the book that are simply and uproariously hilarious. DFW boasted a very sharp and immediate sense of humor along his skills of prosaic manipulation. The edifice of Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House[sic], Don Gately's shrewd but uneducated observations & criminal upbringing, and the overall world of consumerism gone horrifically wrong as encouraged by the rampant rise of corporations are all fertile fields for the novel's more humorous sensibilities. There were many times that IJ brought on a spate of giggling in me so pronounced that I had to just put down the book and allow it to pass before I could continue.<br /><br />Now, be advised that this book is not for everyone. Lord, no. Just because I and others enjoyed it so greatly does not mean that everybody will feel the same way. It's a very challenging and demanding work, and it seems designed for a very particular audience. Anyone hoping for a nicely-defined plot or simple themes will find him-or-herself quickly thwarted. Others looking for some kind of a point to the apparently pointless ramblings of admittedly inconsequential details or conversations that pack hundreds of pages, a lot of them enjoyable but ultimately unimportant to any overarching theme, will also go bananas with vexation.<br /><br />IJ was never designed to nab a Pulitzer or a National Book Award, never designed to go down in the annals of literary greatness as one of those books that speak volumes to whoever reads it over the span of centuries. I think that it will connect most with collegiate types who grew up Gen-X and beyond, the ones who have, as children or young adults, especially experienced the constant bombardment of unconscious marketing by huge conglomerates, as well as the ubiquity of &#34;the entertainment&#34; whether through television and video cassettes or (later on) DVDs and the Internet. Anyone who has grown up in this age of easy access to non-stop stimulation will likely understand what DFW intended to lambaste with this particular book.<br /><br />Now down to brass tacks: I own both the Kindle copy and the regular paperback edition (obtained at a used book sale along with a copy of Michael Chabon's The Yiddish Policeman's Union for a $1, probably the best used book purchase I've ever made). Given the size of this beast, I would heartily recommend the Kindle format for a first-time reader if you've got the appropriate technology. The Kindle version makes flipping back and forth between the main text and the footnotes a breeze, and let's face it, do you really want to lug that huge book around? (Unless maybe you're trying to broadcast to other people what it is that you're reading so you can more easily strike up a conversation with someone who has parallel literary tastes to you, to which I say go right ahead and get the door-stopper, then.)<br /><br />We lost a genius and heartfelt mind in 2008 when Wallace committed suicide, but at the very least, he has left behind this amazing and one-of-a-kind labor of love that continues to inspire and confound the people who read it long after he left us. Not sure if you'll enjoy the book or not? Try downloading the free sample. As far as I know, it's just as long as it was when I first began this massive undertaking, and it'll give you a very good sense of what you're about to experience for the next couple of months. If you're not the intended audience, you can always put the book down. But if you are, you'll find that you too can't stop reading, and your life will likely be as irrevocably changed as mine was by this extraordinary book. Welcome to Infinite Jest.",2013-08-08

This is an astoundingly complex, lengthy tapestry of the interweaving lives of around 100 different characters across many years and great distance, yet even with all that the story is easy to follow thanks to the late author's brilliant storytelling style in which seemingly disconnected narratives fall into place around the two most central characters' own in just the right way to be most impactful (or at hilarious). That said, this is not a book that doesn't require a great deal of effort to read, but it is far more rewarding than difficult, where even the most mundane and uninteresting events are cast in such a light that they fascinate and draw you in, all framed by the darkly comic and 'absurdist' style D.F.W. was known for.

And truly, at first, hating the ending, how it just sort of, well, ended, with absolutely nothing resolved.<br />Actually, at first it was very familiar. Finally I realized that when I first got out of college I had checked it out from the library and returned it unfinished after keeping it for a couple of months. Racking up fines and wanting to give others a crack at the new book, I returned it. And with money being tight being just out of school, that was that. At least for more than a decade.<br />Then I ran across it on Amazon and -- not having anything particularly in mind to read -- the plot summary appealed to me. As did the idea of a 1,000-plus-page work to get lost in.<br />It was big. In seemingly every possible way. Big, heavy book with large pages and tiny printing. Big themes and ideas often given a dribble at a time before appearing again hundreds of pages later.<br />What's it about? On one hand it's like a long Seinfeld show -- it's about nothing.<br />Or maybe it's about everything? Certainly drugs. And Americans' tendency to sit in front of television screens doing nothing until they die.<br />But mostly, I think, about what and who we love, and why. The most sympathetic character, Don Gately, accidentally killed a man by taping his mouth during a burglary and the man, having a raging cold and unable to breathe through the nose, expires through a horrible death of suffocation after Gately leaves him in that state.<br />In one of the conversations between Hugh/Helen Steeply and Rémy Marathe, the former says:<br /><br />  \\""You sit down with your little accountant'sledger and soberly decide what to love? Always? ... What if sometimes there is no choice about what to love? without deciding? You just do: you see her and in that instant are lost to sober account-keeping and cannot choose but to love?\\""<br /><br />Ostensibly the book is about an \\""entertainment\\"" cartridge that is fatally addictive. Or maybe why Hal Incandenza has morphed into some kind of state where his voice comes out as incomprehensible and horrifying to those to whom he speaks?<br />\\""I am in here,\\"" he thinks while waiting to begin a college interview.<br />But maybe it's more than his voice: \\""I expend energy on remaining utterly silent in my chair, empty, my eyes to great pale zeros. ... I would yield to the urge to bolt for the door ahead of them if I could know that bolting for the door is what the men in this room would see.\\""<br />Toward the end, after developing withdrawal symptoms upon quitting smoking marijuana and falling into a funk of depression, he thinks:<br /><br />  \\""It now lately sometimes seemed like a kind of black miracle to me that people could actually care deeply about a subject or pursuit, and could go on caring this way for years on end. Could dedicate their entire lives to it. It seemed admirable and at the same time pathetic. We all are dying to give our lives to something, maybe. God or Satan, politics or grammar, topology or philately -- the object seemed incidental to this will to give oneself away, utterly. To games or needles, to some other person. Something pathetic about it. A flight-from in the form of a plunging-into. Flight from exactly what? These rooms blandly filled with excrement and meat? To what purpose?\\""<br /><br />After finally, months later, arriving at the end, with none of the issues seemingly resolved my first reaction was anger that I'd waded through and been left midstream. But then I found myself ruminating deeply about the book itself and \\""what-ifs\\"" and whys. Which, apparently, is what Wallace intended.<br />In that he succeeded.",2013-06-16

Forster said, \\""One always tends to overpraise a long book, because one has got through it.\\""<br /><br />Though I'm sure he didn't have a book like IJ in mind, but I agree with him to some extent. Reading a long book means devoting a substantial time of your life, a time which you value and there's no way one would like to declare that he/she/it spent that time on something unworthy. But when the book is Infinite Jest, then it deserves every iota of praise bestowed upon it. Its reading experience is something like the author takes your hand, makes you sit in front of a mirror and whisper in your ear, \\""now see the magic\\"" and lo, you're sucked in by the mirror and the next moment you find yourself in a strange yet surprisingly familiar land and slowly the images, the scenery, the words starts unfolding themselves and you need to look out at each direction, else you'll be lost. You need to examine a life, which was left unexamined for a long time.<br /><br />Day of finishing Infinite Jest<br /><br />Jan 25, 2013 at around 2200hrs, I finished reading this book, closed it and put it aside. I stared at it for a while, then logged on to goodreads, gave it 5stars, put it under my favorites shelf and asked myself, \\""Well what was that all about?\\"" There was no answer in response but just an echo of words:<br /><br />to write something that stabs you in the heart. That pierces you, makes you think you're going to die.<br /><br />Day of starting reading Infinite jest<br /><br />There was a loud knocking on the door. I wasn't expecting anyone, drowsily I thought. On checking that the time was 2a.m in the morning, I exclaimed! certainly not at this hour. I reluctantly went to answer the door. An adolescent boy of around 14yrs straightaway asked,\\""Do you want to get entertained? Huh..what the..? I banged the door on his face and went back to sleep. Few hours passed and a sudden sound of some commotion broke my sleep again. Annoyingly I came outand Goodness Gracious Me! there was this whole tennis court in front of me and two players were busy playing. There was a group of boys snorting coke. On the opposite stands, some kind of class was going on! I recognized it was Arthur Ashe stadium, but couldn't place the players. I looked at the score board: Wal and Fed. Wal was apparently leading with 6-3, 7-6, 5-3. All of a sudden somebody tapped on my shoulder. He was the same boy. This time he handed me a book. It was so heavy, that it made me fall from my seat. I woke with a start. The alarm of my cell phone went off at that precise moment. I checked the date. December 1, 2012. I said to myself, Of course!<br /><br />The days in between<br /><br />Over the period of almost two months, I read IJ every day. Having read Girl with curious hair and A supposedly fun thing.., I experienced both fiction and non-fiction writing by Wallace and loved it. It proved to be a boon, coz if nothing else, the disjointed stories in IJ were something like short stories from Girl.. (although a lot more developed and maturely handled) and the long ramblings on different topics reminded me of essays in a Supposedly fun...so Yes! Reading Wallace's other works before attempting this book did help a lot more than I expected. There was something that made him work for me, which not only provided enjoyment but became a great source of knowledge and information.<br /><br />He is one writer about whom I read a great deal about for reasons quite apparent. He dominated most part of my reading year gone by and I'm sure a repeat would happen this year too. Amidst an ongoing group read, reading some great literature (other than this book) and various conflicting opinions w/r/t its content, plot, structure, etc, etc, I have found a book that shall remain with me both physically and emotionally throughout this modest and unexciting life of mine.<br /><br />Infinite Jest is not a work of a genius. It's the work of someone who was all set to change the definition of word genius as we know it. He created a world that was consistently dark, desolate and most of the times demented but also witty, ingenious and oh so funny. This magnum opus is incredibly challenging but at the same time surprisingly accessible. It won't let the reader sit back, relax and enjoy it. It's no beach read but want its readers to sit up and take notice about what is going on. You can't afford to lose focus and track but the probability is that you'll lose both anyways. It's that kind of book, a literary equivalent of mobiusism, a never ending quest, a once in a lifetime experience. By expressing all this, I'm in no way glorifying its completion by me, but simply stating the facts. It's not possible to overestimate this book.<br /><br />Wallace took the most wretched situations and characters and created such amazing backdrops, that in spite of everything so seemingly hopeless, he would still be able to present you with a glimpse of hope. In face of lot of desperate moves, he would teach you a lesson or two in patience. With so many impossibilities going on one after the other, he would tell what all is possible if one try to do just one thing: realize.<br /><br />His prose is exuberant with less scope of comfort. He won't surround you with the sea of beautiful flowing writing to make you feel that he has stated something profound but rather something relentless and contemporary that you're in a position to relate in both subjective and objective way, no matter how insane that way is. You'll lose count of neologism, solecism, colloquialism, malapropism, and many other -isms DFW employed within IJ, which not only proves fascinating but gives you an idea about the extent to which he allowed himself to experiment in order to say whatever he wanted to and you'll see how effortless it all looks as if DFW was telling something that's always been there and getting our attention by a simple psst-look-here expression. Dave Eggers in his wonderfulforeword rightly stated: A Wallace reader gets the impression of being in a room with a very talkative and brilliant uncle or cousin, who, just when he's about to push it too far, to try our patience with too much detail, has the good sense to throw in a good low-brow joke.He has employed an allegorical structure to this novel and develops it to an extraordinary proportion taking cues from many of his influences namely Joyce, Pynchon, Shakespeare and Dante to name a few.<br /><br />I don't want to indulge much into plot(s), but just a brief and my practice in brevity, if I'm allowed. IJ primarily takes place in futuristic USA circa 2009-10 in Boston city. The setting for majority of the narration is based at Enfield Tennis Academy (ETA) and Ennet House, a drug and alcohol recovery house, where majority of the interesting characters reside, situating nearby ETA. ETA was founded by James. O. Incandenza, an avant-garde film maker, whose wife, Avril Incandenza heads the academy with their 2 sons, Mario and Hal being the current attendees of the ETA while their eldest brother, Orin being a previous attendee, now a punter in the NFL. Orin is a jerk, Mario is great and Hal is lonely. Avril is beautiful, very tall and delusional about her kids; James was taller, committed suicide and knew his kids just too well. He created a film known as The Entertainment, titled \\""Infinite Jest\\"", which rumored to have 'qualities' such that whoever saw it wanted nothing else ever in life but to see it again, then again and so on, rendering its audience fatally addicted to it. The quest of finding the master copy of this entertainment marks the entry of a group of Quebecois separatists in the book, known as Les Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents a.k.a Wheelchair Assassins or simply A.F.R, who wants to obtain a copy, which they called Samizdat , because of its lethal qualities that would make them dangerously powerful to meet their extremist goals. This group gave me creeps.<br /><br />The book is mostly covered with Wallace commentary about drug addiction through myriad eccentric and bizarre characters at the Ennet House. Wallace presents the intake of drugs, its effects and substance withdrawal i.e. cold turkey in such merciless detail that one can't help to actually empathize with those involved in substance abuse.Apart from drugs, there's some wonderful description about depression, clinical depression to be precise. Here's one of my favorite passage which I've tagged as spoiler (view spoiler). At this point one can't help feeling for David's own struggle with depression and the justification of the eventual step he took.<br /><br />With drugs and depression, there are AA meetings and telling of stories, some of which are so despicably ugly and dark that it would make you think that you were better off without reading them.Then of course there is tennis and the pressure this competitive game induces on young minds but also tells how a thin line exists that separates Tennis with real life: Tennis's beauty's infinite roots are self-competitive. You compete with your own limits to transcend the self in imagination and execution. Disappear inside the game: break through limits: transcend: improve: win.<br /><br />At ETA, through characters like Hal and Michael Pemulis, one gets the picture of how youngsters so easily resort to wrong paths, which could adversely affect their coming lives a sample of which could be witnessed through Ennet House residents. So in my opinion it won't be wrong to say that Wallace, in a masterful way presented a connection between past, present and future of different promising lives, which got destroyed because of the few choices wrongly made. At Ennet House, characters like Don Gately convey that despite being wrongdoers, they are good human beings at heart and are just a product of godforsaken circumstances amidst which they were born and at the same house there are people like Randy Lenz who are nothing less than a personification of devil.<br /><br />While reading this book, one gets a fitting impression of David's capability and scope as a writer. There could be nothing more challenging in picking the most undesired and ugly elements of the universe and weave them together and creating characters and situations of such unbelievable contrast that the end product dwelling them makes even a stone heart to wail in sympathy or reach a point of such profound epiphany that brings a huge turn around in your life. He won't present you with anything normal but something lovable nevertheless. What's the most important thing that can happen after reading IJ? The world around you changes for better or for worse. One tends to acquire a whole new point of view of looking at people and can't help thinking, Well, what could be their story?<br /><br />The most incredible example of David's talent can be seen through James O. Incandenza's filmography that is dripping with excruciatingly weird but magnificently witty ideas. I admit that there was not much I could relate with in great depth. My love for tennis and movies (especially Lynchian) wasn't the biggest support system and well, I'm not even American or Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, so all the more less relief, so my motivation mainly rest with David's writing and the thought of reading a work of literature which is unique in a daunting yet immensely fulfilling manner. It's true that this novel is full of extraneous ramblings but they are not invasive to the main text. If you learn to like his writing, you will love everything written by him, well almost everything. I had my small issues with few things but I'm ready to overlook them. Moreover a clever move by Wallace can be identifiable in the manner of his use of so many `errors' in different context. I know they were mainly attributed to various characters, but again, in a book so huge, the margin of error automatically increases, which could easily be neglect during editing too. So instead of sifting such errors out, Wallace made them the part of his work. If I'll give it a metaphoric angle as a result of some cogitation on my part, then it could also be seen as life, which can't be led without its due share of some big errors. After all that's what being human is all about.<br /><br />One thing I can confidently say about his writing is that in this book, his prose though seemingly reckless at times, is an intentional move on his part. You'll see the range and depth of his skills throughout. Agreed that most of the topics covered had some deep connection with David personal life but that's exactly it makes it all the more brilliant as we get to read someone who had a lucid and precise view of what he had to say. Though I have read that this thing doesn't sit well with many, but that's what reading DFW means. A blogger rightly commented: So many of his critics never realized the writer's relentless and extravagant prose was a deliberate and incredibly risky attempt to present reality as he experienced it, which was so vast and multi-layered as to make sharing it with another person who was experiencing a similar influx, an astonishing feat.<br /><br />Infinite Jest, among many things is homage to sobriety, happiness, loneliness, sadness and truth. For some, staying sober is happiness and for some feeling is happiness.

It's like watching a reality sit-com over a surveillance camera, is one concise description I particularly like. A work of literature that was born to become immortal and shall teach you what all can be done with words and what power lies within the realm of writing.<br /><br />My reading experience was more or less steady and enriching.

Denouement and IJ doesn't go together in the most conventional sense. There was a lot more left to `figure out'.

One would carry one thing or the other out of it. There are many loose ends that are not being tied, may be because they are meant to be honored in isolation. The whole thing would turn up as fogged mirror, which only you can clean to see an image, either unbearably beautiful or unbearably ugly.

Yes, I realize that I'm writing one, but trust me on this -- no one can do justice to the experience of reading Infinite Jest without actually reading the book (like comedy, and a frog, it tends to die when dissected).  So what should you know about this book, then, in order to decide whether to read it?  Do you enjoy reading books where the footnotes tell the critical parts of the story?

However, I will try to lay out reasons to buy/not buy this book as well as a few things people might want to know before jumping into this kind of commitment.  INFINITE JEST isn't for everyone, and I don't mean that in a condescending or patronizing way: it will certainly appeal to some people's sensibilities much more than others.<br /><br />###Here's What You Need to Know###<br />David Foster Wallace's INFINITE JEST is a postmodern novel with a premodern message.  Wallace, who railed against irony, wanted to be sincere in his writing.  So while this book does contain many postmodern conventions, its ideas about humanity aren't postmodern at all.  I think many people were disappointed that the book is \\""about addiction, and that's all you need to know,\\"" but there is much more to this book, and there's much more that Wallace has to say.  Some of these messages are delivered with a heavy hand, and that's fine: Wallace wanted to be sincere, and he wouldn't want to dull his insights by distancing himself from them via irony or whatever else.<br /><br />This book is indeed incredibly long.  INFINITE JEST is notoriously known for being a long book - it's just shy of 1100 pages.  Stephen King's THE STAND (uncut edition) and George R.R. Martin's STORM OF SWORDS are longer this, but I was able to clear those books much quicker than David Foster Wallace's second novel.  I'm a very slow reader, and I was able to read INFINITE JEST in about two months, without taking into account the time I spent reading two shorter novels by different authors.<br /><br />This book is indeed incredibly verbose.  As a way to rage against the rising popularity of minimalist writing in the 1980's, Wallace found himself moving towards a brand of writing that captured everything: every thought, every action, every detail.  His maximalist writing can be hard to get through at time: there's an extended passage detailing a tennis academy's design that seems to go on forever.  The discussion of an invented game that involves intermediate calculus to keep score reaches across dozens of pages.  Wallace sought to capture everything.<br /><br />Everything you heard about the endnotes is true.  The narration of the book is frequented interrupted with endnotes (different from footnotes), some of which span a dozen pages and contain their own endnotes.  These asides are not optional: plot details are frequently hinted at or exposed in these interludes.<br /><br />READ THIS ON KINDLE IF YOU CAN.  I want to stress this point: reading INFINITE JEST is much easier on an eReader for a few reasons.  With Kindle, the hassle of flipping back to the endnotes is a burden made much lighter.  Each note is hyperlinked to its corresponding section to the back.  It's also really easy to highlight, bookmark, make notes of certain areas to revisit if you need.  Some important plot elements are given only once in passing, so marking these areas is helpful, and Kindle makes the task really simple.  The weight of this mammoth book is also erased with the electronic copy.  There are two complaints about the Kindle version however: 1) it's not a real book, and I prefer handling most books (I think we all kind of do, right?) and 2) if you close the eReader while you are in the endnotes, your Kindle will recognize that page as being the further point you've read to.  Remedying this situation isn't hard; you'll just need to log onto Amazon and clear your furthest-page-read, but it is a bit annoying.<br /><br />###Here's Why You Should Buy This Book###<br />Some of the passages in this novel rank among my favorite all-time sections of writing.  While Wallace can be verbose, it can lead to some of the most inventive and poetic turns of phrase.  I found myself going back and re-reading many moments as soon as I finished them and highlighting them for later use (Irarely ever do this).<br /><br />This book is funny, sad, smart, and silly.  INFINITE JEST really runs the gamut in terms of emotions that it evokes.  I've seen many readers talk about how funny it is, and others that focus on how tragic it is.  There are moments in this book that I still reflect on and laugh out loud.  There are moments that, when I think about them, make me want to cry.  There are even moments in this that give me the goosebumps imagining how horrifying they would be.<br /><br />INFINITE JEST is filled with tons of ideas and tons of characters.  Readers will spend a lot of time with the characters here, and almost all of them are interesting.  Some of them are fun, and some of them are despicable.  Mario Incandenza ranks among one of my favorite characters in literature.  Additionally, this book is full of ideas about addiction, entertainment, society, family, imperialism, Quebec separatism, and tennis.  There's a lot of great insight spread out across the novel's length.  There's not a ton of plotting to INFINITE JEST, but it's alright: these characters are often compelling enough that readers will want to spend their time with them.<br /><br />It seems that half of the reason to read INFINITE JEST lies merely in the act of doing it.  Most people bail on the book midway through, so finishing the novel is seen as a sort of accomplishment in some circles.<br /><br />###Here's Why You Should Pass on This Book###<br />This book is too long.  It surprised me to learn that INFINITE JEST had an editor and that sections of the book were excised.  There are some stretches where not much seems to happen and no new insights are made.  Most books leave me wanting the ending to go on and on forever, but there were times where I was just ready for this novel to be over (strangely enough, not at the ending though).<br /><br />INFINITE JEST is wildly inconsistent.  It probably comes with the territory of maximalist writing, but while some passages of writing are fantastic, some passages are equally dull.  While I loved the book, I think it would be hard to argue that this novel is a solid, consistent work.  Additionally, the novel frequently jumps (apropos of nothing) to different characters and different times and different settings.  The narrative might be dealing with Hal Incandenza at a Boston tennis academy in the future only to suddenly (with, granted a line break) focus on a glimpse of his father in the 1970's.  Even more additionally, the writing style changes frequently.<br /><br />The use of styles can be jarring.  I ended up liking this point, but I feel that I may be in the minority on this.  Early in the book, an essay written by one of the characters (in high school) is recounted in full.  Later, we are treated to stream-of-consciousness via a character we are not familiar with.  Later, there are dozens of pages with nothing but dialog (literally, not figuratively), and some passages that are completely without dialog.<br /><br />There's not much plot here.  I haven't talked much about the plot in the above content because there's just not that much to talk about.  The premise is: a filmmaker created a video that is so enjoyable, people can't turn away from it or think about anything else.  Most of this book focuses in on its settings and characters to make its points.<br /><br />###Overall... ###<br />Overall, I gotta say, even for all of its flaws, I really enjoyed INFINITE JEST.  Some of the reviewers that rated this book poorly have good points to make, and I would recommend reading these reviews before making the plunge on buying this book.  At the end of the day though, if you enjoy postmodern fiction, INFINITE JEST is definitely an experience worth trying.rarely ever do this).<br /><br />This book is funny, sad, smart, and silly.  INFINITE JEST really runs the gamut in terms of emotions that it evokes.  I've seen many readers talk about how funny it is, and others that focus on how tragic it is.  There are moments in this book that I still reflect on and laugh out loud.  There are moments that, when I think about them, make me want to cry.  There are even moments in this that give me the goosebumps imagining how horrifying they would be.<br /><br />INFINITE JEST is filled with tons of ideas and tons of characters.  Readers will spend a lot of time with the characters here, and almost all of them are interesting.  Some of them are fun, and some of them are despicable.  Mario Incandenza ranks among one of my favorite characters in literature.  Additionally, this book is full of ideas about addiction, entertainment, society, family, imperialism, Quebec separatism, and tennis.  There's a lot of great insight spread out across the novel's length.  There's not a ton of plotting to INFINITE JEST, but it's alright: these characters are often compelling enough that readers will want to spend their time with them.<br /><br />It seems that half of the reason to read INFINITE JEST lies merely in the act of doing it.  Most people bail on the book midway through, so finishing the novel is seen as a sort of accomplishment in some circles.<br /><br />###Here's Why You Should Pass on This Book###<br />This book is too long.  It surprised me to learn that INFINITE JEST had an editor and that sections of the book were excised.  There are some stretches where not much seems to happen and no new insights are made.  Most books leave me wanting the ending to go on and on forever, but there were times where I was just ready for this novel to be over (strangely enough, not at the ending though).<br /><br />INFINITE JEST is wildly inconsistent.  It probably comes with the territory of maximalist writing, but while some passages of writing are fantastic, some passages are equally dull.  While I loved the book, I think it would be hard to argue that this novel is a solid, consistent work.  Additionally, the novel frequently jumps (apropos of nothing) to different characters and different times and different settings.  The narrative might be dealing with Hal Incandenza at a Boston tennis academy in the future only to suddenly (with, granted a line break) focus on a glimpse of his father in the 1970's.  Even more additionally, the writing style changes frequently.<br /><br />The use of styles can be jarring.  I ended up liking this point, but I feel that I may be in the minority on this.  Early in the book, an essay written by one of the characters (in high school) is recounted in full.  Later, we are treated to stream-of-consciousness via a character we are not familiar with.  Later, there are dozens of pages with nothing but dialog (literally, not figuratively), and some passages that are completely without dialog.<br /><br />There's not much plot here.  I haven't talked much about the plot in the above content because there's just not that much to talk about.  The premise is: a filmmaker created a video that is so enjoyable, people can't turn away from it or think about anything else.  Most of this book focuses in on its settings and characters to make its points.<br /><br />###Overall... ###<br />Overall, I gotta say, even for all of its flaws, I really enjoyed INFINITE JEST.

How often does that happen?","Another astute reviewer called Infinite Jest the ugliest American masterpiece, and I think that's incredibly apt and precise. It is this lurching, shaggy behemoth born of DFW's obssession that checkout-line-tier junk and acclaimed literary fiction of the period--the touchstones of low and high culture--had essentially the same goal: compel the reader toward the end and along the way supercharge them with accumulated feeling or insight or appreciation for fine craft. He found it toxic. His goal was more audacious, more prescriptive: to give the reader tools to prise that gilded cage apart, to be a more conscious reader with the hope that the resultant rigor would seep into other areas of life.<br /><br />Know that it is a rigorous book. Know that the ugliness is tightly and expertly controlled, not mere sloppiness. Know that all the pleasures you'll get from this novel will be oblique in one way or another because that is the point. Know that there IS an ending, just not an Aristotelian, Shakespearean, or even postmodern one. Know that you do get a few hundred pages of connective tissue, which is satisfying in a way completely divorced from plotting considerations. I cannot say Infinite Jest was enjoyable or entertaining--it was, in dense, explosive clusters that definitely did not comprise more than half the novel. Here's what it was for most of it's length: vivid, interesting, rigorous, and most importantly, finely felt. This is different from deeply or profoundly felt, which can be captured in Realist terms, with gorgeous, crisp prose.<br /><br />Wallace sculpts inner lives in the abstract, with heaps of finely observed cuttings of information, emotion, syntax, and subtext laid alongside each other which crackle with intensity, all the more astonishing because this laser-like empathy shoots from these UGLY, sedimentary walls of text, and (at least I thought), \\""How is this possible? I spend much of the time flipping back and forth to sometimes infuriatingly factualminutiae, in the dictionary, or puzzling out tenuous connections. How could he get me to care about these characters' inner lives so minutely when the foregoing work erodes some of the pleasure I get from reading?\\"" It's because the work is bound up in the book as part of Wallace's (cutting edge/old fashioned) moral approach to fiction. If Infinite Jest can inhabit you (I had to pick very carefully here--it is not only a matter of entertaining, arresting, appreciating, astonishing, or even finishing--as these all have their narcotizing aspects if engaged unconsciously) you will eventually be enriched by it. Maybe not immediately, but surely you will. Surely and eventually is better than immediately but contingent, right? And if, after all of this qualified endorsement, you're still an interested skeptic--give it two tries, maximum. I'll be frank and admit I'm contemptuous of the many one-starred reviews that can blast the book in a few sentences and slip in somewhere that they finished in a week or two. Or those tortured souls who've read the same 100 or so pages 3,4,5+ times over. Why try to turn somersaults with one hand nailed to the floor?<br /><br />I hope you'll give Infinite Jest your time. It is even more deserving of your native intelligence and empathy.",2012-09-11

Its size, its depth, the end notes (which, unlike regular end notes, are not just optional citations but critical movers of the plot) - everything about this book says, \\""You can't read me.\\"" And a significant part of David Foster Wallace's genius is that this intimidation was chosen for effect - it  was essentially done on purpose, and it's what makes this book not just a story, but an experience. And not infrequently a life-changing experience.<br /><br />One of the first things you notice about Infinite Jest - one of the first unmistakable facts about this book that you will encounter - is that it is not a linear narrative. There is some academic speculation about exactly how non-linear the book really is (is it circular? fragmented? a mobius strip?) but suffice it to say it will skip around a great deal at first before giving you enough freebie background information to give the reader a firm footing and propel the story forward.<br /><br />While this may sound very tedious, by the time you get your bearings - say, around pages 90-130 - you will begin to appreciate that Wallace has put you through that fragmented beginning for a reason. This is not drug-induced moon-howling stream of consciousness. This is not structured chaos. It is not beautiful by accident, or despite itself. It is beautiful on purpose.<br /><br />It is somewhat pointless and beside the point to summarize the plot of Infinite Jest, but one piece is critical to understanding what I think Wallace was going for with this, his masterpiece of fiction. The plot centers around a movie - called \\""the samizdat,\\"" or Infinite Jest - which, if viewed, turns the viewer into a crazed addict who wants nothing more but to watch it again, and again, and again and again, until they die of starvation/dehydration/exhaustion. Conceptually, Wallace seems to have put a great deal of thought into whether something like that would be physically possible - some kind of filming technique, lens, subject or equipment that could have such an immediate, irreversible and profound effect on anyone who saw it.<br /><br />I don't know this for a fact, but I suspect Wallace also wondered what could be possible to achieve with a novel - what techniques, subjects lenses or equipment could he employ to have an equally, if not identically, profound influence on those who experienced it. I think the heft of the book is a deliberate choice. You are supposed to be a little aware that this thing you're holding weighs three pounds or whatever. I think the disintegrated nature of the plot structure is a deliberate choice, because his nonfiction is straightforward and entertaining. I think the footnotes are meant to piss you off, and you are supposed to be occasionally frustrated with the book. But he does this because it gets you emotionally invested in the book as a mental exercise but also as a physical artifact. It's his way of breaking through that barrier of time and space and making you physically feel something.<br /><br />Another arresting feature of Infinite Jest is the sheer density of ideas that he packs into it. A single page will hatch three or four ideas that you've never thought of before - enough ideas to satisfy an entire chapter of a John Updike novel. And none of them are frivolous, or overwrought, or showing off. They're just new, interesting ideas that would take a normal person about a week to have thought of on their own. It's almost like alien intelligence - it's hard to believe sometimes that this book was composed on yellow legal pads in a one-room studio apartment in Syracuse, NY. But it was.<br /><br />The book is not without flaws, and not everyone will appreciate it. One of the most obvious shortcomings is that Wallace doesn't really write any empathetic female characters. In fact, for all the ideas and thoughts and insight and hyper-intelligence, the characters in Infinite Jest seem to be emotionally transactional with oneanother in a way that seems unrealistic - like it takes place not on earth but on the planet Vulcan.<br /><br />The book also tends to deliver what emotional payload it does have through exploration of the depths of addiction, madness and despair. Not that it's a book of total sadness - and unlike some addiction-themed works of fiction James Frey, it isn't meant to shock or to sell books, I don't think. Instead, this is a profound intellectual explosion that obviously came from the hands of a 30-year old man, and to some extent that's who is going to be able to identify with this book the most.<br /><br />I read Infinite Jest over the course of about three months, which from what I can tell is just little slower than average among those who actually complete the book. That was about a year ago. Many people have said Infinite Jest was a life-changing experience for them - so many that for me to say it now would be a clich&eacute;. So I won't. But I will say that in the year since I completed the book, I have felt on the one hand like I have joined some kind of weird international brotherhood of book-nerd dudes who read and loved Infinite Jest, and on the other very isolated by my inability to fully digest what it had to say.<br /><br />By all means, read (or at least attempt to read) this book.

They would forget to eat, forget to sleep, and even forget to use the restroom as they were carried away by The Entertainment.<br /> Loosely, this is the question that is under scrutiny in the massive 1000 + page tomb from the late David Foster Wallace. More broadly, pretty much everything comes into question in Infinite Jest. The \\""plot\\"" of this thing can't really be pinned down, nor should be, and so I'm not going to attempt that one.<br /> As a postmodern work, the reader of Infinite Jest will be dropped rudely into an already moving, fluid and ludicrous backdrop where you might find yourself asking again and again, \\""Did he just go there?\\"" And finding that the answer is always: yes, yes he did. It's unlike Wallace's \\""Broom of the System\\"" in that you are never going to fully or maybe even partially know what the heck is going on. Oh sure, you'll formulate multiple questions about the characters of the work and become interested in their outcome, but in the end, for-getta-bout-it.<br /> This is the reason that probably the majority of mainstream readers will shy away from Infinite Jest, but here are some reasons it is worth its weight. Number one: it's intelligent. While not quite like reading the Oxford English Dictionary (as one of the several dozens of characters for whom we hear a perspective in the work does), it does offer a bit of information on any and every kind of subject. For those who have never touched an addictive substance to those who have felt the shakes of withdrawal, Wallace makes the addiction and its consequences informative, real, and oddly entertaining; addictions that range from substance abuse, emotional dependency, media reliance, and even vanity issues. Through Wallace's characters all things, all emotions, all scenarios are possible and probable.<br /> Another reason to dive into Infinite Jest is the humor. You will find it's not a laugh-fest as you wade through the intricacies and details of the work, but it is witty and thought provoking as the character bounce off and into each other in a broken timeline of years that have names like \\""Year of the Trial Size Dove Bar\\"" and \\""Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment.\\""<br /> Perhaps the reason I would read Infinite Jest again and would recommend it to the patient reader is the places that this work will take you. Those who know a little about David Foster Wallace know that this man of prolific writing capability committed suicide in 2008 after more than 20 years of struggling with depression. This element lends itself in Infinite Jest as Wallace talks through his characters about the consideration of suicide, the attempts, and what it truly means to decide to \\""erase one's own map.\\""<br /> The phrases like \\""offing one's map\\"" and developing a case of the \\""howling fantods\\"" are what make the novel endearing and unique. Wallace is speaking his own language in his own world that he has created, and...it's damn impressive.<br /> Wallace has a way of providing commentary on issues that makes them interesting in their own right. He has you considering whether filmmakers are purposefully bad in their art or just plain bad, and then not even ten pages later you are considering how much food an average human would consume over their lifetime and what a room filled with said food might actually look like?<br /> In the end, the novel is going to turn you upside down, vertical, and put you back horizontal (page 902). It's going to make you think a little more, and mourn a little for the loss of the author that brought you on such a wild trip. While not for the faint of heart, it's definitely one to get lost in.

Infinite Jest is one of those books that takes time to get it's hooks fully into you, but when it does it's hard not to be completely in thrall to it. I'm not even sure it's a novel as much as it is a holistic intellectual commitment the way most German Philosophers and some long-running HBO television series are. I found myself actively wondering about the characters, the structure, the chronology, the footnotes, and in general just puzzling over this bizarre, fractured little world like it was my own. Wallace has syntactical prowess out to *here* and I feel like you don't read these sentences as much as you just navigate them and sort of pull them through with you, filling in the little ellipses, argots and inside jokes as you go along. And yet in spite (or perhaps because) of all of the rich stylistic exploration, Wallace is able to create compelling, humane characters, often in the span of just a few pages.

I love Vonnegut, but something about this book is more complete, even though it's still a satire. You can see the influence of Vonnegut (and many others) on Wallace's writing, but there is not a single bit of hackery to be found. Wallace has an omniscient voice, as if he really does know pretty much everything, and I honestly do think that I did more external research during my close reading of Infinite Jest than I did in my entire college experience. Every sentence is poetic, despite being prose, and the pregnant meanings hidden behind the obscure and archaic terms are like little presents that reward your reading further with every definition sought. References to famous artists, philosophers, and scientists throughout the book are similarly engrossing, and if for example you wonder why Hal, very early on, thinks Dennis Gabor may have been the antichrist, I suggest you look Mr. Gabor up, and retain that puzzle piece off to the side until you find the spot in the story where it fits.<br />Within this book, our entire future is explored, from a uniquely American perspective. It is terribly tragic, yet wrought with levity and wit at every turn, and there is no more-poignant commentary on the American condition. Wallace deftly illustrates a world where \\""addiction\\"" and \\""entertainment\\"" are thematically married, and struggles to make sense of the futility, the hilarity, and the source of it all. Be warned, though: This book is alive. It has many personalities, expressed by many voices, but at its core there is a single soul, and as comedic and fantastic as the story seems, it can at times be dreadfully, overwhelmingly real.

Do not be intimidated. As an earnest, diligent reader, you will be rewarded in manifold ways, like no book you've ever read.  David Foster Wallace did not set to go about creating a deliberately unapproachable book. Infinite Jest is not intended to be unbearably unreadable (as you might think!). It is only that he expects much from his readers. He will not talk down to you. He will not overexplain. But he absolutely will expect you to meet him halfway. Some activities are passive: reading is not one of them.  Our culture's waning literary interest has mostly to do with authors who feel an arid superiority toward an uninformed readership, so they create these books that are abstruse, convoluted, haughty, and altogether esoteric as a gloating challenge to the supposed proletariat readers who just don't understand. If you can't keep up, then too bad for you. And we wonder why literature has hardly any place in our world today: the writers insist upon being deliberately uninviting to the uninformed.  DFW is not that kind of writer. Infinite Jest is not intended to aggravate or frustrate readers, though it may at times. It is simply sharing a story, and we aught to listen carefully about the techniques used therein to do so. Because it is a remarkable story with sharply insightful comments on addiction, precociousness, and how we consume and interact with media. It is truly an indispensable book to the American literary canon. In my own unprovable opinion, this book will still be discussed hundreds of years from now.  I am writing this review just before I embark upon my second reading of this text. You know from others, or could easily find out, why this book is remarkable, so I will not spend much time praising it. But I can tell you that I still carry around with me scenes and phrases and characters from this book even five years later. It is powerful. It will affect your relationship to theworld. It is that significant.  Recommendations on how to read this book:  1.) Buy two copies of this book and a good dictionary (OED). Keep all three at hand when reading. You may also want to keep a browser up for encyclopedic entries.  2.) Find a quiet place. Personally, it was difficult for me to read this book in a coffee shop or any public place, but I am easily distracted. It may or may not be the same for you. For me, there is too much force to Infinite Jest for any venue but a quiet study or a library.  3.) Read slowly: there is a lot going on.  4.) Stay on the intended path. Follow every footnote and endnote: the author has a path for us to follow. Let that be your guide. The footnotes/endnotes are not unimportant.  5.) Take notes. Keep a character list and other notes as you go along to help you remember. It also helps to read as much as you can in each sitting. You will become exponentially confused if you read this 800-pound gorilla in 2-page increments every five days.  6.) Finally, read it again within five to ten years after your first reading.

I also like it when I'm reading books that feel like they're happening in my head, that I'm thinking them instead of reading them. Maybe I'm just wired that way.  I'm not going to get into all the issues that so many others have already gone over in some detail (some amazing reviews in here). I'm just going over what led me to a 4-star review.  First, I look at \\""entertainments\\"" as a sort of roller coaster ride or an opportunity to go to the edge and look over and then safely retreat to my day-to-day life. This is definitely one of those books only it can be really tough to pull back from the edge. The characters in this book are so broken, so filled with despair, there were many times when I found myself thinking, \\""I'm surprised DFW didn't kill himself while he was writing this.\\""  He paints black, black, black, scary pictures. And then, just when you're about to drown in the despair he's weaving around you, he drops a line that'll have you laughing out loud for minutes on end. The guy knew how to manipulate catharsis.  Something smells delicious.  I found his timing excellent. I felt played like a violin.  I really enjoyed his prose, and didn't let myself get too hung up when I came across words whose meanings I didn't know (I found most relatively to figure out based on the context).  One of the things I particularly enjoyed about his prose was how every character had a unique voice. Marathe's Quebecois French seems translated literally. Don Gately's voice is much more vivid because not only does his character mangle the language when he speaks, but his language is just as mangled when you're reading his thoughts. Or Hal's non-stop, manic patter as he tries to figure out how just to set up that one last marijuana binge. He's cracking up, and through DFW's use of language and pacing, you start to feel the same way. I came out of that passage wracked, sweating, and paranoid. Just like Hal.  One of the things that really surprisedme was his treatment of AA and NA. At first, I was prepared for him to look down on the meetings and methods they used, but as you start to attend these meetings and see the wrecked lives these people lead, their efforts to pull themselves out of the shitter feel almost heroic, and you see a grudging admiration for the works of the people who run the meetings. I was genuinely stunned and moved by that. Beautifully done.  And that's what I really liked about the book: if you let yourself go, DFW's technique puts you in each character's position. I had no problem succumbing to it, though there were definitely times that, as a result, I just had to put the book down for a few days as it seriously zapped my head.  But, as much as I liked it, as much as I was able to put on the book and wear it, there were definitely times when I just plowed ahead to get through something. It was as if at times like these, DFW's humor left him. As did his pacing, and that would often get me thinking, \\""OK, OK, OK, I get it. Life sucks. Now, can we just get on with it?\\""  In the end, though, I think it's a wonderful book. As others have said, don't expect anything close to a traditional structure. Just be patient, and when a new piece of the puzzle falls into place, snap it on in and feel the novel's ultimate shape shift a bit.  You won't be the same reader coming out as you were going in.",2011-10-13

The writing is magnificent and much of the underlying story (consisting of numerous threads, some of which I could not, for the life of me, connect until near the end of the book) is highly entertaining.  There are frequent references to organizations, acronyms and events which make absolutely no sense for hundreds of pages until an information dump occurs which suddenly brings things into sharp focus.<br /><br />For example, reference is early and often made to the Great Concavity.

This is my favorite novel and so that would take a while and probably waste your time rehashing what other people have said better. Instead I'll try to address a few of the more common complaints I see here:<br /><br />The first is that there is no closure. This is correct to some degree, since many of the storylines in the novel - Hal's addiction, Gately's and Pemulis' fates, the Quebecois insurgency, etc. - aren't explicitly resolved. There are hints of what happens if you'd like to sleuth these out (I was lucky enough to read it shortly before Infinite Summer, a sort of online book club for this, started, and luckily got to see the theories of cleverer people), but I'd argue that even those are unnecessary. The way I like to describe it is that Infinite Jest is too good to be constrained by a plot. Instead, these storylines are really just avenues for exploring some very interesting concepts: addiction, achievement, depression, loneliness. Moreover, these avenues are populated by some very well-drawn characters, some of whom are pretty repulsive but most of whom are so deftly fleshed-out that you can somehow empathize with them anyway. And momentarily inhabiting such realistic characters (narration is often limited-omniscient, albeit confined to a variety of different characters at different times) is such a rich experience that, to me at least, it more than makes up for a scant plot.<br /><br />The second is that the book is hard to read. This is true in parts, and there are more than a few words in here whose meanings I still don't know. There are a lot of footnotes, a common theme in DFW's work, which can be bothersome but not horribly so. The beginning is especially slow going because the characters are unfamiliar and confusing and, especially if you haven't read any of DFW's work (I strongly suggest reading some of his essays before this), you may not have the reservoir of goodwill to get you through. But once you find your footing about a hundred pages almost all of the remainder is  very readable. Sure, there are portions that can be pretty technical. There's an exposition of a Risk-like children's game that involves a jargon-packed discussion of nuclear warfare, for one, but I enjoy taking these digressions to learn a bit about the subject, and at any rate they're often skimmable if you so choose. More prevalent, to me, were sections of wicked humor. Infinite Jest has a lot of hilarious exchanges, events and descriptions. As an experiment, I looked for the funniest thing I could find in 10 seconds, and here that is: someone is selling sterile urine to beat a drug test, urine that's described as \\""warm pale innocent childish urine that's produced in needly little streams and the only G/M scan that it couldn't pass would be like an Ovaltine scan or something\\"", and this sort of thing is all over the book (though it's a little more scarce toward the end). Real, laugh-out-loud humor. Sometimes broad, sometimes subtle. There's also a lot of exploration of how people think and behave, which is much more realistically felt and appreciated than I can describe, and which draws more empathy from me than any other novel I've read. At any rate, I think the best thing I can say about this book's readability is that I still pull it off the shelf occasionally, just to read a random section and either laugh or savor its ideas and prose, or all of those things. Not because I want to impress anyone; not because it's some book-medicine, required but unpleasant; but because it's really pleasurable to read.<br /><br />So to summarize, if you want a novel that will introduce a problem, detail its solution, and tie up any loose ends (in other words, a conventional story), you may want to look elsewhere. But if you want descriptive prose, sharp humor and emotion, and a thoughtful exploration of a very wide variety of subjects and experiences and characters, give this a try.",2011-08-26

Utterly fascinating, almost in spite of itself.  It doesn't conform to many notions of a \\""successful novel\\""--the ending, for example, resolves nothing, which might disappoint some readers after 1,000 pages (although by the time you get there, you may not be surprised at the lack of conventional ending).  And let's be real: this is a long book, and it could have had nearly the same effect if it were half as long; although I was never tempted to abandon it, it was certainly a slog at times.  Although it may seem petty, the typeface is small, and feels small; it might be more petty if this were a 300-page book.  (This was the first, and maybe last, time I could imagine preferring to read a book on an ereader, for the adjustable font size and easy access to the 100 pages of even smaller-fonted end notes.) But on the other hand, it's not a particularly difficult read.  Sure, you have to pay attention, and there are a lot of characters and several interwoven plots, and some unusual vocabulary, but the syntax is generally very accessible.  This isn't Finnegan's Wake.    But make no mistake, Wallace was brilliant, and Infinite Jest is a rewarding window into his mind as much as a novel.  This might seem unappealingly self-indulgent if his mind weren't so interesting, but I felt privileged, particularly considering that we won't be hearing more from him. One reviewer said he would drive grammatical readers crazy, but Wallace knew exactly what he was doing with words, and I'm not referring merely to his use of many words with which the reader will not be familiar (I guarantee it).  Indeed, his unique mastery of the way we actually use language and the way our thinking actually operates, as well as the way writers typically write, is a good part of the fun. That, combined with his perspective on life, had me feeling as though I'd found a kindred soul, someone who saw things more as I do than almost anyone else--andthat's quite a statement about a novel. I found myself wanting to quote many passages to my closest friends, but you really have to read it to get the context. And what is that perspective? Hard to articulate, but a combination of irony, an appreciation for the absurd, and compassion, depression, and anger at what we have made of our lives and world, particularly through the corporations and the forms of entertainment we've created.  (The reader may find himself doing a little research on postmodernism.)    There are parts of Infinite Jest that are seriously depressing; it comes as no surprise at all that the author took his own life, and he's effective enough that the reader may find himself wondering whether that might not be such a bad idea. There's also some graphic violence, although not a lot considering the length of the book. It's also one of the most laugh-out-loud funny books I've ever read.  Wallace was extraordinarily perceptive, and his finely drawn characters, cartoonish though they are, are more like the deeply flawed personalities we actually are than most of the characters that populate novels, which seem superficial by comparison; the reader feels as though he's met these people, and will come to care about them.      This is engrossing and disturbingly insightful stuff.  It's an investment of time and emotion, and stretches one's mind.  I'm very glad I made that investment; it's one of the most powerful novels I've ever read.",2011-08-08

If that will bother you (as it did me and other readers), you probably shouldn't start this.  On the other hand its supporters will tell you \\""it's not the destination, it's the journey.\\""  And the novel is undeniably shot through with interesting characters, sub-plots, anecdotes and allusions.  At times I found it quite entertaining.  Hence the three-star rating.  Still, I have a strong 'classical' preference for Unity with my Variety, and that's just not what Wallace has on offer.<br /><br />What I mostly take away from reading this book is a portrait of the seriously disturbed, manic/depressive, substance-abusing, suicidal author.  This is, in other words, not a story at all...it's a chronicle of a man's mental condition as he attempts to write a story (ultimately failing).  Mr. Wallace committed suicide while in the depression end of his cycle; in his manic phase he penned Infinite Jest.  There is a constant pall-mall rush to his flow of run-on paragraphs, along with a literally compulsive listing of things and naming of irrelevant persons or events, that will drive many readers to \\""howling fantods\\"".  More than that though:  His imaginings are so bizarre they more resemble the ravings of a person in delirium than genuinely creative outflow of a Nietzsche or Van Gogh. So much mutation, mutilation, addiction and insanity... so little beauty, wisdom or goodness.<br /><br />  Some  have promoted this book as funny, or a black comedy, or even \\""hilarious\\"".  Not even!  Catch-22 and Dr. Strangelove (the movie) were black comedies, and they were hilarious.  Voltaire's Candide was at least amusing.  Infinite Jest virtually never tempted me to laugh or even smile.  Grimace sometimes, yes.<br /><br />  It's unfortunate, and a bad sign of our times, that some effete literary critics have hailed this style as \\""the next thing in fiction.\\"" I'm convinced they're simply trying to be the first critic to have caught the New Wave.  This reminds me so much of the situation in modern art, the way pretentious critics contest with one another to identify some new trend or artist...while the art itself they're promoting is mostly just crap.

Full of psychotropic arcania, tennis trivia, frustrating obscurity, and moments of high comedy, any attempt to synopsize this post-modernist epic would be an exercise in futility.  Don't consider any attempt that you have encountered to tell you what the plot is, or what the book is about.  The emotional range is stunning, with moments of genuine despair, revulsion, joy, and triumph.  The style ranges from the most esoteric (I don't think I've ever used my dictionary more) to straight-forward and declarative.    What I will say is this:  Differing from any fiction I have read in the last ten years, this book haunts me; it gnaws at me; it invades my thoughts at unexpected times and in unexpected ways.  Sentences and scenes come to my mind with hallucinatory clarity.  My vision of the world has been subtly changed.    The book is not without flaws, and the sheer logistics of reading it, with its 200 pages of endnotes - some of which are chapter length - make the challenge of reading it all the greater.  Yet I think that was part of the author's plan.  There must often be pain to temper the pleasure.    So as to not sound too serious, I should again mention that this book is full of humor, often laugh-out-loud humor.  But I find the book ultimately sad, profoundly sad.

And I am sad to see him go the way he did. But, more to the point, this book is an embarrassment to American literature. While I seek out and enjoy books set in Tucson with great regularity (except for Barbara Kingsolver, whose Tucson books are utter tripe), this one paints the city in a way that is completely and utterly foreign. But that's actually not my gripe. My true complaint is that for all his talent, DFW takes a clever idea and absolutely drives it into the ground. This book could have been--and should have been--half the length that it was. I understand the overwhelming need for writers to construct a massive tome at some point in their careers. It feels good. It weighs a lot. You win genius grants from the MacArthur Foundation. Fun times. However, to say that DFW's clever little footnote trick gets old, tiresome, and flat out maddening (and I know, it's very \\""of the times\\"" to multitask and show the varying levels and degrees of meaning in the human condition, but good lord) is a terrible understatement. However, in light of the ire I am sure to draw for trashing one of the quintessential practitioners of the \\""clever, self-absorbed, pretentious, and self-important\\"" writing school that gave us the likes of Jonathan Franzen, Adam Levin, Arthur Bradford, Dave Eggers and the entire McSweeney's aesthetic, I will preface my final critique of the book by saying that I'm well aware of the draw of this sort of writing for would-be writers who long to go down through the ages as a hip genius of American letters. This book, in short, is a tiring exercise in cleverness--the footnotes, the hyper-extension of the foibles of commercialism and capitalism. And when you finish it and come to the realization that the joke is on you, it will sting a little, and you will be bitter. But don't take my word for it, read it yourself (I am, after all, only one of a few dissenters). And--if you ever actually finish--get back with me and tell me what you thought.

(1996) David Foster Wallace.<br /><br />Everything you have heard, read, and that has been said about Infinite Jest is true. Should YOU read it? Is the only relevant question. This book is work--it's going into the gym and the classroom. (It is 1079 pages and holding it requires strength and strategy. And Kindle, iPod, or cd isn't a remedy because of the classroom aspect--you will want to highlight, and write in the margins; and it requires two bookmarks--one for the body and one for the endnotes.) This book, though a novel, is a journey into the mind of David Foster Wallace and is one long suicide (Wallace hung himself 12 years after publication at age 46) note. But it is not grim and dour. It is, at times, gruesome and frightening, yes, and also funny, and always insightful into the human condition and especially the American pursuit of happiness and pleasure along with the concurrent escape from discomfort and pain. And mostly about the inherent and ironic conflict between pleasure and pain--how the relief of pain into pleasure ultimately creates more pain, which causes one to seek more relief/pleasure, i.e. a psychological and physiological trap--a cage with no way out ... except maybe through a Twelve-step program which is SO boring so as to be not worth the effort. And then, there is reincarnation--which DFW never calls by name (something he does with the Psychoanalytic Reaction Formation, also) but which plays a huge part in the story. Both.<br /><br />Should YOU read it? I rank it as one of the four best books of all time. I lived with it for three weeks pretty much not doing anything else but reading and thinking about what Wallace was saying. I stopped drinking (One theme is addiction) and didn't bother to go out or watch any entertainment or do any work of my own (writing). It, the book, moved into my mind--took up residence in my apartment, became my roommate. Of course that is ironic also because the book's first name was \\""A FAILED ENTERTAINMENT,\\"" and the book is the most entertaining thing I've ever experienced - passively; but then it is work so it's not completely passive, as say watching something - \\""spectation\\"" Wallace calls it. What the book is is inside the brain of a particular personality who happens to be a genius with a photographic memory (which again he doesn't name but describes: \\""Hal [a central character] can summon a kind of mental Xerox of anything he'd ever read and basically read it all over again, at will, ... .\\"" (Pg. 797) I think parts of Wallace surface in all of the characters (there are scores of them) and what he does is to debate through interior and exterior dialogue, btw & w/in characters. Ideas/thoughts/philosophy (and of course this is discussed. He also critiques his own writing style via this, his technique,) Wallace's personality is, if categorized by the trait theory of The Big Five (OCEAN) [I think]: Extremely high O (open) slightly less but still very high C (conscientiousness), somewhat low E (extraversion, i.e  Introverted), somewhat low A (agreeableness) and somewhat above average N (neuroticism). Add to that an extremely high I.Q. with that memory thing, a large physical presence (6'2, 200lbs.) and a cute and interesting face and you've got the man. If you think you can relate to those characteristics--you'll probably be taken by, and drawn into the novel as I was. [About being high O. Highly Open persons tend to be bored by people below them on the continuum, which looks like arrogance, elitism, snobbery, creative showoffishness, etc. Openness is the trait most associated with creativity. They also tend to be low in A (a `pussified' trait) for obvious reasons.]<br /><br />That by way of introduction. Briefly now, a look at Infinite Jest by way of the six elements of a story.<br /><br />Title: Perfect, either one. Defines the book.<br /><br />Plot: There is only a very almost inconsequential one. It is sometimes a distraction. It is about the relationship btwnthe USA and Canada and the use and disposal/reuse of energy and territory. In an interesting way - it is woven into the pleasure/pain conundrum and so therefore worth some consideration. The personal and political intersect with, I think, some very bizarre drug enhanced imaginative thoughts and ideas. Free association.<br /><br />Characterization: There are three main protagonists. Hal Incandenza, a 17 yr.old, privileged white boy, at an elite youth tennis academy in Massachusetts; founded by his father (alcoholic) and run by his mother (OCD). Hal is addicted to marijuana and nicotine and a gifted and highly rated tennis prospect. He has younger residents/students/players he mentors, as well as two brothers who play prominent roles. Don Gately, a 29 yr. old, staff resident of a halfway house for recovering substance abusers, located adjacent to the tennis academy. Don is 9 months sober and oversees other recovering addicts. He is recovering from addiction to downers and a life of crime. Remy Marathe, (of unknown age) a legless Canadian, and member of a group of wheel chair assassins involved with the USA v. Canada's political/environmental/territorial mess. There are numerous sub-characters within these three facets of the story - the tennis academy, the halfway house, and the governments of the two countries. There is a prominent female character, Joelle van Dyne. She is involved with Orin Incandenza (Hal's older brother); James Incandenza (Hal's father); Mario Incandenza (Hal's younger, deformed, brother); and Don. She is also a person of interest i/r/t Remy's work. She is addicted to crack cocaine and a girl of exceptional beauty--the P.G.O.A.T.--the Prettiest Girl On The Planet. To me, none of the characters were all that likable.<br /><br />Setting: The story takes place mostly in and around Boston, Mass. USA in the near future [The book being written in the mid 90's.] year of 2007. It is spring through fall and there is rain, humid heat, and snow.

So and but that night's next ...\\"" etc. He repeats words: \\""Then he considered that this was the only dream he could recall where even in the dream he knew that it was a dream, much less lay there considering the fact that he was considering the up-front dream quality of the dream he was dreaming.\\"" [then he adds, mocking himself] \\""It quickly got so multileveled and confusing that his eyes rolled back in his head.\\"" (pg. 830) Events are not lineal.

Some readers struggle with the minutiae of tennis. But the game of tennis and the discipline required is a metaphor for life, in Wallace's mind. This is what is taught at the academy, and also all the AA stuff, characters and references. Delay of gratification and effort and struggle are their own rewards ... blah,blah, blah and yada, yada. Life is a GAME and it is not about you or who wins that matters. Ironically--nothing matters. Addiction is covered from head to toe, from its genesis to its usually horrific conclusion. You think you're not, addicted, maybe you should read this book for that reason. Entertainment and the individual and that relationship- ship's- ships' (Wallace's style is infectious) exploitation by design and by fate (Never named.). Then there is the issue of control, choice, and self-determination, which is the underpinning of The Game, Addictions, & Entertainment. Is it (control) really just a delusion? So why not - seek pleasure and submit to ecstasy? And running beneath the underpinning is all the unnamed Freudian stuff (Also, never named.)--that childhood decides. That even the best of intentions can have disastrous consequences, and not even here to get into all the horror of the ubiquitous neglectful, abusive, and incestuous parenting stuff that Wallace explores. And finally [not really possible] Wallace's take on reincarnation--that YOU will be killed by a woman, and that that woman will be your mother in your next life.<br /><br />Got time?

Look elsewhere if you're expecting normal narrative satisfactions:  I think the novel fails if one considers its convoluted narrative structure, limited characterisation, and empty commentary on its purported subject matter;  however, the novel succeeds spectacularly as the embodiment of  the author's experience of the world.  The author's mind and psychology are embodied in key features of the text: the idiosyncratic virtuosity of the word surface; the humour created created out of obsessionality and the grotesque; and in each and every character's stasis, anxiety, and isolation.  Having been allowed a glimpse of David Foster Wallace's soul, I would risk speculating that we have been privileged to share a brilliant life, a brilliant life shaped by Asperger's Syndrome.<br /><br />Some biographical research is useful, given that (for over a month) you will be asked to look out of David Foster Wallace's eyes and to feel the world through his pores.  Online there are numerous interviews, including video with Charlie Rose, audio with Michael Silverblatt, and a sensitively judged piece by D.T.Max in the New Yorker.  Articles and, more recently, complete biographies document his interests, his unusual childhood, and education: many commentators weave these basic facts into a romantic tale of troubled genius.  Biographers also document Wallace's depression, the prescription of medication and ECT (electro-convulsive therapy), his time in half-way houses, and his tragic suicide.  Equally evident are his energy and his distress: however, the sources of both are left largely unexplored.  The biographical facts are compatible with Wallace having had Asperger's Syndrome; but better evidence for this diagnosis is provided by the text (or testimony) of Infinite Jest.<br /><br />Emotion is inherent in many scenarios in the book.  Yet the emotional impact is muted, and thespecific emotions evoked ambiguous and incongruous.  Rather than an instant unmediated effect, emotion is accessed through the intellect.  The emotion is acquired at a distance, and the intellect's conclusions remain open to interpretation - there is doubt as to what is being felt, by the reader, by the characters, and by the author.  Wallace has allowed the reader to re-enact the inner experience of Asperger's Syndrome, where emotion is present but access problematic.<br /><br />Given the reader's own intellect has been channelled through the synapses of David Foster Wallace, there is an obsessional surfeit of detail competing for attention with the clauses carrying the emotional import of a scene.  His sentences are like rivers, sweeping the reader far from the initial point of entry, and swamping the outsider's thought with the rhythmic torrent of his ideas.  Again, the reader is not only given a description of a mind that processes its experience with a hyper-articulate obsessionality and intense focus, but actually allowed to inhabit the mind (almost) first hand - if there is a justification for the excessive length of the book it might lie in the need to immerse the reader repetitively in order achieve this transfusion of experience.  The repetition itself, along with the obsessionality which verges on compulsive (the intense illumination of the prose can feel like a powerful spotlight wheeling about, with its operator only partly in command of its direction), evokes the experience of Asperger's (and of those elsewhere on the Autism Spectrum).  The verbal dexterity, especially when directed towards a special interest, is also found with Asperger's - although the level and breadth of virtuosity speak more of Wallace's  intellectual gifts.<br /><br />In regard descriptive passages, Wallace is at his most impressive recreating the anxiety, monomania, and isolation of drug addiction - numerous scenes depict the sensory experience associated with various drugs, along with the psychological battlefield of withdrawal and abstinence.  Less frequent but equally affecting are passages expressing the inner world of the severely depressed.  No doubt Wallace is speaking from his own experience, and to be able to translate this into vivid, exhaustive, and compelling language is a stunning achievement.  Towards the end of the novel there is an extended passage where one of the main protagonists, Hal Incandenza, in a state of withdrawal from marijuana and other drugs, relates his bewilderment at his own emotions - others can read his facial expressions, but he is disconnected from himself.  The prose shifts perspectives, subtlely manipulates tone, and takes the reader within Hal's experience - which can in itself be taken as that of an \\""Aspie\\"".  Likewise the evocation of a delerium state experienced by another protagonist, Don Gately, is a bravura literary performance - it too occurring late in the novel and spanning many pages.  Drugs, delerium, emotional distress are patently difficult subjects: these, I think, are the best passages in the novel, but there is no escaping the reality that not every reader will relish a prolonged encounter with such subject matter.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier, less satisfaction is to be found in the plotting and characterisation.  There are three main strands to the book.  In one Hal Incandenza wrestles with memories and marijuana while doing his time at the Enfield Tennis Academy.  In the second, Don Gately works at Ennet House recovery facility for dependency, attending AA and NA meetings, and unexpectedly getting involved in a crisis.  In the third, Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents (Quebecois Separatist wheelchair-bound assassins) plot perversely motivated terrorist activities.  The first two strands are largely static, and the third absurd (and frankly a bit tiresome).  Exploring Hal's family and Gately's past are the motors for the first two strands - this strategy gains the reader's interest and, ultimately, is a method to deepen the characterisation.  The limitation here is the world view which emerges - every character, major and minor, is isolated.  There is precious little motivation in anyone to overturn this isolation; that is to say, there is no love between characters, requited or not, and no character risks yearning for a future relationship.  Even at a pragmatically physical level, Hal and Don are essentially sexless.  Hal's parents are glazed of all emotion, hermetically sealed by Hal's memory and incomprehension - his father's death is denied power through being rendered ludicruous and grotesque; his father's life is related as if Hal had heard of the man but never met him; his mother, similarly, is less a mother and more a figure to be observed.  Orin, Hal's brother, is long absent and his relations with women stilted and, with \\""the journalist\\"", relegated to a joke.  A single line in the novel suggests that Orin had sex with his own mother, Avril: this is stated and never followed up.  In any case, the protagonists want so little, and demand so little of other people, that their inner priorities and motivations have no dramatic arena in which to be revealed.  While not true to the diversity of human experience, this presumption of isolation, and difficulty in reading one's own and others' emotional signals, poignantly depict core features of Asperger's Syndrome.<br /><br />Wallace validated the novel's form by placing himself in a tradition of largely American writing stretching through DeLillo, Hawkes, Barthelme, Pynchon and Barth, where the conventional focus on plot and character is secondary and the author's and reader's attention is directed elsewhere.  In interviews he plays up his formal pretensions by claiming the novel is structured according to a Sierpinski triangle: this is a mathematical construct and how this could afford structure to a narrative is opaque - even if Wallace were to explain his claim (and I'm sure the explanationwould be inventive and entertaining), a reader could rightly object that this was not the \\""structure\\"" that scaffolded any actual reading.  In reality that role falls to the three parallel story strands.  There is some fracturing of the plot, some juggling of chronology, but these moves are standards manoeuvres, used often enough in novels (and in film) to provoke the reader into being an active participant in piecing together a coherent story.  Wallace stated that he wanted the endnotes to disrupt the reader's physical experience (the flipping back and forth), and to introduce layers of material in a manageable way - as with so much in the book, I think the actual effect of this technique is to take the reader inside the mind of Wallace, to mimick its habits, rather than to colour any objective commentary upon the world.  Personally, I'm not entirely won over by the aspirations of the tradition of literature mentioned, and, perhaps for better rather than for worse, I'm not sure Infinite Jest shares many of the cardinal features of the tradition.<br /><br />I wonder if the obscure vocabulary similarly reveals Wallace's inner state.  Many of the rare words are taken from medicine, botany, and mathematics and used out of context. This cross-fertilization might well be how Wallace's mind generally works: he has several streams of thought running simultaneously (consciously or semi-consciously) and sometimes they intertwine and the words of one stream bleed into the next.  There is also the sense that the world is primarily experienced as a manifold of individual objects (in contrast to other authors where human relationships constitute the bulk of the world); the vocabulary has an urgency to it, as if this multitude of things requires precise description in order to be comprehensible and so allay the immense anxiety generated by the plenitude of discrete objects - whereas Cormac McCarthy's arcane words make the world old and inscrutable, Wallace's make things sit neatand technical and gleaming.  It's almost as if every individual thing in the world has eyes, and is staring at Wallace, demanding his attention, and the only way to satisfy this throng is to assign each a precise and proper name.  The relationships between objects are also theatening in their exponential complexity; hence the conjoined conjunctions (and so but then, etc.) that stud the prose like nodes in a neuronal net.  It is unclear to Wallace which of the options takes precedence - for him, relationships are not felt but untangled by the intellect.<br /><br />The humour in the book comes in different flavours.  Often Wallace's taste is questionable.  The entire conceit concerning North American politics is shallow - possibly the ideas are worth a few laughs, but they are presented so repetitiously that they soon rankle.  An oversized agent in drag and an amputated assassin with contorted English syntax also merit only a chuckle or two - but Wallace presses on for countless pages - sometimes his persistence wins out, but more often the humour grows weary.  Persons on the Autism Spectrum can find repetition, and isolation for that matter, very soothing and pleasurable: thinking through what it took for Wallace to write this mammoth book one wonders whether some of the content actually reflects Wallace's needs. He said that he was surprised readers found the book funny - which makes me fear we're laughing at Wallace, at his quirks, at the mechanics of his mind, rather than with him.<br /><br />In interviews Wallace claims Infinite Jest is about addiction - undoubtedly it is.  Further he claims it is about entertainment - I think it says almost nothing of interest about this topic.  And he thinks it is about a \\""sadness\\"" affecting his generation of privileged Americans - again I see the book as offering no general social commentary, and to label the book \\""sad\\"" is to misrepresent its tone and content.<br /><br />For me, there are some ambiguously positive side effectsto reading the book: there is vicarious pleasure in the facility with words, with the capacity to see the world so clearly through language - the exuberance of mind induces a kind of manic euphoria; there is a defiant pride present, in Wallace having the wherewithall to construct such an object, and in the reader having the tenacity to read it to its end.  But the primary effects are negative: the book infects the reader with anxiety and agitation; and there is a solitariness - in every character, and in the very situation readers find themselves in, withdrawn from the world for the days it takes to finish the book; rather than sadness, there is a despair at there being no purpose, no meaning, beyond mere individual survival - getting through one day at a time, as per the recovering addict.  There is no love, no connection, no confidence in a human life shaped by family, friends, a sharing in the human condition.  This too is not sadness, but a kind of hopelessness, an emptiness, a loneliness.  The book has no proper end and, given Wallace's perspective, this too is negative in that author, reader, and characters are all trapped in an endless loop.<br /><br />The book is inimitable, brilliant, but it is less about the world than about a specific perspective on the world.  It is about the view from inside David Foster Wallace. I suspect this is the view of someone with Asperger's Syndrome, who is also blessed and burdened by high intelligence, and who has reacted to his experience of the world first with intense unrelenting anxiety and later with a consequent pervasive depression.",2011-01-08

A plot that is all but impossible to describe, if indeed there even is a plot to this book. There's not a way I can describe Infinite Jest that doesn't make it sound intimidating, difficult, and challenging, and there's no denying that, in some ways, those adjectives fit...a little. But what a description doesn't reveal is just how much fun this book is, and just how enjoyable of a read it really is. I mean, this is a book that contains deadly wheelchair-bound assassins, an organization of hideous people who veil themselves to protect others, Canadian separatist revolutionaries, prep school kids playing nuclear war games, art house cinema involving cameras pointed back at the audience, bored ghosts who stick beds on ceilings, and so much more. How all of this comes together is somewhat difficult to explain; what plot there is here revolves around a video so entertaining that people will literally never quit watching it until they die, the pursuit of that video by various government organizations, and a college prep school that revolves around tennis. But all of this misses the point of the book. This is a funny book, often on laugh-out-loud levels, and one beautifully written and crafted. In the introduction, Dave Eggers comments that in the entire book, \\""there is not one lazy sentence,\\"" and that's putting it mildly; his sentences are magnificently crafted, with stunning imagery and often brutal feeling between them. And as funny as the book is, that doesn't even touch on how frequently moving it is, as well; the sections about addiction and AA are incredibly powerful, and done with remarkable emotional complexity. Look: is Infinite Jest a little difficult? Yes. Is it a little unfocused, to put it mildly? Without a doubt, sometimes to the point of frustration.

The experience of the book was not worth the time and effort.      I've read many books in my life, and some of them much longer than Infinite Jest (Proust, e.g.). But I have never struggled to finish a book, or dreaded having to pick it up and slog through a few more pages before I got too bored and had to put it down.  This happened time after time with this book.  It was a lot of work for very little reward.  Obviously, there are a lot of pages to get through.  That would be a minor issue if the story narrative and character development were compelling enough.  They are not.  Granted, there are some interesting things in this book.

Reading IJ is a huge commitment; reaching that final page will take for most a minimum of one month, and for most, including myself, it will take several months, but it's completely worth the investment. Summarizing Infinite Jest is a nightmare in theory and in practice doesn't do the book justice: over the period of a few weeks in November, wunderkind Hal Incandenza deals with his personal and familial issues at the Enfield Tennis Academy; reformed burglar and addict Don Gately tries to stay sober in a Boston halfway-house; radical Quebecois terrorists seek an experimental film that reduces viewers to mindless zombies crying for repeat viewings; packs of feral, carnivorous hamsters roam the toxic wastelands of Old New England; a guy named Roy Tony is mentioned once, appears briefly five hundred pages later, and is never heard from again; a brief essay appears out of nowhere to explain the rise and fall of video-telephones, and so on and so forth. Infinite Jest isn't a traditional story with a beginning, middle, and end. Instead, Wallace pulls back the curtain and allows the reader a brief glimpse at his own fictional world full of characters, events, and locations tied together through very elaborate and delicate means that only become apparent as the novel reaches its end. Along the way, the reader becomes acquainted with Wallace's bizarre humor, political satire, 12-step mantras, Boston street-argot (I'm trying to bring \\""demapped\\"" and \\""promoted\\"" into my vocabulary now), and science fiction that sometimes becomes eerily similar to today (I discovered the joys of Netflix's Instant View features around the time Infinite Jest explained how TP's download content from the internet).

What we end up with is a dense and sprawling work, juggling tragic/comedic/philosophic/and practically every other form there is, and at the same time it can be capital-E Entertaining with theright mind looking into it.         Reading Infinite Jest gives one the sense that, not just was Wallace a genius, but one of those seemingly rare geniuses whose hearts somehow outweigh their minds.  I.e. the author is not merely showing off to us what he knows, what he can do; it's more like he's . . . reaching out.  And when you're aware of Wallace's tragic real-life mental struggle - the epitome if there ever was one of the \\""tortured artist\\"" - you start to hear his voice between every line of the 1,000+ pages; and so then you want to understand, you want to reach back . . .

Employing a \\""the flesh is sad and I've read all the good books\\"" posture at 20 years old, I dismissed this as hipster trash without glancing at page 1.  Ok, so DFW eviscerates that very attitude explicitly, lays out the psychological underpinnings and proceeds to illustrate the destructive impact it has on one's life.  He does things like that a lot.<br /><br />In my defense, I was only half wrong.  It's not hipster trash; it's a hipster classic.  This is not to demean this work. I'm pretty sure this is a major novel - who am I to say?  It's themes however, are very much of the hipster variety.  That being said, DFW applies real Socratic philosophy to the modern lifestyle, examining painfully and explicitly how better lives may be conducted.  To do that, DFW needs to examine the underpinnings of the hipster attitude/philosophy.<br /><br />The unifying metaphor in the work is that of addiction. This takes two forms, the more interesting of which is the addiction of our generation to entertainment.  That's paralleled with very concrete stories of drug addiction.  Our character of primary interest (initially) is facing a bit of drug addiction himself, but in a modest hipster pot common man sort of way.  Still.  This is a pretty powerful way to critique the present generation and humanity in general.  Plus, you learn a lot about AA.<br /><br />I'll put that out as an example, but there's a real philosophical heft to the book, and that is hard to find at any time.  It's worth the read just as a novel, but also because of its influence on the rest of current literature (which is fairly vast).  As a self-help book, it's not really bad either.<br /><br />Oh, and the vocabulary. Dear God.  Sometimes it's just nice to pick up some new words.

There was relief and even a sense of accomplishment that I had finally finished such a dauntingly long book (over a thousand pages). There was a little confusion and disappointment, for after all that brilliant text, the plot, such that it was, didn't really Resolve in the ordinary way. But my main feeling was one of respect for the author. This novel really was an extraordinary piece of art.<br /><br />It hit pretty much all emotions, humor, pathos, disgust, inspiration, etc. while canvasing an incredibly broad spectrum of characters, wealthy, poor, intelligent, stupid, kind, cruel, everything. The author has (had) a remarkable ability in two areas. First, his ability to put words together is as good as I've ever seen. This sounds like an obvious skill for a professional writer, but Wallace's turn of phrase is astonishing in it's impact. The second skill that Wallace possesses is a power of observation that would make Sherlock Holmes seem sedated. These two things combined really make for a powerful reading experience.<br /><br />I am, however, a bit puzzled by the configuration of this novel. It seems a bit disjointed. Occasionally some of the threads of the narratives of the disparate characters come together in subtle in-joke kind of ways, but that combined with the lack of a classic plot resolution made me realize that one could actually begin rereading the book immediately after finishing it and pretty much find that no less enjoyable (perhaps the \\""Infinite\\"" of the title.) I actually did reread the first 50 or so pages because way back in the dimly remembered early pages, I remembered stories of characters I had only properly learned about many hundreds of pages later and I wanted to revisit them. But the book is so long that you can't possibly remember what happened 1000 pages back. If you put this on an endless loop on a electronic reading device, you'd hardly miss the beginning and ending.<br /><br />Speaking of an electronic reading device, I must say that any collection of 1088 sides of paper is going to be quite irritating to lug around and, ridiculously, it was something of a physical feat to just hold it open while reading it for as long as it took. Exacerbating this annoyance were the hundreds of end notes which required constant shuffling of the huge tome. Regrettably, they were usually either too essential or interesting or both to be skipped.<br /><br />There were lots of plot elements, but nothing really cohesive and some were downright ridiculous (the sinister ninja-like terrorist organization that is used for various bizarre plot purposes is composed predominantly of people in wheelchairs). Although there was no grand normal old-fashioned plot, there was a lot of descriptive activity taking place. If you're not squeamish about drug use, this book's incredible attention to the realistic details of unfortunate recreational pharmacology might change that. Another minor topic is tennis. Tennis isn't offensive to anyone (like golf) and those who aren't interested can simply overlook it. For me, who has always liked tennis, the incredibly rich descriptive discourses on the life of serious tennis people were rather inspiring and I've since taken up the sport.<br /><br />Overall, a magnificent and amazing work. If you think you might be interested in a fantastic book about modern American culture and are prepared for a bit of a long read, I highly recommend Infinite Jest.ctronic reading device, I must say that any collection of 1088 sides of paper is going to be quite irritating to lug around and, ridiculously, it was something of a physical feat to just hold it open while reading it for as long as it took.

This is like nothing else I've ever read--I hope this is only because I'm not well-read, because the idea that I never will read anything else like this is a very sad idea. Who else could write in excess of 1100 pages in which very little ever actually happens and have it be completely irresistible?    Wallace's voice and personality in this book are inimitable. The book, for this reason, is undeniably funny, because DFW is funny, but I can't help but think that the reviews that call it things like a \\""screwball comedy\\"" are completely missing the point. The book, to me, is almost indescribably sad.    The question \\""is it really possible to know another person's heart\\"" is so trite that I pretty much won't read any book whose review or blurb contains it--but this is what this book asks, and it asks it better than anything else whose author seems to have set out to write a book asking it, and the humor with which it asks it only makes the question itself more heartbreaking. Actually, this isn't really the question at all; the question is a lot better than this--how do people communicate with each other at all, what masks do they hide themselves behind and how do the choices they make and the things they give themselves away to cut them off from each other--and of course the book does all this infinitely better than I can do it here.    This is probably the aspect of the book (the professional conversationalist bit, the wraiths, &c.--although this is not a book that is easily broken down into \\""this bit pertains to this theme and that bit to that\\"", and it recurs in many guises) that resonates with me the most--but there is so much more.

In fact knowing the author`s fate, makes it even more poignant as one begins to understand just what was going on in his brilliant mind.  No need to discuss the themes and storylines as others have done it so articulately. So it is left for me to describe it as THE reading experience of a lifetime.

That must equate to what.... almost 2000 pages in `normal` type ? It should have frustrated, it should have bored at times, it should have seemed pretentious with words used that you can`t imagine even a dictionary holding. Yet not once did I think that DFW was trying to show how smart he was, which must be irresistible for one who actually WAS that smart. The book captures you and is as addictive as the addictions we read of in the pages, we learn to love the characters and care about them, we are momentarily irritated when the next chapter moves on to another of the protagonists and we are then absorbed in their problems...until we are then back where we were before,totally enveloped in the previous chapter`s character`s struggle.

He not only saw societal problems on various levels, he understood the way to make these issues most relevant to a modern audience was to approach them in a beautiful dance of words and metaphors, which is what he has done in these pages. It is not easy to read. He didn't want it to be. Wallace was against, and admirably so, the dumbing down of literature and of the masses. He expected more of the reader, and the reader in turn was given the imaginative web of characters, subplots, and humor in Infinite Jest. It was well worth the effort.<br /><br />There is so much I could say about this book, but I couldn't possibly do it justice or come close to the genius of the author. I'm not typically impressed by modern literature, and find most 'hyped' writers to be cliche, self important, and boring.

No thought, feeling or physical detail is ever left unsaid. This turned me off at first and it took some time for me to actually start enjoying the book. But suddenly the surface broke, or the corner was turned, and I was swallowed up by the story. The 'maximumist' style, once adjusted to, makes you experience the book as if you are the characters. This is generally said about most good fiction, but Infinite Jest is that art at its pinnacle. It's almost like being possessed!    Infinite Jest is somewhat like how Wallace describes drug rehabilitation in the book: when one walks into an A.A. meeting it is immediately disliked and uncomfortable. The more the addict keeps coming, however, the more it transforms from being the worst thing to the best thing in his life; which is the exact opposite of the drug they are trying to kick -- the drug is immediately loved and easy, but progressively becomes the worst thing in the addict's life. Infinite Jest is a steep upward curve of enjoyment and learning until you are left gutted that it ended.     There is one footnote in it that goes for eighteen pages! And that footnote has footnotes! Again, this was annoying at first, since all the footnotes are at the back of the book (and with a 1000 or so page brick like this you don't want to have to keep running from the back to the front). But this became something like a board game where I excitedly searched in the back for the next plot clue (yes, much of the plot's most important information is in the footnotes!).    For those interested in issues like depression and suicide, Infinite Jest contains the best description I've ever read of how it feels to be suicidal -- and Wallace is unfortunately an authority, as we all now know.    The book is about tennis, film-making, terrorism and drug rehab, plus where/how all those things fit into the rest of the Universe. It's both hilarious and deeply metaphysical.

Having parted ways with Mr. Wallace on that note, that should have been it.  But something about Wallace's style, coupled with his sardonic take on the world, coupled with his sheer elephantine ambition, caused me to keep going back to him.  I read \\""Girl With Curious Hair,\\"" was mildly impressed with it, went back to Infinite Jest, and again floudered less than halfway through it. I read \\""A Supposedly Fun Thing...\\"" was very impressed, picked up Infinited Jest a third time, and once more crashed and burned. And so it went, with me bouncing back and forth over the years between Wallace's short pieces of fiction and nonfiction and his long convoluted novel.     The truth is, I still haven't read this book all the way through from first page to last, although I'm fairly sure I've read the entire thing (and much of it more than once) in large chunks and pieces.  And maybe that's as good a way of reading it as any.  After all, it doesn't seem that DFW ever intended Infinite Jest to be read as a novel in the traditional sense of the word, not with its one-hundred-plus pages of footnotes tacked on the end and its countless sub-plots and circular digressions that run on for dozens of small print pages at a stretch.  In fact, it seems to me that Wallace did virtually everything in his power to hinder a straight-forward reading of his book, as if almost daring the reader to try and get through it without interruption, as one might get through, say, \\""David Copperfield\\"" or \\""Middlemarch.\\""  None of this is to suggest that Infinite Jest isn't greater than the sum of its parts. It clearly is.  But it does seem to me that by book's end, Wallace was still struggling to finda format big enough to contain his considerable genius, and Infinite Jest, for all its much commented on size and daring, wasn't quite it.    Of course all of the above is mere speculation, and with Wallace dead now we'll never really know for sure what his still evolving view of literature actually was, or where his talent might ultimately have taken him.  But while Wallace may be gone, we do have his weird creation, Infinite Jest, a book that, no matter how you read it (straight through or in drips and drabs), has an abundance of great set pieces, sly witticisms, clever turns of phrase, and some of the most crazy, paranoid characters this side of Pynchonland.",2009-09-20

US,23414322,R3VLU3K33DLD66,0316066524,669738240,"Infinite Jest",Books,4,5,5,N,N,"The Year of Infinite Jest","David Foster Wallace's writing is notoriously challenging and often antagonizing.  'Infinite Jest' is both, only longer.  Like his other work, it can be annoyingly precocious and self-indulgent, and the author's humor occasionally juvenile.  He purposefully breaks the narrative flow with a deluge of detail, endnotes, and abbreviations within the text, and thus alternates between keeping the reader at arms length and reeled in.  Even so, Wallace was clearly a genius, and though I don't buy into the reasons behind the experimental fiction of 'Infinite Jest' - or its effectiveness - he certainly framed a compelling argument on a vast canvas that questions the conventions of the novel and simultaneously attempts to deconstruct the self in millennial America.    It's the American culture of addiction and obsession that Wallace is out to skewer in 'Infinite Jest' - the passive acceptance of a substance (or activity) that gratifies the mind's pleasure centers to the detriment of maturing.  Integral to this theme is the existence of a video so addictive in its presentation that people who have once watched it are willing to cut off body parts in exchange for another viewing, if that's what it takes.  Those with unlimited access to this 'entertainment' will sit and watch it repeatedly until they starve.  This video becomes the Unexposed Contents of the book, with several parties desperately in search of the master version and the few underground copies that occasionally surface - some to suppress it, and some to use as a terrorist tool to further their political ends.    That is the macro-framework of the novel.  Within that is the story of Hal Incandenza, the son of the auteur who made the 'entertainment', and resident of the Enfield Tennis Academy; and Don Gately, former Demerol addict and small time burglar who now is part of the live in staff at a recovery house just below that same academy.  Hal, an almost unbelievably intelligent 17 year old, ranked nationally in his sport, and definitely a prescriptionist grammarian, has so many qualities that I associate with David Foster Wallace that his storyline was almost embarrassing to read - as if I'd stumbled on DFW's private diary from high school.     But the story of Don Gately, still in early sobriety, is a stunning portrayal of recovery and 12 step programs.  This is not Hallmark stuff, nor is it nurture your inner child stuff.  This is gritty realism and fascinating attention to humanity.  If the slightly dystopian near-future DFW sets his novel in comes across as ineffective and silly political satire, and the chronicle of the Incandenza family too contrived to comfortably connect with, Don Gately and his fellow addicts are almost non-fictional in their pragmatic efforts to become whole again - to become 'someone'.      And yet Wallace hasn't just spent the last 1000+ pages trying to warn us of the moral torpor inherent in passively accepting entertainment simply to provide us with another venue.  As the narrative of 'Infinite Jest' hurtles through the lives of its characters; as government and terrorist forces are poised to swoop down among the lives we've spent an unusually long time learning about; as the promise of a startling denouement thunders across the horizon of each upturned page, Wallace simply comes to the end of another seemingly irrelevant flashback and then stops.     At the end of the 20th century, I think Wallace wanted to know what the novel had left to teach us.  I think he held up the disinterred skull of its form and conventions for consideration, and decided that the only wall left to demolish was not between author and reader, but the one enclosing text and reader - the solution then is to \\""uninvolve\\"" the reader, to break his concentration with furious flipping from endnote to text, to disrupt the flow of the story with overwhelming quotidian detail and to slap the reader's face with an unsatisfying ending.  All of this so the reader will continually refocus his attention, and question anew what he is reading and why.  DFW demands not blubbering passive agreement but instead attempts to provoke the reader _physically_ with the rigors of attention required - as a mountain climber might sell his autobiography from the top of a large hill to further his point.      Or I could be completely wrong.  But I keep coming back to Wallace's writing, and how it doesn't seem transcribed as much as orchestrated, and how I have the feeling that Wallace had reasons for every word, every endnote, and every unanswered question.    I think I would have enjoyed 'Infinite Jest' more had I read it when it was published - now, it seems to have a slightly cloying youthful smugness.  I think I would also have been more open to DFW's style at that time, instead of it wearing thin by page 1100.  And the story of Hal Incandenza, the inordinately intelligent teenager who can't be true to his own self until he establishes its existence first might have been an effective dipstick to measure philosophical angst in my own soul as a younger man, but his adapted \\""To be or not to be\\"" seems luxurious to me today.  But the faults of the book are outweighed by its strengths - the stellar writing, the insights, and the humor that does hit its target combined with the massive attempt to overhaul the conventional novel make 'Infinite Jest' one of a kind.

A staggering work of a real genius, namely the late David Foster Wallace, takes a little longer to read, about four weeks in my case to finish \\""Infinite Jest.\\""  This is not a book for everyone.  It starts at the end and ends in the middle.  Three substantial story lines (about a junior tennis academy, a nearby drug-and-alcohol halfway house, and a wheelchair-bound Quebec-based terrorist organization dedicated to breaking apart the newly formed Organization of North American Nations (O.N.A.N), thus liberating their homeland) touch at the edges, but never dovetail into the definitive, explanatory ending that you first hope for (but give up on when you realize there's not enough room for it.)<br /><br />There is room, however, for more than 150 pages of detailed footnotes in six-point type in an end-section.  Some are technical explanations (particularly from the narcotics culture) that you can skip; other, longer entries are integral to the plot.  Did I mention the title?  Within the book, \\""Infinite Jest\\"" is the title of an avant-garde film that is so entertaining that those watching it lose interest in all other aspects of their lives, including eating.  They just watch the film in an infinite loop until they die or emergency personnel respond, whichever comes first.<br /><br />If all this sounds like a mess, well it is, in a way.  It also exemplifies the postmodern school of novels.  Dom DeLillo's [[ASIN:1416548645 Underworld (Scribner Classics)]] comes to mind - books of sweeping scope and minute detail that defy all the expectations of traditional novels.  What do you get in the bargain?  Some of the most brilliant writing I've ever read, particularly regarding the world of addiction - addiction being probably the major theme of the book - and twelve step processes.  The most sympathetic character is halfway house night manager Don Gately, a narcotics addict who Keeps Coming Back.  During his research for the book, both AA and NA groups gave Wallace broad access to their meetings.  His descriptions of the process first seem off-the-wall, but you also sense that they're not very far off, if at all.<br /><br />Wallace's political satire is also sensational.  I'll not soon forget President Frank Gentile, the clean-freak lounge singer cum President who orchestrates the merger of the U.S, Canada and Mexico into O.N.A.N. in order to clean up what's become a very messy country.<br /><br />As a burned-out former junior tennis player, Wallace can and does describe that scene in minute detail.  The Enfield Tennis Academy (E.T.A.) is more than a little nutty, being that avant-garde filmmaker James Incandenza (known to his family as \\""Himself\\"") founded it (a listing of Incandenza's films in the footnotes was a highlight for me).  Himself's son Hal, an Oxford English Dictionary-memorizing genius modeled after both Wallace and Hamlet, is our guide through that world.  His brothers Orin (a tennis player turned NFL punter, the conversion to which is another of the book's most memorable scenes) and Mario (product of a birth defect and extremely difficult delivery who seems to be modeled after R2D2 of Star Wars) also play co-starring roles.<br /><br />For the most part, the tennis content wasn't as fascinating as the addict content.  The espionage content was somewhat confusing, given that Wallace writes much of the dialogue in English based on Quebecois-French syntax.  The addict content also can be confusing as Wallace writes from the perspective of characters with seriously Substance-altered minds.<br /><br />I think I mentioned that \\""Infinite Jest\\"" isn't for everyone.  But if you're up to a challenge (\\""Underworld\\"", [[ASIN:0965045641 Middlesex]] by Jeffrey Eugenides or [[ASIN:0312421273 The Corrections: A Novel]] by Jonathan Franzen might be good lead-ins), and yearn for some scorch-your-eyeballs writing, by all means give it a try.

Nobody wants to dislike Infinite Jest (or to admit it, anyway, for fear of seeming too dumb to follow brilliant writing). So I guess I'm too dumb for Infinite Jest--and I read it on Kindle so I had quick access to the definitions of his big, often obscure words.    Now my confession: I only read about four percent of the book. I took my time, tried to process each word, sentence, and essay-long paragraph, but in the end it none of it said anything to me. Here's what I took from my time with Infinite Jest: A tennis prodigy interviews with an admissions board, they question his test scores, he says a bunch of stuff but he was actually having a seizure and had to be restrained ... ? Now a character is waiting for a girl to bring him some primo dope so he can smoke it all and not share and ... yawn ... sorry. Then a kid thinks he's going to the dentist but it's really some sort of counselor and they have a long battle of wits to see which one of them is the bigger booger-eating nerd, but then it turns out it was his dad in disguise. I tried to go on, but there comes a point in a man's life where he realizes that his ten bucks is gone forever.    When the author dumbed down his vocabulary (a happening seemingly exclusive to similes and metaphors), it was, in fact, brilliant. Too bad he used the other 99.5 percent of what I read to show off his amazing vocabulary and his equally stunning ignorance of communication skills. It was like he looked in a thesaurus for the most unusual and least-known words he could find and flooded his story with them. And if you could get past that, the content itself was boring.    Call me undereducated or dumb or whatever you like, but I'll stick to books that capture the reader's attention and interest in the first chapter or two and that keep readers turning pages because they care what happens to well-developed characters in interesting plots.",2009-04-24

I first read Infinite Jest in the middle of high school: it was assigned reading for one of my classes [an optional class, but I'd thought the book was interesting, and the teacher who taught that class had given me a hearty recommendation]. I read it during every waking moment I could, straight through, for three weeks: flipping back and forth between footnotes and endnotes, starving, wanting more, no matter what the cost, really. Yes ... I, unlike many people here, read Infinite Jest straight through, pretty much without taking a breather. [I continued going to classes, and I did between 5 and 10 minutes of homework a night. And I ate, very, very quickly.] And what this book gives you ... DFW uses the omniscient narrator throughout the story to guide you through its' different tones, from sadness to happiness and back again. The book is extremely funny. One part in particular [the Eschaton part] had me laughing nearly the entire time. The book has countless characters and none of them vfeel contrived or flat in any way: they're all fleshed out, somehow, ancillary scene stacking on top of each other, everything described so perfectly it makes your eyes pop out of your head and your mind revolt [or try to pretend to be like him]. The things DFW can do with a sentence are incredible. Perhaps part of what made this book resonate so strongly to me is that I, at the time I was reading it, was a tennis player in high school who has been ... thinking about philosophical doggerel most of my life. Everything seemed so ... relatable. It was as though the book was written for me and me alone, and after I read it once I started flipping through to odd places and read from there. I can pick up the story thread from pretty much any place in the book, now, and know where I am. The world is so consistent and brilliantly written, and thecharacters express the depths of emotion, and the things that happen aren't just things oddly thrown into the world to make his characters do stuff: they're important, they all show things about the characters that they're in. The book is over a thousand pages, and every sentence feels important.  This review is far worse than the book. For a while I've refrained from posting a review because it would have such a lack of eloquence ... I can't really think straight when it comes to this book. I've owned it for four years, and ordered another copy just so that I could loan the first out to people [as I'd been loaning the first copy out to people anyways, but it wasn't getting back to me]. The narrator here is alive: and he is showing you. He is showing you the world, and all you have to do is listen for a while.  From DFW's oft-quoted Kenyon College commencement speech:  'There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says \\""Morning, boys. How's the water?\\"" And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes \\""What the hell is water?\\""'  This book tells you what water is.",2008-11-30

US,44909764,R1LN4EWC0B6CU3,0316066524,669738240,"Infinite Jest",Books,1,20,66,N,N,"Infinite yawn","Infinite Jest, by David Foster Wallace, is the worst science fiction novel ever written. The truth is it might be the worst novel ever written, or at least published, but given the fact that Wallace has stiff competition from the burgeoning spawn of PC Elitist writers, not to mention his own PoMo kith, such as Rick Moody, Dave Eggers, and that ilk, I think I'll stick with just calling it the worst sci fi has ever produced. Granted, I am not one who has read all the depth of sci fi offerings, but I've read enough to know that this so far undershoots the rest that by mere extrapolation it would be a titanic achievement for another author to do worse. Yes, there are the sword and sorcerer riff-raff, the cyber-punk crapola, and the remanent dross of the Golden and Silver Ages of sci fi still hanging around, and even those who've produced masterpieces, such as Richard Matheson and Ursula LeGuin, have been known to write horrorshow books in terms of quality, but this dystopian novel by Wallace is worse than them all. His book, only a decade old, is more outdated than many Golden and Silver Age sci fi books specifically because of his slang's sounding as relevant as John Dryden's courtly verse....The novel clocks in at 981 pages, with over a hundred pages of notes that serve no purpose, reference nothing in the book, which is footnoted, and are filled with nonsense and faux information, with a small dab of the real tossed in. This is the T.S. Eliot Effect. At least, now I know where Dave Eggers ripped off his garbage that ends his wretched A Heartbreaking Work Of Staggering Genius. By that rationale, one might say Eggers novel-cum-autobiography is worse than Wallace's tome, until one gets to the fact that Wallace's monstrosity is about two and a half times as long, considering it's larger page format and smaller type. Let's see; Eggers' crap is how many pages, to Wallace's? Do the math and times-  Oh, well, I guess that equation was unnecessary- sort of like this book blurbs on the book's cover claim its descent from Finnegans Wake by James Joyce, but while that book is poseur crap, as well, there is, at least a love of wordplay, poesy, alliteration, and plot machinations, despite its ill construction. Infinite Jest lacks even these few meager pluses. In short, if Finnegans Wake was a rancid fart that was proudly left to rip, Infinite Jest is a weak one, lacking sound and odor....It's not that Infinite Jest does not obey traditional norms, it's just that it disobeys them poorly, and offers no alternatives of quality. Apologists will say that `Those who think it's bad writing simply do not get it.' Wrong, it's gotten, very easily, and seen through quite well, as most poseur crap is. It's just that what's there is not worth the getting. Infinite Jest, in that sense, is a very easy read, almost as light and gay as Victor Hugo's Les Miserables, which is even longer. And while that classic is not a great book, it's a damned sight better, as well as more narratively daring than this book. A thousand page shrug of the shoulder simply is not `innovation', but sloth. The fact is that all I have read of the book's provenance suggests its legendry is true, that Wallace turned in over three thousand pages worth of spew, got an editor to whittle it down to two thousand pages for a first draft, and then to just under a thousand it stands at. But, other than cutting, what exactly did Wallace's editor do? Yet, all Wallace worried over, in his final draft, and proofs, supposedly, was not the tale, but the typos. Quoth the dude: `There were about 712,000 typos, and I freaked.' Gee willikers, Davey! I guess his editor couldn't even accomplish a professional proofreading.<br />  Even the book's worst (or best) apologists cannot excuse the book's ending, which simply ends, and not circularly like Finnegans Wake. It just ends, after having devolved from a pointless and vacuous dystopian novel to a collection of disjunct pseudo-intellectual preenings. But,what's worse? Such preenings, or the vapid characterizations that go nowhere? Wallace simply is not a good writer- from the level of image-making, to sentence construction, to overall narrative arcs. His logorrhetic writing is banal and sterile on all levels. In short, he fails fractally. Yet, he remains an ink blot for talentless hipoisie wannabe writers to measure themselves against. They ask, `I know I can write a bunch of crap as badly as this, so why can't I be the next big thing?' And they're right. Wallace represents not even style over substance, but mere hype. The book's language does nothing, except raise solipsism and shaggy dog stories to an art- maybe....unless the whole book is a hoax. But that would mean that there are plenty of hoaxers out there, and even more gullible fools willing to finance the hoaxes upon themselves....He and this book are simply silly, and a waste of pulp. Worse, he utterly disdains readers and their intelligence, and wasted seven hours of my life. Time will bury him and his ilk- the dirt's already flying, but let me add to it.

There are already so many good and long reviews here that I can't really imagine reading them all before putting my two cents in. However, some of the top reviews got me thinking about my reactions to this book, and I've decided to add them (perhaps in the hope that it will reward me with some general sense of loyalty to an author I have come to closely identify myself with).    To understand Infinite Jest, you have to understand David Foster Wallace. I personally have read and enjoyed to different degrees everything he has written, but for those only interested in getting a better grasp on Infinite Jest, I suggest purchasing and reading \\""A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again.\\"" In that collection of stories and essays, you will find a sort-of \\""behind-the-scenes\\"" look at some of the places where Infinite Jest came from. For instance, the character of James Incandenza can clearly be seen as influenced by real-life director David Lynch, whom Wallace met while writing a portrait piece on Lynch and visiting the set of \\""Lost Highway.\\"" Actually, I suspect the seeds of at least one other character may have grown from that assignment; needless to say, Wallace's own discussion of Lynch's movies and their influence on him speaks volumes not only about what Infinite Jest is really about, but also how important his visit to one of Lynch's movie sets must have been to him.    The essay in \\""A Supposedly Fun Thing...\\"" about television, though heady, also gives a good bit of insight into the mind of the man behind Infinite Jest. As does the essay about his childhood experiences playing tennis. But the key essay for figuring out Wallace's intentions with Infinite Jest is also probably the driest bit of text yet published under his name. Wallace's essay about post-modern writing gives a real sense of who he is as a writer, and what his feelings are about telling a story.    Wallace went to school as a creative writer in the lates 80's. He read a lot of contemporary fiction, and around that time, guys like John Barth and Thomas Pynchon were icons of post-modern fiction. And just as Wallace was exiting the university and entering the fray of American publishing, a new \\""style\\"" of fiction had been born. It was called \\""meta-fiction.\\""     The tagline for meta-fiction was: it's fiction about fiction. Whatever that is supposed to mean, Wallace was probably thinking about it when he started to conceive of the idea behind Infinite Jest. In some sense, Infinite Jest could be described as a story about telling stories. People telling their \\""stories\\"" at AA meetings. Hal reliving a childhood memory over the phone with Orin. Mario telling the story of the forming of O.N.A.N. as a puppet show.    But at it's heart, there is one clear thing that Infinite Jest most certainly is: it is a joke. The title is \\""Infinite JEST\\""! The point behind the book is to play an elaborate joke on the reader. Not a mean-spirited joke; just a joke.    But this isn't a shaggy-dog story. This isn't just wandering prose with no endpoint. The whole point of Infinite Jest is that it DOES come to a conclusion, you just never get to know how it got there. Wallace tells you that something tragic has happened to Hal, but he doesn't tell you what. And he gives you options for what might have happened, but he wants the reader to forever be wondering: what really messed this kid up?    It might be worthwhile to think about what one of the book's sources is. The title is drawn from a line in Hamlet, but the play's influence on the book doesn't end there. The James Incandenza character appears as a ghost near the end of the story, just as the king did in Hamlet. Although Incandenza appears before Don Gately, rather than Hal, which might suggest who the real hero is supposed to be. And the relationship between Hal's mother and her half-brother mimics the marriage of Claudius and Gertrude.Just as Hamlet devolves into madness following his father's murder, Hal's own descent into uncontrollable facial spasms can be seen near the end of IJ. As people remark about the weird expressions he is making, we're left wondering if Hal is actually going insane, or just losing control of his body. The plot of Hamlet seems to deal with one young spoiled man's inability to cope with the tragedy foisted upon him when his father is killed. Infinite Jest deals with some of these same issues.    Which goes back to the idea that this is all supposed to be fiction about fiction. Wallace's book is one big arch-joke on the reader. But the idea isn't to frustrate or upset the people who've spent months reading the book. The idea is to get them to question what they are really looking for in entertainment.     Do we really want to know who shot JFK? I've read Infinite Jest four or five times, and I would be very disappointed if Wallace ever came out with some coda telling us what really happened to Hal. I don't want to know. In his article about Lynch, Wallace talks about how disappointing Twin Peaks became after we found out who killed Laura Palmer. Why do we want the mystery revealed?    That's the beauty of Infinite Jest. The story goes on forever. I can keep going back and re-reading the story, because there is so much in there to rediscover, and so many different scenarios to postulate on that may get me to the same conclusion: that university bathroom in Arizona.",2008-06-20

Perhaps (particularly the 100 pages of footnotes), but that's what makes it so fun.  So what's so good about it?  Let me put it to you this way - once I finished reading it two days ago, I honestly feel like I have just come off an intellectual acid trip that has made me look at the world,  addiction, our collective need to find contentment, what a novel can do, and tennis in a whole new, enlightened way.

Wallace's giant masterpiece has already become a modern pop culture reference with people referring to it on television and other books as something to grapple over in terms of whether or not to read it or leave it on your bookshelf. I myself had left my copy on my shelf for over a year, wondering whether or not I wanted to brave the 1000 page book. I finally decided to read it after tackling Rushdie's \\""Satanic Verses,\\"" a book that was sort of disappointing. Regardless, after hearing what everyone else had to say about this book, I knew I had to start my year crossing off one of the many books I had to read before I died. \\""Infinite Jest\\"" did not disappoint. Wallace's prose is dazzling and is so detailed that this is not the kind of book you can skim through on the subway to have a full appreciation of the genius behind the sentences and the book as a whole. The levels and intricacies of the characters he has created is astounding - I know, I'm using quite a few superlatives, but there is nothing I can do - and this book is one of the best attempts at the \\""grand oeuvre\\"" I have seen in a long time. The Incandenza family is a warped, post-modern collection of dysfunctional people whose lives once intersected, but have quickly diverged. My own favorite storyline, the one I found myself hoping to read between all of the different ones going on, was that of Hal, the gifted, drug-dependent tennis player trying to figure out his life. As a former junior tennis player, I must say that Wallace has provided a very clear picture of life as a tennis player, albeit one that involves a lot of drugs and weird occurences such as a kid who has his forehead stuck to a window and loses half his face trying to get it off.  <br /> <br />The main reason why I did not give this 5 stars is because trying to ingest everything that goes on and all of the minutiae that is present for no reason is hard to stomach for 1000 pages. It's just not necessary and not the kind of book that you enjoy in the same way as something more story-oriented. You don't get the same type of narrative satisfaction here that you would find in a Dickens or even McEwan novel.

Try as I might to make a case for the profundity of art that it produced, I must conclude, in retrospect that I was right from the beginning.  They are in fact, derivative, with slight improvements, sometimes, along the edges, and, in many casse, a debased 9th generation mimeograph.<br /><br />Take Infinite Jest.  The style is Pynchon.  And by style, I mean, an exact duplication.  No change whatsoever.  Oh yeah, they drugs are different.  I guess (and here I imagine I guess right) that if you're the sort who likes Breaking Bad mainly because it puts drugs into mainstream TV drama, then you will root for Infinite Jest.  And of course, Pynchon made his drug references, but they were like \\""my Dad's drugs\\"".

There are word plays, many witty sayings, and funny situations. When sometime narrator seventeen-year-old Hal Incandenza becomes afraid that his marijuana smoking is beginning to create problems in his life, he goes to a halfway house for information on Narcotics Anonymous. However, the clerk there just sees him as a nervous kid and refers him instead a a Robert Bly-type men’s meeting, so young Hal ends up being spooked by a bunch of grown men crying and revealing secrets.<br /><br />The novel devotes pages to Alcoholics Anonymous and other twelve-step programs. Such programs help some characters in the novel to get their lives together. But the programs do not help everyone. What if, like Hal, you are too detached or you simply do not believe?<br /><br />Infinite Jest is serious. Its most intense and moving parts are its descriptions of depression. Some are positively scary. Characters struggling with melancholia are not uncommon in literature, but I can only think of two other works that compare to Infinite Jest in effectively presenting what it is like to be depressed: The Bell Jar and Hamlet.  Wallace gets it.<br /><br />Infinite Jest is ultimately about escape and entertainment. Its title comes from a line in Hamlet, but, in the novel, Infinite Jest is a film that people cannot stop watching - they watch it without even eating or drinking until they die. Is there really such a thing as an infinite jest? An amusement so great, so entertaining, that it does not stop or cannot be measured?<br /><br />The novel details the backstories of many of the characters. Some of these are horrible, involving abuse, abandonment. Others seem clinically perfect, parents following the latest upper-class psychological techniques for child-rearing. But it seems like the teleputers (upgraded televisions) and the drugs (including alcohol) seduce nearly all of them. We all have the Old Adam we need to overcome.<br /><br />For recreational times, the kids at a tennis academy in the story play a strategy game on their tennis courts called Eschaton.  The word eschaton means “end of history.” Is that where we are headed? Vonnegut had his ice-nine. Wallace has the Infinite Jest film. Which is more likely scenario?<br /><br />Is there any hope for humanity? Will we all end up, in the words of Neil Postman, amusing ourselves to death?  Will any of us grow up and come to our senses?<br /><br />Because of the drug use, extreme situations, odd characterizations, and emphasis on bodily functions, Wallace has been compared to Thomas Pynchon.  I can see why, but those are more superficial features. Wallace is not as indifferent or detached as Pynchon. As I was reading Infinite Jest, I kept thinking of Neal Stephenson. His stories are clever and entertaining and may have some extreme behavior, but like Infinite Jest, there is a science fiction element involving futuristic technology. Stephenson actually has contributed an introduction to one of Wallace’s nonfiction works.<br /><br />Infinite Jest is not for everyone. It has strong language. It is full of drug and alcohol abuse. It has weird violence and creepy sex. But what it does, it does extremely well. Eliot said about Hamlet, “Of all the plays it is the longest and is possibly the one on which Shakespeare spent the most pains.”<br /><br />One could say the same thing about David Foster Wallace and Infinite Jest. Wallace bleeds on the pages. It is funny.  It is scary. Even if it is not humane, it is intensely human.",2015-01-06

But once you get past the first 200 pages or so, things start to fall into place and it becomes enjoyable.<br />There are some delightful little observations of the human condition, and the insight into drug addiction, clinical depression and training children to become professional athletes are fascinating. The 'science fiction' is awkwardly bad. The characters are impressively well-depicted, nuanced and real. Some chapters don't really go anywhere or worse, parade unnecessary exposition in an obvious manner (honestly, just skip Mario's puppet movie screening chapter). Wallace writes the occasional page-long run-on sentence.<br />I'm not finished, but I'm close and it certainly feels like it's building towards something.

This time around with nearly two decades more of living and reading accrued I both succeeded and failed. I will explain that claim momentarily.<br /><br />The novel was included by Time magazine in its list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923. By most accounts the book has sold approximately two hundred and fifty thousand copies. It continues to invite commentary and creative tributes. Jenni B. Baker, Editor of The Found Poetry Review, started a project in 2013 called Erasing Infinite that produces erasure poetry page by page from Infinite Jest. In 2009, a challenge was thrown out to people to read the novel over the summer. A blog was dedicated to this action that is still current with observations, insights and interpretations of Foster Wallace's work. One can easily find numerous other essays, wikis, blogs, testimonials and homages (the author once made an appearance in animated form on The Simpsons).<br /><br />Dave Eggers wrote the Foreward in the edition I waded through. He and authors such as Jonathan Franzen are said to have been influenced by Foster Wallace. Eggers honestly and beautifully introduces the original complexity that is Infinite Jest. It presents the debate that continues regarding fiction, namely, should it be easy to read and popular (think James Patterson) or \\""challenging, generally and thematically, and even on a sentence-by-sentence basis\\"". Eggers goes onto explain that it took him four weeks to read Infinite Jest suggesting that it is both daunting and worth savoring. On its originality he compares it to \\""a spaceship with no recognizable components, no rivets or bolts, no entry points, no way to take it apart.\\""<br /><br />Infinite Jest has been called an encyclopedic novel with three hundred and eighty eight endnotes. Those endnotes signal an amazing attention to detail and a curious insecurity at the same time. By no means is this an easy read but it can be a rewarding one. Just be warned that he employs a variety writing modes and voices that can trip you up and frustrate. Thrown about is dense jargon and often invented vocabulary from the tennis world, pharmaceuticals and geo-politics. Abbreviations and acronyms, long multi-clause sentences, and explanatory footnotes and endnotes make it resemble either a brilliant college student's paper or a troubling diary found on a homeless person.<br /><br />Without a doubt the semi-satiric future North America he creates is astounding. The United States, Canada, and Mexico together compose a unified North American superstate known as the Organization of North American Nations, or O.N.A.N. Many reviews refer to the novel as a screwball comedy but I found it much, much darker. Certainly there are funny bits throughout including the fact that corporations are allowed the opportunity to bid for and purchase naming rights for each calendar year for tax revenue. This is a tremendous foreshadowing of the extent of brand sponsorship we now experience. The years of Subsidized Time (and structure given to the novel) are:<br /><br />Year of the Whopper<br />Year of the Tucks Medicated Pad<br />Year of the Trial-Size Dove Bar<br />Year of the Perdue Wonderchicken<br />Year of the Whisper-Quiet Maytag Dishmaster<br />Year of the Yushityu 2007 Mimetic-Resolution-Cartridge-View-Motherboard-Easy-To-Install-Upgrade For Infernatron/InterLace TP Systems For Home, Office Or Mobile<br />Year of Dairy Products from the American Heartland<br />Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment<br />Year of Glad<br /><br />The action largely involves a junior tennis academy and a nearby substance-abuse recovery center. Both settings are drawn from Foster Wallace's own life. He was a regionally ranked junior tennis player and one who suffered from depression for most of his life. That depression necessitated the use of medication.<br /><br />The plot is outlandish. It involves a lost film that causes those who watch it to want nothing but to watch it continually until they die. Even more wild is the introduction of Quebec separatists who want the film for terrorism purposes. As a resident of Quebec who has been treated to the laughable (but very concerning) parochial, xenophobic and illogical arguments thrown up by the beautiful province's social and intellectual luddites, I must admit this aspect was a treat.<br /><br />Yet, I wondered how Foster Wallace thought to integrate French separatists into the novel. Was it because he actually considered them a joke or was it something else? I will never be sure but the inclusion of the Bloc Quebecois, PQ, FLQ and the wonderfully pathetic and fictional wheelchair-bound Quebecois secessionists he names Les Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents was fun stuff. He riddles the latter with bizarre cultural practices and hockey-team hazing rituals that reach dangerous levels. Along for the ride is a pan-Canadian Resistance who fight an insurgency against the union and for added measure there are Albertan ultra-rightists including the Calgarian Pro-Canadian Phalanx.<br /><br />But this is all secondary to Wallace's endless skewering, ruminations and speculations on addiction, corporate power, entertainment, art, and tennis (somehow in 1996 he predicted the rise of Venus Williams who plays a very minor role). In a 2008 retrospective by The New York Times, Infinite Jest was described as \\""a masterpiece that's also a monster -- nearly 1,100 pages of mind-blowing inventiveness and disarming sweetness. Its size and complexity make it forbidding and esoteric.\\"" That is all very well and good but as I teased at the outset, I both succeeded and failed at reading it. I got through it, contemplated the content and so far have concluded that either this is one big choppy mess or perhaps buried throughout is the secret of life.

I figured I'd re-read it and not have to deal with the massive physical version. Earlier this month I started to read the K version and found problems, especially with the pop up notes. However,  that version had page numbers and x-ray. Then I managed to call up an updated version. This new version no longer has page numbers and x-ray, but the pop up notes are clear and also give you access to the proper note in the notes section at the end of the book.<br /><br />However, one very important note is 110. At least as it appears in my updated version's pop up, it is quite short and has an error message in the middle. I couldn't figure whether that was part of Wallace's note or a real error. When I checked the actual note at the end of the book, I found it to be a genuine error. The actual note is 18 pages long and a full, set piece. Anybody who accepted the pop up would have missed in effect a complete sub-chapter of the book. So if you find an error message in a note, go to the actual note at the end.<br /><br />Also, for some reason, this version will not hold notes and highlights--at least on my Paperwhite 2. I usually read in airplane mode. It seems that when I switch airplane off, I lose my notes etc. on this one title. Weird.<br /><br />Anyway...it's a brilliant novel, but I wish the updated Kindle edition had page numbers and x-ray and didn't have that unfortunate error in pop up note 110.",2014-07-16

It's crazy long, it's crazy over-the-top in ways you might not even notice at first, and the first chapter grabs you in a way the rest of the book never bothers to follow through with. I was recommended this book in 2011, after graduating from college and having to end a friendship desperately near to my heart. I was largely broken at the time, having just barely survived my undergraduate experience and earning myself a social sciences degree that left little to the imagination in terms of sheer unemployment potential. I was down on life and went to the bookstore in search of something that would challenge me. This and Pynchon were recommended; I almost immediately had a distasteful reaction to what of Gravity's Rainbow I picked up; no matter how many times I tried reading passages and segments I just wasn't sold. I picked up this tome which the employee was much more hesitant about recommending, and read the first page, then the first two, then the first chapter. The ending of that left me so floored I purchased the book outright.<br /><br />As I've said, the rest of the book doesn't really follow this setting of expectations. The plot is largely nonexistent, and it's more about the book's lack of plot wherein the plot truly resides. This book is an accomplishment to finish; you'll have two bookmarks and feel like a scholar every time you read some of it. For me, therein lay part of the initial attraction. I was tired of books being simple, boring stories that were wrapped up neatly or sequelized simply at their end. I didn't even know this at the time, and it was perhaps this book that taught me this most of all -- and it has left me sadly wanting ever since. I'm rereading it now, three years later, and without days occupied only by food, this book, and trips to the gym, it will take you a long time. It won't fulfill you the same way a pulpy bit of fiction will. It will make you think. It will make you bored, and it will excite you. But more than either of these things, the strength of this book to me lies in its sheer sensitivity, and its penetrating insights into human behavior, and deep characterization, characterization that only time spent with a character can provide.<br /><br />As someone on Slate's book club said, this is very much a book that a man would write. I consider myself extremely sensitive, almost a feminine individual, who looks deeply into human behavior and has a long history with depression. I dislike arrogance; I value humbleness. And though many people tell me again and again that Infinite Jest is a tome of veritable unbounded arrogance, a masterwork of someone craving attention and respect, I completely disagree. Infinite Jest is a sensitive look from behind the eyes of an author with some deep concerns about human behavior, perhaps even fears. I think this book is quite emotional, but it isn't emotional in a way that will make you cry, it is deeply analytical, almost overwhelmingly so, and the wordplay is so utterly fascinating it defies any explanation. Some parts of this book would be construed as poor writing from any other author, or if they weren't surrounded by such brilliant prose.<br /><br />Really, the best way to find out for yourself is to try a sample chapter (kindle this one, it's just huge in print and the hyperlinks are well implemented on the ebook edition). The first chapter may end more intriguingly than others in the book, but its quantity of words and weightiness should give a good idea as to whether or not you'll like his writing.<br /><br />This book also made me profoundly sensitive to issues of alcoholism, and addiction in general. Wallace covers them with the mind of someone far too familiar for his own good.But more than either of these things, the strength of this book to me lies in its sheer sensitivity, and its penetrating insights into human behavior, and deep characterization, characterization that only time spent with a character can provide.<br /><br />As someone on Slate's book club said, this is very much a book that a man would write.

I am inclined to agree strongly. You are very unlikely to hate Wallace if you like Pynchon.

I've avoided this book for about six years but finally decided to tackle it a few months ago to christen my newly received Kindle. I feel overwhelmingly proud to have finished it. The challenge revolved mainly around my seemingly poor memory as this novel is unlike any other novel. Immediately, I was faced with the problem of my own meager mind. Soon, however, after a few frustrated hours and tedious days, my mind started adapting to the strenuous pace, incongruity of this, obvious, genius' writing.<br /><br />So, I say with grave caution that this is not a book for just anyone. This is a book for those who desire to challenge one's self, one's mind, one's outlook and bored monotony. I do not recommend this to everyone, but I do wish that everyone would read it. I've read many reviews of the book from when it was first published and am disheartened that some would find it so obscure as to hate it; others loved it, however. I love it. I love its obscurity. The book, in its sheer length, forces you to work hard for whatever it is that you will take away from it. DFW gives you nothing. He makes you pay with your mind and your time for even the seemingly smallest reward, which is to say that there are no small rewards in this book; they are all monumental but only to those who want them.<br /><br />I had a wonderful ten weeks with this beautiful monster, and I cannot wait until I read it again. I have already begun to peruse my highlights and reread areas that I try to remember but that have gone fuzzy. I apologize if this review is not very helpful in the sense that I do not want to talk about its content. However, I would highly recommend this book to everyone, even though, as previously stated, this book was not written for everyone.<br /><br />Nevertheless, DFW did write in various levels of accessibility. So, if you find thatyou would like to read this book but are unsure if you're 'capable' of it (which you are by the way), perhaps first read his collections of non-fiction essays (Consider the Lobster, and A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again, to name two), in order to familiarize yourself with his writing.

The topic of the book is ostensibly a future dystopian fantasy, but it really is a book about, and of, addiction,uncontrolled mental thrall to one's own undisciplined and despairing spirit.  The intense, prolix focus on scatology, violence, gore and anxiety made me feel like I was a car-pool mother, trapped into driving a bunch of under-age, over-smart adolescents on a lo-o-o-ong car ride and having to listen to their jejeune philosophizing from the back seat. As a piece of craftsmanship, it also is terrible: foreshadowings of events that never occur, plot lines developed and never resolved or even addressed, lengthy dramatis personae of undeveloped characters who fill out a roster of grotesques with little differentiation.

Work that is in the end worth it, but work nonetheless. You will contend with deep, deep characterization. You will fight with hundreds of end notes. You will have to sift through some of the darkest American humor there is. And in the end, you may not be able to connect all of the dots. At first. This book is not reserved only for the genius set, the lit majors, or lit professors. It is an American tale.<br /><br />Wallace is (was) an artist. Every word counts, every sentence crafted for its purpose. Think of the Modernists of the 20's. The simple detail wasn't simple, it pointed to something. The diction that generated ambiguity in a phrase was intended. The reader often had to decide if the criticism was directed to or at the reader. Here too, just across 1200 pages.<br /><br />Everyone will recognize that guy or that girl, the fringe American character Wallace describes so well. The social commentary and criticism is very accessible. I'm old enough to get a lot of the allusions. I even lived in Inman Square for a very short spell (which was surreal when I arrived at that part of the narrative). But the full story arc didn't click at first. I knew that all of the lines had been drawn, but somehow I didn't see them all. The I reread the first chapter and a had something of a cascade effect in terms of connecting previously unconnected dots. Seriously, the devil is in the details in this book. And there are a lot of details that my simple mind has difficulty holding in store for long periods.

Could have achieved his (Wallace's) purpose in much less and still have been impactful.  How?  Start with verbosity.  Although I did admire his extensive vocabulary,  he (Wallace) was long on verbose.  The Foreword says the author didn't want you going to the dictionary every few pages.  Well, I did (go to the dictionary) every few pages only to find many of his (the author's) words missing.  I guess the dictionary needs to consult Wallace for further inclusions.  And pretentious?  The footnoting is pretentious.  If it's that important (the information in the footnotes), include it in the body (of the novel).  Many times it was just to show off knowledge (Wallace's) of drug compounds or cinematic equipment.  Was it (the knowledge) correct?  Who cares-does it matter?  I felt the style (of the novel) did bear a resemblance (philosophically speaking) with stream of consciousness writings and the variations of grammatical structure that occurred around the beginning of the last century.<br /><br />Half way through I wanted to quit.  That would put the author (Wallace) on par (in my opinion) with James Joyce, whose &#34;Ulysses&#34; I didn't finish (and the only novel I never finished) because I finally just didn't care what was going through people's minds (in &#34;Ulysses&#34;).  For Wallace's novel, I felt he was gratuitously violent & voyeuristically prurient in his (Wallace's) deviant & nauseating detail.  Halfway (through the novel) when I was ready to quit, I even allowed the idea (in my head) of skipping to the end to double check that my version of what I thought the ending would be was the version Wallace chose.  Ha! Ha! Ha! There was no ending (to the story lines).  (And no, I didn't skip to the end to find that out.  I read all 1079 pages!)  Although the novel was overall entertaining (at times humorous, depressing, & illuminating), the major disappointment (for me) was that he didn't finish the stories.  He (Wallace) left you hanging (not literally).  Is that what the author means by he (the author) wants to entertain you?  Or is it just the infinite jest?<br />Please note the lack of footnoting.

It is a long novel but I didn't think it was particularly dense or challenging.

From my perspective, Foster Wallace is not the kind of writer who will be remembered for his future vision. Much of the world he imagines is laughably dated even down to his incessant brand name checking. As a 90's artifact, it might appeal to the nostalgic but I never felt like he illuminated anything lasting for me.<br /><br />As a final point, I would note that this book contains the most cringe worthy attempt to capture the black American vernacular by a white author since James Bond eavesdropped in a Harlem speakeasy.  The  &#34;Wardine be cry&#34; section is so awful and stilted that even though the book is almost two decades old, it is hard to believe that any editor let it be published with that passage intact.

Incandenza created the film Infinite Jest, a.k.a. “the Entertainment,” so addictive that anyone watching it couldn’t take her eyes off it and eventually dies from lack of food and water. Les Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents (A.F.R.), or the Wheelchair Assassins, a Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois separatist group seeking to have Canada secede from the Organization of North American Nations (O.N.A.N.), searches for the master copy and intends to distribute copies and use the film as a weapon of mass destruction. David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest is a satire about our contemporary culture. Specifically, addiction. And not only to entertainment, i.e. the film Infinite Jest. The novel depicts the addicts in The Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House trying, or not trying, to recover from cannabis, cocaine, Demerol and other drugs. And in nearby Enfield Tennis Academy, many students are on drugs. Wallace’s writing is humorous, but beneath the events, sadness flows.<br /><br />While thinking about the power of entertainment in our culture, I recall Neil Postman’s Amusing Ourselves to Death, where he describes how TV, and more generally, visual entertainment, has transformed the way we think and process information. Whereas reading requires us to process the words and sentences and to imagine the scenes, we can “absorb” the information much quicker when we view a picture or watch a video. But just as taking too much easily digestible sugar rather than complex carbohydrates isn’t good for the body, watching too much TV may be harmful to the mind, from not exercising the muscles in the brain. We have the Internet and we don’t lack information, but what’s more important than information is the ability to analyze data, qualitatively and quantitatively, and to imagine new ideas and possibilities.",2013-11-05

Infinite Jest is an extraordinary book, but it is difficult and you do have to want it.<br /><br />Catch-22 and Brave New World seem to have influenced Wallace in writing this book. There are tons of characters and the point of view changes at the drop of a hat. This is not a book to be read casually. I read every night before I go to bed but this book requires both concentration and dedication, do not try to read this after you've had a few drinks, you'll probably get lost and crash somewhere in the desert. (If you're lucky you'll get to talk to a cross-dressing spy.)<br /><br />There are points where Wallace gets a little Ayn Rand-ish. He goes off on long tangents (usually about tennis) that don't hold a lot of substance for the story, but I think that if you focus on it, it's easy enough to comprehend and there were only a few times I found myself bored.<br /><br />Despite all of my dread warnings, I really did enjoy this book. It delves into the meaning of entertainment, addiction, and possibly where the two intersect. This is a fantastic book, but it's not for everyone. Most of the story takes place between an elite private tennis academy and a halfway house that share the same name in 'near-future' Boston. Part of what makes this book difficult are copious undefined acronyms - intentionally undefined acronyms, most of them are resolved by the latter third of the book, but trying to work out what exactly they mean both engages the reader and is kind of fun.<br /><br />Published in 1998, Wallace managed to predict the rise of the internet in the life of a modern American, the War on Terror, and the continuation of vapid consumerism in our culture. It is incredibly relevant today.<br /><br /> \\""In a 2008 retrospective by The New York Times, Infinite Jest was described as \\""a masterpiece that's also a monster -- nearly 1,100 pages of mind-blowing inventiveness and disarming sweetness. Its size and complexity make it forbidding and esoteric.\\""<br /><br />This book made me fall in love with David Foster Wallace, but after reading it you have to decompress.

I'm just not sure that his particular brand of genius was suited to fiction. As the critic James Wood has pointed out, Infinite Jest is all about information not character. If a novel informs me that's great, but I also want to be impassioned by it in some way - if I merely wanted to be informed I'd read a non-fiction book. Admittedly these are personal preferences, but I would argue that IJ's mix of literary realism, satire and science fiction fails in its own terms. While some of its observations about information technology, for example, are prescient, the talk of \\""cartridges\\"" and \\""CD Roms\\"" just sounds silly in a novel supposedly set in the 21st century. What made me give up reading around page 250, however, was a passing reference to the way that US veterans hospitals had emptied due to the persistent lack of wars since Vietnam. At its best, science fiction is visionary and strange - IJ, though undoubtedly extraordinary in its own way, is just too specific and topical, and as a result feels dated in a way that those paired 20th century classics Brave New World and 1984 do not.",2013-05-11

There are sections I skip over because they're just too tedious, and wave their arms too wildly to signal \\""major and serious work of literature over here\\"": Marathe/Steeply, the history of ONAN, JOI's filmography & death, Madame Psychosis, the long explanation of Interlace.  AO Scott said there's a lot about the book which smacks of a precocious child being called upon to perform at dinner, and I agree to a certain extent.  So, perhaps 10% misses the mark-- is too much, not accurate satire, not worth my time.<br /><br />What he does best in the book is to describe, sympathetically and in great detail, the characters' self-involvement: their inability to get outside of their ravenous heads or to feel for other people except through guilt, shame, loathing.  This goes from the beginning (Ken Erdedy) to the end (Gately hitting bottom).  Isolation is more of a theme than the (showy) achievement-and-addiction-are-two-sides-of-the-same-hill notion which links the two worlds depicted.  There are moving sections where people talk to *themselves,* or about themselves in recovery meetings, but not where they talk to each other.<br /><br />DFW had his own number, and maybe yours too.",2012-09-29

Infinite Jest is a double head fake -- a private joke whose reception probably turned out to be a much needed source of amusement for DFW during the last quarter of his life. Needless to say, it would also explain the title.<br />--<br />Reading Infinite Jest is a bit like plowing through piles and piles of manure, looking for the occasional flashes of brilliance. As it turns out, Wallace distributes enough of them in the first half to make you last until the end -- just about (assuming you read quickly).<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong. There is more than enough evidence in this book that Wallace was truly one of a kind when it came to observing and understanding certain aspects of human nature. Unfortunately, the raw, intense method he chose to communicate this understanding doesn't quite work. Sometimes, it's perfect; other times, you find yourself thinking that he's trying to stick to the same style just for the sake of it, squeezing a round peg through a square hole, and failing to communicate unique insights and ideas that frankly deserved way better.<br /><br />My best guess is that the book is a double parody, and that most of the world's 'artistic elites' never got beyond round one. So they accept Infinite Jest, praising it as a unique portrait of our addicted, consuming society, written in a never-seen-before style -- all that whilst being completely oblivious to the similarities with a story about an emperor who had no clothes. Then, seeing that everyone else likes it, others join in, and soon enough, the world's wannabee intellectuals pile in, followed by the mass market.<br /><br />Some patiently suffer through the book for the reward of saying they've read it. Others take this ridiculous adventure even further, writing notes and trying to analyse the text, fighting through every page, re-reading the entire volume multiple times, and defining themselves by their admiration of it. Somehow, they manage to ignore the irony of getting addicted to a book about addiction.<br /><br />I have never read any of the author's other novels or essays. Many speak highly of them, but since the same people also speak highly of this book, I remain cautious. Yet, given DFW's understanding of pain and depression that clearly shines through here, one has to give him the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />I struggle to accept, however, that someone with his intellect couldn't take the 30 pages of brilliance scattered through Infinite Jest, drop the 970 pages of utterly pointless, boring drivel, and turn it into a concise, entertaining and enlightening novel that could have reached a broader audience, and touched it more profoundly.<br /><br />By Occam's Razor, then, DFW must have wanted to make a point -- for, as unlikely as this explanation may seem, all the alternatives seem even less probable. What point, though?<br /><br />I have no idea, but hope it was something deeper than an attempt to amuse himself by watching the spectacle that ensued, since, albeit presumably quite amusing, it has been an expensive one..<br /><br />..for someone who understood the value of human freedom and happiness so deeply as Wallace, to have purposefully wasted millions of hours that humanity won't ever get back would be..truly sad.",2012-05-21

There were subtexts, clues, and jokes that I undoubtedly missed.<br /><br />But wow.<br /><br />David Foster Wallace wrote an epic -- a novel that no one else could have ever written.  Unlike many works, it is so abundantly clear that Wallace put *everything* into this novel.  And what a novel it is.<br /><br />So what is it about?  Well, there is a lot going on, but the underlying theme of all the various stories (really, three independent threads that finally sort of come together at the end) is addiction, desperation, and dissatisfaction.  The first story, probably the main story (especially early on) involves the Incandenza family, specifically Hal Incandenza, a rising start at Enfield Tennis Academy, and his rapidly increasing use (and addiction) to marijuana.  Mirroring this story is the story of Don Gately, a mostly-recovered addict who works at a drugs/alcohol recovery house.  And the third story is a search by would-be terrorists for a video-tape that causes the viewer to stop everything they do and become -- yep, you guessed it -- addicted to watching the tape.<br /><br />It is bizarre.  But it is rewarding.<br /><br />A note regarding the Kindle version: I cannot imagine reading it any other way.  The text of the actual hard copy is quite small, the book is gargantuan, and the numerous (300+) footnotes are actually endnotes, requiring constant flipping back and forth.  While it is occasionally inconvenient to click the notes with the Kindle, it is much easier than flipping.  I encountered occasional little glitches with the Kindle version (what appeared to be very minor typos), but overall I think that the Kindle version is the way to go -- highly recommended.",2012-02-06

The plot seemed so amorphous, the characters too psychologically parsimonious...and the title seemed like it was mocking me.  \\""Infinite Jest.\\""  Big joke.  Unfortunately, it seemed like the joke was on me.  It was Wallace's stylistic abilities that kept me going.  This man can write a chapter about a little handicapped girl getting raped and make me laugh...physically laugh...out loud while reading it.  He can make me care about a 29 year old ex-Demerol-and-Percocet junkie who has murdered several people.  Reading David Foster Wallace feels like a sociological murder mystery.  The experience is akin to, say, a citizen of Soviet Russia piecing through hundreds of survivor accounts of the Siberian gulags after a life of relative ideological comfort, and learning that something is profoundly wrong.  People called this book outrageously funny.  It is not funny.  It is sad.  It characterizes the forces that have shaped our society and our world.  It tells us that we are all addicted to something, and that the only way out is addiction to something marginally less harmful in the short term.  The plot does agglutinate into something more centralized after about 400 pages, but this man makes the silences more powerful than the words.  Much is left unexplained by the end of the book, but the good news is that Wallace is one of those rare authors who is better the second go around.

But it's so entertaining on so many levels that it's a relatively quick read.      Here are a few caveats and hopefully helpful hints:      1.  Don't skip the footnotes.  Some are merely definitional.  Many are short, but some are entire chapters.  Some are laugh-out-loud hilarious.  All are essential parts of the experience.    2.  I read the Kindle edition on my iPad, and found it perfectly suited for this book.  You get to the footnotes just by touching the footnote reference number.  You get to the footnotes' footnotes just by touching the footnote footnote reference letter.  And you get back to the text just by pressing \\""back to text\\"".  You can use the dictionary function to look up words (which you'll surely need) by touching the word, and then get back to the book by pressing \\""back\\"".  What could be easier?  With a book this heavy, trying to maneuver back and forth between text, footnotes, footnote footnotes, and dictionary would be exhausting.  You'd likely lose your place or miss something.  Also with a book this size, requiring so much flipping back and forth between text and footnotes and footnotes' footnotes, your arms may be so tired by the end of the book that you would not want to turn it over and start reading it again.  Barring physical exhaustion, you very well may want to do just that.         3.  If your spouse or significant other is a light sleeper, don't read IJ in bed.  Parts made me laugh out loud, and they usually were unexpected, coming, for example, at the end of a very long sentence, or at the beginning of a footnote.  My outbursts of laughter kept waking my wife, who tended to find the jokes not so funny when I read them to her, out of context and just as she was being yanked out of slumber.    4.  Unlike other lengthy novels to which IJ has been compared (e.g., Gravity's Rainbow), there is no need for a \\""companion\\"" book (other than a dictionary).  This book has many arcane references, but DWF almost always eventually explains them.      5.  Don't get discouraged by the seemingly disjointed beginning.  DFW is telling many stories, about many people and many things.  Let him introduce the characters and themes, and let him let you get to know them.  Eventually you'll start seeing the connections as he begins to weave the threads together.        6.  When you get to the Eschaton Game chapter, put the book down unless and until you have a good, solid chunk of uninterrupted time to devote to it.  You are not going to want to stop in the middle of that chapter.  It is just too entertaining.    7.  If you're a real stickler for grammar, IJ will infuriate you.

Here's a different viewpoint that may help you to understand and love this book as I do(apologies to anyone else who may have already pointed this out):    Infinite Jest is a beautiful novel while also a textbook for mental health disorders--the mood, anxiety, psychotic and other mental disorders--co-occurring with addictions.  However, if you're like me, you don't read straight through entire textbooks, even if they are written well.  But this book I read twice, and it was well worth it, enriching my world and leading to a much better understanding of fellow human beings.  The Co-occurring Disorders Textbook nature of this novel is evidenced by:    1) The narrative is disjointed, disorganized, with run-ons, rapid changes, and neologisms, often relying on the music of the language more than the content of the sentence to get the point across.  This sort of narrative, a chaotic mess with layers upon layers that often don't seem to go anywhere (i.e. footnotes of footnotes) is the kind of narrative a psychiatric interview will often uncover from someone who is psychotic or floridly manic.  This is also the narrative form of dysfunction, trauma, and abusive environments. (I don't know from novel structure--I'm a psychiatrist, not an English professor).        a) also, the setting is not in an alternate future...it is set in the 1990's, but a place that continues to have the fears of terrorism, environmental degradation, and possible global annihilation from nuclear weapons, warped by delusion.  Everything sounds real-enough to the narrator but very confusing to a reader who lives in the era of al-Qaeda, NATO, and OPEC.          b) the compression and expansion of time, concrete thinking and muddled metaphors, and a constant undercurrent of terror are common in psychosis.  And this novel is replete with terror.      2) Wallace includes: Major Depression, Anxiety, Mania, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Body Dysmorphic Disorder, Hypochondria, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Panic disorder, eating disorders, ADHD, sexual disorders, and multiple pathologic personality traits, including the antisocial personalities of many, if not most, of the characters.  He also includes sports psychology, the psychology of the gifted and talented, and characters with cognitive disorders.    3) Wallace describes nearly every sort of addiction and substance abuse known:  alcohol, prescription drugs, cocaine, opiates, designer drugs, hallucinogens, inhalants, TV, sex, gambling, and food.  His description of marijuana dependence and detox are the most beautifully written that I have ever seen.     This novel is a view from the inside of a much different mind--the reader can experience delusion, psychosis, and recovery while trying to make sense of events that seem both plausible and unreal at the same time.  Can't we empathize better with those who struggle with both addictions and mental illness if we can see it through their eyes and feel similar feelings?     One key joke in the book is told by a biker in recovery to Gately:  \\""This wise old whiskery fish swims up to three young fish and goes, `Morning, boys, how's the water?* and swims away; and the three young fish watch him swim away and look at each other and go, `What the f-- is water?' and swim away.\\""      *Note how often the color blue is present* or described when reading or re-reading this book.        *And enjoy the swim.",2010-08-27

I would have been happy enough with a shallow but amusing farce, but what surprised me was the depth you burrow into the psyches of the characters. The descriptions of AA meetings in particular are very effectively written. It's not as if you're there ... you're more than there ... you're inside the head of someone as each thought bubbles to the surface. What an amazing writer!    And lest you think Mr. Wallace abuses his talent for strictly high-brow dramatic purpose, there is plenty in the book to make you laugh out loud. The humor softens the emotional blows and greases the long rails of this transcontinental journey of a book. In a handful of places it doesn't work but in more thousands of places than you can count the humor is clever and unusual and your day ... well the next hour anyway ... is richer because of it.

On the Kindle it's simple to go to the text of the footnote and then go back to where you left off in the text. In fact some of the footnotes even have footnotes, and the Kindle handles this with ease.     2) The book has a rich vocabulary, and I found myself having to look up (in the Kindle's built-in dictionary) lots of words.     3) The dead-tree version is big and heavy, not the kind of thing you'd want to drag onto the train or bus every day, or even hold up while laying in bed.

But there's no way I'm shelling out $17 for an electronic, DRMed copy of a book that has been out nearly 15 years now.    I realize the pricing decision wasn't Amazon's, and I'm sympathetic to the publisher's stated desire to price new release Kindle editions above the $9.99 price point and then bring them down in price over time (the record companies said they'd do the same thing with cds, and that never happened), but this makes me think that they are just trying to kill off the Kindle platform.    Buy the paperback - skip the Kindle version until the publisher prices it appropriately.",2010-04-15
