The story, if there is one, is entirely unintelligible.  The characters are incredibly vague and undefined; reading this I had no idea what the relationship was between any of them.  If that wasn't bad enough, he had both a female and a male character with the same name - I'm guessing.  It's very difficult to tell what exactly is going on.  While some people may be impressed by how confusing and, therefore, DEEP this is, I find it incredibly annoying and wish I had never read it.  Not only that, but I wish Faulkner had never &#34;written&#34; it and had instead pursued a career as a lumberjack, or stevedore, and served humanity in some noble fashion.  My hatred of this crap knows no bounds.  This is by far the worst book I've ever read.<br />I would like to build a time machine for the sole purpose of traveling back in time to kick Faulkner in the nuts.

There's a difference. Also, I would assume going down in history as being one of the &#34;greatest writers&#34; of the ages would require a knowledge of proper punctuation, but seems over time the legend outweighs the quality of the work. I see punctuation in my sleep, and often find myself going back to a novel I am working on at all hours of the night and morning to check on a comma I may have missed or some other typo I feel I might have made. Faulkner couldn't bother with that in some of his work, the run-on sentences falling off a cliff in an incoherent stream of babbling gibberish. Sure, I can expect the argument from Faulkner fans that this was his style, and his stream of consciousness writing was innovative and original for that day and age, but telling the reader, as he has, to read it over and over and over again in order to understand what the hell he was attempting to covey, is both arrogant and condescending. My suggestion to him would be to stop drinking over and over and over before plucking away at those keys, because I never again will make an effort to wade through another of his nonsensical, grammatically-butchered ramblings. Is it just the alcoholic authors that history has made an effort to be extra kind to, or is this the emperor's new clothes-end result from decades of teachers who forced this thinking on us? Through years of force-feeding this crap as required reading to hordes of terrorized young people, who often leave school never even wanting to be near a book again, much less read one, it has practically become scholastic law to have to pretend this is great work, while in the meantime more deserved writers of the day fell by the wayside. I see it in the world of writing in the same way as in the world of music--if you are told long and hard enough that THIS is what you are supposed to revere as great, you go on believing it and telling others that, even without checking it out for yourself.t checking it out for yourself.",2014-10-24

Basically it's about the Compson family of Jefferson, Mississippi. The Compsons were a prominent and important family of the Old South but by the early 1900s had lost most of their wealth and status. The family is made up of a needy, neurotic mother; a distant, hard-drinking father (who dies fairly early in the story), three brothers, and a sister. The book's narrators are the three brothers: Benjy, a mentally handicapped child-man; Quentin, a troubled, unstable Harvard student; and Jason, a disappointed, hard-hearted, would-be patriarch. The heart of the story is their sister Cady, a caring but promiscuous young woman who shames the family by getting pregnant. Cady enters into a hasty marriage but her husband quickly divorces her when he discovers the child is not his. The Compson family takes in Cady's daughter &#34;Miss Quentin&#34; and cuts off Cady completely. This drives the story since brother Benjy adores and misses Cady, brother Quentin is devastated by her behavior, and brother Jason is angry at Cady for embarrassing the family and depriving him of the bank job offered by her husband. Jason also resents Miss Quentin and steals the money Cady sends for her. Other important characters in the tale are Dilsey and her sons, black servants that function almost as extended family. The dissonance among the Compsons leads to much acting out and tragedy, which is witnessed by Dilsey - who cares for all of them. I thought the book's characters were memorable and the story (such as it is) was compelling.",2014-08-01

Every word Faulkner writes, every memory that is explored, every action in the novel is distilled into a lingering, oppressive, sadness that is as omnipresent as the honeysuckle Quentin so hated.<br /><br />I started off enjoying the novel; I liked the experimental way Faulkner tries to convey the confused mind of Benjy. As someone who grew up with and spent years working with severely mentally disabled adults, I felt Faulkner honestly captured the state of mind of someone who is almost totally unable to experience rational and unselfish thought.<br /><br />The second chapter, too, was quite beautiful but at times was nearly impenetrable. Pretty much only the scene with the little girl, when his mind stops wandering and he focuses only on finding her home, really seemed to have much of an impact for me. Everything else - the broken watch, his drunken father's philosophical ramblings, his time with Caddy - seemed ... distant. Distant is the best way I can describe it from a reader's point of view. I never felt like I was part of Quentin's experiences even though we spend so much time in his mind. He was no Bloom.<br /><br />The final two chapters were straightforward enough. We learn many of the previously mysterious details that Benjy's and Quentin's minds could not clearly articulate (or were unwilling to articulate). And Jason was a wonderful character - the best in the book. Faulkner certainly has created one of the great characters in literature with Jason.<br /><br />But what does this all add up to? Yes, the novel is about the south and the south's decline, but what South? Was there a time when people did not behave badly, were devious, cheats, liars, manipulators, and every other sin you can imagine? Maybe there were times in the Compson family when they were more outwardly respectable, but how do we really know those &#34;better&#34; people were actually any better? Is Faulkner so nostalgic for a long forgotten time that he actually believes we've all degenerated in our time?<br /><br />I doubt Faulkner was so naive or sentimental. He write a book in which the main characters are all flawed and fallen ne'er–do–wells, who all long for a time when things were better and resent the present because it didn't turn out the way they wanted it too. Adults who haven't really ever grown up. In a way he wrote a warning against nostalgia, against seeing the past with thick rose colored glasses because if you keep trying to compare yourself against an impossible standard you will only disappoint yourself or, if you're smart, just run away from your entire family.<br /><br />From that point of view, then, this isn't a &#34;southern&#34; novel bemoaning the end of one specific time and culture of Faulkner's love that will unfortunately never return, he's trying to warn us from falling into the cycle of always going back to the past. If your mind is always full of how things were and how things used to be then you will miss every opportunity to better yourself tomorrow. The Compson's totally fell apart because they could not come to terms with reality.<br /><br />Yet even with such an analysis, I just could not get into this novel. I really wanted to, but you have to approach every work of art from the perspective of how it effects you personally and this novel just made me feel sad after having witnessed so much misery on every page.e actually believes we've all degenerated in our time?<br /><br />I doubt Faulkner was so naive or sentimental.

Faulkner was just as difficult to read as I remembered from back in high school when I was forced under threat of death (well, practically) to read Light in August. However, I very much liked this story set in early 20th Century deep South. I was awed by Faulkner's courage to use Benjy's severely intellectually challenged (he's retarded) point of view and especially to start the book with Benjy's point of view. But for goodness' sake, you shouldn't have to read a page twice to figure out who said what throughout the dialogue. If you have to work that hard to read a book, then you are aware of the process of reading rather than losing yourself in the story. And the characters (except Benjy's internal dialogue) all sound alike. The adult Jason is intense and Mother is a whiner, but all the black people talk the same, and all the kids, girls or boys, talk the same, and all the white people talk the same.

Flags in the Dust], and, in retrospect, is considered the first of the four literary triumphs (As I Lay Dying, Sanctuary and Light in August round out the burst of literary genious) that signaled the arrival a grand new voice in southern writers.  Now how is that for hyperbole?  Cutting through the dense stream of narrative, readers will be rewarded with a harrowing look at a formerly grand southern family dying out.  Not once does the grand matron of the house fail to remind those around her that she was forced to marry beneath her station and that her troubled children are the punishment for doing so.  Each of the three brothers are obsessed with their sister Caddy, albeit for different reasons.  The man child Benjy clearly adores his fallen sister like an angel, the suicide Quentin shared a love with his sister that may or may not have broken a soceital taboo, and the abusive Jason who, having shriveled under the smothering praise of his mother, takes his anger out on everyone around him - especially Caddy's illegitimate daughter, Quentin.
