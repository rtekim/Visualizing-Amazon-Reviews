Influenced by a wise, old pig among them, the animals decide to revolt and start the Rebellion. They believe by driving out the poor leadership of humans and instead working together for the common good, they can thrive off of new-found freedom. Though the animals succeed in removing the farmer, the changes are more than they anticipated. The pigs, driven by selfish ambitions, take control over their fellow “comrades” and put into effect “Animalism and The Seven Commandments,” which they ultimately alter and forgo.<br /><br />Over the course of this allegory, a bright light is shed on the cruelties of communism. Though socialist/communist ideas may make sense on paper, the reality is that mans’ sinful nature overpowers good intentions.

That's the brief version of my review.<br /><br />Eric Arthur Blair, or George Orwell as the world knows him, is a genius at describing fear, terror, doubt, uncertainty, mischief, evil, and hopelessness. The writing is beyond exquisite, even if the topic is morose. Such a loss to the world that Mr. Orwell died when he was just 46 years old. The unwritten works that he never wrote, the works that would have enriched our world and weren't meant to be. In Animal Farm, much like 1984, Orwell goes where you just don't want him to go - painting a dark grim bleak picture that grows worse by the page, of precisely what happens when the evil minds take over the masses, and scheme lie after lie until the truth is so distorted one can't even trust one's own memory. A fantastic allegory to the horrific Russian revolution and the communist party, one that makes you want to open up real history book to remind yourself that yes, this actually happened not to imagery sheep and hens and horses and farm animals in a little work of fiction, this happened to millions of people and this is still happening.<br /><br />Well, I am so SO so glad I read this book even though it was uncomfortable, disturbing and scary - not half as scary as 1984 but scary enough to never forget. But I'm also glad it's over. It was heavy reading and an interesting feeling between loving the writer, loving the writing but resenting the story because it brings to light the ugliest of all ugliness in the world and puts it on the spotlight.<br /><br />My favorite lines - favorite is a funny sort of word to use for lines that make your blood run cold but here goes:<br />&#34;All animals are equal but some are more equal than others.&#34;,<br />&#34;No animal shall drink ... to excess.&#34;,<br />&#34;Four legs good, two legs better.&#34;<br />“Comrades!' he cried. 'You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege?&#34;<br />&#34;Surely comrades, you don't want Jones back now do you?&#34;<br />&#34;The animals wished there were less figures and more food in their bellies.&#34;<br />And on and on and on.

Orwell's classic satire tells the story of a revolution gone wrong. When the animals of Manor Farm revolt, taking control, they initially set-up the perfect democracy. The two leaders of their rebellion are two well educated pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, who cannot be counted on to agree about anything. It is their disagreements that will eventually lead to the demise of what had once promised to be a step towards complete freedom.<br /><br />While I enjoyed this more than 1984, I still can't say that I really enjoyed it. It was well-written, and I particularly came to like Clover and Boxer, the two horses. That said the story itself was just meh, it did not much interest or excite me.

The book was first written in 1943 and published in 1945 about the dictatorships of Stalin, Communism, and what has become one of the darker spots in world history. The book mirrors some of the horrors of war, politics, and deception in what Orwell called &#34;A Fairy Story&#34; about dominating pigs, ignorant horses, and dumb sheep.<br /><br />The story begins with Mr. Jones, the human owner of the Manor Farm. Jones' rule on the farm is harsh, and when an old boar named Major gathers the rest of the farm animals together to incite them to rebel, they eventually do. After Major dies, the animals run Jones off the farm, claiming the land as their own, and they adopt a system of thought known as Animalism. Animalism, of course, is none other than Communism and Mr. Jones represents the ruling Tsar and capitalism.<br /><br />Once the farm is under the animals' rule, the pigs assume a dominant role of leadership because, as the book says, the pigs seem to be the smartest of the animals. All of the animals then sing their own anthem called the Beasts of England, which is in celebration for their victory from Jones' tyrannical rule to their own freedom. However, these animals unknowingly move from one tyrannical rule to another.<br /><br />They rename the farm &#34;Animal Farm&#34; and the pigs, the dogs, horses, sheep, and chickens set up their seven commandments of Animalism dictating how the farm will be run. Out of all the pigs, two become prominent figures on the farm: Snowball, who is the mirror image of Trotsky, and Napoleon, who is none other than Stalin.<br /><br />Napoleon and Snowball feud about how the farm should be run now that all animals are declared comrades and all animals are equal. Only man and his vices are the enemy. Yet Napoleon has other ideas and nearly has Snowball killed as he runs the pig off the farm. The other animals then fall under Napoleon's rule.<br /><br />The strongest of the animals is a cart horse named Boxer, who adapts his own mantra of &#34;Napoleon is always right&#34; and &#34;I must work harder&#34; whenever he is faced with an obstacle or opposition. The old donkey, Benjamin, has the worst temper of the animals and is generally a sourpuss, but he seems to have the steadiest head on his shoulders compared to the other beasts. Even though he avoids giving his opinions on many matters, he, unlike the majority of other animals, learns how to read and comprehend.<br /><br />The other cart-horse, Clover, is a motherly mare always willing to help. Mollie is a vain young mare with an affinity for sugar cubes and ribbons for her mane. The sheep always dumbly parrot what they are told by the pigs. While the dogs work as the pigs' bodyguards and kill any of the animals that step out of line or whom the pigs deem worthy of death.<br /><br />As the book progresses, the animals successfully build a windmill which brings power to the farm for a time. But none of the animals seem to benefit from this new power except for the pigs. In fact, the pigs are the only ones truly benefiting from the resources of the farm while the other animals live in poverty.<br /><br />The pigs move into the main farmhouse and begin sleeping in Jones's beds, wearing human clothes, and walking about on two feet. By the story's end, the animals of the farm find it hard to tell the difference between the pigs and humans, their enemies.<br /><br />Overall, Animal Farm paints a tragic picture of war and how men became not better than beasts. The terrors experienced during WWII in Communist Russia and the rest of the world will forever haunt history, and I think Orwell's book captures that fearful scene quite well. There is not much about this book that I dislike. I would certainly recommend Animal Farm not only because it is a classic but also for its historical significance as a great satirical piece.<br /><br />The story is humorous attimes and so is some of the animals' dialogue, especially the pig Squealer. And many times I found myself wondering, why couldn't the animals see what's going on? But that is one of the points of the book. The lesser animals on the farm represent the types of people in the world and, sadly, their ignorance and misplaced hopes. What's most interesting about the book is its appeal to both young and mature readers after all these years.times and so is some of the animals' dialogue, especially the pig Squealer.

The pigs carry on this idea that all animals are equal and the farm flourishes becoming greater than ever. They make their own seven commandments to the farm and change the name to Animal Farm. The pigs realize the other animals that can't read or write as well as them are lesser creatures. This starts a class system in the farm, with the pigs at the top. After this two pigs begin to differ and fight. One is kicked out and is told to be a villain. This represents Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin.

I have always enjoyed Orwell’s writing. IMO he is a superb prose stylist. His writing is always elegant, to the point, enjoyable, and clever. This was not an exception, although perhaps because this work strives to work on some of the same levels as a fairy tale, it is more simple than some of the other things that I have read. In fact it is a fairy tale, albeit a fractured one – it is a political allegory disguised as a modern day fable. The story is about communism, and it is not surprising to note that it was written by a disillusioned leftist, a man who (I think) once believed in communist revolution but clearly came to view its results with a very cold and jaded eye.<br /><br />The story is as follows: There once was a farm in England run by a nasty, selfish, drunken farmer. The animals despised the slavery under which they toiled, and a spontaneous rebellion takes place. The farmer is driven off his land and the animals take over. At first it is a democratic place, but over time a cabal of pigs, led by one Napoleon, and a pack of vicious dogs whom the pigs command, take control of the farm. Dissenting voices are silenced or run off, and the other animals fall back into their lives of unquestioning toil. The pigs rule through a mixture of propagandistic lies and threats. Eventually the pigs make peace with the neighboring farm owners, and show that they have become exactly like them. Nothing has changed.<br /><br />Orwell seems to say that there is little or no hope for a true revolution, as long as the world is populated by creatures like the sheep (who stupidly and loudly follow whoever leads them) and the selfish and scheming pigs. A cynical view, no doubt, but one that many believe today. And it was a fabulous idea for a little book, i.e. animating this viewpoint by setting it on a “revolutionary” farm.",2014-11-19

At first life without humans fulfills their socialist dream. Then as the pig Napoleon becomes power-hungry, that dream becomes corrupted: &#34;All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.&#34; Once the corruption starts, information is controlled and the pigs power strengthened until the reasons for the revolution have been blurred.<br /><br />A casual reading of Animal Farm would see it as an attack on socialism. This would be a reading that ignores facts: Orwell was a socialist. Despite his political beliefs, one thing overruled any ideology: the truth. When I was in my first year at La Trobe University, I discovered Orwell's Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters. He impressed me with his intellectual bluntness (which he described as brutality). He believed that socialism could make life better for most people, but that gain should never come through sacrificing the truth.<br /><br />Animal Farm is one of those rare must-reads, suitable for everyone.

Many may not be aware of  the origin of  the common phase from the book that's widely used, \\""some pigs are more equal than others\\"".  Not sure that it's still part of  most high school education curricula (where I read it in the late 1960s). I had a copy (along with Orwell's \\""1984\\"") to lend to one of my post-college daughters who attended what is consider a superior high school, but she has not read either of them then. See my May 2014 review of \\""1984\\"" on its Amazon page. (http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UIMREA3OTZV0)<br /><br />This very short novel should be read by all as part of one's education. Orwell's story is set on a farm where a revolution is led by the pigs against the farmer to set up a  better life for the farm animals. After the farmer is ousted, the pigs set up a system that's suppose to provide fairly and equally among the animals. Eventually though, the animals realize that things were not quite what they were suppose to be, the pigs were in charge and they had more privileges, power, etc. When questioned about this, they were told that \\""some pigs were more equal than others\\"".  In the end the pigs cooperate with the farmer, and the other animal could not tell the pigs and the farmer apart.<br /><br />Orwell likely meant the story to be a satire about Stalin's Soviet Union. Present day, the story of the pig-controlled animal society should be familar with any one who's read objective first-hand accounts of places where there are one-man or one-party governments, \\""people's republics\\"" (definitely Orwellian Newspeak), etc.  We should be wary of societies and policies where the government is totally in charge of making things \\""equal\\"" ( something not objectively definable), that will tend be controlled by a small group of people who will inevitable have more power, privileges, material goods, etc. because they \\""need\\"" all that to implement/enforce the \\""equality\\"" policies.

US,51617184,R1QCSI2UY7WRIM,0679420398,380925201,Animal Farm,Books,5,1,1,N,N,"a review less equal than others","I, as with many others, first read this back in late middle school... or was it early high school?  I no longer know, but I remembered the mantra, &#34;Four legs good, two legs bad.&#34;  I remembered the change to, &#34;two legs better.&#34;  I remembered the pit in my stomach when Boxer was betrayed, I remembered the frustration with the slowly changing 7 Commandments, and, above all, I recalled having some notion that Communism was bad.  Or was it Socialism?  Or was it just Russians?  It baffles me that we are given this book to read as a lesson in satire when, at least in my educational experience, we have little to no understanding of the real-world events that are being satirized.  So having recently finished Robert K Massie's brilliant Nicholas and Alexandra and the (less stellar) follow-up The Romanovs, I just had to revisit Orwell's satire armed not only with newfound knowledge but also a personal desire to figure out just what in the world it was that I read as a kid.<br /><br />Whenever possible I try to buy the Everyman's Library version of whatever I'm reading.  For some reason this book was a little difficult to find, but I'm very glad I hunted it down (Thank you, BookDepository) as I always find the introductions to these volumes to be incredibly insightful.  It was certainly the case with this edition if only to see the idea that, &#34;when you meet anyone in the flesh you realize immediately that he is a human being not a sort of caricature embodying certain ideas,&#34; pop up again.  That notion has continually shown up in my reading lately, and I love it!  That personal note aside, I certainly don't recall being taught very much about the historical context in which this book was written and eventually published.  These were English classes after all, not History!  So while I was excited to approach this with my own new understanding of the source events, Symons's introduction combined with the inclusion of two versions of Orwell's own prefaces at the end were beyond valuable for grasping the real meaning of the story and its place in history.<br /><br />It turns out that what I remembered was completely off base.  Not only did Orwell respect the Russians, not only was this not a book about Communism at all, but Orwell was actually advocating for Socialism, and there's one of those things I certainly don't remember being taught!  While there was definitely no trace of the empathy I felt for Nicholas II for old Mr. Jones, it was not the person of Mr. Jones who was the enemy here.  Totalitarianism was the antagonist and Socialism the protagonist.  Orwell’s trouble in finding a publisher and his distaste for the masses following the status quo make also clearly mark him (and his work) as proponents of free speech and free thought.  “The enemy,” Orwell says in his original preface, “is the gramophone mind, whether or not one agrees with the record that is being played at the moment.”  He was disgusted by Britain’s willingness to turn a blind eye to the evils being perpetrated by Stalin’s regime and, once the war was over, by the demonization of even the idea of Socialism by western Democracies based primarily on Stalin’s appropriation of the power of the proletariat into his own hands after the Revolution.<br /><br />As enamored as I was with the author’s direct statements and seeing the book in its own historical context, it was still an absolute joy to read the work itself.  It was so much fun to start picking out who was represented by what and which events mapped to the real world. (I still didn’t get the windmill/5 Year Plan connection… I’m definitely more stuck in the first quarter of the 20th century) The story flows on its own just as easily as I recalled, and the satire was biting yet never heavy-handed.  This is a journey upon which I am incredibly happy I re-embarked.  Funny, sad, engaging, and brilliant… it is such an unfortunate state of affairs that, given this as an assignment, I failed to find much more than the answers to the upcoming test.  As with many of the pleasures of being young, it is yet another one that is wasted on the youthful. *sigh*<br /><br />Some satires are more equal than others, and now I just ordered the Everyman version of 1984… my eyes are going to fall out.nment, I failed to find much more than the answers to the upcoming test.

Led by the natural ‘brain-workers’, the pigs, an assortment of farm animals rises up and takes over the Manor Farm, posting a list of commandments, undertaking a public works project, and organizing themselves along human lines. It helps to know something about Soviet history to understand George Orwell’s targets, though by no means is it necessary to appreciate his satire on the foibles of government, human or animal.

The over-worked and abused animals of Manor Farm finally decided that enough was enough and revolted against their cruel master.  Poor old Jones never had a chance; the bizarre behavior of his animals caught him and his hired men so completely by surprise that they were run off the property before they knew what hit them.  Even when Jones came back later with more men, they were no match for the pent-up fury and frustration of the newly liberated animals.<br /><br />The animals could hardly believe how easily the dictatorship of Jones was overthrown.  They proudly toured the borders of the farm and decided to re-christen their new territory \\""Animal Farm.\\""  Their new-found freedom was even better than they had hoped, and a simple list of seven commandments was drawn up to ensure the continued freedom and equality of all animals.<br /><br />\\""Animal Farm\\"" soon became a utopia, with all of the animals sharing in the work and the reward.  The pigs, being the smartest of the farm animals, were elected as the natural leaders and handled the planning.  They decided what crops to plant, when to harvest, and got the other animals organized into effective work groups.  \\""Animal Farm\\"" becames a model of efficiency and the harvests that first year were the most bountiful the farm had ever seen.<br /><br />Their happy time is short-lived, however.  The leaders of \\""Animal Farm\\"" begin to get greedy.  Some of the animals begin to notice that the pigs are doing less and less work, while taking more and more profit.  What's more, it seems like the commandments that were drafted to govern the farm are changing, literally overnight while the animals sleep.  Before long, the hard working animals of \\""Animal Farm\\"" realize that they have traded one ruthless master for another.<br /><br />George Orwell is as shrewd as he is cynical.  If you ever want to see, in a nutshell, how nations and governments rise and fall, you should definitely read Animal Farm.  Orwell covers everything: a revolution, drafting a constitution, a military coup, a labor strike, propaganda, and trade agreements.

US,34705979,R1VIMZWZB32YTQ,1412811902,380925201,Animal Farm,Books,4,0,0,N,N,"Bleak fable of Stalin, Lenin and Trotsky","George's (Eric's) fable summary of the rise and fall of socialism in Russia. Clearly it resonated - this book has been constantly reprinted since being written, as he concludes the story, in the four months between November 1943 and February 1944. Who knows how far the popular (my) consciousness of Stalinist Russia has been shaped by this book. I suspect some of its popularity would be from capitalists gleefully applauding the depiction of communist leaders as utterly corrupt and exploitative, although it should be noted that the final tragedy we're left with is that the vile socialist leaders have become as bad as the capitalists:<br />Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.<br />Orwell was a committed socialist and far from moving to oppose it after seeing some of the appalling suffering in `communist' Russia, was rather deeply saddened by the despotic betrayal of the revolution. There was a time before the National Socialists of Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union had so tainted socialism's image, and it was still quite possible to be respected as an intelligent and humane thinker and as a socialist. Blair didn't question socialism as such, but was deeply concerned with the poor way it was realised and marketed (cf. the latter chapters of [[ASIN:B002CMLRE2 The Road to Wigan Pier]]).<br /><br />The extended parable is unsubtle (or, if you prefer, crystal clear) - there's no mistaking who Napoleon the pig, and Squealer with his ridiculous statistics, represent. Interesting that he'd have to acknowledge Jesus as much as anyone else as a stylistic influence, although Jesus' parables always forced a wider perspective than any particular political leader. In one way Orwell tries to give a face to the incomprehensible numbers betrayed by Stalin: in our human way we can instinctively feel more anger and despair in the betrayal of the noble fictional Boxer. Although if we are to take this fable as having wider implications than an interpretation of one particular place and time I suspect we can only look to the taciturn and cynical Benjamin the donkey. Benjamin is the oldest animal on the farm at the start of the book and seemed no closer to death at the end - \\""Donkeys live a long time\\"", and given his superior intelligence and good heartedness there's no-one else better placed to model wisdom. Rather than a socialist party line that revolution simply must come sooner or later as a historical necessity, Benjamin reserves his hopes in the good times, and his despair in the bad, feeling that ultimately things will return to the status quo - of hard work and exploitation.<br /><br />It was a tough time to be a socialist - there were such hopes in the thirties (cf. John Wain's Comedies), could we blame Orwell for the crushing despair of 1984 and Animal Farm? For all his contemptuous dismissal of religion, there was a time that Orwell was a true believer in socialism, and held as much passionate hope in the `golden future time' of equity and plenty following the revolution as the gullible animals tempted by Moses' Sugarcandy Mountain. The aforementioned Road To Wigan Pier recounts as much of a testimony of conversion as I've heard in a few churches. Reading guys like Orwell it feels like Socialism had much in common with a religion, and the teachings went (go) bravely beyond the dominant cult of nationalism (as does the best of religion, something Orwell never acknowledged) - hence much of the violent and vehement opposition it faced by those who felt betrayed by their own countrymen at their darkest hour: imagine opposing jingoism at a time of war! (Or read Lewis' [[ASIN:0060652896 Screwtape Letters]]Screwtape Letters which did just that. I wonder if there's any record of what these two contemporaries thought of each other?

They don't go outside of their character's role. However, Orwell made sure to give his characters enough personality that the animals were not only interesting, but even sympathized. When, despite all animals being equal, the pigs start becoming the humans they chased out, it is clear that they represent a dictator, while the rest of the animals represent humans under said dictatorship.<br /><br />Like its characters, Animal Farm is written in such a simple way that anyone can follow the story. Orwell easily portrays a story of how a revolt can easily lead to totalitarianism, even using simple songs and poems that represent how documents can be manipulated to suit anyone's purpose. Even someone who doesn't know politics can understand when something starts to go wrong in the book.<br /><br />However, its limited perspective lets readers know what the animals know: not much. While they have the information in front of them, the animals (excluding the donkey Benjamin) can't piece anything together. So when things get worse and the pigs start representing the repressive humans, nothing can be done. Some things - like the conclusion of Mollie the horse, Snowball the pig, or even the animals of the farm when they finally do realize what the pigs have become - stay unknown. Thankfully, things are obvious enough that the reader should be able to understand what the animals can't.<br /><br />George Orwell's Animal Farm is an excellent book and allegory for totalitarianism. Though there's no happy ending, it's an easy read and I would definitely recommend it.",2013-06-03

I had heard about how great this book was but wow, no one has really done it justice. Animal Farm shows the best example of communism within a fictioinal book that I've ever seen.<br />The story starts out with the animals on Manor Farm whom feel unhappy with the current conditions they are living in and feel that they are slaves to the men who run the farm, mainly Jones, the owner of the farm. So, one day one of the oldest pigs Old Major paints a picture of an ideal world where animals run the farm and are treated equally without human interference. A few days later when Old Major dies, the animals on the farm finally begin to rebel against the humans and when they succeed in expelling Jones and his men they decree Manor Farm as Animal Farm and set up commandments that state all animsals will be treated equally, will not act like humans, dress like humans, etc.<br />The pigs, mainly Snowball and Napolean, act as leaders and organziers on the farm and set up the commandments and tell the other animals what to do and organize the work on the farm. This is when the first signs of communism start to appear; all of the animals must work harder than the pigs, yet the pigs reap more of the benefits. The pigs also tell the other animals what do, and when the animals protest, they use brainwashing tactics to make sure the other animals do not uprise and do what they are told.<br />Wow, what a great novel. Honestly, one of the best books I've ever read (or listened to?) and I can't wait to read 1984 by George Orwell as well, because I've heard it's even better.

Short and easy, font and outline flow fast. The story though.... *shudder*! At first is was blatantly obvious that Orwell was writing about Communism and the state of affairs in the Soviet Union. Another reviewer quite well detailed all the characters and who there were in real life including the Union's (the original) five year plan of economics (the windmill) of progress to transform Soviet society. And that it was written in 1945, yeah, it's about the USSR. Beyond that though, when you get into it about half way after they run off one of the main characters (snowball) and the real tyrant takes over (napoleon), you begin to see the parallels to contemporary culture and society. How the animals never seem to figure out what is going on right in front of them. Even when they do stand up, they are punished by death for their crimes and rebellion. Then the propaganda from one of the more intelligent animals leads them to forget and believe they didn't remember things correctly, all in the name of the pigs implementing and fooling the less intelligent animals into their serfdom. I see it as contemporary social and political events that are happening in the U.S. and withing the Republican party. Eventually the other animals aren't able to distinguish the pigs from humans and the cycle has started all over again. Very sad story, but how many people have lived this or are living it right now? The sense of freedom and change that is corrupted, twisted and silenced, which turns right back into the cycle. The oppressed become the oppressor.

Orwell shows the dangers of replacing one government with another. Like this story, rather than eliminating the capitalist class system it was intended to overthrow, the Russian Revolution only replaced it with another hierarchy. The story begins with Old Major inspiring the animals with words of freedom. Shortly after, he dies. Yet, his story lives on and the animals plot a rebellion. Jones is chased from the farm and the farm is then renamed Animal Farm. All is well in the beginning until two pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, begin to gain control of the farm. Napoleon is power-hungry and uses propaganda to hide his mischief. When Jones attempts to retake his farm, Snowball leads the animals to defeat Jones in what later became known as the Battle of the Cowshed. Snowball also conceives plans for a windmill to help ensure the farm's survival and would make the animals' lives much easier. Napoleon then steals Snowball's plans and rids the farm of Snowball's presence by chasing him off with his pack of dogs. Napoleon blames Snowball for all of the farms problems from then on. An attempt is made to build the windmill, but it is destroyed by a storm. Napoleon continues in his corruption and begins to kill innocent animals with his dogs. Squealer appropriately excuses this by using fancy speeches. Eventually the windmill is built and the pigs move into Jones' house. They begin to grow fatter as the rest of the animals receive less food. Once again the windmill is destroyed, this time by a neighboring farmer named Frederick. The original commandments are modified when the pigs can't seem to follow them and are eventually reduced to one law: \\""All Animals Are Equal / But Some Are More Equal Than Others.\\"" A final attempt to build the windmill is made, but Boxer collapses and is then sold to a knacker by Napoleon. This is yet again covered up by Squealer and the other animals believe him. Although the farm expands from purchasing more land from neighboring farmers, the animals still have a very rough life. The pigs, on the other hand, begin to take on the characteristics of their former oppressors by walking on their hind legs and dressing un human clothes. The novel ends with Pilkington sharing drinks with the pigs in Jones' house. Napoleon changes the name of the farm back to Manor Farm and quarrels with Pilkington during a card game in which both of them try to play the same card. As other animals watch the scene from outside the window, they cannot tell the pigs from the humans. Animalism is symbolic of Communism and Manor Farm symbolizes Russia. The farmer Mr. Jones is the last Russian Czar, Nicholas II. Old Major, the pig, stands for Vladimir Lenin, and Snowball represents Leon Trotsky. Napoleon stands for Joseph Stalin, and the pack of dogs are his secret police. The horses Boxer and Mollie stand for the Russian working class. While the animals believed that they were going to live a better life, in the end they were worse off than in the beginning.

It is a short novel by George Orwell that is full of allegory and deals mostly with political corruption and the distortion of reality. The book itself is very easy to read and is quite short with approximately 100 pages. Two of the major themes in the book are the naive of the middle class and the manipulation of language to gain power.<br /><br />The book opens up with all the animals on the farm gathering to hear a dream by old boxer, a pig, about the animals living freely from human tyranny. In this society the animals were free and equal, and they keep what they worked for. Although Old Major died before his vision could be seen, two pigs took up after him, Snowball and Napoleon. Thus the next time they were treated horrible, a revolution occurs, and Jones and his wife were chased off the farm.<br /><br />At first the revolution was an amazing success. As a result the farm animals changed everything on the farm. They met every Sunday to debate farm politics, and developed seven basic rules that all animals must live by. Since the pigs were considered the most intelligence they automatically became the supervisor. Napoleon the leader of all the pigs became power hunger and lazy. With the help of Squealer, another pig he was able to convince the other farm animals that the pigs are always right.<br /><br />Two concepts that are fascinating in the novel are the power of words and the corruptions of power. There is a famous saying that goes, “power corrupts but absolute power corrupts absolutely”. This is proven true on every page of the novel. Napoleon lust for power took over him. He forces Snowball off the farm with the help of his trained secret dogs. Thus he was the smartest and only animal with total power on the farm. He also uses the dogs to get confession out of other animals and even killed them when they did not speak.<br /><br />Napoleon although cared nothing of the other animals decided to devote the animals’ time in building a windmill. After the completion of the building of the mill a fight broke out on the farm in which the mill was destroy by the humans. Boxer, the horse who was in charge of the mill received serious injuries. Napoleon then sells Boxer to a glue boiler. The animals were curious of what happen to Boxer but Squealer convinced them then he was taken to a veterinarian hospital.<br /><br />As the years goes by on the farm, the seven commandments became one sole line “all animals are equal but some are more equal than others”. The pigs also completely changed, they began to act like humans, “walking upright, carrying whips and wearing clothes”. At the end of the novel the pigs invited a nearby farmer, Mr. Pilkington over for dinner. In which they discuss on ways of allying themselves against the working classes, both humans and animals alike.<br /><br />The novel seemingly ends just like how it started. The name of the farm was changed back to the Manor Farm. Corrupts individual were still in power, and the animals couldn't distinguish the animals from the humans.though cared nothing of the other animals decided to devote the animals’ time in building a windmill. After the completion of the building of the mill a fight broke out on the farm in which the mill was destroy by the humans. Boxer, the horse who was in charge of the mill received serious injuries.

The animals were curious of what happen to Boxer but Squealer convinced them then he was taken to a veterinarian hospital.<br /><br />As the years goes by on the farm, the seven commandments became one sole line “all animals are equal but some are more equal than others”. The pigs also completely changed, they began to act like humans, “walking upright, carrying whips and wearing clothes”. At the end of the novel the pigs invited a nearby farmer, Mr. Pilkington over for dinner. In which they discuss on ways of allying themselves against the working classes, both humans and animals alike.<br /><br />The novel seemingly ends just like how it started. The name of the farm was changed back to the Manor Farm. Corrupts individual were still in power, and the animals couldn't distinguish the animals from the humans.",2013-02-23

I read Animal Farm to help my grandson with his school project. Why I failed to read this amazing allegory for the last fifty years or so is beyond my reasoning.

Napoleon sucks!\\"" Never mind!<br /><br />Power corrupts but absolute power corrupts absolutely! No doubt the idea of equality is an amazing concept. Orwell though, realizes the truth behind this fallacy of allowing a government to set those standards. On an individual basis, we can manage equality. On a larger scale, we end up weakening society and individuals without seeing their true strengths and talents. We make everyone equal and never reward hard work. People are equal to live, not to be rewarded just for existing.<br /><br />Napoleon the Pig did not start off by usurping all the power.

You've worked hard for years to raise your farm into one of the highest producing farms from nothing.  All your effort and life toil was put into the success of your farm.  One day you wake up and go about your day as normal, and the animals act up.  We are not talking a simple kick or refusal to pull.  This problem becomes a full out rebellion.  Before you know it the animals are kicking and full out attacking you.  You are being driven out of your farm and your property, everything you hold dear is being taken away from you right before your eyes.  With every kick and shove, hope is being continuously pushed out of you.  Now you are off your farm and now you and your men have to settle somewhere else.  The plan is to take the farm back.  Meanwhile all the animals on the farm are literally running the farm the way the farmers did.  They are also establishing their own government and lifestyle.  They are acting the same way humans do.<br /><br />Before you know it they are running the farm even better than the way you and your men had.  The crop harvest is more bountiful than what it was when your men did it.  Talk about embarrassing!!!  The days turn into months and months into years and you hear news that as time passes the animals are getting more and more advanced and sophisticated.  You begin to feel jealous and outraged. Fortunately for you they just built a windmill for you and your men to destroy and have your vengeance for being driven off your farm.  You and your men raid the farm after some careful planning and you blow up the windmill, temporarily taking all their pride and joy with it.

The author writes about a farm controlled by a harsh Mr. Jones. The animals worked hard and had little to show for it; they were not fed to satisfaction, nor did they have comfortable stables. Orwell uses the animal farm as a symbol of the struggle between socialists and communists.<br /> The plot of the story starts with the dream an old boar, \\""Major\\"", has about an upcoming animal revolution against humans. He calls all animals together and instructs them on how to act when this uprising will take place. He makes it clear right away that no one can know when this up-rise will take place; and whether it will even happen in their lifetime nevertheless, he gave them over a set of rules by which to live that they should pass on to their offspring.  He starts off by telling them why they deserve to be independent; \\""man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk . . . and yet there is not one of us that owns more than his bare skin\\"" (p. 29).  Major emphasized continuously over the importance of equality; \\""and among us animals let there be perfect unity\\"" (p. 31). They also established a list of seven commands they must never violate once they win their freedom. Eventually Major dies and life on the farm continues, until the day Mr. Jones forgets to feed them. The animals stormed Mr. Jones home in search for food and when Mr. Jones began hitting them they started butting and kicking until Mr. Jones and his men fled for their lives. The animals began to realize that their time has come and they started implementing the rules that Major had taught them to abide by.<br /> Napoleon, one of the farm's pigs, who had a tremendous thirst for power, started manipulating the animals into crowning him as their leader. As time went on Napoleon began to veer away from the path Major had advised them to follow. He gave special treatment to his fellow pigs, and slowly began transforming himself into a dictator. Eventually he took over the whole farm, and had all the animals working as hard as they did under Mr., Jones while he laid back and enjoyed himself. The commandment that read \\""all animals are equal\\"" (p.43) was suddenly changed to \\""All Animals Are Equal But Some Animals Are More Equal Than Others\\"" (p. 133).

At times I greatly enjoy his works, and at other times (1984 I'm talking about you) I just can't bring myself to appreciate what are well known as classics.  Luckily, Animal Farm is one of the ones I can appreciate.<br /><br />Ready for a Revolution, the animals at Manor Farm have had it with the way they have been treated by their human owners.  A rebellion breaks out and drives the humans away from the farm and the animals take it over for themselves.  They all chip in to do the hard work, but as time passes, certain animals raise themselves as leaders and begin delegating, promising great hopes of tomorrow for the other animals.  More and more the perfect society morphs into what they used ot know, with many of them being unaware of it.<br /><br />These are animals, of course we're going to like them better than a story about people.  Who can't be charmed by a horse who wants to work hard or a donkey that just seems a bit gloomy.  And I think it's a brilliant way of putting the authors outlook on certain societies and government out there.  And the subtle way that it's done is most impressive too.  The pigs have brains, there's no denying that and it was interesting to see how Orwell used them to present the change in power amongst the animals.  I do think Orwell was a bit unfair to some of the animals though; there should have been a few outstanding cases amongst some creature other than the pigs, just like there are a few outstanding people amongst an unfair government as well.<br /><br />Obviously this is based on the authors interpretation of communism.  But I think the bigger lesson, rather than focusing on any particular government, is that when you have a group of sentient beings, there are going to be some that want more power than others, and no equality can exist in such a dynamic.  No utopia will ever be reached because of this trait of humankind either.  It just so happens it's represented by animals in this book.  And this book isn't very long.  It doesn't even reach a hundred pages in my version which is astounding when you think about how much detail and how many ideas are packed into it.  And it's presented well without feeling rushed.

As Mr. Jones flees his house and farm, the animals take over renaming it \\""Animal Farm\\"" rather than \\""Manor Farm\\"", and establish their own communist society based on equality, fairness and justice.

Soon, the commandments are slowly altered to suit their purposes until the final commandment states, \\""All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others\\"", making the summarized version \\""four legs good, two legs better.\\"" This one statement encapsulates all of humanity in my opinion - we're all equal, but some are more equal than others.

There are a select few that enjoy the benefits of endless power, and a great many that suffer the constant oppression. The few at the top reap the benefits through the sacrifices of the many, as was demonstrated through George Orwell's novel, Animal Farm. The novel is a political satire whose events are modeled after that of the real world, as well as the animal characters representing real people. The plot and characters reveal Orwell's true genius behind his book, as it is a work of literary excellence that greatly impacted society.<br /><br />  George Orwell wrote his political satire, Animal Farm, at a controversial time in history. It was time where he could not truly utilize his right to freedom of speech for fear of deadly repercussions. The structure of the book is completely influenced by this time period.  Despite this hindrance, he was able to create animal characters to represent real political figures and a society that modeled that of the dictatorships of the real world. In Animal Farm, the animals on the Manor Farm overthrew the neglectful farmer that previously took care of them. They created their own society with commandments that all the animals had to follow. Initially, the utopian farm was very successful, but soon, there was a power struggle between two pigs: Snowball and Napoleon.<br /><br /> Napoleon and Snowball modeled Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky respectively. Napoleon ends up taking control of the Manor Farm and running Snowball out. Napoleon then assumes dictatorial qualities, such as declaring that there will be no more meetings and asserting the pigs will make all the decisions. The rest of the animals become overworked and underfed whereas the pigs drink whiskey and live in luxury, which exactly modeled the conditions in the Soviet Union and other dictatorship societies.<br /><br /> Apart from the two main characters, Orwell created many prominent characters were used to symbolize other people. The horse, Boxer, was a hard, honest laborer. His motto was, \\""I will work harder\\"" yet despite this, he was betrayed by Napoleon and sent to a glue factory. He was representative of the working class. Orwell showed the working class' honesty and dedication, yet their downfall was the naïve trust they put in their leaders. Additionally, the pig Squealer acted as Napoleon's buffer to the other animals. He announced and justified Napoleon's actions, just as the media does. He modeled the propaganda that those in charge feed to the working class.<br /><br /> In the final analysis, George Orwell's novel, Animal Farm, was filled with representations in order to effectively convey his message of his disapproval of a communist society. The characters represented real-life dictators, and the animal farm subsequently turned into a dystopian society. The political satire was effective both when it was written as well as the present day in showing the fallibility of the Soviet Union and countries that lack democracy.o symbolize other people.

It is a satirical fable that uses the story of animals rebelling on a farm to tell a version of the Russian Revolution and the rise of Joseph Stalin.  Most of the major characters are loosely based on real life people.  Major, the boar who dreams of a farm run by animals, is inspired by Lenin.  After his death, Snowball (based on Trotsky) and Napoleon (based on Stalin) take over command of the animals and lead a rebellion against the farmer.  The animals are collectively in charge of the farm in a form of communism (referred to as \\""Animalism\\"").  Eventually Napoleon plots to oust Snowball, and then gradually erodes the rights of the animals to assume a position of dictatorship, paying only the merest of lip service to the origin tenets of the rebellion.<br /><br />This is a very short novel (the version I read had fewer than 100 pages although this varies depending on the typeface), which takes only a couple of hours to read.

It is ok for teens<br />and adults. The gist of animal farm is this:the animals of a farm (secretly)<br />were able to communicate with each other and hatched a plan to take<br />over the whole farm fron the humans who owned it and the animals did!...<br />Once the animals were in control they set up ground rules for all the animals to<br />follow-incidentally,the pigs being the smartest,were the &#34;speakers&#34; for the<br />whole group. at first,things went as planned for the animals,but slowly over<br />time,things changed.<br />The nicer of the two pigs(snowball) was forced off of the farm thru treachery<br />orchestrated by another pig, named Napoleon. At this point,Napoleon takes<br />control using outright lies and intimidation(Napoleon trained dogs to be his bodyguards).<br />As far as the humans in the story,a group of humans tried to take back the farm<br />but,failed and then later,Napoleon had to work with the humans to get certain things<br />that they needed to use on the farm. as I read each page,I thought that this reminds<br />me alot of Hitler/Germany/world war two, but, really the author intended Napoleon to<br />represent Joseph Stalin. alas,Hitler and Stalin were cut from the same cloth,so it is<br />logical to make the comparison between the two.

Orwell seems to have a dim view of humanity and seems to highlight the reality that humans tend to naturally be self-seeking and easily corruptible. Though this stands in stark contrast to the ideals of the Enlightenment, the WWII context for this book revealed that humans are capable yes of amazing achievements yes, but equally capable of horrific atrocities.

My interpretation of a classic is a book that is relevant for all times. Such is the case of Animal Farm. Originally written as a criticism of Totalitarian oppression of the people it serves today as a window into the machinations of politics in the Oligarchy that is America.<br /><br />Napoleon the Pig represent the oppressive power of the Corporatocracy that is America. Were I to give him a name it would be something ending in Koch.<br /><br />Every oppressive system has to have its Minister of Propaganda. Hitler had Goebbels and Napoleon had Squealer. If I were to place a name tag on our Squealer it would end in Murdock.<br /><br />As in Animal Farm the workers were oppressed and subjected to the whims of those in charge. Today it is the middle class not the peasants  that are being set upon. The grand old worker, the horse named Boxer upon who's back all that was accomplished or attempted to be done, rested. Boxer and his companion Clover it was said 'never lost heart' - kinda kin to 'hope springs eternal'. They worked for the improvement of the Farm. They worked to make things better. They worked.<br /><br />Finally when Boxer could work no more and needed medical help - help came. The story was that he would be taken care of and return to live out his remaining days. The facts were much different. He was no longer useful, was simply no longer an asset. Boxer went away to a 'hospital' to be come glue and whatever else they make of horse flesh.<br /><br />Clover and Boxer are, for me, representatives of the middle class. The Pigs use them and work them and take the profits from those labors and grow fat and rich.<br />Social Welfare Programs for the poor and elderly have become liabilities to the Pigs....they want more. They are going to work, work, work the life out of those who will work. Like the sheep, they will be fleeced of every thing.<br /><br />Amazon - you wanted a review. Here tis.

My \\""Signet Classic\\"" copy has an introduction by C.M. Woodhouse, which was published in the \\""The Times Literary Supplement.\\"" One of his points was that two events occurred in August, 1945, and the target of both was the Soviet Union. One was the dropping of the A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which effectively ended the Second World War, but also, as Woodhouse implies, was a warning from the United States to its ally in that war. The other event was the publication of this book, which was a scathing, thinly veiled denunciation of the betrayal of the original principals of the Russian revolution by its leaders. George Orwell had experienced other betrayals as well, having fought on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, and bore witness to the failure of the Western democracies to support that side. His account, [[ASIN:1604443499 Homage to Catalonia]] is highly recommended.<br /><br />Having just re-read the book, I've concluded that it has definitely withstood the \\""test of time,\\"" and remains as relevant today, even though the Soviet Union no longer exists. Orwell's tale is an allegorical one; his prose is lean and to the point. In the best spirit of the \\""inmates taking over the asylum,\\"" Orwell has the animals on \\""Manor Farm\\"" seizing power, and driving off its human owner, a Mr. Jones. The one animal that was most directly allied with Mr. Jones is a black raven, a clever talker, who would convey tales of \\""Sugarcandy Mountain,\\"" way up there is the sky, where all the animal's dreams would come true. Priests anyone?  In the immediate aftermath of the \\""revolution,\\"" new principles are proclaimed. The most important one is that \\""All animals are equal.\\"" Not having to support parasitic humans, the animals will now be free to enjoy the fruits of their own labor. The work days will be shortened; retirement benefits proclaimed. Hum!  And yes, within a few pages, the initial problems commence. What happened to the extra milk?<br /><br />Orwell unfolds his tale brilliantly. Step by step, a new hierarchy emerges, with the cleverest of animals, the pigs, in charge. There is a conflict between the two cleverest pigs, once closely allied, Snowball and Napoleon. Snowball loses, and step by step, becomes the personification of all evil. Themes that Orwell developed in [[ASIN:0452284236 Nineteen Eighty-Four]] are present. He that controls the past controls the future, so it is no surprise to see the past constantly rewritten in order to justify current actions. Orwell depicts many an administration \\""spokesperson\\"" in slimy \\""Squealer,\\"" a cheerleader, rationalizer and literally re-writer, adding key qualifying phrases to the original Seven commandments. Napoleon transforms into the indispensible, aloof leader, who needs much praise, and, of course, lots of \\""perks\\"" as compensation for his heavy duties.<br /><br />The narrow reading of this allegory is that it is solely about totalitarianism.  The broader reading concerns the power relationships which evolve when any three humans gather together. In particular, I have to think about how the \\""power elites\\"" almost lost it in the 2008 financial meltdown, but with only a stumble or two, have re-establish the need for their \\""perks,\\"" and, in the main, most people still go along with it. As in Animal Farm, Napoleon, (i.e., the power elites) constantly uses external \\""threats,\\"" in particular, from the evil Snowball to maintain control. Alliances of convenience have to be made with former enemies. The focus remains on self-aggrandizement; the hedge fund managers need their incentives in order to work hard; the rest, like the ever faithful horse, Boxer, need only exhortations.<br /><br />At the beginning, it was called \\""Manor Farm\\""; after the \\""revolution\\"" it became \\""Animal Farm\\""; and sure `nuf, at the end, it reverts to its original name.

Animal Farm is supposed to be an ideal place, but turns out to be anything but that - a corrupted place where a few pigs have all the power. Having done some research on the book before reading it, I learned that this whole novel was satiric, and an extended metaphor or allegory of the Russian revolution. The message, however, is not just about communism or socialism or Russia, but rather society and humankind as a whole.<br /><br />It is easy to be discouraged to read this book because of the heavy political reference; however, the commentary on human nature outweighs this. Old Major, the pig with the vision of a new peaceful society for the animals, represents the Soviet leaders Marx and Lenin. These leaders aren't actually alive to see the implementation of their ideal. I like that Orwell doesn't exactly attack Soviet ideals, but simply paints a harsh picture of the ones who come afterward to corrupt the ideal (namely Napoleon), by becoming overzealous and tyrannical themselves. Theoretically the ideal could work. Orwell points out; however, that greed and humankind's nature can lead to corruption.<br /><br />To me, Boxer, the workhorse who represents Soviet peasants, is the most tragic character. Loyal and hardworking, he remains blinded by idea of the now jaded ideal as he stays faithful to Napoleon's leadership even as things continually go wrong.<br /><br />The character of Squealer - a pig who convinces the other farm animals that their memories are bad among other things - awed me.

Old Major, a boar on Mr. Jones' farm, convinces the rest of the animals that their rights and conditions are anything less than ideal.  After his death, two pigs named Snowball and Napoleon take his ideas and turn them into a movement, convincing the other animals that they must take action.  After a successful rebellion, the animals begin to set up new rules for their society (referred to as Animalism).  As the book progresses, we begin to see the gradual shift of power from the animals as a group, to select subclasses within their society, namely the pigs and dogs.  Animalism begins to evolve into something more evil as more and more rules and restrictions are placed on the animals by the pigs, and Snowball and Napoleon are corrupted by the effects of that power.<br /><br />After finishing Animal Farm, I was fairly underwhelmed.

Fully prepared to give the novel four stars, it wasn't until I reflected on it several days later that I began to realize how wrong I was.  My problem with the story was that I grew up in America after the end of Communism, and couldn't fully appreciate what Orwell had done. To have written a story like Animal Farm in 1945 was revolutionary in itself.  I kept reading the book and getting frustrated at how stupid the animals were, and wondering how they could follow these leaders along so blindly with unflinching determination in their work.  All of the events are not simply a product of Orwell's imagination, but an actual reflection of life under Stalinism.  Why would an animal admit to treason, knowing that it would result in their execution?  Well why do suspects routinely sign false confessions?  Why did seemingly good men go along with the atrocities of My Lai?

Led by two other boars, Napoleon and Snowball, the farm animals with the stalwart shire horse, Boxer, oust the incompetent, selfish farmer, Mr. Jones, and change Manor Farm to \\""Animal Farm\\"", henceforth to be governed by the revered laws of Animalism, and its Seven Commandments. However, venality and brute force subvert the high ideals of Animalism, leading to its ironic culmination, which Orwell sums up in the distortion of the final, and most sacred commandment. No spoilers. Read it for yourself.<br /><br />History buffs will find delightful parallels in the many personifications of past Russian Revolutionary figures, whether it's Old Major as Lenin; the gifted, inventive Snowball as Trotsky; or, the brutal, cunning Napoleon as one of recent history's megalomaniacal dictators - Stalin. Then, there's the litigious, double-dealing farmer, Foxwood as the United States, and the gentleman farmer, Pilkington as England/Europe. Not to be left out is Religion - \\""the opium of the masses\\"" - as represented by Moses, the Raven, squawking about Sugarcandy Mountain, and the rewards awaiting hardworking animals. Most moving perhaps, is Boxer. His betrayal by the pigs is ultimately the betrayal of the common man, who is the backbone of any nation.<br /><br />Orwell's writing style is masterly, never a word out of place. His sense of social injustice and righteous anger never boils over into melodrama, or cheap manipulation. \\""Animal Farm\\"" is not a story with a happy ending, but history is a very long story. Unfortunately, Orwell died before the end of the Soviet Empire. But perhaps, he saw it coming anyway. No dictator stays in power forever, just long enough to do maximum damage in minimum time.",2011-03-07

Communism persecute all religions as superstition and lies. They deny god, killing human being is a snap because they are intellectual ANIMAL. It's sad that so many people nowadays try to change this  nation into communist or socialism ( same role, just different name) not really knowing the truth, just based on some political ideology that human history had repeatedly  proved to be failed.  In fact communism is the worst political system that ever presented on earth. Because of its brutality, I escaped from that regime. And I  am happy to be in this country where human freedom is mostly respected, and protected. Communist lies saying every one shares equally: In fact only, those few comrades who caused the shift of power enjoy the wealth and power, but the rest of the general citizens have no equality nor basic human right. Any one speak against government---disappear next day to \\""concentration camp\\"" w/o fair trials nor justice. Communist shut down all religious freedom, or freedom of speech ( all medias are government controlled) Communists deny any form of gods but instead, they set the status of Stalin or Ma chiding, or Kimjung ill, and have to sing songs and salute for them, worship them.  From elementary children to elders... Anyone dares to go against the government, ---labor camp!  Several millions who stand  for their freedom were killed brutally  in early 20th century, during the communism overturn. Stalin communist government killed 90 millions including the vicinity nations that were turn into communism, Macho-tong communist killed 100 millions, 2 millions by North Korea, by Cambodia each, 2 millions in Africa, 200,000 latin America..so on . But most of all they all became terribly poor after communist regime,oppressing the free capitalism, except China, because they started to adapt the partial capitalism from 10 years ago after they realized the harsh economic state. Now history tells also other evil regime; Hitler killed 6 million jew with other 4 million of Europeans; Japan' imperialism killed 20 million Asians during WWII, ..so on.<br /><br />Men can't govern themselves.They are very selfish, greedy and evil by nature. If  any political party, government have too much power, they will certainly hurt others unless they truly know jesus who always teach love and peace. That's why our America's constitution is truly great, because it was written by the God's fairness and wisdom protecting basic human rights that is originally from God . I realized only those who hate God fall into \\""deny the constitution, or change it because it's old ideas\\"". Too old constitution?  Then why the whole world always look upon America when it comes, most well practiced freedom and human right? Please have  reasons.<br /><br />Research the communism nations' history. All the nations turned into  communism fall into worst human rights and economic state from their establishment. Any communist countries in the history ever get better as decades go by?China is the only seemingly doing well now. Why? because from 10 years ago, they realized communism was failed with extreme poverty, started to adapting the partial capitalism into their system-free competitive capitalism. That's the reality people.  If USA turned into communism, the power will shift  to only those who hate the existing American system. They  secretly controlling communicast-medias ( I already see it happened ) and brainwashing the youth with distorted  facts in textbooks  last 20 years. They keep change their names, their activity, and theory. Why? if they openly speak up, they know they will fail because any normal mind people will see the deception and its perversion. Look at these behind scene head members:They are  mostly angry people with extreme hatred.

It's so realistic that I'm afraid it's going to happen all over again.  I have vague memories of having read it way back when I was in junior high, but reading it again recently, I had no memories of the actual book itself, so this time around was basically like reading it the first time around.  And boy am I glad I did decide to reread it.<br /><br />So, it starts of seeming like, what is to me, a dream come true.  The animals of Manor Farm decide to kick the human off the farm.  I've always dreamed about something like this happening somewhere, to show humans that animals really do have feelings and the way we torture them on factory farms, raising them for food, is sickening.  Unfortunately, from there it goes downhill (in terms of my dream of what would happen if this actually did happen in life), and what follows is a brilliantly master-minded story that gives us a unique look at the inner-workings of a socialist/communist society.<br /><br />Sure, with the animals and all, it's fictional, but it's based on truth so much so that, were you to replace the animals with human animals, you would have communist Russia.  Orwell's story is told in such a way that, even though you are reading something serious and important, you are absolutely hooked from line one, and you won't want to put it down until you know what happens to the animals of Manor/Animal Farm.  Even though, if you know a little something about communism, you probably do.<br /><br />I think it was absolutely fitting that Orwell used the guise of \\""pig\\"" for the rulers of his farm.  And the sheep, of course, were always the ones to blindly follow.  It is scathingly critical in the funniest and most appropriate of ways.  Despite the good intentions with which the farm is formed, we see how easily these intentions can change, and how readily the people in charge are willing to brainwash those \\""less intelligent\\"" in order to gain a little more human comfort.  It builds up in such a way, though, that it's almost as if those high up don't even realize what is happening.<br /><br />Animal Farm is satire at its best, and I could go on for ages about how brilliantly Orwell has parodied communism and given all the best reasons it won't work, but the fact is, the book is short and wonderful, so I think it's best for you to just read it for yourself.

BUT because those three men were uniquely corrupt men, then socialism lead (unnecessarily) to Totalitarianism.  Orwell truly believed however that if not for \\""them\\"" (they were unique, and not representative of 'all' men) everything about socialism and communism would have worked out fine.<br /><br />Scholars argue that Orwell's book is really a great defense of capitalism, just quite unintended to be by the author.  It is a defense of capitalism in a back-handed sort of way, But Orwell clearly thought that he was just sending a warning to socialists like himself to be careful not to let this happen.  The beauty of the book is that it really does describe what will happen when capitalism is replaced with socialism.  Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely - however this is not \\""unique\\"" to some men but all men.  Unfortunately Orwell is clearly blind to the facts of historical reality.  He has religous faith in his own concepts.<br /><br />The great lesson of this book (Capitalism is better than Socialism) is obfuscated by the (early in the book) characterization of the capitalists as \\""Alcoholics\\"".  This is, by the way, how we know that Orwell despised capitalism and establishes beyond doubt he hates the free market system.  He in no way advocates for the American way, he is quite anti-American to be sure.  He very unceremoniously dismisses all capitalists in one prejudiced swipe of the brush stroke \\""alcoholic\\"".  Hardly a fair treatment of such a complex system and one so historically successful.  None-the-less THE ingenious question that this book will cause every reader to ask themselves is this:  Do you think all men are corrupt and need policing, or only some?  Orwell answers himself and says \\""only some\\"".  He never gave up his position on the potential ability of socialism to create Utopia.  He simply believed IF the right men were in charge then Utopia would last.<br /><br />Since historical fact shows inevitably all socialist systems (Utopia) lead to totalitarianism (Dystopia) the book falls short of greatness.  History shows it is not just some but all men will devolve into their lowest form when left unchecked.  By creating a capitalist straw-man then burning it down so easily he belies his bias and shows his colors.  Too bad Orwell, you shouldn't have done that, it's intellectually lazy and actually makes his book very much like the character \\""Squealer\\"", the propagandist.<br /><br />Finally the characters in this book remind me of current politicians and organizations:  Obama - \\""Old Major\\"" and  Harry Reid - \\""Napolean\\"" and Pelosi - \\""Snowball\\""  and MSNBC - \\""Squealer\\""<br /><br />I highly reccomend this book to both Conservatives and Progressives alike and challenge someone to write a book that treats the Capitalists fairly and displays how the U.S. Constitution was designed to police free-market capitalism.

Based on the story of the Russian Revolution, it grabs you from the very first sentence and is practically an addicting book to read from start to finish. The story itself is very simple and easy to follow, however, the message it gives you is one that is powerful. This book is one you definitely need to think over when you finish reading it, if even for only a brief minute.<br /><br />Animal Farm is the story of the animals on Mr. Jones' farm. They are abused frequently and harshly overworked, considering themselves to be slaves to him. This abusive treatment, in combination with the words of the wise old boar, Old Major, spark ideas for revenge, freedom, and revolution. The animals, after Major's death, quickly act out their plans, overthrowing the alcoholic Mr. Jones and Mrs. Jones out of the farm and claiming it is their own, \\""Animal Farm\\""<br /><br />Following Mr. Jones' expulsion from Animal Farm, the pigs take over, having prepared for leadership by learning how to read and write. Despite this, things seem to be great at first; freedom finally gracing the animals for the first time in their lives. Through complex propaganda and scaring tactics, the animals slowly lose all the freedom they worked to regain. This continues until the end of the novel, where they are found to be in the exact same position they started in, maybe arguably being in even a worse position.<br /><br />Through Orwell's use of symbolism, parallels can be made from \\""Animal Farm\\"" to the Russian Revolution, teaching you, in a way, like a history book would (Of course I'm not insinuating you read this novel in place of one). The animals all relate to real life people who held significance during the time and actually tell the tale very accurately. Despite this, Orwell is able to make you become attached to some characters, and, at times, can get you angry at what they are forced to endure.<br /><br />Animal Farm is, to say the least, a classic read. While the story is a short one, the messages it leaves behind are huge and inspiring. This story, while sad and depressing in nature, is definitely one I would recommend to anybody.

The narrative centres around farmyard animals who uprise and overthrow their cruel master Mr Jones to live in a utopian society where \\""all animals are equal\\"". The short novel outlines how good the Communist idea was intended to be, and how cruel it could become in the hands of a dictator.<br /><br />Positives<br /><br />In Politics and the English Language, George Orwell denotes that successful authors should : \\""Never use a long word where a short one will do\\"". He applied this rule to Animal Farm and made the book accessible to any audience by doing so ; if read in depth, can be taken as the historical allegory of the fall of Communism in Russia during the years under Stalins' dictatorship, or read simply can be taken merely as a childhood fable (albiet not a very happy one). The book can be understood by children who don't need to understand the political message. The simpleness and grace of the prose of the book easily portrays the tragedy behind the story. The reader is hooked from the strong beginning and will find it easy to read in a couple of hours; Animal Farm is only 10 chapters long! I took History at A Level (I'm so cool, I know) so I think this is why I enjoyed the book, because I was aware of the history behind it. Orwell captures the characters of the political leaders he is satiring well ; Old Major is Karl Marx, with the first idea of Communism, Snowball is Lenin and Napoleon is Stalin. He also portrays the cruelty of how the Russian people were treated very concisely and chillingly; for example the execution of the rebellious chickens. A must-read book, that was well ahead of its time and can be read and allegorised to the majority of governments in society today.<br /><br />Negatives<br /><br />The character development was sacrified in favour of the narrative ; the majority of the characters are not fleshed out as well as I personally would have liked.

This happens not at once, it is a creeping and scaringly not avoidable process!<br />Is this the fate of any free order, that it deteriorates into dictatorship? Is this what Orwell wants to tell us? Not quite! He is about showing us that this is only inevitable when the conscience for freedom values is undermined. But then it might be an imperceptible process which is all the more successful in case of a skilled use of language. The individuals should get accustomed to the wrong and adopt it. This makes them assessable. In the end they have no more own voice and bleat \\""mee\\"" and \\""moo\\"" in lockstep until they can be lead to the butcher unresistantly. At first it is the turn of the unadopted, but in the end all others are in for it, even the rascals. They leave a desert behind. Enough examples in the younger history! Especially the 20th century has excelled in the realization of much promising but less promise keeping ideologies, whose devastating effects will last long.<br />Orwell`s book is an appeal to all to understand and treasure the freedom rights of man as superior sanctity of human possession and to restore them as the most precious good that people have. He hopes that man is wise enough to do it. It is a pious hope.<br />Freedom is always endangered if one or a group of people, a party, a majority etc. has the presumption to connote oneself as only owner of \\""truth\\"". And freedom is getting lost, if it becomes a political will, transformed and applied by the power holders. Ideologies promise always to bring people to their true greatness.

The pigs on the farm become the ruling class in this \\""classless\\"" society. The farm endures an abortive invasion by the humans and gradually devolves into a society similar to the old one that was overthrown with the humans allying with the pig elite. Enough said about the plot. This book today is seen by many as a children's story as some publishers saw it when Orwell first approached them. As the memory of the Soviet Union fades into history this book will lose its edge as political parody.<br /><br />The story of ANIMAL FARM is actually the history of the Soviet state between 1917 and the death of Stalin. The secession of Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin can easily be seen in the story as can the the tyranny of the ruling Politburo. ANIMAL FARM  was probably influenced by Orwell's experience in the Spanish Civil War remembered in HOMAGE TO CATALONIA- a bitter story of Communist double dealings against the Left. The chapters in HOMAGE TO CATALONIA that deal with the labyrinthine left politics of the Spanish Republic are echoed in ANIMAL FARM.<br /><br />ANIMAL FARM raises the same disturbing questions that HOMAGE raised with me when I read it. The tyrant pigs who run the farm are, paradoxically, the ones who save it from the humans and the ones who organize and exploit it. The Soviet Union with its meagre help bought time for the Spanish Republic, advanced the Soviet state's interest in maintaining its military alliance with France, and at the same time prevented a real revolution in Spain. A revolution that could have created a weak Spain possibly occupied by the Nazi war machine. A war machine that would have dominated the western flank of British Egypt and Malta.<br /><br />The West benefited from the tyranny of Stalin with a destructive second front against Hitler.  The farm, with the political machinations of the pigs, was defended from a far worse human tyranny. Was Orwell guilty of aloofness from Realpolitik or did he have excessive idealism? Is the worldview of ANIMAL FARM realistic? Was Orwell a reactionary in red sheep's clothing?<br /><br />The impact of this book was seen as huge and potentially destabilizing when published in 1946.

Gee, guys, it's a political allegory for adults for crying out load!<br /><br />It's also interesting that many of the reviewers read the book in high school, which indicates that their teachers didn't get it either.

I guess she assumed that telling the truth about \\""Animal Farm\\"" makes the novel more interesting, which it sure does.<br /><br />\\""Animal Farm\\"" is anti-Stalinist, not \\""anti-socialist\\"". Orwell believed in democratic, revolutionary socialism. He may have been naïve, of course, but that was his actual position. In the novel, the oppressed animals of a certain farm stage a rebellion against the farmer, Jones. The rebellion is the Russian revolution, while Jones symbolizes the Czar. The animals are led by Old Major, a pig who symbolizes both Lenin and Marx. After the death of Old Major, a battle for control ensues between the pigs Napoleon and Snowball, obviously based on Stalin and Trotsky. The name \\""Napoleon\\"" for the Stalinist pig is presumably based on Trotsky's accusation that Stalin was a \\""Bonapartist\\"". Here, Orwell made an intentional or unintentional mistake, since the Marxist term \\""Bonapartism\\"" originally referred to Louis Bonaparte, not Napoleon Bonaparte. (Of course, Orwell might have chosen the name for a more mundane reason: just as Napoleon \\""betrayed\\"" the French revolution, so Stalin \\""betrayed\\"" the Russian revolution.)<br /><br />In the novel, the pig Napoleon emerges victorious, and transforms the liberated Animal Farm into a new system of oppression by a combination of violence, propaganda and deceit. He also gradually changes the message of Old Major, eventually replacing his commandment \\""All animals are equal\\"" with the classic line \\""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\\"". In the last chapter, Napoleon's pig faction negotiates with humans, and as the other animals are looking in, they realize that the Napoleonic pigs have become so similar to humans, that they are impossible to tell apart. (In the novel, humans symbolize capitalists or monarchists.) Another classical part of the novel deals with the old horse Boxer, who symbolizes the Russian working class. Boxer is eventually sent away to the glue factory by Napoleon.<br /><br />In other words, it's a novel claiming that the true principles of Marx and Lenin were betrayed by Stalin.

Just as Napolean, the pig, instigated a rebellion against the owner of the farm (Jones) by talking about how great things will be once the animals ruled the farm, today we are told by the Obama Democrats that once Bush and the Republicans are thrown off the farm (Washington), that all will be well, that things will look wonderful, and that none of us will ever be hungry again.  In Animal Farm, though, the animals were far worse off after Mr. Jones was kicked off the farm.  Like Obama, Napolean also did not have any experience in running a farm, but this did not stop him from stating that he would be more competent and able to handle the farm.  Further, once Napolean took charge of the farm, the interests of the other animals started to decline more and more.  He started to remove any sense of democratic principles by eliminating the need for public comment and strongly took action against any potential dissent.  This is exactly where the Obama Democrats want to take our country--first, by stating that they (and he alone) can manage the country -- even though there is no experience to suggest that he ought to, and secondly, by eliminating any form of dissent by destroying talk radio and also by heavily regulating and taxing the internet in order to suppress the one free and open medium that is available to counter their message.

Through many hard times and conflicts it comes down to who can survive the new farm life. New leaders, new problems, new jobs, everything is changing for the better. Or is it? Orwell is able to portray the idea \\""absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\"" Animal Farm is a quick read and has a loud and clear message, which Orwell shows through a microcosm of the 1917 Russian revolution.<br /><br />The animals have one goal in mind after they defeat Mr. Jones. That goal would be change. And through this change there will be laws, the Seven Commandments that will help keep the animals equal with one another and make sure the animals don't acquire human-like habits, because the animals don't want to become like the humans who have treated them so terribly and striped them of their freewill. While reading the book you see some animals are starting to create a different status for themselves on the farm, making them more important and able to instruct as well as make decisions for the other animals. I know that while reading Animal Farm I felt angry at the animals that let a new leader control them. Only some of the characters didn't remain loyal to their new leader, and that to me showed bravery, for standing up for something they knew had to be stopped.<br /><br />George Orwell used farm animals to illustrate the struggle for the control of the Soviet Union. The two pigs, Snowball and Napolean, from Animal Farm resemble Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stallin who both fought over power in Russia. Both Napolean and Stallin took all the power for themselves and became greedy and selfish, therefore not fulfilling their promises to their followers. The struggle for authority, throughout history, is an ongoing process.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed reading Animal Farm.

Word had gone around earlier that Old Major a prize Middle White Boar, had a strange dream whose meaning he wanted to explain to the other animals. Major is so highly regarded by the other animals on the farm that everyone was happy to show up.<br /><br />Major tells the other animals that his time on earth is short and that he will be dieing soon but that he feels compelled to pass on the wisdom he has gained. Major points out to the animals that there life is one of misery with most of their time devoted to the gain of others, primarily Farmer Jones. Major tells the animals of his vision of a farm not run by humans but instead by animals. In this utopian society, no animal will be over worked or under fed because all of their toil and work will be for their own collective gain. Major advises that sometime in the future, the Animals must band together and make the utopia a reality, and that is just what the animals do......<br /><br />Animal Farm is an allegory about communism as viewed through the eyes of George Orwell (Eric Blair). It has been rumored that the two conflicting leaders on the farm young boars named Snowball and Napoleon are actually based off of former Russian leader and Politician Joseph Stalin and Politician Leon Trotsky. Like Stalin and Trotsky Snowball and Napoleon are at constant odds and are always trying to move the farm in opposite directions with the price for their bickering being bore by the other animals on the farm.<br /><br />The Good: This was a good short read lending insight to how Communism can and did unfold.

George Orwell (1903 - 1950) was the pen name of the British author Eric Blair, who developed an early enmity towards those in power and their abuses of power.  Orwell was a socialist but came to witness the horrors of the Soviet state and the betrayal of his ideals by Stalinists.  As such, Orwell came to loathe totalitarianism in general and wrote novels, including this book and _1984_, showing the degrading effects such societies (and in particular the communism of the Soviet state) had on people.  Orwell's books are indeed prophetic and show us a world in which the very life-force has been sapped out of mankind by those in power.  Orwell imagines a highly efficient totalitarian state, capable of enforcing political correctness at the highest levels, tampering with the memories of men (or animals as is the case in this book), and maintaining a total disregard for the truth.  Orwell shows how under such regimes the very notion of truth becomes suspect and the individual can no longer distinguish between fact and state propaganda.  This particularly applies to the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin, which is the primary setting for Orwell's stories.  During the Second World War, when Stalin was regarded as an ally by many British, Orwell's stories came as a shock in that they showed the vile nature of the Soviet regime.<br /><br />_Animal Farm_ begins as the Manor Farm of the human farmer Mr. Jones, who the animals believe exploit them.  As such, the animals on the farm gather together and stage a rebellion against the human exploiters so that they may together own the farm to work for the benefit of all animals.  The story begins as Old Major, a prize white boar near the end of his life, tells of a future society in which animals work together free from the exploitation of man.  It has been suggested that Old Major very likely represents either Marx or Lenin, the precursors of the Russian revolution.  Following this, all the animals join together in singing the traditional folk song \\""The Beasts of England\\"", expressing their hope for a better society.  Following this, the animals stage a revolt against Mr. Jones and drive him from the farm, assuming ownership of the farm themselves and re-naming it \\""Animal Farm\\"".  In particular, two pigs named Snowball and Napoleon come to play prominent parts as leaders; however, soon there develops rival factions surrounding each of these pigs.  Together the animals create the Seven Commandments of Animalism, which maintain that all animals are equal and that those who go upon four legs or have wings are friends while those who go upon two legs are enemies.  However, as the story continues, all seven of the commandments are eventually to be broken by the pig leadership.  The animals then begin working together on the farm and design their own society ruled by animals.  However, a rivalry develops between the pigs, Snowball and Napoleon.  Snowball advocates building a windmill while Napoleon opposes it.  Eventually, Napoleon and his dogs are to drive Snowball from the farm; however, the memory of Snowball is to forever come back and haunt the animals and he is systematically blamed for whatever goes wrong on the farm.  It has been suggested that while Snowball represents the character Leon Trotsky from the Russian revolution, Napoleon represents the vile dictator Josef Stalin.  Napoleon then begins consolidating his power and little by little takes over all aspects of the farm.  Napoleon also uses propaganda and uses the pig Squealer to manipulate the animals and provide an alternate history which places Napoleon at the center of the rebellion.  Other characters on the farm include the work horse Boxer (whose mottos \\""I will work harder\\"" and \\""Napoleonis always right\\"" serve to illustrate his persistence but whose role on the farm is cruelly exploited by the pigs and who is eventually cruelly killed by them - perhaps reminiscent of the Soviet Stakhanovite movement), the horses Clover and Mollie, the sheep (perhaps reminiscent of the proletariat), the raven Moses (who preaches of a \\""Sugarcandy mountain\\"" in the sky where animals go after death - reminiscent of religion and the churches), the dogs (Napoleon's private guards), the cat, and Benjamin the donkey.  As time passes, the pigs led by Napoleon begin abusing their power and breaking the Seven Commandments.  They drink alcohol, they have dealings with humans on other farms, the stage a great show trial in which they slaughter animals believed to be spies for Snowball, etc.  Throughout the book Napoleon continues to engage in negotiations with human owners of other farms and in particular a conflict develops between Mr. Frederick and Mr. Pilkington, reminiscent of other leaders that Stalin engaged in negotiations with.  Meanwhile, life on the farm continues to grow worse and worse, with longer and harder working hours and less benefits, though the animals have forgotten whether life was better or worse under Mr. Jones.  At the end, the animals see for themselves exactly what the pigs have wrought, as it is shown that the pigs are no different than the humans.  This book also shows the collaboration between the big capitalists and the communist leaders, both of whom plotted against the people to consolidate power in the hands of a few.  The book ends on a very disturbing note, in which we see the complete abandonment of the ideals which launched the rebellion by the pigs.<br /><br />Orwell's books provide classic and disturbing accounts of the horrors of Soviet totalitarianism.  They show us an efficient bureaucratic apparatus capable of sapping the life from the very people it claims to represent.  As such, they are classic tales of the dangers that lurk behind totalitarianism and the manner in which human idealism is exploited by evil dictators.

Eric Blair, whose pseudonym was George Orwell, made the purpose of his writing very clear :<br /><br />\\""Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism... \\""Animal Farm\\"" was the first book in which I tried, with full consciousness of what I was doing, to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole.\\"" - \\""Why I Write\\"" (1947)<br /><br />Reading \\""Animal Farm\\"" has become as emblematic for American education as singing \\""Beasts of England\\"" was for Animalism. Interestingly, despite being a product of the post-war era, Orwell utilizes themes that predate the advent of Communism by nearly 2500 years. The Greek writer, Aesop, wrote a fable entitled \\""The Frogs Who Demanded a King\\"" whose moral was:<br /><br />\\""It is better to be ruled by passive, worthless men who bear no spitefulness (e.g. Mr. Jones, Manor Farm) than by productive but wicked ones (e.g. Napoleon, Animal Farm).\\"" - \\""Aesop: The Complete Fables\\"" (1998)<br /><br />In addition, the cart-horse Boxer's sense of duty, hard work, and false hope resembles the ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus. Even the transition of Manor Farm to Animal Farm and back again resembles the four stages of government outlined in Plato's Republic - monarchy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny. Unfortunately for the reader, Greek thought tended to be rather deterministic; leaving us with little hope when reading \\""Animal Farm\\"" within this deeper context. Even C.M. Woodhouse, the conservative British Member of Parliament from Oxford, who wrote the book's introduction, tells us that the moral of the story is: \\""Life is like that - take it or leave it.\\""<br /><br />Are we to accept this? This conflicts with our innate sense of justice. For example, is it fair (or even inevitable) that certain classes in society should enjoy more privilege and prestige, though they contribute less than others, solely because of their unique, yet, intangible knack for organizing and leading? Orwell raises this issue when he writes:<br /><br />\\""The pigs did not actually work, but directed and supervised the others. With their superior knowledge it was natural that they should assume the leadership\\"" (35)... \\""We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organization of this farm depend on us\\"" (42).<br /><br />But while the whole of Greek philosophy seems to disproportionately weigh in favor of Benjamin's perspective on life; we must surely ask ourselves whether or not there exists some positive purpose as to why this book continues to be read so ubiquitously. After all, we read \\""Animal Farm\\"" with the implied understanding that some good shall come from it. Fortunately, we may find solace in the political philosophy of Englishman, John Stuart Mill. He advocated a style of participatory democracy. Perhaps Mill can breathe new hope into politics, provided people accept their civic responsibility and remain vigilant.

While it is considered a great and important work today, it had a difficult time being published.  He wrote the story between November 1943 and February of 1944 (although he got the idea for the story in 1937), but he was turned down by four publishers before Secker and Warburg accepted the book.  Even then it was not published until August of 1945.  One of the publishers, Jonathan Cape, was originally going to publish the book, until he was warned against it by \\""an important official\\"", who as it turned out was a Soviet spy.<br /><br />This story is a masterful in the way it recreates many of the historical events of the Soviet Union in the context of the farm.  The Russian Revolution, the Russian Civil War, Stalin's removal of Trotsky, putting Lenin's body on display, the Great Purge, the replacement of the Soviet national anthem, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact as well as the invasion by Nazi Germany are all portrayed in context of the story, and there are probably more examples as well.  The characters as well have counterparts, in some cases they represent entire groups (e.g. the sheep represent the proletariats) and in other cases one or two individuals (e.g. Napoleon is Stalin, Snowball is Trotsky, Squealer is Molotov, Old Major is Karl Marx and Lenin, etc.).  Even the humans in the story have counterparts, such as Mr. Jones (Czar Nicholas II), Mr. Frederick (Nazi Germany), Mr. Pilkington (The West).<br /><br />George Orwell is the pseudonym of Eric Arthur Blair, who was born on June 25th of 1903, and died on January 21st of 1950.  He was a socialist for the majority of his life, and those who view \\""Animal Farm\\"" or \\""1984\\"" as a rejection of socialism are incorrect.  He viewed totalitarianism as the opposite of true socialism, and while he probably approved of social revolutions he clearly thought that once the revolution was successful the best thing the people could do would be to take the power away from those who led the revolution.  Some consider him a Trotskyist because of this story, but that too is incorrect.  While Trotsky's character in the story is certainly not portrayed as badly as Stalin's, he is there for the initial corruption of the pigs.<br /><br />While this book may have had difficulty getting published initially, and was criticized by many because of its anti-Soviet (i.e. anti-ally) message, things have changed.  Today it is a book of critical acclaim.  It is still being recognized as well.  For example, in 1996 in was awarded the Retro-Hugo award for best novella from the year 1945.<br /><br />The Everyman's Library edition of \\""Animal Farm\\"" has some nice material included.  There is an introduction by Julian Symons which goes into much more detail about Orwell's life as well as the history of this story.  Next there is a Select Bibliography which covers Orwell's works.  There is a chronology of Orwell's life, including historical and literature contexts for the most significant events in his life.  There is a brief textual note by Peter Davison, discussing some of the decisions made in producing this edition.  Then, following the text are the controversial preface to the book and the preface to the Ukranian edition.<br /><br />The preface which had been left out originally is particularly interesting, as it contains Orwell's thoughts which still have application in today's world.  He wrote:  \\""If one loves democracy, the argument runs, one must crush its enemies by no matter what means.  And who are its enemies?  It always appears that they are not only those who attack it openly and consciously, but those who `objectively' endanger it by spreading mistaken doctrines.  In other words, defending democracy involves destroying all independence of thought.  This argument was used, for instance, to justify the Russian purges.\\""  He also writes in the next paragraph:  \\""These people don't see that if you encourage totalitarian methods, the time may come when they will be used against you instead of for you.\\""nce, to justify the Russian purges.\\""  He also writes in the next paragraph:  \\""These people don't see that if you encourage totalitarian methods, the time may come when they will be used against you instead of for you.\\"" <br />",2006-05-25

The author, born in India of English parents, was a socialist and wrote this profound piece of political satire with the aim of destroying the Soviet myth.  George Orwell wanted to show that the Soviets were using the rhetoric of socialism to veil their vicious statism and that the Soviets were not at all socialist, despite their claims that they were.  One senses that if Orwell were alive today, he would write an Animal Farm that could  strip away the myth from Tony Blair and George Bush doing war in the name of freedom when they are actually waging state terrorism and killing tens of thousands of civilians.  Cutting through what Orwell would later term \\""Doublespeak\\"" in another book (1984) is Orwell's aim.<br /><br />The tale begins by introducing old Major, a talking boar who describes the horrible conditions all animals live under at Manor Farm.  Major dreams of a socialist-type revolution where the \\""Man\\"" can be overthrown by the animals:  \\""Only get rid of Man\\"" and everything would be peaceful for the animals.  Major dies but the other animals are left inspired.<br /><br />Their opportunity arises when the Man goes on a drinking binge and neglects the feeding of the farm animals.  Starving, they must act and action is inspired by a combination of remembrance of Major and of dire straits; the animals take over the farm.  Manor Farm is renamed Animal Farm.  So far this is an allegorical retelling of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia when the starving peasants took control of the state from the decadent ruling class.  The remaining events in the story mirror events that actually happened in Russia under Soviet rule.  In the end, the pigs are no different from the Man.<br /><br />Historically, this has been the fate of all revolutions.

US,20787360,RND2NLEXDZEDG,0151072558,380925201,Animal Farm,Books,5,2,2,N,N,"Political Allegory in Animal Farm","Recently, I read George Orwell's famous novel, Animal Farm.  I was amazed at how much I liked reading it.  Orwell has an uncanny ability to present a seemingly simple, entertaining story, and embed in it with deep philosophical and political issues.  I have read two other works by Orwell, Shooting an Elephant and 1984, both of which possess the same type of political allegory that is demonstrated in Animal Farm.  The use of allegory in Orwell's story about an animal uprising in a typical British farm serves to enlighten the reader about common political issues in society.  When Animal Farm was first sold, some shop owners mistakenly place the novel in the children's section due to the simplicity and \\""fictional\\"" nature of the book.  In actuality, the novel was written as a political allegory concerning old Communist Russia.<br /><br />Although the novel parallels perfectly with the Soviet Union's history, many social and political commonalities can be seen between the pigs and dogs and the governments of many modern countries.  In the beginning of the story, all of the animals take over the farm and establish a society in which all of the animals are essentially equal.  Each animal pledges to do equal amounts of work and do his/her part in creating a better life for themselves.  Much like the theories of Communism, the plan seems perfect, but as always, there are animals that strive to manipulate the system and gain more power than the other animals.  In the initial stages of the creation of the new farm, the animals write the rules which they pledge to follow on a wall.  As time progresses and the pigs want to gain power, they alter the rules slightly so that they will coincide with what the pigs desire.  For example, the initial fifth commandment of the animals read \\""No animal shall drink alcohol,\\"" but after the pigs taste alcohol and decide that they like it, they alter the text so that it reads \\""No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.\\""  The other animals feel like something is different about the rules but the pigs convince them that the rule has always been written that way.  Much like in 1984, the leaders (pigs) brainwash the other animals into forgetting about the true history so that it will not contradict what they say during the present.  This element of Animal Farm instills a sense of doubt in the reader that maybe the history that has been taught to him during his entire lifetime is simply a biased or cleverly fabricated story created by the corrupt leaders of the past.<br /><br />The most alarming twist of Orwell's novel is when the pigs decided to change the fundamental teachings of Major that four legs are bad, and two legs are good to the exact opposite.  Although pigs walking on their hind legs might seem humorous on the surface, it is a quite disturbing example of how the beliefs of someone can be completely altered by corrupt people who desire power and strive to achieve their own personal goals rather than the goals of the community.<br /><br />The fundamental purpose of Orwell's writings is to present politically and socially important issues disguised in well written stories to raise questions about our society and government.  Raising such questions is sometimes harder to do when speaking about those issues directly.  The use of literature to speak about important issues is very effective in that the reader can let his guard down while reading a work and see for himself the important issues presented in the work without having other people directly saying the same thing.  In presenting the issues in symbolic or metaphorical ways, the impact will be greater and the viewpoints will be more highly understood.l like something is different about the rules but the pigs convince them that the rule has always been written that way.

Cleverly laid lore sure to entertain whether through amusement or insight, a must read for all. Highly suggested and speedy through the dark nights in which you sit in stupor on your couch after the repetition of your o-so-delightful day.<br /><br />Mat Perrin, esq.",2006-01-27

George Orwell is a pen name of Eric Blair, an advocate of socialism. Blair wrote this book to SUPPORT socialism, thinking that by showing how socialism became communism, he could show that communism was what was wrong, not socialism. Unfortunately, all he did was to show that socialism devolves into communism, making people wary of BOTH socialism and communism, thus his own book hindered his own cause.<br /><br />I will not ever comment on the storyline and its relation to communism other than to say that it is very well done and provides an excellent simplification of what communism in Russia did. Others have already posted more than most of you probably want to read about its meaning, so I will not even bother starting on it.<br /><br />In short, this is a quick and delightful read which I highly reccomend to people of nearly all ages.",2005-12-25

Many children read it this way, siding with the animals against the farmer, saddened when things go wrong because of the nasty pigs, and weeping at the fate of Boxer.  But the tale was devised as a satire on the Soviet Union, and although the country no longer exists, the influence it exerted on our ways of living and thinking certainly stayed with us and probably will for many years.<br />  Although Animal Farm was a satire on the Russian Revolution, it was also intended to have a wider application.  That kind of revolution as Orwell defined as \\""violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power-hungry people\\"", could only lead to a change of masters.  He went on: \\""I meant the moral to be that revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert and know how to chuck out their leaders as soon as the latter have done their job\\"" (Orwell xl).<br /> Animal Farm is an accurate portrayal of the Russian Revolution and is probably one of the best novels ever written.  All of the characters represented a figure from the revolution.  Old Major is Marx, Boxer and Clover represent the proletariat, Napoleon is Stalin, Snowball for Leon Trotsky, Farmer Frederick is Hitler Germany, etc.  Even the windmill and the farmhouse represent something from the revolution.  Mr. Jones' house becomes the Kremlin and the building of the windmill corresponds to Stalin's various<br />Page 1<br />Page 2<br />plans for rapid industrialization.<br /> Orwell succeeds in conveying the right message, not just about the Russian Revolution, but of any revolution; there is always going to be a person or persons that take advantage of their power and of the people that believe in them.  Most of the time when there is a new leader that person wants to help the people, but as time goes on they get greedy and power hungry and could care less about the people.  At the beginning of the novel one of the animals commandments were \\""All Animals are Equal\\"" (Orwell 16). They all did the same amount of work, received the same amount of food, etc.  Then the pigs decided that because they were smarter they should receive more food, do less work, etc.  Soon enough the pigs were living in Mr. Jones' house, drinking alcohol, wearing clothes, while all the other animals were made to do all the work.  By the end of the novel the commandment stated \\""All Animals are Equal but Some Animals are More Equal Than Others\\"" (88).  This is true with most governments.  The leaders make the people believe that they are just like them, but in reality the leaders sit their in their big comfy chairs reaping all of the benefits, while the working class is doing all of the dirty work and getting the butt end of the deal.<br /> In conclusion, Animal Farm is a novel of importance.  It is a classic that will be read for decades more to come.  One reason for its mass appeal is the classic simplicity of its language and style.  The vocabulary is ordinary and commonplace without being so basic and limited as to be interesting only to children.  Another important quality is its imaginative power.

The book Animal Farm by George Orwell makes this old saying true.  Beyond the old tattered pages lies a timeless classic.  This story is about the life on a  farm.  The animals and the farm duties are neglected and the animals are  fed up with Farmer Jones.  Lead by a prize pig Major, the animals decide to  revolt.  The animals take over the farm and run the farm for themselves.  When doing this they change the name to Animal Farm and now they are  completely in charge.  Later in the story some of the animals break the  rules and make their own rules for life on the farm.  This only leads to  problems with the operation of the farm.  The story of Animal Farm is told  in a simple straightforward style.  The sentences are often short and  simple.  &quot;Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing.&quot;  This  story is a fictitious story that is a fable.  This means that is usually  has a moral and animals act like humans.  Orwell did a great job of making  these animals very much like humans.  In the story for example the dogs  still bite and growl, yet the still support Napoleon's drive for political  power.  Another example is how the pigs eat mash and they also drink  whiskey and walk on two legs by the end of the story.  I feel the moral of  the story was revealed in the last lines of the story.  &quot;Twelve voices  were shouting in anger, and they were all alike.  No question, now, what  had happened to the faces of the pigs.  The creatures outside looked from  pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it  was impossible to say which was which.&quot;  I hope I didn't ruin the  ending of the story for you.  This story also has great description that  kept me interested.  &quot;With the ring of light from his lantern dancing  from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the  back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the  scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already  snoring.&quot;  I felt that this book was very easy to read; yet the  meaning behind it took more time to grasp.  It is only 118 pages and can be  finished on a rainy afternoon.  The story's ending summed up the plot of  the story very well.  This happened when the last commandment was written  &quot;But some animals are more equal than others.&quot;  This had been  proven true when the pigs rebelled from all of the other farm commandments.  I liked this book a lot because it seemed to be very realistic.  Even  though these were animals, their actions were almost just like humans.  This story might not be for everyone because of the deep messanges  portrayed at the end of the story.  Yet I would recommend this book to most  anyone because it makes you see that there isn't a perfect society  anywhere.

This happened when the last commandment was written  &quot;But some animals are more equal than others.&quot;  This had been  proven true when the pigs rebelled from all of the other farm commandments.   I liked this book a lot because it seemed to be very realistic.  Even  though these were animals, their actions were almost just like humans.   This story might not be for everyone because of the deep messanges  portrayed at the end of the story.

He accomplished that much in a startlingly effective way.  But what has he really told us?  What actually made Stalinist Russia turn out the way it did?  Was the evil in the &quot;animals&quot; that meted out their torture to the rank-and-file, or was it in the IDEAS that spawned these animals?  Orwell does not explore these ideas at all, so he never gets to the root of what happened on the farm, or in Soviet Russia, for that matter.  He compellingly shows us that  tyranny and murder are horrible, but we KNOW that already.  He never comes close to the real issue here:  what  ALLOWED these horrible things to take place, and how do we prevent it from taking place on other &quot;farms&quot;?  Orwell, unfortunately, offers his readers no insight there.<br /><br />Orwell even seems to imply that, had Snowball (or Trotsky) been able to wrest power away from Napoleon (or Stalin), that everything would have been better.  He fails to recognize that giving ANYONE that kind of power over individuals necessarily ends in disaster.  Any ideology that demands the self immolation of the individual for the &quot;good&quot; of the collective leads to the destruction of the individual, and, eventually even to the destruction of the collective (i.e., all individuals).  Unfortunately, with Orwell's book as our only guidance, we are left scratching our heads when looking for the answer to &quot;why&quot;, and left helpless against  any POTENTIAL dictator who tells us he has the REAL answers.<br /><br />Read this book for its sensory value, then pick up THE OMINOUS PARALLELS by Leonard Peikoff (non-fiction) for a credible response to the questions Orwell leaves, not only unanswered, but unasked.",1998-02-06

It is like those political caricatures which appear on the magazines; crisp and yet to the point.

Kudos to George Orwell for writing a book which stands the test of time. Not many novels (especially political sattires) can boast it as this book claims.

It turns out the pigs are the most intelligent, and end up managing the running of the farm. The corruption and politics of the pigs and the way they take advantage of the other animals becomes more and more extreme.<br />This has some clear parallels with Nineteen Eighty Four too. The pigs rewrite history and convince the others that things happened differently to how they remember, and rewrite their '7 Commandments' subtly in their favour and so on.

I'm sure I wouldn't learnt about it in high school, but that was a long time ago and I've long since forgotten. Therefore, I started reading the Preface, but since it was pretty meaningless to me (and such things tend to bore me to tears), I skipped to Chapter 1.<br /><br />This book blew... my... mind! I'm struggling to come up with things to say about it that wouldn't give too much away for the few people who haven't read it yet. It really doesn't take any understanding of the historical events to understand what this book is about.<br /><br />It's extremely easy to read and quite short. It truly ropes you into the lives, hopes and dreams of the characters in a way that few other books have.<br /><br />It conjured up thoughts in my mind of people like Saddam Hussein and Robert Mugabe, both freedom fighters and struggle heroes of their own time. It shows that a socialist state will never work because of the simple human flaw: Power corrupts. It shows that the vast majority don't actually want freedom, don't know how to be free, and quite possibly don't understand what freedom actually is. People need to be led, and that those leaders will always take advantage of that.<br /><br />I'm glad that people (and really, there were around four or five people that simultaneous suggested I read this book... and then I started seeing it everywhere on Goodreads) finally convinced me to read this book. I'm only sorry it took me 32 years to finally do so, when so many had actually had it as a set-work in school.<br /><br />I would've given it more stars, were it not for the boring and unnecessary preface - which according to Wikipedia was only added later anyway.",2012-12-23

I saw the animated film version years ago and as I remember it was very effective. I only read a few pages as I had no real wish to read it knowing what a gloomy tale it told.  From the little I read I could tell it has become somewhat dated as communism is no longer the dire threat to western civilisatiion it was when the book came out.  Of course, the corruptive influence of power is ever with us as is totalitarianism in various guises around the world.  And I do think George Orwell did pigs a disservice; they are fine animals and as far as I know they have shown no signs of wishing to rule the world.",2012-10-09

It bothers me a little that the one star review of this book was written by a kid who was forced to read this book in 9th grade; however, I understand. No one is going to like a book they are forced to read, but in the larger picture of the human condition and the social order Orwell is as important as Shakespeare in terms of far reaching themes and ideas.
