Wolfram Kandinsky uses a harsh, grating monotone.  It's a strange artistic decision, if it was intentional.  There is no way I could get through 18 hours of it -- or even a couple of hours.  It's interesting that the Audible version available here uses a different narrator, Malcolm Hillgartner.  I haven't purchased it yet but the sample is promising and I think I would recommend that route instead.  Try the preview here: [[ASIN:B002ZJ1V8O Herzog]]",2012-08-16
US,23126283,R3NKTPMSBQ2NAC,B003IY7NLO,303427184,Herzog,Books,3,1,1,N,N,"Interesting but well trodden territory","This is only the second Saul Bellow book I have read- the first being the excellent \\""Henderson the Rain King\\""- and while unfamiliar with the rest of his canon, Saul Bellow's \\""Herzog\\"" falls squarely in the camp of literature that I would call Philip Roth land.  \\""Herzog\\"" is the story of a middle aged Jewish man, twice divorced, relatively estranged from his two children, scholarly yet dissatisfied with the scholarly world, and enduring a mid-life crisis that finds him writing letters compulsively, letters to friends, ex-lovers, politicians, philosophers, historical figures, anyone and everyone.<br />  The story starts as Herzog starts to pick up the pieces of his life after his second divorce, a bitter, unpleasant one that he did not want, but was inevitable thanks to his superficial, mean-spirited second wife.  Bellow fills in the story through the conceit of Herzog's letter writing; thus, while the details of Herzog's past life are eventually given, not much really happens in the book as the reader merely treads water as we catch up on the past.  It is not until more than three-quarters through the book that Herzog takes action and stuff starts to actually happen- a new love, one last attempt to get even with his ex-wife, a spur of the moment decision to act drastically and be active and not merely passive- and even though this provides a much needed burst of energy, the way it all pans out is kind of a let down.<br />  In Bellow's \\""Henderson the Rain King\\"", the author deals with one man's mid-life crisis by sending that man to the interior of Africa and letting him fend for himself far from the security of modern day America, i.e. an interesting take on a common theme.  In \\""Herzog\\"", Bellow drags us through this mid-life crisis day by day, and while the writing is good and Herzog, the character, can be quite funny at times, the overall effect is rather underwhelming.<br />  A good book but in now way a must read.",2012-06-14

The person is born to become an orphan and to leave orphans, but an armchair like this armchair is a big consolation if one can afford him.\\""<br /><br />This quotation from the novel \\""HERZOG\\"" has been remembered to me more than 40 years - and, among the rest, has led of course to the fact, that I have procured a nice comfortable ear armchair in the Oxford style for myself. The small passage at the beginning of the novel already rescues in itself the whole message: Not totally despair as it is in vogue in certain intellectual layers over and over again, but enjoy that there are in the life also over and over again small things which give consolation, courage and even joy.<br /><br />In this case the erotic situations - count to it RAMONA (from Buenos Aires; \\""she went with quick firmness and clattered with the sales in vigorous, Castilian kind.

He spends much of his time writing angry letters to people, both dead and alive, such as then ex-President Eisenhower and the late philosopher Nietzsche.  Letters to ex-wives and current girl friends, to former doctors and lawyers, and authors to whom he strongly disagrees.  Part of his problem is his brain; it won't slow down.  Another part is his restlessness.  He has no home base, but moves from dilapidated house to infested apartment, to flop house hotel, etc.  He needs to settle down.  He also does a lot of stupid things, like carrying a loaded gun around Chicago for several days.  Or, does he plan on using it? He's loved by his siblings and his children who are now in the custody of their mothers, hated by the above-mentioned ex-wives, tolerated by many others.  His life is in such turmoil that he can't keep a job and has stopped looking for one, even though he is an acclaimed college professor and has been offered a great editing position.  Instead, he remains broke and dependant on the largesse of his wealthy older brother.  His is a mind and soul to be studied and Bellow rises to the task.  There are moments of darkness, of pathos, of bewilderment, offset by passion, compassion and humor.  You will not soon forget the man named Moses Herzog.",2011-03-07
