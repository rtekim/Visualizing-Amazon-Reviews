The book was in terrible shape so it was not as described. It was for a particular individual and certainly could not be given as the gift I'd intended	2014-08-18

This is one of his early works, and seemingly autobiographical to some extent. I'll need to read more of his work to see why he received the award. This book goes nowhere, has no particular message, is written in a herky-jerky style, and it has many sentences that lack either a noun or a verb. This makes for a particularly awkward flow to the prose. I can't really say that I enjoyed it, nor can I recommend the book.	2013-03-28
