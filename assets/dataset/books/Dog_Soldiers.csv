Save your time for the real masterworks of the 1970's","The conventional wisdom goes that this book is a scathing examination of how far the ideals of the flower power generation had fallen by the mid 1970s. A would-be heroin smuggler returns from Vietnam to find that his real war is in America, amidst a revolving cast of of dissipated junkies, sleazy hustlers, violent thugs and burnt out old hippies.<br /><br />Maybe as a millenial reading this in 2015, I'm just generationally too far removed from the social fabric of this age to really 'get it,' but I thought 'Dog Soliders' kind of sucked. Stone's prose is tight and focused, but a lot of the times it descends into cheap thriller territory; the characters are just blandly symbolic stereotypes, and the only thing that really has much energy or drive is the plot as it pushes forward to a bizarre, climactic shootout in the woods of California (Get it? America IS Vietnam, man.)<br /><br />Maybe at some point in the past it was considered brilliant to have your characters more or less look into the camera and start riffing on the decline of the U.S. in the post-war era; I doubt it impressed a lot of readers in the 70s, it sure made me roll my eyes at several points. This is fundamentally a thriller that I think Stone tried to make 'literary' just by adding some pungent social commentary to. Instead he ends up with a sort-of-thriller where the characters just seem to do an awful lot of shallow whining about obliquely hinted at social changes while getting shunted from one plot-point to the next.<br /><br />This was published a year after Thomas Pynchon's 'Gravity's Rainbow' and a year before William Gaddis's 'JR' (both of which, along with Dog Soliders, won the national book award in their respective years), both of those books are massive, massively rich stylistic fugues which helped push our idea of what the the novel is and can do into extreme, new directions. I like plot driven books, and I enjoy social realism, and its not really fair to compare what Stone does to what Pynchon and Gaddis do. But my point is that even by the standards of other big-name works of its age, Dog Soldiers is a pretty bland mediocrity.ynchon and Gaddis do.

The story that follows is less about Vietnam, and more about what was happening to people back at home during the war. Unlike other books that I have read which are about this era, but written at a remove from the time, this book really gave a sense that people thought that the abrupt changes happening in America were signs that the end of the world was coming. So many people had experienced terrible things while serving in Vietnam and then came home and were unable to unsee them. Furthermore, people at home were using drugs with a frequency and in volumes that seemed to be an effort to blot out the world.<br />I enjoyed a lot of the scenes in this book for the detailed descriptions they gave of Vietnam era America.

I felt this way about Post Office by Charles Bukowski and Play It As It Lays by Joan Didion. And now this one.<br /><br />The Dog Soldiers won the National Book Award in 1975 and has been included on Time's Top 100 Novels list. It has been compared to Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and I can see that Stone aims for that same theme and tone. But he misses it by a mile. Instead we have portraits of people who are aimless, without emotion, motivated by impulse, drug and alcohol addled, cynical and dead inside. Whereas Conrad's novel portrays dark universal traits in precise yet metaphorical prose, Stone's book features characters who are all petty and actually fairly naive, rather than being seduced by the black impulses of the human psyche. And the writing all sounds like a hip screen play. It is very much a novel of the '70s, with the frequent use of drug slang and the general cynicism of the late Vietnam War era, when the hippie dreams had failed.<br /><br />The plot goes a little something like this: John Converse has been half-heartedly covering the Vietnam War as a journalist, when he decides to attempt a big heroine drug deal, though he is inexperienced in trafficking. He enlists the help of an old friend and of his stateside wife, only to have them disappear from sight when a corrupt Federal agent enters the picture. From here on the novel becomes pretty much a standard thriller, with the race on to see who ends up with the drugs.<br /><br />Sometimes when I dislike a novel I realize that it's because my least favorite people in the world are those who are aimless and selfish and self-destructive and substance addicted and blame society for all their problems.

The story is largely the stuff of pulp fiction, elevated to literature of a very high order by virtue of Robert Stone's razor-sharp prose, complex characters, and his honest depiction of violence in all its many guises.  In the wanning days of the Vietnam War, a battle-hardened soldier named Hicks is paid to smuggle into the U.S. a large cache of heroin; when he deviates from the pre-arranged plan, he sets in motion a violent chain of events that, in terms of their intensity and body count, bear an all-too-frightening resemblenace to the war Hicks left behind.       On the run, Hicks is persued by characters worthy of Jim Thompson at his demented best.  Among them are DEA agents and cops who may or may not be legitimate, drug dealers with a penchant for sadism, an aspiring screen writer who misjudges Hicks with disasterous results, and an odd assorment of other less than honorable types.  Hick's companion on his hell-bound journey is a bored, drug-addled housewife with an insatiable appetite for heroin and mayhem.  And the odyssey itself sends Hicks hurdling head-long through a California landscape of annonymous suburbs and dead end border towns that in Stone's twisted vision of reality are nothing short of nightmarish.        I've long thought that Robert Stone is deserving of a far bigger readership that he currently enjoys.  But in rereading Dog Soldiers recently I realized that there is good reason why his audience is relatively small.  While he dabbles in genres that are typically the province of popular fiction -- drugs, terrorism, political assassination -- his stories are imbued with a pitiless view of humanity that provides none of the escapism that readers gererally look for in pop fiction.  In this sense Stone is not unlike Graham Greene (the writer I think Stone most closely resembles), who, even in his \\""entertainments,\\"" could not help but speak the truth, even if it cost him readers.

[[ASIN:1450248993 Things That Make No Sense]] Stone wrote:\\""The last moral objection (to smuggling heroin) that Converse experienced in the traditional manner had been his reaction to the Great Elephant Zap of the previous year. [[ASIN:0962852422 The Land of a Million Elephants]] That winter, the Military Advisory Command, Vietnam, had decided that elephants were enemy agents because the NVA used them to carry things, and there ensued a scene worthy of the Ramayana. Many-armed, hundred-headed MACV had sent forth steel-bodied flying insects (helicopter gun ships) to destroy his enemies, the elephants.<br /><br />All over the country, whooping sweating gunners descended from the cloud cover to stampede the herds and mow them down with 7.62 millimeter machine guns. The Great Elephant Zap had been too much and had disgusted everyone. Even the chopper crews who remembered the day as one of insane exhilaration had been somewhat appalled. There was a feeling that there were limits. [[ASIN:0060903287 The Politics of Heroin in South East Asia]] And as for dope, Converse thought, and addicts-if the world is going to contain elephants pursued by flying men, people are just naturally going to want to get high. So there, Converse thought, that's the way it's done. He had confronted a moral objection and overridden it\\"". Obviously, this twisted analogy to justify selling heroin made as little sense to me as the end of the story (what happens to the heroin and the people smuggling it).

This is the place where everybody finds out who they are.&quot; -Converse<br />Dog Soldiers is a story laced with despair, paranoia, and several other not so fuzzy moods, and this quote from the main character elegantly demonstrates this mood.  The tone of the book was a point of interest and displeasure for me, since this was one of my first experiences with total negativity, it was a fun struggle for me to understand the point or the necessity of such an angry mood.  At the same time it made me very uncomfortable, sometimes to the point where I would have to stop reading for the day.<br />There is a constant stream of action in this story, which makes it rather difficult to process what's going on as it happens.  The story rarely drags and it is written so that it feels very real and alive.  Slang terms are used often too, which are also hard to understand.  But after the first few chapters it seems that most readers are able to get around this and start enjoying the fast paced style in which the book is written.  This style also adds to the mood of panic and paranoia that encompass the entire book as Marge, Hicks, and Converse try to flee with their dope.<br />Marge, Hicks, and Converse are the book's three main characters, and as the plot follows first Converse's activities and then moves back and forth between Hicks and Converse, these two main characters develop into very complicated people.  Marge's character isn't delved into as much, but it didn't seem to be that she was usually thinking about much besides the next time she could get high.  Some of the things Converse and Hicks did or said still baffle me, just like the characters that are a part of my real life.

The novel was assigned as a high school project in Iowa, and the kids who had to read it seem to have flocked en masse online (perhaps part of the project) to review it. I found reading these reviews very entertaining, and recommend the experience to anyone, though it won't tell you much about the book. I like kids, what can I say.  Now that that's out of the way, Stone is one of the most important (and most strangely neglected) writers of the 20th Century. I think comparisons with Hemingway and Conrad are a bit off the mark; this novel is far more reminiscent of COMEDIANS-era Graham Greene, in his troubled Catholicism and concern for the decline of religion in the 20th Century. While Stone is hardly interested in promulgating any particular religious point of view, he IS a moralist, and a scathing critic of what we've become without a sense of God. This novel can be read, I think, as a crucifixion myth of sorts, made relevant to the 20th Century. It IS dark, but it's brilliantly paced and written, and a fairly accurate look at the time it deals with.  Stone, by the way, talks of a recurring dream he has, where he's bringing drugs or contraband into a country, usually on a ship, and knows that he is about to be caught. This motif informs the paranoid tenor of the novel.  A final point: the title has nothing to do with Lakota warrior societies, and is a bit of a misappropriation. It appears to be a reference to the proverb &quot;better a living dog than a dead lion,&quot; which Converse muses on in the text.

I might have been able to give this book a higher rating, despite its lack of commentary, social or otherwise, were it not for the fact that plot dragged along slowly, causing me to wonder if it would ever end...  Perhaps this novel would have been better off at the novella length, perhaps not.

His vision takes in everything, the obscure details that fill the world, focused in tight-points on the counterculture and that which the counterculture resists, on the idea of America, of respectability.  Dog Soldiers starts in Vietnam with a drug deal, moves to California, where the deal goes wrong, and winds up with one of the protagonists walking through the desert, wounded, toward death.

I realized my mistake right away, of course, but was pulled in by this epic tale of the end of the war & the end of the counter culture in the US, and the stench of rot that accompanies heroin. You know the story - it was told in the movies as the Nick Nolte war flick, Who'll Stop The Rain.  But the book puts you inside the thoughts of lost boy/war correspondent John Converse, hippie academic wife Marge, & zen punk Ray Hicks, the ex-Marine courier who tries to get the stash from 'Nam to Bay Area.  Author Robert Stone had seen both war & hippie commune from the inside so he reminds you of the hopelessness of each in the final days.  There is humor & despair in nearly equal measure here, often in the same setting (a sordid movie theater; a psychedelic mountain fortress & a burnout guru named Dieter.). Most of all, there is predictable inner dialogue like that of an addict or the unfamiliar conversation w/ self of a dying soldier.  If you've read it before, it works the second time around.
