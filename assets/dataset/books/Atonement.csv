I remembered a very good movie. Watched it again, and was again impressed with the film. Very seldom can it be said that the film achieves a greatness inherent in a great book, but this film is much better than the book. It doesn't contain the egoic descriptions, some of them very well written, but which are just distractions. The characters are more pure, the essence of the plot refined. And the ending with Vanessa Redgrave is just masterful. Only watching the film was it apparent the necessity, the need, the striving for atonement.

Tate was not always my favorite, I still am not sure I really like him.

I worry about Reese, can she be with Tate and be happy?  Is John, her rich \\""other man\\"", the right answer?  As I read Atonement I was beyond thrilled that JH Cardwell answered so many of my questions and many more that I didn't know I had.  The friendship Elle and Reese have is amazing.

I am envious and maybe a little jealous of their friendship, but so happy that Reese has had Elle with all the trials she has had to suffer through in her life.<br /><br />I love that decisions were made about the futures of these characters and they were able to move on past their histories and be happy and successful.

The former dealt with a bizarre, even grotesque, situation; this, with a unremarkable one, yet it's still more unsettling, even to the point of being upsetting.<br /><br />The story is of the return of Louis Bapaumbe, a second-string church organist, to the village where he'd taught music twenty years earlier. It's a journey he feels compelled to make: He must at any cost speak with a former pupil. Somehow Soucy tells the story with all its twists and turns in 100 or so pages and manages to give depth to the characters, create several mysteries, include many memorable and often strange details (the extracted molar that Bapaumbe finds soothing, a soldier's eagerness to mend a teddy bear savaged by an owl, the steam rising from a thawing corpse), and engage both the reader's intellect and his emotions. It's a very atmospheric book as well, though oddly one doesn't get a feeling for the forests and snow and short dark days Soucy describes, perhaps because the effort of describing them shows: metaphorical phrases don't sit well in book with this sort of tone.<br /><br />Some of what happens is not wholly explained and some not at all.

Well, left to their own devices they would be in harmony all along. But first of all they have to put right the wrongs of others to have a peaceful future. It's how they get there that we read about in this book.     Right from the very first page, I was in tune with this book. There is no need to have read New Beginnings first. There is enough background to know what has happened previously. But I urge you not to miss out on it. It adds to the splendour of Atonement to get to know the characters in greater depth.      There is something for all lesbian romance lovers in this book. A bit of mystery, intrigue, excitement and of course the ups and downs of people in love and the impact of the past on the future.

I had read and watched a couple of other things by McEwan before.  I found his writing a bit cold and contrived, containing somewhat cynical explorations of the dark side of things and the tendency of people to eventually reveal their real, ugly, animal natures.  This was something very different - a long and detailed romantic and family drama, set in the period shortly before and during World War II (and in which the war plays a big role).  It is something of a psychological thriller as well, and turns on a young girl's identification of a man who supposedly molested her.  Unlike some of the author's other things, this deals with serious issues in a serious way.  It is also very carefully and evocatively written, and Jill Tanner's precise reading is a perfect fit for the material.    Young Robbie is a student at Cambridge.  He is the talented son of working class parents, and he lives adjacent to the estate of the upper class Tallis clan, where his father was a gardener.  Tallis pere is a government minister, and he is sponsoring Robbie's education.  Of course, he knows the whole clan, and he and his fellow Cambridge student, Cecilia Tallis, have long harbored a repressed and secret attraction to each other.  The action takes place during a summer gathering of relatives and friends at the estate.  McEwan painstakingly outlines the goings-on, particularly from the viewpoint of 11(?) year-old Briony Tallis, Cecilia's sister, a girl of dramatic sensibilities who is planning to put on a play she has written for the group, using her young cousins as cast members.  Robbie writes a lusty letter to Cecilia which he never intended to send to her, but he accidentally substitutes it for another letter.  The expected rejection does not take place, and instead Robbie and Cecilia start getting it on . . . at which point the story takes a dark turn.  There is a sexual molestation, and someone, possibly the wrong man, is blamed.      The action then shifts to the war, in which Robbie is a soldier, part of the retreat to Dunkirk.  The two sisters are both serving as military nurses in London hospitals.  There is a lot of description of the war, and of life (and death) in the hospital.  As the action draws to a climax.  Briony, now a well-known professional writer in 1995 and looking at the end of her days, reveals what really occurred and what the attempted atonement is.  There is a sad note here, as the reader realizes that her attempt to set things right cannot fully exist in the real world, where justice and fulfillment are ultimately elusive.  This book makes me think that McEwan may very well have developed quite a bit as an artist over the years, and that a number of his other books might possess the level of virtuosity that \\""Atonement\\"" does.

I will say that Atonement is beautifully written. Ian McEwan no doubt knows how to write, but unfortunately the writing could not save this story for me. For most of the book, I could not stand Briony. I thought she was annoying, and I hated how she ruined her sister Cecilia and Robbie's lives.

Atonement  is told from many different points of views:  Briony Tallis, Cecilia Tallis, and Robbie Turner. Briony Tallis is introduced to as a 13-year old who has a passion for writing, and for creating imagined worlds.  Cecilia Tallis, Briony's older sister, is more concerned with relaxing and smoking while her mother has one of her \\""headaches\\"".  Robbie Turner, a son of one of the household maids, dreams about going to college for medicine.<br /><br />The main events behind the whole pot of this book all occur in a single day.  Briony misinterprets an interaction taken place between Cecilia and Robbie while looking out her window.  To add to Briony's imagination of what she \\""thinks\\"" took place she intercepts a note written by Robbie addressed to Cecilia.  Robbie gave this note by accident, with the intended note still at his house. Inside this note sexual and personal thoughts of Robbie's send Briony's thoughts array.  Later on Briony see's an intimate event take place between Robbie and Cecilia, not understanding at all what it means - she believes that Robbie has \\""assaulted\\"" Cecilia and is thus a bad man.  If this wasn't bad enough, one of Briony's cousins is found violated later that night in the woods.  Briony automatically believes and accuses Robbie as the assailant.<br /><br />Briony's accusation sets in motion the events for the rest of the book - Robbie is given the choice to either go to Jail or to serve in the Army; he chooses the Army, which changes him completely.  Cecilia becomes a nurse, as she too is changed by Briony's accusation.  As Briony grows up she starts to question her actions and realizes her mistake.

That being said, I was also aware of McEwan's reputation as England's best author today and was curious to see if it was true. While not the absolute best novel I have ever read, ATONEMENT is very skillfully written and I can now see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />McEwan's style has the feel of a classic (I certainly prefer it to Steinbeck's, at the least) and an eye for detail that I feel some other modern writers are beginning to do away with. Though recently books have been becoming increasingly more plot-centric--with the events happening so fast there's little room for description, which suits our ADD culture very well--Atonement stops to take note of the nuances in thought, in vision, to describe the sounds and smells of war, and to give each character a distinct, recognizable personality through development of inner dialogue. The plot itself starts out strongly. The beauty of the first few chapters cannot be matched, unfortunately, in the later ones. As the characters grow up and away from the fateful, disastrous summer night (which I will not summarize because countless other reviewers have already done a fine job) the plot grows a little more shaky and uncertain. It's certainly a great story, but McEwan really put in his best work at the outset, and this is so wonderful that it casts a shadow over the rest. The only part I had real problem with was the last chapter, in which the narration suddenly switches to first person. I personally have no taste for first person point of view, so it was a jarring conclusion to an otherwise wonderful novel, I thought.<br /><br />I will continue to read McEwan's work. His prose is top quality and more beautiful than anything I've read in a good while. I recommend the novel heartily, with the warning that it's not a feel-good summer read. While the plot will break your heart, the literature will hopefully lift it. I've also watched the movie and must say that visually, it too, is a work of art. 4.5 stars.good while.

An example would be when he remembers their first meeting after his years in prison.  Also when Cecilia writes to him that she will wait for him and she loves him.  That makes Robbie want to live.

But I must press forward regardless.<br /><br />Atonement is quite nearly a perfect book to my tastes; tragic, cynical and ultimately profound and deeply meaningful, few other literary masterpieces can match it in capturing me at every level.<br /><br />Ian's mastery of language comes through in every sentence and only Jane Austin and--perhaps controversially--G.K.

We are asked to consider innocence, fancy, self-deception and truth from angles we rarely examine. As the story commences we loath Briony's actions while simultaneously sympathizing and admiring her imagination and integrity, just as we feel her sadness as she comes to terms with her crime.<br /><br />In the end, I believe that Atonement does what few other stories do, it does not opt for the ease of a happy ending, but neither does it leave us with bleak despair.

The book's plot is about a young girl named Briony witnessing flirtations between her older sister Cecilia and their gardener Robbie Turner. Witnessing these events unfold a crime that effects every character for the rest of their lives. The author did a wonderful job with the sentence structures and the flow of the book. Each sentence gave a burst of images of what was happening. Reading Atonement gave me the feeling like I was standing right there and I overall enjoyed it.        In the story, Briony sees her cousin getting raped, and because of a previous encounter of witnessing what she thinks as her sister getting raped, she then concludes that it was Robbie who committed the crime. Briony's persistent fantasy then changes the characters futures. Atonement is unlike most romance books. There is somewhat a twist in the end where McEwan grasps the feelings of Briony and how she feels she took away Robbie and Cecilia's life together. This turn of events is unlike any book I have read. The reader never suspects the ending which makes this book an intriguing read for anyone, not just romance novel junkies. In this novel, the readers need to know the characters to fully understand the story. McEwan introduced the characters perfectly where I fully understood every character inside and out. This build up is crucial to fully grasp and interpret the story.       Even with the marvelous attributes, the book does have some flaws. The author uses a style where he jumps around from each characters view. It can get confusing and hard to understand at first, but because he uses it throughout the book the reader learns to comprehend it. I was only confused with part two.

There are good books that become popular and there are badly written ones that sometimes become popular. This book tends to fall somewhere in the middle. I'll not go into too much details of the story.  Briony a thirteen year old girl who fantasizes and desires to be a great writer has an elder sister Cecilia. Her house is a mansion on a big estate. Her father stays away on business and elder brother Leon just returns with his friend Paul Marshall. Author describes the estate in great detail but I failed to `see' it.   The char woman's son Robbie had been looked after by Briony's father and had been Cecilia's friend. Briony watches Cecilia's encounter with Robbie where she emerges wet out of a fountain.  Then Robbie happens to make a mistake and hands over the letter with wrong (ugly) words to Briony to give it to Cecilia. Here, the motivation of the character is a problem. I couldn't understand why he at all did it. The explanation that he wanted to prepare a ground for the party at night felt a little flimsy -contrived.  Briony at her age 13 is jealous of Cecilia and Robbie's closeness.   At dinner time the twin cousins disappear and everybody is out searching for them. While the search party breaks into groups only 13 year old Briony is left alone. A coincidence again? But it was essential to leave her alone because she was the one to see in near total darkness a man molesting her cousin Lola. So another teenager was left in the dark alone for molestation to occur.   Briony never really saw who molested Lola but assumes he was Robbie and becomes the star witness when cops investigate. By the way cops never visit the scene of crime to see how dark it was there.  Cops don't take Robbie to any doctor to perform a physical examination. Instead of going to medical college he goes to jail and then he is a soldier in retreat in world war two.  I loved the graphic description of violence in WW2 but all of us have read and seen WW2 violence in movies so often that it feels like a cliché (except shooting of the horses). In the next section again we read about the hardship Briony has to go through her training as a nurse. But going through the rigors of training to become a nurse could hardly be called a torture of penance. Again, there are so many details that don't seem important to the story. For example, though Briony talking to a dying French soldier is very touching it doesn't do anything for the story. The whole description of what Briony sees on the road when she is walking to meet Cecilia is a lot but it achieves nothing.  On occasion the descriptions of war and rigors of nursing feel like a documentary - a nicely written documentary. Briony's repentance never feels real.  If I focus my attention to the three pillars of fiction - setting, character and the story, I feel the author has done very good job at setting but failed to keep the balance with the other two -65% on setting, 20 % on character and 15 % on story.  Characterization is mediocre and Briony feels like a two dimensional character.  The story is a collection of far fetched coincidences. I was intrigued by the ending. Basically writer wanted to end the book with a tragedy, had second thoughts, so turns it into happy ending, then had third thoughts and so turns it into a tragedy.  And come on. A girl marries her rapist because he is moneyed. Who is going to buy that.  Ian McEwan is good at language. His language flows smoothly. But page after page of a narrative, with very little dialog, made a daunting task to finish the book.Some paragraphs are more than half a page - not acceptable by most editors in this era.

Now, in literature it can go a few ways. Lack of details can spark the reader's imagination to put themselves in place of the characters or to personalize the setting. But the right details, it can bring a book to life in a vivid way. Ian McEwan's Atonement is of the latter genre.     Atonement, for those of you who haven't seen the film, is the fateful tale of three young people: 13 year old Briony, her older college aged sister Cecelia, and their gardener's son, also college aged, Robbie. On a hot summer's day in pre-WW2 England, Cecelia and Robbie realize their love for each other and Briony becomes entangled between them. Her desperate and confused accusation against Robbie of a terrible crime sends the three of them on distinct and hard paths. Spanning from pre-war England to 1999, it is the tragic tale of one woman's journey for atonement, and the people who suffer because of her deliberate crimes and confused passions.     The story, all of its twists and turns, made this book wonderful. But the details in McEwan's writing, make this book exquisite. There is simply no other word. One can hear the flies buzzing in the Tallis' garden, one can feel the silk of Cecila's green dress, and one can hear the bombs over France during the war. To be able to create such a vivid picture enhances the roller coaster of emotions brought forth in this book, making it a cathartic experience in the true sense of the word. I read it in one gulp, and felt physically exhausted after finishing after running the gamut McEwan set forth for me in it Atonement's pages.     This is a book to be savored, not to be read in a hurry. And, because I know you wondering, the film is a quite excellent adaptation and beautiful in its own right, but it does not serve as a substitute for this masterpiece.

I rented the movie last summer from Netflix and as soon as the movie ended, I stared at the blank screen for a moment, blinked a couple of times in wonderment, and then hit play and watched it in its entirety a second time. Needless to say, I was completely entranced with the storyline and the cinematography. All of this is to say that after having such a wonderful experience with the movie adaptation, I began to worry that I'd ruined the possibility of having a good reading experience with the novel. I find it difficult to read a book after I've seen the movie since I have so many preconceived notions of the characters' appearance and eccentricities locked into my head visually.<br /><br />Never fear. I loved the book just as much as the movie. I actually listened to this book, mostly while driving, and I'm quite lucky I didn't wind up in a ditch somewhere due to my complete inattention to my surroundings. I became so wrapped up in the characters, the story, and the heart wrenching consequences of one thirteen-year-old's misinterpretation of a number of events and a rash decision. This was my first foray into Ian McEwan's writing and it definitely won't be the last. I was mesmerized with his writing style. The characters, especially that of the young Briony, were so well-drawn.  She is so frustratingly self-absorbed and narcissistic in the beginning of the novel, and her imaginative whims that so many young girls possess lead to such a catastrophic turn of events. I'll say no more. You must read it for yourself.<br /><br />I don't often reread books anymore due to the sheer quantity of amazing novels out there that I must get my hands on, but I can definitely say this is a book I will revisit, perhaps a few times, in the future.",2009-11-13

Atonement is very much three different books: an interior monologue, a survival story, and a tale of redemption. The entire first half of the book is the interior monologue. Reading it reminded me very much of Virginia Woolf:  a wall-of-text of the characters' thoughts and feelings. This is probably my least favorite style of writing, and something I struggle mightily to read. I always find it detached and rather cold. Suffice it to say, the first half of Atonement took me forever to read: about two weeks, consisting of off-and-on attempts to get myself interested once again in the narrative. I completely stopped reading it at one point, convinced I was simply never going to enjoy the book.    After finally working my way through the first half, however, I found myself finishing the rest of the book in a single day's marathon. I simply couldn't put it down. I found myself completely pulled into the narrative and compelled to finish the book as quickly as possible. Stylistically, narratively: everything about the second half changes. And as you get closer to the end, you discover there's actually a reason for that. In fact, there's a reason the first half is written in the manner in which it is as well. Everything in this book is done for a reason, which certainly made me appreciate the first half much more than I ever thought I would as I was reading it.    This is the third McEwan book I've read, after Amsterdam and Black Dogs, and is certainly the best of the three. I highly recommend the book.

What is chilling in the narrative is McEwan's convincing portrayal of how a precocious child witnesses more than she understands, comes to a brash conclusion, and armed with what she passionately believes to be legitimate motives, chooses to propagate her interpretation of events.

So when I saw the movie Atonement was playing on several of the flights I was recently on, I decided to get the book first, before watching the movie.

It took me a few chapters to get moving more rapidly with the reading, but ultimately it was rewarding. While the novel does take awhile to get going, the story picks up steam towards the second half. McEwan has an ability to illustrate and pinpoint detail with great vividness, and that goes a long way in creating believable characters, and successfully moving back and forth in time.     ** Warning: Spoilers and plot summary ahead, skip to next paragraph if you haven't read book**     Basically the novel is divided into four main parts. Part one begins with young Briony writing a play and awaiting her cousins as well as her brother's arrival. Briony witnesses a moment of flirting between her sister and Robbie at the fountain and then, after reading a \\""dirty\\"" letter intended for Cecilia, misconstrues Robbie as being some sort of \\""monster\\"". Later, while both families are out searching for her twin cousins who have run off, she witnesses her cousin Lola apparently being molested by a man. Putting all she has seen--and read-- together, she comes to the conclusion that the man must have been Robbie. Unwavering in her testimony, Briony is the one who sends Robbie off to prison despite his protests. Part two fast forwards a few years where we are given a first-hand account of Robbie's role in the war. He and his comrades encounter many grizzly deaths, and witness first-hand how brutality of battle can strip away the spirit of individuals, both physically and mentally. Robbie keeps Cecelia's note to \\""come back\\""  to her as comfort and motivation to survive. Cecilia had been the only one of the Tallis family who had believed in his innocence.  Part three takes the story at the same time from Briony's point of view. Living with her sin, she is now working relentlesslyas a probationer in a hospital helping out fallen and injured soldiers during wartime. Much like Robbie, Briony has had her freedoms stripped from her, only she has done it of her own accord. Briony's work is a form of atonement, as she also sees war's brutal and graphic results, and tries to comfort and tend to the severely injured and the dying. Having written and not heard from her sister Cecilia, she decides one day to go out and find her sister's place. After seeing her sister, she learns that Robbie is there also, and he confronts Briony about the past, telling her that there is one thing she must do to \\""atone\\"" for her past:  tell everyone what the truth is. Briony leaves, apparently agreeing to do this. From here, part four fast forwards to an elderly Briony's point of view. She has gone to her doctor, and realizes that the headaches she has are an early sign of dementia. She only has a short amount of time before this condition will ultimately rob her of her mind, her thoughts, her identity and her life. Despite hearing this news, she is upbeat as she returns home, and gets there to witness many of the young grandchildren perform her childhood play, \\""The Trials of Arabella.\\"" It is significant because this play takes her back to the past, of that fateful day where she made her mistake. She has been a successful writer, but there is one book that never got published and that has gone through many different drafts. It is basically the story of Robbie and Cecilia, and the mistake she made to ruin their love. She tells us that the book has two different endings--one where Robbie and Cecilia live happily ever after, and the other one, in which Robbie and Cecilia both die in 1940. She chooses the first ending because as she puts it \\""Who would want to believe that they never met again, never fulfilled their love?\\"" She reflects on whether she has atoned for her sin or not.     One significant issue taken from McEwan's novel is the idea of forgiveness. As the novel progresses, not only is Briony coming to terms with what her lie does to the fates of her sister and Robbie, but herself as well. We wonder whether they should forgive her for this, or what acts of retribution make up for a moment of sin. There is a sense that, although Briony is young when making her poor decision, that once her statement is taken down by the police, the fate of the three main characters are all sealed, and that they must all pay for years to come. Briony makes her form of redemption by working tirelessly during the war, and there is a sense by novel's end that McEwan wants us to forgive, or at least be sympathetic to, Briony. This seems especially true since the last two parts of the novel are taken from her point of view. However it is, it begs to the ultimate question at the end: Do WE forgive Briony?     It is easy to see how this novel was turned into a film up for an award last year, because the scenery and moments \\""come to life\\"" in McEwan's writing. As far as reading, I would recommend this novel, but do so with the advice that it might take you more than one try to get through, but that it will ultimately pay off.

But I don't understand why the common assessment of Briony as unreliable narrator seems to stop at her end-revelation that Cecilia and Robbie were killed without ever fulfilling their love.<br /><br />Briony admits, in fact, to being a novelist throughout. She says she collapsed several hospitals she worked at into one. A common writing technique; after all, what is important is how her experience as a wartime nurse affects her.<br /><br />Her rejection letter, which states that Elizabeth Bowen (who was said to not even work for the magazine) felt compelled to read her manuscript and loved it, is far too glowing for reality. Then there is the book's harmonious ending. Several generations of Briony's relatives assemble to see Briony's childhood play \\""The Trials of Arabella,\\"" which was interrupted and upstaged by the drama of Lola's sexual violation. Her cousin Pierrot ran away from rehearsals as a child, scotching the performance. Yet the final chapter of _Atonement_ asserts he was bitterly disappointed at not acting in it. To the extent that decades later he organized this performance, and is tearfully grateful to see it. This is pure wish fulfillment. Briony is giving herself a happy ending that she did not give Robbie and Cecilia--though she's still contemplating the latter.<br /><br />Much more interesting is the description of the central event, Lola's sexual violation. Fifteen-year-old Lola is socially sophisticated--her mother just publicly eloped to Paris with a lover. Lola dresses and acts as much like an adult as she can. She's very pretty, dresses attractively, and her grooming and makeup are impeccable. Her interaction with the wealthy young chocolate magnate Paul Marshall is distinctly flirtatious. Like other girls of her generation, Lola would have been brought up to marry well, and Paul is an excellent catch. In another two or three years, Lola would be brought out into society,where her pursuit of a husband would be entirely acceptable.<br /><br />While Briony is  helping everyone to hunt for her runaway twin cousins, she checks the 18th-century \\""ruined villa\\"" on an little island in the little lake. A spot that is both romantic, and easy for non-residents to locate (Paul Marshall has never visited the house before). Here she discovers Lola with a man on top of her, and immediately assumes this is a rape. Three years later, when Lola marries Paul Marshall, Briony admits the man was Paul. However, Briony, who her sister Cecilia describes as \\""a young thirteen,\\"" is not at the time sophisticated enough to understand the difference between consensual sex and rape. Only a few hours earlier, Briony discovered Cecilia and Robbie having enthusiastic sex in the library, assumed it was rape, and they have not had an opportunity to tell her otherwise. Very possibly Lola's sexual act is also quite willing, and Briony realizes that when she is somewhat older. Even Briony marvels that Lola \\""fell in love with her rapist.\\""<br /><br />When Briony discovers Lola and Paul, Paul immediately flees, leaving Lola to deal with the problems. And they have several.  If it's consensual sex, Lola's aunt, uncle, and parents will be furious at her for losing her virtue. They'll be even more angry at Paul, who is a responsible adult. Paul can't immediately marry Lola to repair the damage--she's so young that \\""people would talk.\\"" Also, Lola's uncle (Briony's father) works for the War Ministry, and Paul is angling for a very lucrative army-provisioning contract. It's likely that Lola's uncle could make sure he didn't get it.<br /><br />And here, Lola gets lucky:  Briony, carefully led on, is willing to help Lola call the event a rape and to pin the blame on Robbie. Paul Marshall may merely have had a little sexual amusement in mind. But now that they've been seen, Lola could blackmail Paul into marrying her as soon as she's of age, by threatening to reveal the truth. Everything works out for them.  Lola gets her wealthy husband and hangs onto him for the rest of her life. Paul gains his army contract. He also marries a woman whom he was attracted to when she was 15 and who is even prettier at 18.<br /><br />I suspect that close examination of _Atonement_ would reveal additional examples of Briony as an unreliable narrator.",2008-12-13

This book is told in three parts and each part is from three different perspectives.     The story begins in 1935 and is told from the viewpoint of the 13 year old Briony. Briony witnesses an event involving her older sister, Cecile, and the gardener, Robbie, that her young brain does not understand. Briony decides that Cecile would never commit such an indecent act of her own accord; therefore, Robbie must have forced Cecile into the situation.     Briony later witnesses an assault on her cousin and names the lewd Robbie as the perpetrator. Briony is unwaveringly believed in her account of the tale and Robbie is imprisoned.     Part two of the book is told from the viewpoint of Robbie. He was able to bargain an early release from prison by joining the military and being shipped off to France to fight. Robbie wants nothing more than to return to England and his beloved Cecile. His account of his struggle through the French countryside in an attempt at retreat is mesmerizing. His love for Cecile and absolute hatred for the person who tore him away from her and single handedly imprisoned him instills the same passion in the reader.    The third part of the book is told, again, from Briony's perspective. Years have passed and she is now a nurse for the wounded soldiers. She feels an immense sense of guilt for her childish take on the event so many years ago. She wants nothing more than to reconcile with Cecile and Robbie. Briony is finally able to confront the ghosts of her past and make her appeal to the parties involved. The outcome of this occurrence lies within the pages of the book itself. I will say, however, that the ending...affected me.    I found this book to be elegantly written. The language was absolutely exquisite and I identified with Briony. I could hardly put the book down...I had to force myself to stop reading each night when the hands of the clock approached 1 a.m. I was entranced with every page, every word. The tale of Briony, Cecile, and Robbie will be carried with me for the rest of my days and is now considered to be one of my most beloved experiences.",2008-11-13

The writing is amazing.    His portrayal of naive, pre-teen Briony is dead-on and eerie, and, even though she is far less developed, I could identify some with Cecelia's feelings of being a bit lost and out-of-place at home after the relative independence of college.    I've read a lot of reviews that are impatient with the slow pace, especially of the first part of the novel.  While I agree that it is a novel that immerses the reader fully in descriptions, I think such criticism is a little unfair.  It is not a novel that should be read in anticipation of getting to a juicy ending; it's a novel that should be read with the mindset that getting there is half (most of) the enjoyment.    While I didn't especially *like*, or closely identify with, any of the characters, I thought they were reasonable (I don't like most real, live, people that much, either).  I didn't think Briony was horrible so much as she was ignorant, confused, and self-centered, as are most 13-year-olds; I include myself in that, as embarrassing as it is to remember it.   I thought she was an excellent characterization of an adolescent at an awkward place in life, with an incomplete view and as-yet poor understanding of the world.    The ending was complicated.  No, I don't think anything she did later could actually atone for the mess Briony made.  On the other hand, she was 13 and acting out of ignorance more than viciousness.  And, frankly, I thought the title referred more at her attempt to atone to herself, to lay her conscience to rest, than to actually achieving any sort of atonement in the eyes of the rest of the world.  I think it should not be taken too literally.",2008-10-22

I enjoyed the first part and didn't have a problem with the same \\""scenes\\"" described from different people's perspective that some people seemed to have.  Actually, I thought that worked very well.  I thought the characters were very well drawn out and you could understand (may not agree but understand) their motivations.      If you're expecting a twist or deep secret, don't.  There isn't one.  Most people will figure out what is going on and who did what right from the start.       For me, the book falls apart in the second section.  It is still well written and very descriptive, perhaps overly so as some have pointed out.  But I did think I got a feel for London at the beginning of WWII.      Spoiler Alert.    I don't necessarily like happy endings but the ending is unsatisfying.  The man who actually molested a child ends up marrying her and evidently lives happily ever after.  You don't really get much sense of where Briony has been other than that she is losing her memory.  BTW, I thought this was a nice touch.  Evidently she is being tortured by what she did and, short of death, this might provide her some relief.  And the hero and heroine die during the war.  The book ends where it started with Briony's play.  Didn't see the point of that.  Interestingly, the movie took this scene out completely and replaced it with Cee and Robbie frolicking on the beach near the cottage she had arranged fro them to go to after Robbie returned.

I took it with me to read while on a plane trip. The only reason I was able to get through the first 100 pages was because I had no appealing alternatives as I was trapped next to the window for my several hour airplane ride.<br /><br />As others have said, the book is overwritten.  While there is a lot of descriptive language, it is overdone and often irrelevant.  At times it felt like the author wanted the reader to know how many words he knew or could use to describe something that was quite simplistic.  The characters, except for Briony, are mostly absent, and Briony is just plain unlikeable.  I had read that Ian McEwan did an outstanding job of infiltrating the psychology of the characters--I wholeheartedly disagree.  The characters were barely present, therefore hard to care about or empathize with.<br /><br />The \\""mystery\\"" of the book was easy enough to figure out. After finally making in through the first part, I was intrigued and wanted to keep reading.  While I thought the \\""mystery\\"" wasn't really a mystery at all and an obvious conclusion, I was hoping for some great twist or turning point -- hoping that I hadn't figured out what really happened on the night around which the story was built.  Unfortunately, there was no such twist, just disappointment that the truth was so obvious.<br /><br />Then, in hoping that Briony might recant, I continued to keep reading.

With all of the hype surrounding the book, I surely thought there must be something that I was missing.<br /><br />I always try to take something away from the experience of reading a book, and there were a few instances throughout that caused me to stop and really think.  One was when Briony was relating to her cousin and realizing how others and our reaction to others often help us to learn about ourselves.  It is through how we relate and respond that we can learn something about ourselves that we didn't previous know, or hadn't thought about.<br /><br />Another example was the depiction of the experience of Briony telling her story and then feeling trapped in her story with no space to modify it or turn back from it.

Couldn't really get into it after watching the movie, but actually managed to finish it this time. Would I read another book of Ian McEwan's? Not unless he changed his writing style drastically.<br /><br />At first the book is hard to get into, because it flicks back and forth between the different characters' points of views. But then the film is the same. But the book is pages and pages of never ending description - with very little dialogue added in between. And when you do get dialogue, it seems to be all grouped together, before you get more pages and pages of description.<br /><br />What I will say about the book is that the film was at least faithful to it. You know I hate watching movies of books that I loved (the recent Narnia movies being prime examples), but reading the book after watching the film, I saw a few more insights into what I liked in the movie, but didn't quite make sense.<br /><br />What I will NEVER get about the movie or the book for that matter, is the whole Lola/Paul Marshall storyline. What girl marries the man who sexually abused her? Or was it consensual? Considering she looked like she was crying the second time at least, we can think it wasn't consensual? I found this whole storyline very difficult to understand, since she marries Paul in both the movie and the book.<br /><br />The ending of the movie is also changed, and to be honest, I preferred the ending depicted in the movie. The ending in the book just didn't work. I'm not quite sure what it was, but I was still turning pages, trying to find the rest of it.<br /><br />If I'm going to be brutally honest, I skimmed a lot of sections of this book.

The girl's world is beautiful and immature, and this world--so very real to her--comes into startling collision with the realities of adults.  The novel is woven of colliding realities: different perceptions of what *is* come into painful dispute.      My only objection to the novel is its very light treatment of a sexual assault.  The event--though central to the story--seems to be more of a plot device than anything else.  The horror of that event is dwarfed by the worries of other characters.  This use of rape is cheap and unkind.  It's not a fatal flaw for the novel, but it leaves the book short of something masterful.     And yet, the twists, at the end of the novel were indeed masterful.  For me, the sudden revelations at the end of the book forced me to rethink the novel.

She is precocious and thoughtful, but she is young and fails to understand that she is wrong, in so many ways, about what she sees before her own eyes.  Her emotions and her imagination get the better of her and although she ultimately realizes the mistake she made and seeks atonement for it, she has nonetheless changed forever the lives of her Cecilia, her sister, and of Robbie, the young man with a promising future whose mother works for the Tallis family.  Ironically, though, it is her imagination that will serve her well as a novelist.

The bad news first.<br /><br /> What you may not like:<br />1. While Ian McEwan does wonderful things with imagery (see below), it becomes a bit much at times, especially when he is detailing landscapes.<br />2. If you are not one who enjoys reading a novel that takes place on the battlefront, beware. About eighty pages center around a character's (who is a soldier) trek through France as it is being attacked by the Germans. 3. Having questions that you don't feel are being resolved. And I'm not just talking about the ending; throughout the novel I felt slightly frustrated at times that I was being left out. Granted, that's how life works, you're not always privy to every piece of information.<br />4. The last section seemed rushed, to me. On one level, I felt McEwan was trying to hurry up and tidy up the novel, but I again felt left out of the loop in some regards.  The premise for the last section was interesting, though, I just had a problem with the execution.<br /><br />What you may like:<br />1. Ian McEwan is an outstanding writer. He develops interesting, multi-faceted characters, beautiful descriptions and an intriguing plot. His writing isn't generic or typical of the genre; you can tell his syntax is carefully crafted, he's trying to create something more than just words on a page.<br />2. There is definitely a feeling of drama to this novel. You have love, rape, lies, war, injury and redemption all in one novel. Because of McEwan's style, it's drama that flows and weaves between characters, places and time periods.<br />3. The two main female characters, who are sisters, are strong, independent women who refuse to rely on their wealthy parents.  Their mother is a perfect contrast; not as modern as her daughters, she doesn't understand their desire to become educated and explore the world.<br />4. The male characters are a diverse sample. There's rich and poor, motivated and unmotivated, honest and deceitful, kind and malicious.<br />5. The concept of justice isn't unrealistically portrayed.

I have been aware of the novel almost since it was first published and I know of the major motion picture produced from its story but, for various reasons, it has taken me several years to get around to reading it.<br /><br />Ian McEwan has written a complicated, multi-layered book that is simply beautiful when considered as a whole.  It is a coming-of-age novel, a crime novel, a love story, a war novel, a mystery and an author's reflections on the art of fiction writing, all rolled into one.  The book is structured in three distinctive sections, each with a very different story to tell, and an epilogue that flashes forward more than 50 years.<br /><br />Part One, set in 1935, introduces thirteen-year old Briony Tallis, an aspiring novelist even at that age, who has a vivid imagination but a limited understanding of the motivations and emotions of the adults around her.  Her imagination takes over when from a distance she witnesses a scene between her older sister, Cecelia, and the charwoman's son, Robbie, at the fountain in front of the family home.  Imagining that Robbie has forced her sister to strip to her underwear and immerse herself in the fountain, Briony is filled with conflicting emotions.  As the day goes on, she becomes more and more certain that Robbie is a danger to her sister and is so convinced that he is evil that her imagination leads her to identify him as responsible for a sexual assault that occurs that night.<br /><br />Part Two picks up the story some five years later in France where Robbie, who has been freed from prison to join the fight against Hitler, is part of a British army retreating to Dunkirk in hopes of being evacuated to England in time to fight another day.  Painfully carrying a piece of shrapnel in his side, he realizes that he is responsible for his own survival and slowly works his way to the coast with two others.  But by the time he gets there to experience the chaos and further slaughter of the Dunkirk beaches his wound is causing him serious complications.<br /><br />Part Three focuses on the now eighteen-year old Briony who has moved to London to study nursing at exactly the point at which her training hospital is overrun by casualties from the Dunkirk slaughter.  Her experiences mature her in more ways than one and she longs to somehow undo the wrong she committed against Robbie and Cecelia who has been estranged from the family ever since Robbie's imprisonment as a convicted rapist.<br /><br />Finally, there is the epilogue set in 1999 in which Briony, now a respected elderly novelist joins family to celebrate her seventy-seventh birthday, a section of the book in which McEwan has stashed one final surprise for his readers.  This is an ending that readers will likely react to differently, some in surprise, some in admiration, and others in frustration and even a little anger.<br /><br />Atonement paints a vivid picture of pre-war England and the days immediately after the British army collapse in France caused most Londoners to expect German bombers and troops to appear at any time.  It explores the emotions of both those seeking to atone for transgressions against others and those who suffered those transgressions and find it hard to forgive or forget them.

Given that most readers at this point will be picking up Atonement because of the movie, I think it's fair to do a fair bit of comparison between the two. Both the book & the film play out in similar ways in that they both possess some shining, outstanding moments of brilliance and clarity, but for every four of those there was one moment that needed some polishing, hence my grade of 4/5 stars.    The story starts in the mid 1930's when a thirteen year old girl named Briony, known for being a bit fantastical and in her head, witnesses a series of events one day and misinterprets them to the entirely wrong, adolescent conclusion, and tells a lie that sets off a rapid chain of events that forever change the lives around her - most notably of her older sister Cecilia and her newfound love interest, their longtime childhood friend Robbie. The story follows the path of the lie and its far-reaching consequences through World War 2 up until the end of the 20th century.     Part of me wishes I hadn't seen the movie - given the very unique ending - but a bigger part of me is glad I had, as it made the book a lot easier to read than I suspect it would be for someone who hasn't seen the film. I was amazed at how good the film really was in its adaptation of the book, in terms of keeping in the majority of major dialogue sequences and accurately portraying the scenery as it is described in the book. Most importantly, it really did a great job of capturing what the book was about, the general feeling and sensations you got from the book were translated beautifully on screen.    The one main thing the book did better than the movie was the delivery of the story itself through Briony, especially her thought process as she witnesses the various events early on in the story. The prose itself is quite well written, although (like in the film) it tends to lag abit and get off track from the core themes during the section set in the fields of WW2. There are excellent themes surrounding redemption and coming of age and lots of complicated moral questions that made the book more enjoyable to read than I had anticipated.     My final note would be that the film did a much better job at revealing its final twist than the book - it was acted in such an outstanding way that you felt the weight of the final revelation that much more, although it was strongly based on the excellent writing of McEwan in these final pages.

We are transported into the rich inner world of Briony as we glide through her acute perceptions and fanciful imaginings.<br /><br /> The second part of the book, containing graphic descriptions of a brutal war, is rather rough going.

Despite the serious repercussions, this misunderstanding could be viewed on one level as a slender thread upon which to hang a novel.

And his fate is telegraphed loud and clear; the continuous jabs of shrapnel in his side, into his ribs, against his organs, leave little doubt that he will not complete his journey.<br /><br />Before this ends though, the book shifts (again) to the life of the now grown Brionywho is in nursing training.

The older daughter who had so much difficulty choosing a dress becomes a nurse and is promptly promoted to Ward Sister; a position which requires a \\""she who must be obeyed\\"" personality.  No explanation for this personality shift is explored.  It just happens.<br /><br />Then things get dicey indeed.  A walk the younger girl takes to visit her long estranged sister is described in tremendous detail.  It is not a very interesting walk, but each observation, no matter how mundane, is  recorded.  In fact, in my paperback copy, the description of this tedious walk goes on for 17 pages!  Even the most naive reader can tell something is up the author's sleeve.  This boring segment has a purpose though; everything that occurs after it, (until the last chapter) is untrue. While some people have been delighted with this over-used plotting technique, I was unimpressed.  To describe a vivid love story resolution, and then to find out it was all made up by another character is over-used, cheap, and manipulative.  It didn't help that in this book it was also obvious as all get-out.  But Briony writing an untrue happy resolution of the love story between her sister and the young man who's life she ruined, seems to be the best \\""atonement\\"" we're going to get. She actually has the nerve to muse, \\""How can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?\\"" WHAT???  She didn't decide an outcome of people's lives, she decided the outcome of her fiction. And her foolish, wrong-headed error becomes unforgivable, because she never asks for forgiveness.<br />I would not classify this amongst the worse books I've ever read but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.  Writing a nice sentence, even one that can be described as \\""lyrical\\"" is one thing.  Writing a good book is quite another.bed as \\""lyrical\\"" is one thing.

But the problem lies with mixing the images from the movie with the imagery created by McEwan. First and foremost, the movie closely resembles the book, so at times it was hard for me to picture the events and people without thinking of the movie. Atonement is a story about a little girl (Briony) who convinces herself of something that she knows is a lie, and this lie changes the lives of everyone around her. (I won't tell you exactly what the lie is, but you might be able to get an idea.) She grows up to become a novelist and writes Atonement as her way to absolve herself of the lie that ruins her sister's, Cecilia and Robbie (the housekeeper's son) relationship.  The story is told from many different points of view, which takes readers to the state of mind of the characters. Surprisingly, you come to understand that everyone has a little made up story in their mind. Robbie is convinved that Briony told that lie because she was in love with him. Briony tells the lie because she made up the story that Robbie is a sex maniac and wanted to protect her sister. In a sense, she wanted the lie to be true for her own vindication. The thing that moves me about this book is the kind of love that Cecilia and Robbie had for each other, their longing to be with one another, and never even having that single wish fulfilled. It was absolutely heartbreaking to think of a life that you can share with someone, look forward to it, and never have it realized. Although Briony was absolutely wrong about what she did, you realize, that there is this human side to her and it's hard to hate her because you, as a reader, also get to see what went on in her mind when she lied.",2008-04-20

I do say, I wish the second part of the book had been longer, and Briony's parts less, but I still think it would have taken too much away from the point of the book.  The point being not just a love story, but the sadness that we can try our best to manhandle and control life, but ultimately cannot.  I don't want to give too much away!

However, I was thoroughly disappointed after finishing it, and if I had been brought to tears, it would only have been for wasting my money.  For one thing, McEwan's characters never quite ring true.  Especially in the beginning, the characters' actions are difficult to see as realistic, and McEwan seems to be making them act in ways that are most convenient to move the story along, rather than having them act in a way that is understandable.  Cecilia's actions are difficult to believe, (does any woman, in any time period, *really* believe that taking their clothes off in front of a man is a good way to punish him for something?) The relationship between Cecilia and Robbie seems to have been far too rushed and incomplete to have lasted for so many years with censored letters as the only way to interact, as well.  Call me unromantic, but I found it hard to believe that two people could be so completely and purely devoted to one another when their romance began as, basically, a spur-of-the-moment hookup.      McEwan also seems to have difficulty deciding what sort of story he wants to tell.  At first, it appears to be a mystery: you know that a terrible crime will be committed, and perhaps McEwan hopes that readers will be kept guessing as to \\""who done it.\\""  However, it seemed so obvious to me from the beginning that I did not think the book could have been intended as a mystery.  Then I thought that perhaps the book was supposed to be a collective memoir, the kind that switches points of view in order to tell the whole story.  But this point of view switching is done too unevenly.  Briony gets most of the book devoted to her and her actions, Robbie gets a brief part in the beginning and the middle section all to himself, Cecilia only gets an inconsequential part of the beginning, and even Emily Tallis, Briony and Cecilia's mother, gets a chance to have the story told through her eyes, even though she is of little to no importance to the rest of the story, and her insights serve no purpose.  McEwan's switching from one point of view to the next is done very clumsily, and hinders the storytelling by giving the reader too much information rather than enhancing it.  He seems to want to show off all the research he must have done to write the novel, and consequently makes the whole thing extremely tedious and full of useless details.  Of course, the book could also be called a romance, but since it is told mostly from Briony's point of view and the feelings of Cecilia, one-half of the romantic duo, are largely ignored, the \\""romance\\"" label isn't quite there, either.      In the end, McEwan suddenly jumps to the present day, and explains most everything that's happened to Briony since we left off in World War II. The ending seemed tacked on and unnecessarily drawn out. McEwan could have easily ended the book before his modern-day jump, even though we do not get to know what eventually happened to Robbie and Cecilia.  It is enough to know that Briony stole years from their lives and happiness, and his rushed explanation of what became of them in the end only makes Briony seem all the more self-centered, rather than making the book any better.  I, at that point, had long since stopped caring about Briony whom, even through her intense remorse at the crime she committed against her sister and Robbie, still keeps the spotlight focused on herself and her feelings rather than the plight of those she wronged.      I finished the book only so that I could criticize it from beginning to end--it is by far the worst disappointment I've ever had in a book.  I did not see the movie because of it, and I believe the only way that it could be any good at all is if Hollywood has done what it usually does with novels (that is, completely rewrite them.)

McEwen is a master of the english language and the plot was very intricate and well conceived.  There is also much in this book about the history of England during World War II, and that is perhaps the icing on the cake of this great story.  The evacuation of the British troops at Dunkirk and the subplot of the three soldiers making their way to the French coast during the mass retreat was probably my favorite part of this book.  However, the final portion of the book, which had to do with training nurses in London during the outbreak of hostilities was also very interesting.    I wasn't as interested in the lead-in to the story, which revolved around the pre-war English country life, but it also had it's moments of intrigue and drama.  The story is centered around a romance and while I'm not much for romance stories, I must admit it did draw me in.  The many twists and turns in the plot build towards a fabulous ending, which although I thought I had figured out by the time I got there, I hadn't.    The prose and style is incredible throughout, very descriptive and rich with detail.  Character developement is obviously a specialty of McEwen's and each of his subjects is multifaceted and complex.  I would recommend this book to everyone, and I have, and I will be looking to read many more of McEwen's novels in the future.",2008-02-29

It started off so well: a good concept, a main character with good potential, and an engaging, beautifully written first section.  But by the second section, I had to force myself to keep reading, wondering why people thought the book was good enough to be made into a movie. When I got to the war section, I started speed reading. I still don't know what the war section had to do with Robbie's character development or the plot development. After that, I just jumped ahead to the predictable ending (something I never do...but even the speed reading was putting me to sleep...). I wish McEwan had developed Lola's and Paul's characters more--what reaction are we supposed to have at their wedding?  Why does Briony first become a nurse instead of a writer? We are led toward visions of her attending an MFA program or at least getting an internship at a magazine. Although the ending is poetically correct, it's not very satisfying.

It was filled with lengthy descriptions and tiresome English snobbery (our house is less than five hundred years old -- oh the shame!!).<br /><br />I had very high hopes for Robbie and Cecilia to tear apart this stuffy backdrop with their passion, especially when Robbie broke out the infamous c-word, but the sex scene was extremely disappointing; bogged down by detail and totally without abandon. I was especially angered by Robbie's reserve. I thought this should have been an opening to throw off self-consciousness, but it wasn't, and because of that I didn't believe in their bond the way I wanted to. I believed that they loved each other, but I didn't *feel* it. Therefore there was no chance of liking the book no matter how good the writing was (and it *was* good).<br /><br />Maybe this was intentional? We learn later (spoiler alert...?) that viewpoints other than Briony's are still her creation -- her own novelization of her greatest regret. That being the case I'm not sure where to shift the blame. Briony for not \\""getting\\"" Robbie? Or McEwan for thinking this WAS a passionate love scene?<br /><br />I also did not like the way the plot was structured. Briony sees something and misunderstands. Then she sees something else and misunderstands, then she sees something ELSE and misunderstands... Did she have to see so many things just so that later, when she was writing about it, she would know they happened? I got bored, and furthermore, Briony's fictionalization would have been richer if she'd imagined more of Cecilia and Robbie together, not just elaborated on the tidbits she did see.<br /><br />Still, I was glad I kept going. The war, both from Robbie's POV and from Briony's, was spectacularly visceral and immediate. I felt like I and the characters were all being shaken awake.

Set in England in the 1935's and ending in 1999 the novel follows the life of Briony Tallis, an English girl, from childhood to old age, touching on issues of family, class, war, good and evil, atonement, and forgiveness.  Through the consciousness of Briony, McEwan asks questions about who controls human destiny.  Do we write our own scripts?      Like real life, the novel is complicated by multiple viewpoints: Cecilia's, Robbie's, and most importantly Briony's.  Each character has a limited perspective.  Only the reader has access to the larger picture.  McEwan shows life as perspectival, and shows the closest thing to truth is the union of multiple, sometimes conflicting narratives.  At the age of thirteen Briony Tallis tells a lie that negatively affects the lives of her sister Cecilia, and Cecilia's lover Robbie Turner.  Her lie accuses Robbie of raping her young cousin Lola.  Robbie loses a promising career, is sent to prison, and finally suffers the indignities of war as a foot soldier.  Cecilia stands by Robbie, and forsakes her family because they believe Briony's lie.      When Briony understands the implications of her evil act she dedicates her life to making reparation.  The dictionary says atonement is the making of reparation for a sin or a mistake.  Briony, an upper-class girl, skips university to go into nursing in the middle of WWII as atonement for her terrible lie.  She obeys hostile superiors, empties bedpans, dresses unimaginable wounds, and brings comfort to young soldiers torn apart physically and emotionally by war.  She exchanges self-absorption for selfless care of others.      Briony admits her lie in front of Cecilia and Robbie.  Her life of atonement and her admission of truth do not influence the couple to forgive her.  Though they refuse pardon, they demand a witnessed written statement by Briony with the real facts, and an admission to the family about the lie.  She promises to do this, and accepts their refusal of absolution.  Briony can never repair the damage she has done.  Her selfless work gives solace to others, but not her sister and Robbie.      Beyond the plot the novel is complicated by its structure.  One narration is Briony's life; the other story is Briony's writing.  She creates narratives in her imagination, which are played out in real life.  She actually writes the story of Cecilia and Robbie, and exposes the true rapist.  At first the reader is aware that this is reality.  Then the reader begins to question outcomes.  Is Briony writing this or living it?  Where is the boundary between life and art?   Briony, facing the onset of dementia, writes the final chapters of the story with enough ambiguity the reader is left wondering what actually happened.  As a writer we know Briony has the capacity to play god--to control outcomes.  But the reader is unclear about who is in control of destiny.  McEwan asks profound questions, but gives no obvious answers.",2008-02-15

Then he did the same thing with the older sister. Neither of these characters came alive. They could have come to life in other hands, but McEwan seems to prefer nattering on tiresomely. Why this was considered prize-winning writing is unfathomable.  In my view, it was more a series of preliminary character sketches and a long outline of a book than a real novel.

I'm glad the movie version got such rave reviews because I might not have read this book otherwise and that would have truly been a loss.  McEwan is such a gifted author who is capable or rendering deep emotions in such a way that I felt almost as though I was living through the characters.  This isn't a book packed with scenes of action; instead, it is an introspective and beautifully drawn character sketch that I found a pleasure to read.  That said, it's not for everyone though those who enjoy lyrical novels will certainly enjoy this one.    The character that was most interesting to me was Briony.  As a young girl, she is very self-centered and filled with ideas about her own importance and when others fails to notice her as she wants them to she strikes out in ways that are vindictive and have consequences that are much more far-reaching than she can imagine.  I didn't find her very sympathetic at this age though I think that McEwan did a wonderful job of capturing the psychology that is sometimes manifest in girls of her age.  While she doesn't fully grasp just how profoundly what she is doing will impact not only the lives of Cecilia and Robbie, but her own as well.  Still, as Briony ages and comes to a full understanding of what she has done she becomes far more sympathetic.  How many of us can say that we didn't do something stupid and spiteful in our youth that later came back to haunt us?  As Briony matures she comes to understand just how harmful her actions were and she also reaches one of the most unpleasant understandings possible upon becoming an adult--that remorse, no matter how deep, can not reverse the sins of the past.    Perhaps my only slight disappointment with the book was with Cecilia.  McEwan offers us a glimpse into her thoughts when she is still young and full of promise but we don't get a chance to witness how she thinks once life has given her many reasons to sink into bitterness.  She is a character that has far more wisdom than others give her credit for possessing, though, and what must have seemed to her family like a deranged act of love is, in reality, an act of justice in the face of great injustice.    Perhaps the most moving and vivid scenes in the book are those in which the reader sees World War II through the eyes of Robbie.  These passages in the book are so rich in detail and so chilling that I don't see how anyone could be unaffected by them.  Robbie's tale is ultimately one of survival and that is one of the book's true tragedies, that a young man who once held so much promise is reduced to a struggle merely to make it from one day to the next.  In many ways, the war is a metaphor for his internal struggle, in which the prospect of carrying on is so bleak that one must wonder why anyone would bother.    As rich as these three characters are, concentrating mostly on them only scratches a bit at the surface of this novel's subject.  It is, more than anything else, a novel about the human condition in which character motives are explored.  Sometimes their actions don't make any sense.  Their crimes result in nothing or in the destruction of the lives of others.  The reasons behind their actions are often obscure and, in the case of Lola, unthinkable.  Now that I've had the pleasure of reading this novel, I can hardly wait to see if the movie version even comes close to doing justice to McEwan's wondrous prose.",2008-02-05

Being the first novel I've read by the acclaimed novelist Ian McEwan I was immediately made aware of his immense talent.  The tale presented to the reader is one of remarkable effectiveness, one that is truly relatable and believable and in the end of dire importance for its overall moral is one that transcends the boundaries of this prose and cements itself in our very being, in our every interaction and in our constant memory.  Separated into four sections `Atonement' is broken down in such a way as to make the true conclusion all the more shocking and heartbreaking.<br /><br />Part one retells the events on one especially harsh summer day in 1935.  I say `especially harsh' mainly because by the days end events take place that harshly affect the lives of everyone involved.  13-yearold Briony Tallis is a smart and imaginative young girl and she becomes the main focus of our attention as we hear of the day's events.  As she attempts to orchestrate a theatrical production in honor of her brother Leon's arrival home she is met with a few snags and some ominous distractions that put her initial plans on hold and send her into a newfound direction.  As the relationship between her older sister Cecilia and their housekeepers son Robbie begins to take a turn Briony finds herself in the know of a serious misunderstanding that changes the course of everyone's lives.  With their three cousins Lola, Jackson and Pierrot visiting as well as Leon's friend Paul Marshall the house is quite full on the evening in question, so when events take a turn for the worse there are so many more eyes to cast their judgment.<br /><br />Briony is a very interesting character.  I found it truly fascinating as her character unveiled itself with each turning page.  Her immaturity is emphasized by her incessant need to be the mature one despite her inability to do so.  She's lost in her writing, an obsession that causes her to read deeply into matters that aren't her concern and imagine the possibilities no matter how devastating they may become.  She also allows the actions of others to affect her too deeply, finding herself reacting irrationally and this leaves her in a position to do much harm.  It's hard for the reader not to find themselves calling Briony out as the villain here, for it's her needless actions that cause so much pain, but in reality she's nothing more than a young child who was invested in a poor decision.<br /><br />So, with an accusation made and a terrible crime committed we brace ourselves for the second and third parts of the novel where we follow Robbie and Briony respectably as they strive to patch up their lives.  Robbie has been through hell, literally, and in the second part of the novel we follow his journey as he strives to get home from the war.  The horrors he is witness to, the atrocities he is privy to are all sprawled out for us is detail, as is his dire need to be reunited with his lost love Cecilia.  The third part covers Briony's struggles as a nurse during the war, but more importantly her struggles within herself for some ounce of atonement for her sins.  She has grown up since that summer day, not only in age but in understanding, and she is finally able to grasp the seriousness of her lies.  The pain she has caused will never fully be undone, but she desires to do all she can to write them.<br /><br />The novel opens with such a brilliantly conceived idea, and is so effortlessly and elegantly penned that one is immediately engulfed in its design.  I for one could not put it down and read the entire first section in one sitting.  Sadly the second a third sections do not read as briskly, but their importance is all the more secured by the closing section as elderly Briony recounts her actions and the ultimate consequences of them all.  The final pages are chilling to say the least, and are completely unexpected, so much so that the tears running down my face had all but dried before I realized I was crying.<br /><br />`Atonement' is a brilliantly orchestrated tale of pain, despair, loyalty, betrayal and the ultimate yearning to make amends, to find atonement for our sins and attain forgiveness for our souls.

It's not just that the writing is amazing, it's how McEwan weaves the story, the way the story falls back on itself.  It's more or less written in three acts and a sort of epilogue.  The last part of the book was my favorite, the writing was the wittiest in book.  The story is of course one of Atonement, it's Atonement for an egregious lie, that destroys several lives.  I liked how McEwan takes his time setting up a scene, how he describes everything in illustrious detail, his prose are erudite and beautifully spun together.  Spoiler alert:  One thing that bothered me was that Briony never really Atones for her horrible act, even in the end, her story will have Robbie and Cecilia together like some fairy tale, instead of the tragic way it all ended, she never even apologizes to Robbie for ruining his life and again, Briony lets herself off the hook for their deaths, her book will end with them living happily everafter and she apologizing and recanting her lie, which she NEVER does.  Robbie would not be in the North of France if not for Briony, and Cecilia certainly would not have been a nurse and she would not have been in the tube station when the bomb hit.  All, I could think of when the elderly Briony goes to her 77th birthday party was, what on earth would these people think of you if they knew what you had done?  She has become this famous author, and she has lived with this lie her whole life, even after Robbie and Cecilia had died in 1940, she could have set the record straight she could have still tried to clear his name, if not for Robbie, for his poor Mother, but Briony did nothing, she was a coward, though I laughed at her thoughts at the last of the book and she had made a wonderful life for herself, all I could think of as the book ended was, Briony you're a coward to the end, how on earth can you sleep, I dont know how you have ever slept knowing your actions lead to the death of you sister and her innocent Robbie, it's obscene, but that Briony always living a fairy tale....Great Book.",2008-01-23

The opening is almost perversely ungripping. Instead of the expected sharpness of focus, the first 70 or so pages are a lengthy summary of shifting impressions. One longs for a cinematic clarity and concentration of dialogue and action, but such interludes dissolve before our - and the participants' - eyes. Unlike Martin Amis, say, or Salman Rushdie, McEwan is an invisible rather than a flamboyant stylist. Even so, the pallid qualifiers and disposable adverbs (a \\""gently rocking\\"" sheet of water, the \\""coyly drooping\\"" head of a nettle) come as a surprise. The language used to distil the scene - a gathering of the Tallis family at their country house on a sweltering day in 1935 - serves also as a wash that partially obscures it. Various characters come and go but the novel, at this point, seems populated mainly by its literary influences. Chief among these is Virginia Woolf. The technique is not stream of consciousness so much as \\""a slow drift of association\\"", \\""the hovering stillness of nothing much seeming to happen\\"". The book later contains a critique of its own early pages - or at least of the draft from which they derive - in the guise of a letter from Cyril Connolly, editor of Horizon , who advises that \\""such writing can become precious when there is no sense of forward movement\\"".

There is an undercurrent if not of menace certainly of unease and when the climax comes it is no surprise. Here passions, mendacity, jealousy, snobbery and ultimately violence bubble inexorably to the surface.

Ian McEwan is a great writer, no doubt, and his overly emotional story here is a bit too melodramatic at times, but you cannot deny the power of his writing.<br /><br />The central heroine here, Briony Tallis, is introduced to us as being a combination of all sorts of virtues and shortcomings. In his effort to present her as a likeable, everyday sort of heroine, I regret that McEwan reduced, at some point, his lead character to some sort of caricature. I don't know if other readers have had this problem, but I certainly did.<br /><br />Also, did anyone else have an issue with the elaborate usage of imagery when describing places or the immediate environment? I loved it for the first forty pages, but after a point this became very, very tedious indeed, as it seemed the author was sacrificing readability in favor of his fascination for his own writing.

Seriously, if you placed Danielle Steel about sixty years back, she would come up with stories like this. However, like all proper classics, \\""Atonement\\"" now has the benefit of a major motion picture behind it, and perhaps all the glowing reviews are from people more swayed by Keira Knightley's ethereal beauty, rather than them having read the book.<br /><br />I am glad I read this book before the movie version came out. I haven't seen the film, but would like to. I would like to see how they present the older Briony, in her 'writer' phase.

The first book describes the \\""crime\\"". Briony Tallis, a play writing 13 year old, accuses Robbie Turner, the family gardener and lover of her sister Celia, when her young cousin is raped. On Briony's testimony Robbie is jailed. The second book jumps five years past the crime to focus on Robbie, now freed and part of the British Army that was cornered and eventually evacuated by a fleet of small boats at Dunkirk during the early days of WWII.  In the third book, Briony becomes a nurse to help the war effort. Grown up, she tries to come to terms with what she has done and makes amends with her sister and Robbie. In the fourth book, Briony is an elderly novelist, revisiting her past.<br /><br />The second book is the most gripping of the four books in Atonement. I suspect that has a lot to do with the fact that Briony isn't around in book two. Atonement is a great story suffering under the weight of a sanctimonious main character. Briony as a 13 year old is a precocious brat. Briony as a nurse is boring. It's in her character to put herself through being a nurse during war time, but is it because she wants to make up for what she's done or because she's just engaging in more of the drama she's so attracted to? Most disappointing is the atonement itself. The scene where she apologizes to Celia and Robbie is flat. (You'll do this and You'll do that. Fine. Fine.)

Briony isn't portrayed with enough depth for readers to empathize with the guilt she is supposed to be suffering from. Can a self absorbed drama queen ever really leave her own mind long enough to empathize with someone else? Probably not. The fact that Briony becomes a novelist after the war emphasizes my point.

Superb.","Reading this is like experiencing the beauty of contemplating a giant landscape - the style embodies a unity, a symmetry, a homogeneity - a gently throbbing and satisfying rhythm of oneness as one's gaze roams and hovers over page after page.     Every one of life's moments encapsulates a myriad of philosophical, psychological and historical components - all having threaded their way though particular configurations of circumstance to culminate in that moment. McEwan is a master of splitting the atom of these moments - unpacking for our wonder and delight these bundles of reality, in a style that is delicate and precise - a hallmark of his craft.     In a human narrative each of these moments is seen differently from the perspective of the various players. It is another feature of McEwan's craft that he burrows in and explodes each of these, subsequently weaving the understanding gleaned back together into a more refined understanding of the greater picture.     Beyond these exquisite niceties, a novel should naturally also be a good yarn, and McEwan is a wonderful story teller, maintaining a fine balance between fancy and feasibility. As a reader I experience the tension between wanting uplifting, happy outcomes and being prepared for gritty reality checks. Without giving too much away, in this book McEwan gives us both, with the slightest of sleights of hand - and in the last two pages of the book at that! With similar dextrous economy, the portal to this denouement is presented in the cypher of a set of initials and a date at the end of part three (of four).     The book is something of a saga, spanning 64 years and several generations. McEwan gives us a good feel for each of the periods covered. The 80 or so pages treating of the war have been researched in a novel way and the representation of war is a relief from war of the movies - even the better ones. Here we get the true horror and terror. Also a terrific flavour of the societal context in which this war was experienced in Britain. Towards the end he also gives us an insightful portrayal of an elderly mind surveying its life from the closing end of its journey.     The love story at the heart of 'Atonement' echoes Lawrence's portrayal of the oppositions and physicalities at the heart of romantic involvement. Indeed the male of the story likely read the word at the centre of the storm here unleashed in a student reading of Lady Chatterley.     In the end atonement is made - and McEwan and we accept it.     A personal note: For certain reasons I have been unable to muster the mental wherewithal to take up a book and read for nearly 2 years. I finally felt up to giving it a try, and 'Atonement' was the book with which I tried.

It starts with thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis accusing Robbie Turner of raping her cousin. This part of the book is a little hard to believe. Robbie is enamored of Briony's sister, Cecelia. He sends her a love note, mistaking the edited version for a previous draft in which he used the \\""c\\"" word. Ian McEwan then expects us to believe that Robbie would give the note to Briony to deliver. Briony is a willful little girl who lives sort of a fantasy life. She also has a crush on Robbie. Later, she catches her big sister and Robbie making love in the library. She perceives the lovemaking as an attack. Throw in a little class discrimination and you have a Jane Austin wannabe.<br /><br />After three-plus years in prison, we encounter Robbie once again as he winds his way towards Dunkirk after the French defeat in WWII. He is accompanied by two Cockney corporals who give him a bad time about his Cambridge degree. The corporals add a bit of comic relief to an otherwise brutal situation.<br /><br />In the third part, we find Briony Tallis working as a probationary nurse at a British hospital. One might compare Briony's situation to Marine Corps Boot Camp at Paris Island. Sister Marjorie Drummond, Briony's immediate superior, is a regular Nurse Ratchit. We also find Briony trying to make amends for what she did, hence the title. She's only eighteen but she confronts her sister and Robbie, who apparently survived Dunkirk.<br /><br />The final part of the book is so stunningly unexpected that it elevates the whole book one hundred percent.

The main character is Briony Tallis, a thirteen-year-old aspiring writer, who has led a mostly solitary existence in an English country manor - her much older siblings attending college, her mother confined to bed with migraines, and her father consumed with work in the city.<br /><br />A chain of events is set in motion with the prospective visit of brother Leon - sister Cecilia having already arrived for the summer. Briony has written a play, The Trials of Arabella, for the occasion, but her cousins conscripted as actors are proving to not be capable. Further frustrations and miscomprehensions occur as the romantic interactions of sister \\""Cee\\"" and Robbie Turner, a gardener on the estate and Cambridge graduate subsidized by their family, prove to be the undoing of Briony. In fact, Briony is so mystified by what she sees that she fingers Robbie for an assault - not of Cee - because she is so certain that he is a maniac.<br /><br />Briony after several years realizes her egregious mistake and its ramifications: Cecilia completely disowning her family and Robbie being incarcerated and forced to be a part of the English military force in France that failed to repel the Germans.<br /><br />At the end we see the seventy-seven-year-old Briony having written her final novel, one of atonement, concerning the devastation that she has caused in the lives of two people with so much promise.

If the answer is yes, please share the secret for how you knew. I'm still not sure when it happened.    Starting in pre-World War II England, Atonement focuses on the world of privilege enjoyed by the upper class and the growing attempts of its servants to cross the chasm. McEwan highlights this tug-of-war with the flirtation between the daughter of the house, Cecilia, and the son of the charlady, Robbie. Hovering throughout the book, Cecilia's younger sister Briony tries to capture the world as she see it through her writing, putting people into nice compartments, complete with happy endings. At 13, Briony is straddling the roles of child and adult.     Through her single faceted view of the world she sees a series of events between her sister, Cecilia, and Robbie that appear threatening because Briony lacks the nuanced understanding of what can happen between a man and a woman. In a naive attempt to protect her sister from Robbie, Briony falsely accuses him of attacking a visiting cousin, creating a chain of events that stretches over 60+ years.    Some have complained that this story ends in an unsatisfying way. However, McEwan within the last few pages explains more accurately, for me, what drives a writer, and thus, the reason for this particular ending. To often, we seem to expect a neat and tidy conclusion to our stories. Perhaps we're looking to escape from the chaos and uncertainty of everyday life.

Appropriately so, since it is a novel operating on a number of levels, some of them not apparent until the very end. \\""Atonement\\"" reflects life itself in all its complexity and seeming contradictions, as a great novel should.    Firstly, it is a novel about a novelist, Briony, and the way she   matures at a critical time in her life.  This permits the reader to see how Mc Ewan links an author's psychological and spiritual growth with the process of creating literature.    Mc Ewan uses the device of a publishers' thoughtful rejection letter to take a polite swipe at favorite authors such as Woolf and Joyce. The publisher suggests that exquisite renderings of either stream of consciousness or the external world do not suffice to make a great novel .  In order to give the novel  \\""back bone\\"" and to fully engage the reader, the author needs to provide a plot.    What the letter doesn't mention, and is left for Mc Ewan to demonstrate and the reader to notice, is that plot development serves as a vehicle for character development.  The attendant events of our lives shape us and we shape our lives.  This interactional balance underlies human reality and great novels reflect it. In that way they differ from short stories, fairy tales, or simple narratives.     Secondly, Mc Ewan uses an important psychological revelation that Briony experiences as a means of structuring the novel.  That revelation is that we all think ourselves unique, and all have our own particular take on any interpersonal situation.  This multi-subjective aspect of reality is incorporated by Mc Ewan through his having us see the world sequentially through the lens of each of the three major characters.    The challenge then facing the author, and indeed all of us, is that given the universal illusion of individual hyper-importance, how do we grow beyond that perspective and arrive at one that both encompasses and transcends our individuality.    Thirdly, in theDunkirk sequence of the novel, we are thrown into   a modern version of the Greek myths of War and the Hero's Journey.    Like Ulysses, Robin is determined to return home from the war to Cecilia, his Penelope. He shows persistence, learns to value his comrades, and exhibits courage.  All these heroic traits help him survive the ordeal.  But mortals are subject to the whims of the Gods.  Thus chance is also woven into the narrative, as it is in all our lives.    Robin is spared, while a mother and son he tries to save from death are not, for no apparent reason. That integral part of our existence, the dance between will and chance, is nowhere more apparent than in  this section of the book.    Finally, in the very last section of the book, wherein the author Briony speaks directly to us, the readers, McEwan presents the archetypal author as a kind of God who arbitrarily fabricates and destroys vivid characters..  Some of them possess a kind of immortality.  Anna Karenina; Raskolnikov; Orlando; are a few that come to mind.     Who then is more lasting and in some way realer, the fictional person or the reader?    I found \\""Atonement\\"" not only an engaging \\""hard-to-put-down\\"" read,  but also a book offering profound insights into what it takes to be an outstanding novelist.

I believe the editor should have encouraged McEwan to take out the first two hundred pages, which are told mostly through the incredibly obnoxious and annoying thirteen year old version of Briony, and the last fifty or so pages where the heavy handed attempt at showing the reader not to trust the narrator is completely unnecessary.

However, there are times that I just had to reread because I wasn't sure I really understood the sentence.   Some sentences are really really long -- needlessly so, I think.    The plot is interesting; lives are drastically changed because of a young girls vivid imagination.  However, life goes on.  This is a good read, but not a fast one.",2007-11-02

Briony Tallis, a spoiled British 13 year old, spies her older sister Cecilia and the caretaker's son Robbie as they wrestle with an antique vase next to a fountain. Although Briony imagines herself as mature, she does not yet have an adult understanding of the world. When the events that follow do not fit her scope of comprehension, she forces them into place with a lie that forever changes the people she involves. The novel follows the principals through the war and ends as Briony faces her own mortality in 1999.<br /><br />Especially during the first part (there are four) which takes place just before World War II, I could not help thinking of Henry James and his intricate exploration of character and relationships. I had to keep reminding myself that I was reading a contemporary novel. The only aspect that jarred me into the 21st century was McEwan's use of metafiction (fiction about writing fiction.) Briony is an aspiring writer when the story begins, but we are told almost from the start that she will become an accomplished novelist. Throughout, Briony is keenly aware of the demands of her craft and how they distort the truth. As the novel progresses, the reader is made more and more aware of this self-conscious side until the end, when the final section deals with this issue alone.<br /><br />Personally, I'm tired of metafiction and find it contrived; however, McEwan's polished writing atones for this literary sin. The details of life both before and during the war are extraordinary, as are the intricate characterizations. Although parts of this novel are overdone, it is McEwan's expertness that triumphs.<br /><br />Atonement is a fine book that deserves widespread attention despite its dryness. I recommend this book for serious readers and those who yearn for more classicism in contemporary literature. You'll want to skip this novel, however, if you don't have the patience for detail or are looking for a suspenseful or complicated plot.ant to skip this novel, however, if you don't have the patience for detail or are looking for a suspenseful or complicated plot.",2005-09-14

The growing tension of the story made it impossible for me to stop reading until the advent of a new course of action and I was released me until the next time.<br /><br />In the innocence of childhood, precocious talents are encouraged, applauded. But by the next stage of development, adolescents are often capable of spite and revenge, and exhibit a certain primal sense of justice. Things are black and white, not mitigated, by circumstance and inside a clever young mind, a twisted labyrinth of perplexing ideation emerges. Simultaneously the ripe possibility of consequence is irresistible, hanging suspended, the flash of guillotine glinting above the prisoner's exposed, perhaps innocent, neck. When the blade descends, imagination prances about, dressed as truth and clearly believable. The young girl, Briony, is so perfectly realized that I recognized myself in her, caught in the consuming greed for notice, compelling the adults to admit the correctness of her new-found maturity, rather than the unstable perceptions of a child. All is contained in the moment, not the consequences, for Briony is immersed in her own self-importance. She is incapable of perceiving the degree to which lives are altered, incapable of such consideration. I can barely forgive her this hubris, no matter what her age.<br /><br />Two other characters are drastically affected, their lives irrevocably changed: Cecilia, Briony's older sister, and Robbie, grown son of a family retainer. Helpless to change the course of events, Cecilia bitterly carves out a life she can endure, unwilling to meet with her sister for years. Eventually, as Briony truly matures, she begins to fathom the nature of her misdeed and the moral burden she bears. In her guilty angst, Briony is humanized and made available as just another flawed human being. There is an indictment, through Briony, of the class-consciousness that enables accusation and judgment without the need of adequate proof. The lower classes of 1935 London are, in Briony's perception, simply incapable of the finer instincts of her class and therefore culpable by default. Social acceptance by virtue of birth or background creates a false sense of entitlement, eroding the society that gives it credence. By the end, I felt in need of redemption myself.

I'm much more prone to choose a very interior, almost claustrophobic book that takes me deep into the heart and soul of the main character.  I found &quot;Atonement&quot; so engrossing, however, that I read the entire book in one day, something I usually don't do.<br />While most books can be described as either plot-driven or character-driven, I think &quot;Atonement&quot; achieves a wonderful balance between the two.  While &quot;Atonement&quot; is definitely not a &quot;page-turner,&quot; plot never takes a backseat to character in this book.  And, conversely, character never takes a backseat to plot, although, in keeping with the book's cool and formal style, we are kept rather distanced from the characters.<br />&quot;Atonement&quot; spans sixty-four years, from 1935 to 1999, yet the book is seamless and flows perfectly.  McEwan chose to write &quot;Atonement&quot; in a very elegant and formal style and I think his choice was perfect.  Subject matter such as that dealt with in &quot;Atonement&quot; could so easily slip into melodrama.  McEwan, however, always keeps everything perfectly controlled and definitely understated.<br />While I thought the understatement in &quot;Atonement&quot; to be a perfect choice, it did create a barrier that kept me from empathizing fully with Briony or any of the other characters. I didn't find them unlikeable, I just felt I couldn't get to know them.  I never really became a part of their world, yet for me, that did nothing to detract from the book.<br />I've heard several people complain about the ending of &quot;Atonement.&quot;  Some felt cheated or tricked.  Personally, I loved the ending of this book and can't imagine McEwan writing it any other way.  What I disagree with is the fact that the book is &quot;multi-layered.&quot;  If pressed, I don't think many people could explain what they mean by &quot;multi-layered.&quot;  This book definitely wasnot &quot;multi-layered.&quot;  We are given Briony's story and Briony's only.<br />I have to applaud McEwan for not judging his characters; for not using his book as a forum from which to make moral judgments.  This choice left the book a little more open-ended than some readers would have liked, but it added a poignant, fatalistic quality as well that I found lovely.<br />&quot;Atonement&quot; is a beautiful book.

The first part draws you into a confined setting, a very hot day in a country house and the preparations for welcoming the son of the house who is about to arrive with a friend. It lets you see the scene from the perspectives of the  different characters in the house. Although McEwan focuses more on the internal lives of the characters than on external events, and devotes most of the attention to their impressions and reflections on what takes place around them, you feel the tension building steadily towards what certainly must become a disaster. The second part describes the dire consequences of these events, which grow out of the lively imagination of a young girl who half sees and half imagines what is happening in the house and tries, with good intentions, to put things right. McEwan ties everything together beautifully and elegantly in the last part where the young girl has grown old and has spent all the intervening years trying to reconcile herself with what she did as a child. I don't want to spoil anyone's reading experience by giving details. The book was rather different from what I had expected based on the descriptions, but it is certainly one of the better books that I have read. It is warmly recommended.",2013-07-01
