This is the one of those books.  Compared to most of what's being published today, this is wonderful.  Compared to his novel Freedom, this one isn't as good.<br /><br />So much of what Franzen does here is impressive.  He tells the story of a retired couple, Alfred and Enid Lambert, and their grown children, Gary, Chip, and Denise.  Enid is looking forward to enjoying her later years but is ill-equipped to handle Alfred's Parkinson's disease.  The three children have all fled East from the Lambert's Midwest home and are dealing with problems of their own: Gary has a wife and three kids who are mutually manipulative, Chip has lost his job as a university professor, and Denise struggles to avoid destroying the life she's built.<br /><br />Ultimately, the plot comes to center around Enid trying to get everyone back home for one last Christmas together.  Like many great novels, however, this one is less about plot than about delving into character.  So many novels are barely able to develop one or two characters in their brevity and superficiality.  In The Corrections, however, each of the five major characters has a distinct voice, a fully developed narrative thread, and the way Franzen enmeshes their stories provides a richness that is missing from many novels.  It is impressive.<br /><br />And yet, it is hard not to be a bit disappointed when one has already read Freedom.  Compared to the Berglunds who are so very real, the Lamberts occasionally push over the edge into an intensity that seems contrived.  I am thinking of Alfred's hallucinations with trying to use the toilet on ship and much of Chip's narcissism, for example.  Because of this, I find it harder to sympathize with the Lambert's problems than with the Berglund's.  The layering of narratives in Freedom is also much more sophisticated than what is done here, which is a much more straightforward method of storytelling.<br /><br />I so wish I could go back and time and read The Corrections first.  I think I would have been much more impressed.  There is no doubt that The Corrections is a very good novel, better than most of what's out there.  On the other hand, I think Freedom is one of the handful of great novels that's been published in that last 25 years.

That he does it so well sure as hell entertained this old man.    I'm struck by how many reviewers, mostly American, seem to be unable to appreciate the trenchant satire in this book. Reminds me of an acquaintance of mine who says: \\""Lighten up; if you can't laugh at yourself, call me, I'll laugh at you.\\""    I enjoyed the discursive introductions to each member of this closely bound family in their attempts to establish a sustainable separate personal existence. And the constant tension between feeling on the brink of laughing at the characters and feeling moved by their predicaments. The last few pages are quite moving in their pathos.    My criteria for judging a work of fiction are quite standard ones: does the author create a coherent, credible world with credible characters, tell an interesting story involving those characters, use language in interesting and admirable ways and say something interesting, useful and/or truthful about the real world in the process.

I'm a lover. I will go so far as to say it is my favorite contemporary book of all time (so far). I read it when it first came out and again when my book club chose it. I was delighted to have an excuse to read it again. After finally finishing Freedom (which I really really liked but didn't love), I felt compelled to finally write a review of The Corrections. This book is a work of art. But you must enjoy and empathize with some extremely flawed characters. I loved them all, even Alfred, the father, who is probably the most challenging character to like. The scene in which Gary and his wife argue about the source of her injury (was it playing soccer with her kids or running to answer the phone when Gary's mother, Enid, calls?) and he proceeds to drink too much, attempts to trim the hedges, cuts his hand, and ultimately wraps it in a plastic bread bag is one of the most memorable scenes I've ever read. As ridiculous as their argument was, I felt for Gary the whole time. He was ridiculous and sympathetic at the same time. The chapter on the cruise ship with Enid and Alfred is also incredible and memorable. Again, to love this book, you must embrace human frailty wholeheartedly. I never wanted the book to end.

It is a long New Yorker story - bourgeois, vapid characters, no resolution, but beautifully written.  I stopped reading the New Yorker's fiction long before I gave up the magazine itself.  The individual sentences here, like in the magazine, are all beautifully crafted as if they came out of a graduate school workshop.  Stuff happens to the at-times interesting characters, but it does not as a rule seem to develop organically from who the characters are.  The characters are obvious marionettes for the author to pull the strings for.  Ultimately, the question revolves around a family getting together one last time for Christmas at the old family homestead.  They do - for one breakfast.<br /><br />This book sat on my shelf for a while before I picked it up, and I only did that with the recent laurels the author has received in the media for his new book.  After reading his earlier also lauded book, I have no plans to read further in his career.  The Corrections, like much in contemporary literary fiction, is celebrated for a stylistic competence and rightly so.  However, there is something lacking.

The patriarch and the matriarch, Alfred and Enid, still live in St. Jude in the home where they raised their three children.  Alfred, who is a retired railroad executive, suffers from depression and battles the onset of Parkinson's disease, while Enid perpetually competes with the Jones'.  The Lambert's oldest son, Gary, lives in Philadelphia with his manipulative wife, Caroline, and their three sons.  Like his father, Gary denies that he may suffer from depression.  The middle child, Chip, is a disgraced college professor who lost both his job and his chance at tenure by willingly allowing himself to be involved with (and manipulated by) a precocious female student.  Emotionally bankrupt and having no place else to go, Chip agrees to travel with Gitanas, the husband of his recent former girlfriend, to Lithuania and create an Internet business to defraud American investors.  Finally, Denise an accomplished chef in a trendy Philadelphia restaurant and a part-time lesbian, is beautiful but has no moral compass.<br /><br />The superb prose is no better illustrated than during the extended metaphor Franzen uses to allow Denise to compare her romantic experiences with her ex-husband, Emile, with those of her same-sex lover, Robin.  With Emile, Denise thinks, \\""The last thing she wanted late at night was to follow a complicated and increasingly time-consuming recipe for a dish she was too tired to enjoy.  Prep time was fifteen minutes.  Even after that, the cooking was seldom straightforward.  The pan over-heated, the heat was too high, the heat was too low, the onions refused to caramelize or burned immediately and stuck; you had to set it aside to cool off, you had to start over after painful discussion with the now angry and anguished sous-chef...\\""  Conversely, continues Denise's stream-of-consciousness, \\""Robin was prêt-a-mange.  You didn't need a recipe, you didn't need prep, to eat a peach.  Here was the peach, boom, here was the payoff.\\""<br /><br />The title is a multifaceted play on words that relates to themes and ideas in the parallel story lines.  For Chip, the corrections are literally his belief that his screen play immediately requires changes.  (Chip's girlfriend, Julia, gives Chip that idea when, after she reads the screen play, she dumps him.)  For Alfred, corrections to his deteriorating mental state may be possible through a phase-II testing drug being manufactured by a biotech firm that bought a patent that Alfred himself developed in his basement many years earlier.  The idea of corrections permeates in some way each of the main characters' lives, some of the secondary characters' lives, and throughout the entire story as well.<br /><br />The stories build to a climax when, after a great deal of emotional blackmail from Enid, the family, sans significant others, convene for Christmas at the Lambert ancestral home in St. Jude for one last time before the train in Alfred's mind leaves the station for the last time.  The event is not exactly what Enid had anticipated, but does provide a reasonable resolution, a somewhat happy ending, and even more corrections.  In this reviewer's opinion, corrections are, if not synonymous with, are certainly a close relative to rationalizations.<br /><br />While the pages in `The Corrections' turn very easily, the reader detects an undercurrent of cynicism, which is just a bit disconcerting.  While the reading is technically superb and the story is rock-solid, the tone may be suggestive of the author's arrogance, aloofness, or superiority to traditional family values...but THAT is part the story.  To base one's dislike of this literarily sound novel on the author's contemptuous opinion of what family life in the Midwest may be is akin to panning the film `Leaving Las Vegas' because it waswritten in the context of prostitution.

The two major protagonists, Alfred and Enid Lambert have been married nearly 50 years and have spent their lives in a town called St Jude, Iowa.  Albert is a retired railroad engineer who, since his retirement, has spent his life in  a recliner and who has recently developed Parkinson's disease and probably dementia.  In his younger days, Albert spent much of his time in his basement in a metallurgical lab, where he secured two patents for his amateur studies.  Enid, his wife, has the burden of taking care of Albert.  She wants to have a lively life in retirement,to go on cruises and have fun. She craves the company of her family, the couple's three children.  In particular, she wants her children and three granchildren home for one last family Christmas in St Jude. Enid has been frustrated, emotionally and sexually, by Albert's aloofness, silences, and frequent business absences during their marriage.<br /><br />The couple has three children, Gary, the above-mentioned Chip, and Denise, each of whom have severe problems in their lives.  Gary is financially successful with three children but his marriage is in difficulty and he, as did Albert, suffers from a depression that he won't acknowledge to himself.  Chip, the failed academic, lost his teaching job due to an affair with a student. He borrows large sums from his sister, Denise, and finds himself in Lithuania in a con-scheme with a former Lithuanian diplomat with whose estranged wife Chip has had an affair.  Denise is a successful restauranteur, who had her first sexual experience as an adolescent with an older married man when working as an intern on her father's railroad.  She later marries and divorces a restauranteur substantially older than herself, and then finds herself involved with a married man as well as with his wife in a lesbian relationship. The stories of Albert, Enid, and the three children are all told at great length with many flashbacks, culminating in the final section -- the long-awaited and predictably disatrous Christmas dinner in St. Jude.<br /><br />The book has aptly been described as combining elements of Thomas Mann's early masterpiece, \\""Buddenbrooks\\"" and the contemporary American writer Dom DeLillo's \\""White Noise.\\""  As does \\""Buddenbrooks\\"", the work involves the decline of a family and a culture. Importantly, both books emphasize the works of the German idealist and pessimistic philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. (Albert in the book, somewhat too obviously is an inveterate reader of Schopenhauer.)  The book gets its brash, overwritten, irreverent and highly critical tone from DeLillo, a writer I have never been able to enjoy.<br /><br />Franzen's book has good moments and moments I thought were dreadful, but ultimately it for the most part worked for me. His characters, both the members of the Lambert family and the many secondary characters, are brought to life in all their troubles. The social criticism -- the discussion of the claimed materialism, selfishness, lack of values, technological obsessions, lack of sexuality and intimacy of the current United States, is unmercifully pounded home again and again. There is a tone of alienation, superiority, shrillness and judgment in this book which I found off-putting.  One looks for both compassion and understanding. There is little of this until, perhaps, the endof the tale.  The book is far too long for what it says and in many places overwritten.<br /><br />In spite of these distinct shortcomings, the book moves along and pivots convincingly from \\""tragedy to farce\\"" as it least some of the characters achieve an insight into themselves and to the dissatisfactions in their lives. For all the modernist trappings, the book has a relatively traditional message -- in its emphasis on trying to enjoy life in the everyday, to take the moments of love and sexual intimacy that come one's way, to not shut oneself off from others, and to avoid negativism -- of the sort otherwise on too much display throughout the book. There is the hint of a possible redemption from the woes that beset the characters through lightening up a bit and through working towards a happy sexual and loving relationship. The book is probably worth the effort it takes to read -- as these efforts tend to point out that the achievement of the goal the book sets forth is not easy, under the best of circumstances, and requires a degree of reflection and insight to see and realize.<br /><br />Oprah Winfrey did this book an honor by featuring it on her show.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanoo long for what it says and in many places overwritten.

The writing is often splendidly funny or entertaining, and the book is not without some insights into the American family, but too often the book veers into satire or shallow caricature apparently to avoid addressing complexities of character.    In my view, Franzen did not effectively use the many fantastic (synonym \\""unreal\\"", not \\""superb\\"") episodes to weave a coherent statement about American life today, but allowed them to devolve into jokes simply for humor's sake.

There are numerous strenghts, including the ability to create characters that seem to take on a life of their own. I was very impressed with Franzen's ability to create fully-developed, phychologically present characters with the Lambert family. Every character in the book is developed with sensitivity, realism, and insight into the workings of the human heart. Despite the justice that Franzen dispenses to this characters, Denise (the daughter), Chip (the youngest son), and Enid (the mother) are the most fully developed.     Franzen's treatment of Denise, the bi-sexual chef daughter, is superb and is really an unforgetable character. This may be one of the finest characterizations of a female bi-sexual in English literature.    Enid, the mother, is perfectly drawn as a mom who's judgements of her own children are heavily influenced by her peer's perceptions of her children. This core insecurity does not allow her to really see her children, who and what they have become, and keeps her trapped in a nieve state of denial and unrealistic romanticism. My heart went out to her even as I cringed at the manipulations she attempts on her husband, children, and grandchildren to situate them in her vision of familiar harmony and happiness. This was perfectly drawn in the passages of the Christmas daily calendar where every day a little window is opened until December 25th when the youngest child in the family opens the 25th window with a picture of the Christ Child behind. These seemed to be Enid's outward familial ritual that conveys to her inner soul that everything is alright, everything is at peace.     Chip, the college professor who has sex with one of his students, takes methamphetamine with her, writes her term paper for her, and then gets fired by the University is a perfect example of the bright rebellious person who has yet to sort out their own demons and thus becomes victim to these internal demons despite the high intelligence.     The language is beautiful in this book, even when describing cruise ships, basements, and share holder meetings. The book is long but rewarding in that the story of Denise could have been a stand alone novel but is certainly more enjoyable embedded in the context of her family background.",2007-08-17

The characters and their experiences are so well written that they begin to seem real, almost too real at times. Franzen unapologetically forces his reader to see through his characters' eyes (through those of all five principal characters individually); to experience their personalities, relationships, struggles and emotions first-hand. Though this vision can sometimes be depressing, infuriating, sickening or even heartbreaking, I couldn't look away. Other times, the view through his characters' eyes is exciting, hopeful, romantic and humorous. Whatever the view happened to be, it always felt authentic, and often, very familiar.<br /><br />Franzen's prose is masterful and refreshing. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about his writing is that it has a pleasing, almost musical tone, yet still seems effortless. His characters' dialogues are so natural that their sarcasms and subtleties are evident without the reader having to be explicitly told or shown. His metaphors and similes are not only fresh, but so fitting that I felt a little jealous that I hadn't thought of some of them first.<br /><br />The Corrections may seem like an odd title, but Franzen injects the term \\""correction\\"" in various forms throughout the book. More importantly, the characters all undergo some sort of \\""correction\\"" in their lives.

Enid and Alfred have never had a good marriage.  Right from the start they have clashed: he is too focused on his work and not focused enough on giving his wife the attention she needs.  She tends to nag and to fixate on appearances.  Despite these problems in their marriage, they produce two sons and a daughter--Gary, Chip and Denise, to whom they pass along various psychological problems.    Now grown up with lives of their own, Gary, Chip and Denise are just as unhappy as their parents.  Gary lives the picture-perfect life.  He has a beautiful wife, lots of money, a stable job, and three sons.  However, he is suffering from depression, constantly feuding with his wife, and he can't seem to connect with his boys.    Chip pretends he doesn't need his parents' respect.  He is an intellectual, a college professor on track for tenure and a guaranteed job for the forseeable future, but then he throws it all away to have an affair with a student.  He has a habit of sabotaging his own life.    Denise tries to act the part of the caring daughter, but she can't seem to do what her mother wants--settle down with a nice man and start a family.  Instead she has a series of affairs with married men before deciding she might be a lesbian.    In his retirement, what was supposed to be the best time of Enid's life, Alfred develops both Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's.  He is cranky and unpredictable and driving Enid crazy, since she believes he is not really as helpless as he acts.  However, she tries to put on her best face and act like things are still fine.  She becomes fixated on having her whole family back to her house for one last Christmas, feeling like if she could make that happen then things might be okay.  Her children, though, fighting with demons of their own, aren't quite so enthusiastic about the idea.    Some of the language in this book was beautiful.  Some phrases and entire paragraphs took my breath away.Franzen has a gift for examining the mundane bits of life in extraordinary detail.  However, this gift becomes a curse when it takes a story and drags it out as long as this story has been dragged out.  Description is wonderful, but not when it pulls the reader out of the story for pages at a time to explore a flashback so  detailed that by the time the character returns to the present, the reader has completely forgotten the flow of the story.    The excruciating detail is not the major problem, though.  The major problem is that every character in this story is absolutely despicable.  I found the descriptions of how Alfred and Enid treated their children when they were young almost painful.  However, after having read about Gary, Chip, and Denise as adults, I found I couldn't be sympathetic to them, either.    I certainly understand that all humans are flawed, and some stories more than others examine the darker parts of human nature.  However, there needs to be some balance in characters.  Every one of these characters was so overwhelmingly deplorable that there was no tension in the story.  I wasn't rooting for anyone to find success or happiness, and as the novel plodded on, I found I was less and less concerned with the continued failure of this family to connect with each other or the rest of society.",2007-04-08

He builds suspense in the smallest spaces of the human mind, and yet sees the importance of the big picture, and leaves gorgeous clues as to where his characters will find themselves, or where they see themselves.  Like Pynchon and Wallace, he treads the sometimes surreal area between the landscape and the land, and lets the reader often decide which, but he does not venture so far into his own mind that you forget which story he is telling.  His structure is brilliant, reminiscent of vintage Faulkner in his timeline, but honestly his ability to tie events together throughout his characters' histories, and present the results of past actions as beautiful surprises in the prose reminded me more of Thomas Hardy.  Readers unfamiliar with literature might need to keep a dictionary handy, but I always enjoy that aspect of prodigious novels.  However, Franzen is here to tell a well constructed story, not convince us that he's read the OED, which can't be said for some writers of equal stature.  Loving your family and friends despite their faults is what living life is all about, and someone able to attain that goal in a novel is a writer of literature, not storybooks or badly disguised scripts for Lifetime original movies. <br /> <br />Those who stopped reading this book half way through completely missed its point.  Everyone has quirks and dysfunctions, and Franzen's laser beam eye for them does make the reader squirm, but squirm deliciously, at their own foibles and those of their own family members, and laugh at the same foibles. It's hard to find tragedy that's so damn funny.  But a dysfunctional family is simply the MacGuffin here.  This book is not about solving problems among family members (none of them get solved) but about the hope that lies beneath all hardship, the humanity behind the dysfunction. <br /> <br />Readers who do not like these charactersmay be lying to themselves about their own idiosyncracies.  Although I identified a lot with Chip there is something in each of these characters that holds a mirror to the reader.  What Franzen possesses in great abundance is a love of people, a love of humanity that transcends the darker side of human behavior.  Without that love of humanity, there is no way he could have written this book.  When you reach the end, its ultimate message is hope, after all, true hope that it is never too late to be happy in life.  What better message can a book bring forth than that?",2007-02-12

Everything I've read in which Jonathan describes our shared suburban and corporate milieu - in \\""The Corrections\\"" and later New Yorker pieces - rings true. And I've been quick to pick up on minor errors of setting and social background made by other authors of realistic fact and fiction in cases where I know the territory. <br /> <br /> I can see many parts of my father in Jonathan's dad, and I hear my mother-in-law in Enid's party descriptions. It's so easy to satirize guys like our fathers: Midwesterners from small towns, first generation to go to college, engineers (that almost goes without saying!) who worked hard and moved up the executive ladder in Old Economy corporations. They didn't talk much, they voted Republican, and they seemed really, really boring. Jonathan is the first writer I've encountered who ultimately treats them with the respect they deserve and appreciates their basic integrity, while still chronicling their foibles and his own father's descent into dementia.  <br /> <br />As I grow older, I've come to feel grateful and even proud to have been shaped both in opposition to and imitation of this kind of stubborn, conscientious, judgmental and extremely hard-working German-American, rooted in the real world, and capable of surprising insights, complexity, and even (sometimes) compassion. From my reading of \\""The Corrections,\\"" I'd say Jonathan feels the same way. <br /> <br />The arrogance of the smart Lambert kids, confident they've risen above their parents' limitations and dysfunctions, is also very familiar and credible, I can say from experience.  <br /> <br />After such a long spell of narcissism, magical realism, and/or self-absorbtion in contemporary fiction, it's a treat to have social novelists like Jonathan, Zadie Smith (\\""White Teeth\\""), and Jeffrey Eugenides (\\""Middlesex\\"") writing and being read so widely. \\""Middlesex\\"" is a great, multigenerational Detroit saga that checks out with the real world, at least to this longtime observer of Detroit and armchair student of Detroit history.

The characters were revealed to have motivations that originated outside themselves and suddenly it became impossible to care about them. As they became absurd in Franzen's eyes, they became absurd in mine. He abandoned them and cut them down to less than human fictive types. They were no longer human beings and hence I felt little for them in the end. I think this is a very good book except for Franzen's fatal misstep.

(It is close to 600 pages and I read it in five days.) The book is about the Lambert family, which includes the aging parents, Alfred, who seems to be dying of Parkinson's and other attendant ailments, including dementia; and Enid, his wife with a bad hip and a lack of patience for Alfred's failing health. They live in a fictional Midwestern city, St. Jude. It's also about their three grown children, Gary, a bank VP, who is married to Caroline, and has three boys, Aaron, Caleb and Jonah; Chip, a professor of \\""textual artifacts\\"" fired for writing a paper for a student and then stalking her, who spends time on a Lithuanian Web-based financing scheme; and the youngest, Denise, a chef, who may or may not be a lesbian.<br /><br />The book is loooooooooong, although it was a pleasure to read, and I think my only substantive criticisms (which I'll just get out of the way), are that it may at times be uncontrolled and it has a lot of sex in it, overtly and covertly. After awhile I realized, that except for Enid, the matriarch, all the characters wanted to have sex with women. Gary did. Chip did. Denise did. I'm not sure that there's anything wrong with that, but it makes me wonder if Franzen just can't write heterosexual women very well. I don't know; I've never read anything else by him.<br /><br />This book is simultaneously dead-on on the realistic detail as well as fantastic, and there are some funny moments, including an early moment in which Chip is correcting student papers and writes in the margin: \\""Cressida's character may inform Toyota's choice of product name; that Toyota's Cressida informs the Shakespearean text requires more argument than you present here.\\""<br /><br />That said, there were things about this book that just made me draw in my breath because they were so pitch-perfect about the chaos and complexity of family life. Enid, as the mother, is an interesting case, because she seems never to think that she deserves to have anything she wants, but, oh!, she wants things desperately, so she manipulates people to ask for the things she really desires and initiates. She hounds Denise to help her father with his exercises, then tells Alfred, \\""Denise wants to help you with your exercises.\\"" She also seeks to avoid responsibility for her comments. Note this passage from page 515:<br /><br />\\""I don't mean to criticize,\\"" Enid said, \\""but [smoking]'s a terrible habit for your health. It's bad for your skin, and frankly, it's not a pleasant smell for others.\\""<br /><br />Denise, with a sigh, washed her hands and began to brown the flour for the sauerkraut gravy. \\""If you're going to come and live with me,\\"" she said, \\""we need to get some things clear.\\""<br /><br />\\""I said I wasn't criticizing.\\""<br /><br />Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Moments like that show Franzen a keen observer of the interpersonal familial dialogue! He certainly gets right the way the kids grow up in the same family, have completely different experiences and different responses to the way they were raised and their aging parents.<br /><br />And their responses lead me to my final idea, the meaning of the title. There are many corrections in the novel. Chip, while a professor, lives across a bog from a correctional institution and Gary, the stockbroker, who has an interesting interior monologue on how he is not depressed because serotonin gains outnumber declines in his brain, draws connections with market corrections, the Big One of which comes toward the end of the novel. Other corrections are more oblique (but I tried to pay attention to the use of the word in the text... I was an English major, afterall). There is the correction adult children try to make for the shortcomings they perceive they had to endure in their upbringing. There is the correction that adults try to make in their growing children to keep them from not only \\""bad\\"" people, but too unusual (there's the requisite, \\""You're going to sit there until you eat it\\"" scene). There is the correction that consumerism can make to a lonely or unhappy soul. There is the correction drugs (legal and otherwise) can make to an ailing psyche. There is the correction family members seek for their aging father's terminal illness. There is the way the father views his hospitalization as time spent in a correctional institute.

Enid, his ever-faithful wife, never lives a day without her rose-colored glasses to filter out any element of life that does not comport with her extremely sanitized version of how life should be lived by respectable white people.<br />Alfred and Enid Lambert's three grown children, Gary, Chip, and Denise, each live full lives of their own, and through Franzen's complete writing, we come to know the details and idiosyncrasies of each life. Reading this book meant coming to know a family and gave me a sense of what I am missing.<br />Family is not all \\""I love you\\"" and \\""I can't wait to see you,\\"" as a prisoner comes to remember it. This book provides much more depth. We come to know Gary's midlife depression and insecurities. He is a successful banker by profession, faithfully married to a beautiful and well-educated woman whom he loves, and together they have three loving children. Despite Gary's apparent success, he drinks too much and is more anal than any other character I've ever read. What made me identify with the book more than anything was how much of Gary's character I see in my own behavior. If a book is great when it helps us learn something about ourselves, I would say that Franzen's exceptional novel is one of the best I've ever read.<br />Chip, the middle son, lacks Gary's discipline and strict code of values. He is 40 and, despite his Ph.D., still hasn't found his way in life. Chip trips along from one bad decision to the next, and only in the final pages of the book does Chip make the transition from an empty suit to a man of substance.<BR>Denise, perhaps the most complicated character in Franzen's novel, is a free spirit. Loyal to her family, but more loyal to her independence, she shows both a strong will and a determination to pursue happiness on her own terms, even if her alternative lifestyle turns conventional, white bread life on its head. I admire Denise's commitment to live her own life, consequences be damned.<br />My own father suffers from Alzheimer's, and as a result of my imprisonment, I have had no contact with him for several years. Because of the length of my sentence, I don't expect that I will see or talk with him again. I never saw his struggle with dementia, and despite the vivid descriptions my sisters gave me, I never really know what it meant to lose one's mind. Through Franzen's descriptions of Alfred, I feel as though I've come to know dementia and what my sisters have gone through in caring for my father.<br />Although Franzen takes us back to early episodes in each character's life, the story takes place over the timeline of a single season. And in the end, readers come to realize that, just like the Lambert family, we all make choices that take our lives in different directions. The corrections represent those decisions we make to bring us back together.<br />This is a wonderful story of American family life. I recommend it.",2003-07-13

The novel received glowing reviews from nearly every reviewer, and it is not difficult to understand why.<br />&quot;The Corrections&quot; introduces us to the Lambert family, five individuals struggling to cope with life.  What struck most reviewers about &quot;The Corrections&quot; was the realness of the characters, who have both faults and strengths and are never simple.  This description in fact underestimates the characters.  Instead, what makes them so strong is that, just like with real people, the reader shifts between loving and hating, respecting and despising each of the Lamberts.  There are no heroes in this book, yet there are no villains either.  Instead, the reader will have no choice but to accept each character with all their faults and strenghts.<br />Franzen writes with a ringing clarity.  He ignores the florid descriptions that occupy so many novels of today, instead using the language sparingly.  His descriptions are taut and witty, but not for the sake of being witty.  He writes entirely to serve the characters.<br />&quot;The Corrections&quot; is a character driven book, not a plot one, therefore it should be skipped by those who want action and twists and turns.

Still, I really have to part company with those who feel these people are somehow unreal or trite. Chip, the self-involved, middle child desperately clinging to the very last shreads of his pretentious, psuedo-hip youth, is painful precisely because he is so very recognizable.<br />Nor can I agree with the readers who found this a hopeless story devoid of any real redemption.

It's the story of Alfred Lambert's descent into dementia and the attempts of his family to cope with the old tyrant's decline.

You can even feel that the chapters set back in St  Jude are reminiscent of the American novelists of the first part of the twentieth century, Sinclair, Veblen, Cather, Dreiser, Fuller, while the chapters in the suburban east have touches of Updike and Cheever.

Don't get me wrong, characterization and an eloquent writing style elevate this novel over the crowd, but midway through the book, I began to wonder whether the fine writing was more than a clever gimmick and whether anything of substance underlay the delicate descriptive passages. Oftentimes, I had to wonder whether we were discovering anything new as we learned more and more about depression and Alzheimer's disease. 40 pages would go by and the author would sing the same song, so consumed by the art of writing, by the creative process of devising new ways to describe the ordinary, that his message began to suffer. Soon I had to conclude that hiding behind the clever, page-long metaphors were empty revelations and lackluster observations of the human condition (Al's business trip describes his dissatisfaction with his wife; it took some 30 pages where 1 or 2 would suffice)<br />On the whole, the absence of heroic characters surprised me. Not that I expect an author to present his characters sugar-coated and on a pedestal. What I missed was an insight into their souls. None of his characters seemed admirable people. Instead, Franzen, much like American media and America in general, appeared obsessed by the private life, by the substance behind the barrier that separates the private and the public. And that did not make his characters more real or genuine to me. Ever since I saw Election, I question whether such attention to 'complete reality' is interesting, revealing, ground-breaking, or simply plays on our desire to be shocked. Is Mr. Franzen really convinced that all of us are just like the Lamberts? I don't think that that is the conclusion. More like is that Mr. Franzen simply considered the shocking as the only unexplored. I don't know, I can't really form a final opinion on the subject. While I read I was too preoccupied reading about out-of-control body-excrements, depression and Alzheimer's to form a conclusion. And I am not that interested in reading the whole book again.<br />What I did like, was one impression the book left behind: our lives are full of white lies and pretences; just think how we would feel if a disgruntled European told us face to face unabashedly what they think of us Americans (something the Europeans, bless their souls, are found of doing). We would dislike him instantly but never say so openly. Our society is simply build on pretences and it will not change. And that is what Mr. Franzen's characters must combat. Franzen seems to conclude in the end that to have what it takes to change ourselves is culture shock, war, death, those types of Earth-shuttering events that destroy our belief-system. Is that something new? No. And that is what saddens me. That we offer Mr. Franzen's book as the high point of our fiction, where comparisons to great fiction would be insulting. I think that the book was well chosen for Oprah's book club. It had a nice point of view to drive home about the American Family in the post world war II era.

Post modernism is the sampling and juxtapositioning of other previous styles. Franzen's narration wonders through a forest of other author's styles: Thomas Pynchon, Walker Percy, John Updike, Ken Kesey and Don DeLillo (some have said J.D. Salinger -- maybe, but I don't think so). There are pointed references to Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Knut Hamsun and others.

This novel challenges its reader to be as intellectually open as its author.  A reader must be willing to swim around in one's own intellect, and realize that it is okay to read something that is smarter than the average person.  Mr. Franzen wants the reader to realize that to read one must constantly be learning about the world around them.<br />What this novel is more than anything a study of the American family.  Mr. Franzen ignites an intellectual debate over how imperfect the ideal American family is, no matter how hard the people involved are trying.  Enid, the mother, tries harder than anyone in the family to ignore imperfections and focus on the idea that her family is wonderful.  Eventually, it takes drugs to enable her to live in this fantasy realm.  At the end of the novel even she realizes that she cannot live in her fantasy and will need \\""to make some changes\\"".  The father, Al, has left this world behind and, through Parkinson's, is living in his own fantasy world.  It is because of this disease that we find out how hard he has tried to protect his perfect family (hiding his daughter's affair with his coworker, and believing in the greatness of his wild son).  The most powerful aspect of this is the fact that all three of the Lambert children are completely messed up.  Mr. Franzen shows that the no matter how hard parents try to raise their children in the \\""American Way\\"", they cannot control how their children will grow up.  Each child has a different affliction, Gary is depressed, Chip is a sexual addict, and Denise looks for affection in all the wrong places, but they begin to realize their faults and instead of blaming their parents take their faults upon themselves.<br />I think that those who have a hard time with this novel are the people who are not allowing their intellect to run free.

Chip is a screw-up of the most annoying kind--brilliant and bored. The sibling rivalry and parental preference is outlandish and sickening.  I cannot imagine children being raised in such a functional dysfunctional family being this passive aggressive and jealous. There is nothing endearing or sympathetic about these characters.  They are merely pathetic.",2002-10-27

I myself was bemused and somewhat skeptical, thinking maybe Franzen was taking himself a little too seriously while laughing all the way to the bank on the heels of Winfrey's selection, wanting to be read by intellectual males who might theoretically balk at a book with the \\""Oprah's Book Club\\"" sticker on it.  I finally got past my reservations, and after putting down the book for a month about a third of the way through, I just finished the thing and think I read a masterpiece.<br />Franzen does have his foibles as a writer, and some of his early scenes in particular I thought were pretty indulgent.  I hated the first page, in which he describes the metaphor of an \\""alarm bell of anxiety\\"" for far too long, and I was put off by the name of a law firm (Bragg, Neuter and Speigh) that seemed like a childish trick which a \\""serious\\"" writer like Russell Banks, John Updike or Ian McEwan would never pull.  Maybe Carl Hiaasen would name a law firm after operations to sterilize pets, but why mess up the Great American Novel?   And while I am griping, why begin the the section of the book introducing the character Denise with a 20 page history of the Passifaro family, which includes the lady that ultimately became the wife of Denise's boss? In a 568 page book, sometimes less is more.<br />Alright, enough of my criticisms - what did I really think?  Well, about halfway through the book each of the balls Franzen tossed in the air became more and more engrossing, and by the end I thought the novel simply breathtaking.  The author effectively tied up all the loose ends in satisfying fashion, and the book concludes the only way the novel really could end.  Any reader whose family has been touched by dementia will be moved quite a bit.<br />Most of you who have gotten here are familiar with the background of the novel.  Alfred and Enid Lambert live in the fictional midwestern city of St. Jude.  Alfred, a retired railway engineer,  is slowly slipping into dementia via Parkinson's Disease, while his wife Enid firmly believes all of the family's myriad of problems would be solved, or at least swept under the rug, if she can get all three grown children back to St. Jude for one last Christmas.  Franzen effectively changes the narrative focus, and we see that all is not well with any of the younger Lamberts, who each seem to be facing a crisis at home.<br />Youngest Chip is a poor aspiring screenwriter who realizes, to his horror, that the screenplay he just submitted a) makes little or no sense; and b) has a bizarre fixation on womens' breasts.  (Maybe Franzen had recently read John Irving's A Widow for One Year and had a little fun at his expense?)  Through a bizarre turn of events Chip ends up in Lithuania, helping the local government bilk money out of foreign investors.  Meanwhile middle child Denise, a renowned chef whose trendy Philadelphia restaurant lands her on the Food Network, makes a mess of her personal life with dire consequences to her career.  And finally there is eldest son Gary, a banker who is battling alcoholism and an increasingly antagonistic marriage, and who angrily campaigns for his parents to sell the old family house in St. Jude before the house's neglect and disrepair strips it of all value, or before Alfred accidentally burns it down.<br />Each of these mini-dramas is played out, in sometimes maddening detail, but by the end of the novel each of the Lamberts becomes entrenched in your subconscious, and you find yourself caring for the characters, foibles and all. I thought in particular the battles between Gary and his wife Caroline, including his stubborn insistence that she admit how she REALLY hurt her back,  were written with keen insight and biting humor.  I loved the scenes where his kids mock him in chorus withhis wife, asking him,in his drunken stupor, to make them a \\""mixed grill\\"" for dinner.  I also loved the reminisces over past Christmas vacations at Gary's house, where his wife threw out a cheap robe given by his visiting mother before she even left town.  Franzen seems to have a remarkable sense for how chasms form in marriages over seemingly trivial events and disagreements, and how parents then use subtle means to enlist the kids as allies. <br />There are occasional rough patches to be sure, I suppose a novel of this size is bound to have at least a few, but overall I thought The Corrections was brilliant, funny, well-researched and most certainly worth the effort.

Enid Lambert is trying to get her scarred and scattered family together for one last Christmas.  If you need more thrills and explosions, don't read The Corrections.

Without a doubt, Guidall's interpretation and performance added much to this novel, but you gotta give props to J-Fran.  Here is a novel that not only tries to make a point (many points, actually) but is consistently entertaining and ridiculously accessible.  There was not a single moment where I felt as if the book was dragging.  I even liked all the Lithuania sections, which some people thought too pedantic.<br />The book is crafted by joining long, third-person-voiced sections together, and there's nothing too spectacular or brilliant about the way it moves.  They're all just very solid sections that give us the opportunity to be with each of the main characters of the Lambert clan - first Chip, the failure son who's a stand-in for Humbert Humbert (tangent: Melissa - 3 syllables, just like Lolita; Lambert - sounds a bit like Humbert, no?  Coincidence?  I doubt it); Gary, the oldest son who is succesful in business yet a powerless moron with his vicious family; Alfred and Enid, the parents, as they spend a wretched vacation on a luxury cruiseline; Denise, the daughter who's a chef and has issues with her sexuality....<br />If I can find one fault with The Corrections (and believe me, it's not easy), it is this: sometimes, it felt as if the characters were being put through the ringer just so Franzen could make a point.  Sometimes, you could see the strings on the arms and legs of the characters as they were being yanked and jerked by the author.  But even when this was happening, I could never honestly say that I didn't enjoy it.  This book made me laugh, if not through the black-humor-laced plot, then through Franzen's pure ability as a writer.  I laughed because some parts were genuinely funny; other times, I laughed because I didn't think a human being was capable of writing down so many great lines in a single paragraph.  The Corrections came with muchhype, and I'm happy to report that it truly lived up to every red and orange line of accolades printed on the back of the dust jacket.  In this novel, Franzen has managed to join together the dark beauty of Vladimir Nabokov and the concise brutality of Richard Yates.  Franzen is the Cirque de Soleil of verbal acrobatics.<br />My personal favorite part of the book was the last section, because by that point, Franzen seemed to have exhausted all the bigger ideas and was only interested in dealing with the Lamberts.

While the premise of emotional twisting and turning within families, especially families dealing with an aging/demented parent, is interesting enough it is really the characters that shine through.  Each character in this drama is fully crafted, given their own lives/problems/personalities, and is felt with incredible authenticity.<br />We begin with Alfred, the somewhat demented patriarch suffering with parkinson's disease.  He's a stern, bitter, retired engineer who suffers delusions of [things] crawling up the walls.  Even in his demented state, though, he inspires fear in his adult children.  Alfred would seem an easy enough character to dislike, but don't count him out.  We glimpse a hidden side of him near the end of the book when his grown daughter learns that he left his job to protect her honor, without ever telling her, so that he could spare her shame.<br />Enid is the family matriarch, living within an unsatisfying marriage for over fifty years.  Now Enid finds herself confronted with an increasingly needy husband and all the problems that are attendant.  All Enid wants in the world is one last Christmas with her family at home, which just happens to be the thing that her family wants least in the world.<br />Gary, the oldest son, is perhaps depressed and certainly drinking too much.  Perhaps it's because of his stifling marriage to a woman who has little desire to be an adult herself, perhaps not.  Gary subscribes to a strict philosophy of materialism and persues this to it's logical conclusion.<br />Chip, the next Lambert child in line, has had a terrible time with adulthood.  He believes that the consumer society is to blame for many of the world's evils.  Unfortunately, he loses his chance at tenure because his morals don't extend to keeping his hands off of his students.<br />Denise, the youngest and only female Lambert child, is a divorced star chef who is having serious sexual identity issues.  Her relationships take her on a wild ride, which culminate with being caught by her girlfriend, with her girlfriend's husband.  And oh, her girlfriend's husband is also her boss and didn't know that Denise had been sleeping with his wife.<br />The Corrections is a very well written story that was just a pleasure to read.  There are dark moments that will make you cry. There are moments that will make you dread the day that you have to deal with your aging parents.

Father Alfred is slowly fading away, due to the onset of Parkinson's Disease.  Mother Enid wants her family, which also consists of her grown children Gary, Chip, and Denise, to spend one last Christmas in their childhood home.  These are highly intelligent but emotionally scarred people.  These are the Royal Tenenbaums, these are Salinger's Glass family.  As Enid's attempt at a reunion are consistently rebuffed, author Jonathan Franzen presents the reader with a portrait, a dramatic tableau, of each member of the Lambert family, the better to understand why they wouldn't want to come home for Christmas, but probably should anyway.<br />The book is divided up into long chapters, each focusing on one member of the Lambert family.  It would seem to be a simple structure, one that even the most pedestrian reader could follow.  But this belies the complexity within each chapter.  Time, in Franzen's hands, is dynamic, as he jumps liberally back into each character's past, then slowly forward to the present.  He does this with skill and precision, but also without fanfare.  Careful attention must be paid, else a lazy reader will get lost.  This technique allows Franzen to slowly build up the fabric of the Lambert family, as the reader sees patterns emerge within the lives of each character.  It also helps that Franzen allows you inside the characters' heads, to see the world through their eyes, giving their internal dialogues a chance to be heard.  What you see and hear, however, is not always pretty.  Often times, these people -- like, I suspect, most of us -- are quite ugly in their private moments.  You'll see how Alfred's dementia makes his life a confusing place, how oldest son Gary's depression creates in his home life an oppressive hell, how middle child Chip's obsessions and fantasies and masturbatory perversions dotheir best to ruin his promising teaching career, and how youngest child Denise's own confusion and anger conspire to ruin every relationship she has.  Each character's thoughts, as they would themselves think them, are laid bold on the page.  It's an intriguing and credible rhetorical technique that Franzen's skill as a writer pulls off perfectly.<br />Franzen lets his technique show far too often.  Writing that strives to tear apart the seams of literary convention often times bores me.  I prefer it when a writer just comes up with a stronger stitch.  Franzen toes the line between these two tendencies.<br />When writing about Gary and his family, for example, Franzen uses an inordinate amount of exclamation points.  Usually this would indicate a flaw in the author, that his limp prose must rely on punctuation to convey meaning.  But Franzen, in full control of his prose and willing to show his skill at every turn, uses it to indicate something about character: that Gary and family, outwardly successful, are empty and dysfunctional on the inside.  It's a less than subtle technique, though.  At least the other characters wear their dysfunction under their sleeves; Gary's is right there in the punctuation.  Less effective still is Franzen's use of that suddenly-tired modern literary convention, the e-mail conversation.  Chip and Denise's dialogue would have been traded through lengthy, handwritten letters, doing yeomen's work marking the passage of time, if this novel had been written but ten years ago.  Now, they just exchange half-formed thoughts, inside jokes, and not much content.  Maybe that's the point (not maybe; I'd gather that is exactly the point), but it made for unenlightened reading.  Neal Stephenson, in his long crypto-tome \\""Cryptonomicon\\"", is the only writer I've encountered so far who has been able to effectively update this technique for the modern age.<br />More effective, however, is the way Franzen recasts familiar situations to suit the inner thoughts of the character they are happening too.  Alfred's battle with overwhelming incontinence is told as if he were planning the safety inspection of a railroad (one of his duties before he retired).  Denise's sexual technique is recounted as if it were a recipe for a particularly complicated dish (she's a cook by trade).  These, and others just like them, are wonderful extended passages, where Franzen ably relates the inner and outer lives of these characters, allowing them to intertwine into one level of existence.<br />The inner lives of his characters are further complicated by his use of an omniscient and often times judgmental third person narrator.  This technique is usually reserved for objective storytelling, presenting the facts as they lay.  But Franzen's authorial voice has an intelligence and awareness all its own.  Witness this little bit about Enid:<br />\\""'There's bacon, you like bacon,' Enid sang.  This was a cynical, expedient fraud, one of her hundred daily conscious failures as a mother.\\""<br />These are the narrator's words (\\""a cynical, expedient fraud\\""), not any one character's.  Never afraid to take a stand, Franzen performs vivisection after vivisection on his unsuspecting creations, the better to understand them inside and out.<br />Has Franzen written the Great American Novel?  It's great, and it surely is American, but applying that three-word adjective to this tome at this point is a little hasty.  I suspect, because it makes specific reference to pop culture icons of its time (Stanley Tucci, Jennifer Aniston, and Chloe Sevigny -- amongst many others -- are all name-checked here), it might not be relevant five or ten years down the road.  Is it a darkly comic vivisection of a modern midwestern family?  It sure is.  Funny and tragic at once, Franzen is able to straddle the line between these two tones with remarkable ease.  His book is truly insightful, mercilessly satiric, and endlessly readable.  Not a book that will change the world, mind you, but still well worth the read.",2002-08-22

All the jibes he made at society were understood, and the book has value in that sense, but the &quot;disgusting factor&quot; cancels everything else out in my opinion. I give it three stars because it was interesting at times, and I think he is a talented writer. However, I'm used to reading books with sentences you understand the first time!!

Well, like everything else, it's a matter of personal taste. Being a Manhattan-based web-consultant who loves William & Sonoma catalogues, I found it to be hilariously and painfully true to life. I was unable to put the book down after the first five pages. Some of my friends couldn't get through the first paragraph. If you're like my friends, then put the book back on the shelf and walk away, because you're not going to find anything different later on. The book is highly stylized, and there's no point in slogging through it if you don't like stylized books.<br />While the book does cover a lot of modern societal obsessions, I wouldn't call it a satire. Like all good books, it is really about universal aspects of the human condition, love, sickness, and loss. The blue tuxedos and fusion restaurants are beautifully described, but serve mainly as a backdrop to the characters' personal tragedies. Each one is consumed by hisn (or her) failure to secure what we all want: love, forgiveness, security, and a sense of place in the world. They are achingly vulnerable, but also hampered by flaws that make it impossible to relate meaningfully to anyone else. What I found so disturbing about the book was that it showed how we are all inexorably shaped during childhood, before we have any choice, and there's no guarantee we'll be able to buff out the psychic dents we're left with. Enid and Alfred are each repellent in their own way, but Alfred dies miserably while Enid gets a second chance. Chip and Denise muddle ahead, while Gary's left with a wife who uses his family against him.<br />It irks me a bit that so many reviewers here saw the characters' flaws as an indictment of American society, though perhaps that is what Franzen intended. Reading some of what's written here, you'd wonder why the Bible prohibits avarice and envy, as they were clearly invented in America some time during the industrial revolution. I really hope that Franzen's intention is deeper. For instance, there are obvious parallels between Franzen's \\""Mexican A\\"" and chemically-based personality facelifts on one hand, and real-life anti-depressants on the other. I don't think that anyone would seriously argue that Prozac destroys your personality, though. What really struck me was that Franzen's miracle drug took away the *capacity for shame*. For me, the corrosive nature of shame was a major, and moving, theme. I also liked lefty, intellectual, lit-crit Chip's obsession with an unattractive undergraduate who unabashedly enjoys herself and her life. That, I think, is the point Franzen really wanted to drive home. Life is hard enough. Why make it worse for yourself and everyone around you?<br />All that being said, I would not call this an epic piece of literature. It's funny, sad, touching, and timely. But not timeless.",2002-08-07

I've noticed that a number of reviewers have complained about the characters in the book but that's probably because there are plenty of kernels of truth in this book that probably remind people too much of their own lives.<br />The book made my very uncomfortable a number of times and I'm still grappling with some of its implications.

Franzen does a great job of doing just that - this is an excellently written novel, clever and perfectly paced, in which Franzen uses expertly crafted characters to sketch a wildly inventive portrait of an imploding American family. <br />The characters in The Corrections wallow in their flaws and shortcomings, make mistake after mistake, and in general are recognizable and human.  The novel essentially is a snapshot of the lives of three siblings, and the plot (insofar as there is a traditional plot) revolves around their mother's effort to get them all back to the Midwest for one last Christmas.  For a book without a traditional storyline, however, this novel covers a lot of ground.  Franzen captures the various settings with authority: from Wall Street to the smalltown Midwest to Eastern Europe on the shadow of the fall of communism.  Franzen's prose is rich, inventive, effortless, and complex - and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.<br />The issue of Alzheimer's is not handled with sepia toned sentimentality, but instead in the harshly lit, cruel, tragically comic style that is much closer to reality.  In my opinion the passages which chronicle Alfred's decent into senility are among the most effective in the book.  This isn't a guidebook for handing Alzheimer's with dignity; it's a novel which instead sets out simply to reflect the disease's terrifying effect on the afflicted, and its impact on loved ones.  This isn't a self-help book; don't expect to be consoled.  <br />Then there is the hype.  Franzen's prickly views on the literary high road didn't originate with the flap over The Corrections getting the nod as an Oprah pick; several years ago he'd panned the booming book club phenomenon for \\""treating literature like a cruciferous vegetable that could be choked down only with a spoonful of socializing.\\""  Perhaps Franzen should stick to writing novels and leave the PR work to someone with better social skills, but a look at some of the reviews on this very website might lead one to believe that his comments weren't far off-target.  There exists the perception that the Oprah crowd has been conditioned to expect uplifting stories with easy-to-follow linear plotlines and inspiring protagonists.

My critique could be deemed simplistic in that I admit favoring prose which is succinct and colorful and clear. But my impression of &quot;The Corrections&quot; is that for all the talent which might be present in Mr. Franzen's work, this 500 or so pages ought to have been a first draft, one which suffers for what other people deem metaphoric brilliance. To me, it's heavy, unedited description which will drive you to madness almost as well as his adverbs and stilted way of presenting dialogue. I say read White Noise or the Body Artist (De Lillo) if you're looking for De Lillo-esque writing.

Although I don't particularly agree with the philosophy of life/worldview that permeates the novel, he is obviously intelligent and thoughtful, which makes for an interesting read. I also found his characters to be realistic and captivating, and I found the book to be hard to put down.<br />BUT ...<br />What is the deal with all of the sexual hangups and screw-ups?

Apparently, it makes the urban East Coast feel better to imagine this seemy, dark side intermixed with breath-taking ignorance in all of the inhabitants of that large, netherworld that they call the midwest. It's the same mindset that sees a novel based exclusively in Manhattan as general fiction, but anything based west of Pennsylvania as a form of one regional genre or another.

While the premise may seem blase and overworked, Franzen delivers a captivating novel that throws the dysfunction in your face while still generating enough empathy for the characters to allow the reader to feel connected in a familiar and almost surreal way. <br />The book is organized in an easy-to-read fashion. Each section of the book focuses on a different aspect of the family, whether it be a character or a relationship, and ties each bizarre limb together by way of a central storyline - the mother's desire to have her entire family together one last time for Christmas. Franzen is extremely detailed in his development of each character and does an exquisite job making each member of the Lambert family come to life. The passages are well-written and colorful. The language is purposeful and imaginative. It is obvious that Franzen worked very hard crafting this novel.<br />My only criticism is that the early portion of the book would have benefitted from some additional editing.

The book is rarely judged on its own merits, on whether of not it is simply a good, entertaining novel, but instead, judged on whether of not it is the greatest piece of literature ever created, an inherently unfair standard.

Franzen's characters are some of the most three-dimensional characters to ever hit the page. Each character is so fully fleshed out that it is hard to believe they are fictional. Franzen doesn't just give you just a base level understanding of each character and then move on, instead you get even the most subtle details of each characters personality. You have the overbearing mother, who stubbornly refuses to face reality, the repressed, distant father rapidly losing control of his body and mind, to their grown children, all of whom, in their own way, have made a mess of their own lives in an attempt to \\""not be like their parents\\"". While the topic of dysfunctional families if far from original, it is rare to see the subject dealt with in such an entertaining and authentic way, without stereotypical characters or a convoluted plot.<br />I had two criticisms of \\""The Corrections\\"", having nothing to dowith the story itself, but more to do with the length and pacing of the book. Each primary character in the novel is given his or her own section, almost like a novel within a novel, which, while serving to give the reader a detailed understanding of each character, did get a bit tedious. The section where the parents, Alfred and Enid, are on a seniors cruise was so long and often boring that after awhile I was ready to jump overboard myself. That chapter easily could have been cut down by half. Also, while I appreciated that each character was given equal coverage in the book, I thought the novel would have flowed better had it been paced differently. Instead of separating each characters story into individual sections, I think it would have been wiser to have interspersed between the various characters throughout the book. Franzen could have kept all the same information in the novel, but made each section seem less exhausting. Another problem with dedicating an individual section of the novel to each character was it made it a bit hard to keep all of the various stories straight. For example, Chip, the character who is the focus of the novel's first section, doesn't return until several hundred pages later, so by the time he reappeared I had forgotten so much about his situation that I had to spend an annoyingly long amount of time going back to the first section of the book to refresh my memory.

Further, after reading several reviews on the site, I was alarmed at how only a few wrote about some of the true themes from the book.  The Corrections is not simply a book about a dysfunctional family.  Nor is it just a satire of internet culture, pharmaceutical dependence, or the stock market boom.  It is how these fit together into the American experience, certainly not ALL experience, but definitely a comment on what's perceived as important in our society, from the author's skewed point of view.  <br />That said, The Corrections is not a brilliant novel.  Ambitious, but far from perfect.  I did feel a little encumbered by some of his thicker passages, but it was readable.

It seems the most savage reviews started like this: \\""I was the only person in my book club to finish this...\\"", which leads me to believe Franzen was right in questioning the inclusion of his book.  The Corrections is not for everyone.  The plot isn't uplifting.  The characters are not easily identified with.  Obviously it isn't for the regular Oprah readers.<br />Case in point: a reviewer complained the book overlooked religion.  How does religion factor into consumer culture, or the stock market, or the neurosis war in the Lambert household?  The characters are products of mainstream American culture.  Does it surprise anyone they're not very good human beings?  Could it be Franzen's contempt for the Lamberts is really contempt for our society's misplaced values?  A lot of these one star reviewers really don't scratch the surface.  I'm not saying my interpretations are more valid than anyone else's, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of effort to pry underneath aesthetical objections to the Corrections.  But again, the book isn't for everyone.",2002-05-05

It does not seem to look too far beyond our present predicament and at times the various strands of stories seem more like a very good but mechanical cut and paste job and less like a soulful organic whole. The Corrections seems at times too detached and clinical despite legitimate insights and entertaining and humorous detail. This is a large,ambitious and partially successful novel that never quite attains the emotional sweep and power of a great novel.  I most enjoyed Chip's story and wish there had been more detail about the Leftist intellectual phase of his life and how his Left beliefs and ethics collapsed.  Chip seems to be emblematic of many on the left whose personal Weltanschaaung disentegrated along with the collapse of Eastern European Communism--this, despite the fact that  most had been sophisticated enough to maintain a critical distance from these deformed socialist states. The bitterly humorous depiction of Chip's involvement in a cynical capitalist plot in post-Communist Latvia illustrates how thoroughly he has been corrupted. His hedonistic pursuits illustrate another aspect of his decline and sense of confusion.  His brother Gary has always been an ambitious individual who never questions the capitalist system and sister Denise represents a third \\""alternative\\"" that is more \\""spiritual\\"" and New Age. They are lost as well. There seems to be a common desire for a guilt free and perhaps even emotionally pain free life but here is also an intense hunger for significant real feelings that is evident in their various self-inflicted injuries:  cigarette burns and bloody hedgeclipper cuts, sacrificial gestures in a world of sterile and meaningless choices.  I think Marcuse would have liked this book and seen it as a confirmation of his One-Dimensional Man.  The basic plot conceit of trying to get the dispersedfamily together again for a Christmas dinner reminded me of Anne Tyler's Dinner at The Homesick Restaurant, a less ambitious but tighter novel.

Alfred has developed Parkinson's disease and his physical and mental health is steadily and tragically deteriorating. Enid wants the entire family to get together for one last Christmas at their home in St. Jude, presumably before Alfred dies. Enid originally wanted Gary to bring along his wife and children for Christmas, but it is apt that he eventually goes by himself. After all, this book begins and ends with the immediate family.<br />_The Corrections_ concerns the interrelationships of these five characters. The books also gets into the individual lives of the three grown children and with Enid's increasing inability to cope with Alfred's illness. What I found particularly interesting were the various individual relations and alliances that form within this family, including the expectations each family member has for the other. Gary is Enid's favorite, and as a child endeavors to work hard to please his mother. Chip, the intellectual and later errant middle son, is Alfred's favorite, and the only one that Alfred is able to trust after he becomes ill. Alfred is seen calling Chip's name for help, even when Chip is not present. Both parents are concerned for Denise, who is the youngest and their only daughter. Denise becomes a talented chef and restauranteur. Enid is afraid that Denise is having an affair with a married man and that she will never marry. Denise has other ideas.<br />This is not just another book about a dysfunctional family with quirky characters. Each family member is well-drawn, three dimensional, and flawed.

My dad's name is William, and he has Alzheimer's disease.  <BR>    Jonathan Franzen's portrayal of Albert's interior life knocked me to my knees.  Sad as I am about the almost daily deterioration of my father as the man I use to know, I can't honestly say that I gave him credit for occasional moments of lucidity until I meant Albert in the pages of The Corrections.

I would have thought that it was my age that kept me from enjoying it more.  Jen, however, is only 28 or so.  Her connection with Franzen's world is more real than mine.  The lifestyles of the main characters, including the use of drugs and rampant promiscuity and countless partners, etc. kept me from relatingat first.

Mostly I want to know how to do what Franzen did.  He crawled inside the minds of divergent people and revealed them through their own thoughts.  I think Jonathan was right when he turned down Oprah.  Her audience strikes me as not being up to the task.  I also don't think he needed Oprah's stamp of approval.  I think that his is a book people need to force themselves to read because they will be ultimately changed by it.

His commentary on American pharmaceutical culture, the fractured American family, and (upper) middle class consumerism is solid. It's just not anything new.

Franzen's novel focuses on the Midwestern Lambert family consisting of parents Enid and Alfred, two sons Chip and Gary,a and daughter Denise.  True to the dictates of dysfunction conventions, Enid and Alfred's relationship has become basically estranged and non-communicative, both between themselves and vis-a-vis their children - a situation greatly exacerbated by Alfred's intensifying senility and Parkinson's Disease, as well as Enid's obsessive sense of dutiful \\""correctness\\"" and unquestioning allegiance to middle American orthodoxy.  Naturally, their three children, all of whom have moved to the implicitly Godless East(Philadelphia and New York),  have gone about more or less making untidy messes of their own lives: Chip, a 39 year-old radical college professor who manages to get himself fired for having an affair with one of his students, borrows money shamelessly from his sister, works as a part-time proofreader for a law firm, while laboring endlessly on a screenplay that stands little chance of making it onto the big screen. Through a series of plot contrivances, he winds up flying off to post-Communist Lithuania with his ex-girlfriend's husband to pursue an Internet dummy company funding fraud.  The other son, Gary, a successfulbut weak-willed investment manager,allows himself to be badgered and nagged by his manipulative wife and two elder sons, while obsessing on whether he's depressed or not, and, if so, to what degree.    The daughter, Denise, a cordon bleu chef, is a workaholic who is wrestling with her sexual identity -jumping from failed marriage, and heterosexual affairs to the arms of female lovers-while working 16-hour days trying to open her own successful haut cuisine eatery.  The trials and tribulations of this off-kilter clan is the subject matter of this alternately exhilirating, exasperating, and much too often distasteful read (much too much tortured prose is devoted to eliminatory and excremental matters). Also,when dealing with Denise, Franzen irksomely bedevils the reader with line after line of culinary arcana, as if  trying to impress with his gourmet erudition. This reader got quickly, (pun intended), \\""fed up\\"".   This last complaint crystallizes too much of what, in the final analysis, is wrong with \\""The Corrections\\"". The book is simply shamelessly overwritten -at times the reader almost feels as though he needs a machete to hack though the dense prose.   When Franzen, forgoes his self-conscious desire to be \\""oh so literary\\"", the book is quite entertaining and lively, but too often he bogs himself down and becomes downright dreary. Some episodes go on far too long towards unsatisfying dead-ends(this is especially true in the \\""Denise\\"" portion), while Chip's misadventures in Lithuania seem hurried and superficial.   There are also confounding contradictions in his attitudes towards his characters. For example, Franzen implicitly takes son Gary to task for using \\""insider\\"" information to make a killing in the market, but than is critical of the father Alfred for not doing the same in a similar situation earlier in his life.                                  Finally, although the ending of \\""The Corrections\\"" is reasonably moving, the reader cannot help but feel that it is somewhat illegitimately grafted on- not quite earned or following logically from all that preceded it.  In the last analysis, Franzen's sprawling novel is a worthwhile read, but it is flawed, too often as annoying and tiresome, as it is provocative, insightful and entertaining.

US,51182732,R1B1J97KP9HKRF,0374129983,647099960,"The Corrections",Books,1,28,41,N,N,"The Emperor's New Clothes in bookform","At our most recent Bookclub Meeting we discussed amongst other things the question: What makes a book literature? The Corrections is certainly hailed as that. Does it deliver? To give you a hint: so far I seem to be the only person in our bookclub who has been able to finish it, which may have been helped by the fact that I was prevented by an injury to do a lot of other things I'd rather have been doing - such as going to the library to get something else to read. <br />Now... what brings me to this unfavourable opinion? Maybe it's the picture of the author. He looks a lot like my ex-husband, possibly a bit smarter (not so difficult) but equally self-absorbed. Maybe it's the way this self-absorption shows in his writing. OK, he has a good eye for all those cunning little details. Does that mean he should be allowed to wallow on and on? He certainly has to be praised for his doggedness in filling more than 500 pages. Unfortunately half of them could have been deleted without being missed. Maybe his literary agent was too busy fanning the hype instead of calling Franzen to order? If so, the mission was succesful. This book has been very effectively advertised, even to the extent that I wonder if Franzen's refusal to 'be an Oprah book' was not just another marketing trick.<br />For me a good book is one that moves me in some way. Favourite books are like friends, to be enjoyed time and time again. This book is about a so-called dysfunctional family. I don't know enough about families to judge if this one is truly dysfunctional. What I do know is that none of the characters in this book moves me. I have absolutely no desire to revisit this family. Even if the descriptions are poignant and lots of things happen, the total impression is one of gloom and doom. This could of course be intentional and even part of the selling proposition (let's make it more depressing - that way it will look more like literature!). <BR>However, I'm totally baffled by reviews that call thisbook 'sexy' or 'funny'. 'Heartwrenching' I could agree on. After all, some people enjoy watching trainwrecks or another person going to pieces, don't they? Or do they? More importantly, do you? And if so, what does that say about you?<br />After finishing this book I reread one of my long time favourites: a Lord Peter Wimsey novel by Dorothy Sayers. First published in 1923 I have never seen this promoted anywhere, but that does not stop Dorothy Sayers (or Nevil Shute, to name another truly great author) to still have a loyal following of readers. This book, too, is full of superfluous words and descriptions... each and every one of them enjoyable. Which proves that it can be done - but not by Jonathan Franzen. At least not until he grows up and starts to be either entertaining or truly meaningful. The Corrections is neither.<br />If you really want to read this, don't invest your own money. Loan a copy first and see if you still want to read it after the first ten pages or so (I can promise you it will not get any better). And by all means do not buy a so-called collectible copy, with as only 'collectibility' that two pages are reversed. Sellers are charging between fifty and almost two hundred dollars for first editions of this book.... (Chip would love to be in this business, a living example of exactly the kind of hype described in the book. But then - he is already in this book, the poor thing.) Our bookclub got it at Amazon, first edition, sticker and all. <br />Now I must correct myself (see how I, too, cleverly can insert corrections in my text? gee, it's easy to write!). In one way this book did move me. It moved me another big step further away from books that are intensely promoted by the relentless USA publishing industry. And it will move this copy out of my book case FOREVER. If after all this warning you still want a copy - our bookclub has several for sale.",2002-03-20

On the most basic level, it has a soap opera thing going, and the travails of its characters draws you in.  With that said, don't expect to like all the characters.  They are most definitely flawed, and we see their vision of the world through their skewed views.  The description of son Gary's depression, I belive, was dead-on, and I sympathized with him very much during his discover period.<br />Basically we see each of these people as they go through major changes in their lives--Corrections, if you will.  Each has gone so far in one direction and finds they must do some reversal soon or they won't survive it.  In my own experience, these &quot;corrections&quot; are most often difficult and painful to experience and watch.  All of the characters in &quot;The Corrections&quot; are basically good people, but you have to work to like them.  If you need to really like the characters in the books you read, then this book is not for you.  However, if you like interesting, multi-layered characters, then dive right in.<br />The weakest aspect of the book, in my opinion, was son Chip's business venture in Lithuania.  A week after finishing the book, that section sticks out to me as not fitting with the rest of the subplots, and hence I only give the book 4 stars.  But that is no reason to dismiss the novel.

Forget it (and please don't insult one of the greatest writers who ever lived). I had no trouble at all finishing the over 700 pages that 'Buddenbrooks' covers. But the only way to finish 'The Corrections' was quitting it, a decision I only postponed because on principle I never quit a book. So I struggled through 320 pages blindly ignoring the obvious fact that it wasn't going anywhere. Well, it wasn't. 'The Corrections' seems to be just the next book by a novelist who took a course in contemperary writing. All basic rules taught in such a course can be seen to full effect in this novel (or whatever you should call it). They run something like this, I imagine:<br />1. Avoid clear story lines at all times, but instead apply a  garble of as many flashbacks and flash forwards as you can possibly fit in.<br />2. Annoy your reader with constant slow-motion, focussing on details of details, or on reflections on musings on thoughts of characters. Hallucinations are also great! The content or relevance of these are not an issue; the more trivial they seem the more suggestive of hidden depths they will be (and your reader, who is far less clever than you are, will never find out that there are no such hidden depths). Don't forget: banality is the hallmark of a contemporary novel!<br />3. Be very, very clever. Insert as many citable oneliners as you can. Don't worry if they are totally gratuitous (\\""Dry land lacked this z-axis\\""). Also, it is good to add many difficult words, a few in foreign languages, preferably. Don't ever say that 'things are quiet because father has taken to sleeping a lot'; better say that 'a Pax Somnis is descended on the household'. Doesn't that sound literary! And of course show off everything you (or your encyclopaedia) know: add little asides on say, Scandinavian history, Baltic politics, Dutch waterworks, psychofarmaceutical treatment or organ registration.<br />4. Don't bother with chapters or even paragraphs - just ramble on at will! Please wallow in the conviction that your novel is so engrossing the reader will never want to put it down, so no breaks are needed. Which, by the way, saves you the trouble of structuring your plot. Or better still, you don't even need one!<br />5. Use lots of similes. Far-fetched is always OK. Or you can be just plain ridiculous and, say, liken the act of intercourse to a model railroad engine tunneling up `warm and gently corrugated recesses'.<br />6. Avoid any trace of normality in your characters. A story becomes so much more interesting if people are paranoid, selfish, destructive, stark raving mad, abusive, addicted to drugs and porn, incontinent and generally dysfunctional! No character, not even a secondary one, should be without its great, dark tragedy.<br />7. Add gimmicks: a little picture of a logo here, a little diagram there, marked 'figure 1' - very sophisticated!<br />8. Of course sex should always be the clue to everything, which also gives you great opportunities to write very modern things with lots of four-letter words! You may even occasionally want to print these in capital letters.<br />9. Other, preferably revolting details involving bodily fluids or excrement are also very contemporary: use them!<br />Well, you get the picture, and it isn't pretty. What Franzen tries to do has been done already, and so much better, by for instance Jay McInerney or Douglas Coupland.

I really can't fathom the 1-star reviews, except to think that Enid Lambert (the mother in the book) wouldn't have liked it either! Some of the 1-star reviewers are comparing it to Taylor Caldwell and TOm Clancy, so.<br />The Corrections combines the social criticism of Don DeLillo (it reminded me strongly of White Noise at times) with a very human, character-driven storyline that is reminiscent perhaps of Anne Tyler or Ann Beattie. It is a novel of ideas hidden in a story about a family. Every character will drive you crazy, and yet each is entirely sympathetic. The Lamberts are rich, multi-dimensional characters. I feel that I know them all well.<br />The book is sad yet not depressing (in my opinion). It can serve as a warning to readers -- of what kind of relationships NOT to produce -- with one's family, partners, possessions, money, ideas...<br />One thing that disappointed me about the book was the Pynchonesque conspiracy that seemed to be developing around the Axon Corporation -- they bought Chip's father's patent, their law firm employed Chip, the parents of the young woman who destroyed his career ran a mutual fund that was the only source of information on the web about Axon's process, he was referred to the law firm by Eden's husband, who talked obliquely about the company in the hilarious fish-in-the-pants scene...why all these connections?

In her words, and those of her friends, it was brilliant, witty, timeless, and relevant. Given her enthusiasm and the great reviews that this book has received here and elsewhere, I was hoping for an engrossing read. What a disappointment.<br />I like books with the following characteristics:<br />1. A strong plot,<BR>2. Three-dimensional characters and a discernable character arc,<BR>3. A non-intrusive authorial voice,<BR>4. A theme or issue that is universal to the `human condition' across all times and places. <br />Unfortunately, \\""The Corrections\\"" had none of these. <br />1. This book really contains more of a situation than a plot: a dysfunctional family gets together for Christmas.<br />Structurally, it's written a lot like a typical disaster movie (although no doubt Franzen would be horrified at this comparison). First, all the characters and their back stories are introduced. Next, there is the obligatory foreshadowing of Something Bad  that will happen later on. In a movie like \\""Airport\\"", you'd see the bolts on the left wing rattle ominously then come loose. In this book, dad falls off the cruise ship. Moving on, the characters eventually board the airplane (arrive at the ancestral home) and Disaster ensues (dad has a medical crisis.) During and following the crisis, all the characters experience some sort of awakening and come through the experience changed. (Cue uplifting music.) As I said, standard disaster movie fare.<br />Unfortunately for those of us who enjoy plot: A) the Disaster doesn't arrive until around page 540 (of 568 pages); B) the back story for each character is chock-full of irrelevant, pedantic digressions about rail roads, drug use, supposedly-shocking-but-really-very-very-boring sex, oh and some faux Lithuanian politics; C) there is no build up of tension-the climactic moments are shown to us using the same snarky tone and plodding pace as the treatises on rail road politics; and finally, D) in a cheap, tacked on epilogue, Franzen *tells* us (rather than shows us-don't they frown on this in MFA programs these days?) how each of the characters has changed as a result of dad's collapse.<br />The character arc actually occurs in the *epilogue*!<br />2. These characters are so stereotypical that they border upon being demographic categories. You have the clueless wife, the work-aholic, ailing husband, the angst-ridden, ineffectual academic, the ambitious, latent lesbian daughter, the burnt-out corporate exec, etc. No doubt there are marketing departments all over the U.S. collecting statistics to target these very people. Was this Franzen's point?<br />From the other reviews, it is clear that many people can relate to these characters and their travails. Unfortunately I was not among them, and Franzen is so contemptuous towards his own characters that those of us who don't empathize with them immediately never get the chance to do so later on. These characters are tokens, place holders like chips at a casino, and none of them have any soul-even a dark night of a one-at all.<br />It's not a question of \\""likeability.\\"" I don't need to like characters to find them interesting or dynamic--Don Corleone anyone?  But in a character-driven piece like this one, an author must interest his/her audience in the lives of his characters and help the audience empathize with them no matter how despicable they might be. Franzen tells tells *tells* us all about their horrid lives but given his emotionally superficial style, he cannot make these 2-D characters come alive for someone, like me, who didn't have an immediate/a priori emotional connection (via personal experience) to them.<br />3. Franzen bludgeons the reader to death with self-conscious, manipulative prose. No two ways about it, the book feels forced. If you collect \\""favorite sentences\\"" from books you read, you might enjoy \\""The Corrections\\"". Personally, I enjoy writing in which the writer himself is invisible and the words transport you to a new world and into the lives, hearts, and minds of the characters. A good turn of phrase here and there can be nice in a book, but I don't think that the reader should be catapulted out of the story again and again because the author wants to demonstrate his \\""wit\\"" or his skill with a thesaurus.<br />People have claimed that this book is a \\""difficult read\\"". It's not, at least not in the way they mean it. What I found difficult was not the sentence structure (are compound sentences, semicolons, and run-ons supposed to be exotic these days?) or the so-called advanced vocabulary. But rather slogging through page after page *after page* of clunky metaphors, snide asides, and calculatedly \\""clever\\"" and \\""shocking\\"" vignettes that contributed nothing to the understanding of the characters nor to the progression of the plot. Where was this guy's editor?<br />4. This book is relevant only to its narrow little wedge in history (middle-class families in the late 90s early 00s). In contrast, sure \\""Moby Dick\\"" is a book about a whale, the whaling industry, and one guy's quest to kill a whale. But what makes it great is that it is also a tale of obsession and revenge, of human against nature, themes that resonate across time for all of us, not just those readers who happen to share the characters' particular demographic slot.<br />There are no broader conclusions that a reader can draw from \\""The Corrections\\"" except that families in the 90s are screwed up, boy and how. This is not exactly a newsflash. There is no redemption or transformation for any of these characters and no message or insight about the human condition that readers can take with them after wading through the Lambert's lives.<br />So, is \\""The Corrections\\"" a great novel?

Anyone who thinks this family is anything more than mildly dysfunctional has never read a newspaper or seen a Jerry Springer show.  Basically, the characters are all mildly successful, BUT completely non-interesting, self-absorbed, self-sabotaging individuals who would never have picked each other as friends if they hadn't been born into the same family in the first place.

I found The Corrections describing me too closely for my own comfort -- not in the acts of the characters but in their base motivations. Chip (off the old block) and Gary draw the x and y axes of my own bad character. Alfred (the Great) was truly admirable but made everybody uncomfortable. Wouldn't it be better if we just did away with the old guy and failed without his judgement? <br />The book works psychologically and cosmologically for me, and even if the listing and language go over the top at times, one of the novel's very subjects is the over-the-topness of American life, the anxiety of being born with too much for hope to have meaning, of coming after the climax.  The novel seems to be Chip's screenplay -- a tragedy that works better as farce. <br />As the Great American Novel, well give me a minute longer before I say. I liked it better than Death of a Salesman because it made me laugh out loud, and at the same time I've seldom seen the grief of age rendered with such dignity. Indeed, that grief is all the dignity available. <br />My own Alfred-Dad is nearing 80, and I moved to Alaska in part to escape his shadow, to escape the expectations of that entire hardworking post-WWII world in which every mother's son was expected to be a doctor -- or anything you want to be! <br />Tocqueville warns that too much democratic freedom can weaken individuals. He says Americans don't fear death so much as sustained effort.  Once I shook off the irritation that phrase caused me -- unjerked my knee -- I realized how many times in and since college that I have made decisions based almost entirely on how much more school I would need, and then, what if I didn't like it? None of us wants to reach the end of life and look back to find we didn't live, but our solution is to do a thousand stupid half-baked things to be sure we don't get stuck like Dad did. Anything but what Dad did. <br />What is so scary about what Dad did? Why does that seem so much like notliving even when the evidence of his life dwarfs us?<br />If The Corrections spells painful news, well, it's painful news. I know this review will help no one who has done everything right and who has no guilt. If you find no problems with the American way, if you feel no uneasy feeling about the world we live in and the way we live in it, don't bother with this novel.

Would she be dosing on prozac and diet pills. Would Lenin be struggling with an obsession for internet porn? Thankfully, we'll never know these answers.

Can a person grow to love characters that have every single one of their secrets revealed? Are there not things that all people consider private? Do you really want to know anyone this well?<br />Jonathan Franzen has managed to collect together a family portrait so vivid that it captures the inside and out. However, the bad pun of truth here is that we only see the negative. Or, you might argue, we see only the truth, and there is no positive in the truth. Maybe, everyone is just this way. Maybe everyone is simply a pastiche of faults, clamboring through life, trying to make as little an ... of themselves as possible. An amazingly terrible insight that is bleated on and on throughout an otherwise brilliantly written work. Franzen's insights are too dead on to be produced by anyone other than a co-conspirator of the banal and hopeless. But if there is beauty in banality, if excrement - babbling nonsensical profanity as it drips down the side of a wall - can be beautiful, it is only Jonathan Franzen, in this big book, who has forseen this potential.<br />My final question: is it wrong for me to rate this novel with only four stars, when I admit completely that it was wonderful? Full of wonders. What must it have included to garner that one extra star? What was it missing? Not reality. Not clarity. Not humor or wit. Character growth is there. It's all there. Is it too real? Does it hit too close to home? Is it true that we really want to escape the world when we read these days, and not face things as they are? Maybe the final star is a strike against me, and notthe book. Regardless, my rating stands. As for readers interested in buying - do not take this book to the beach with you, or on a cruise.

He obviously learned a lot about railroads, metallurgy, culinary arts, medical research, Lithuania, and oh yes, Shopenhauer. He is to be applauded for his knowledge and his dedication to getting the details right. What I question is his obvious need to cram it all into one book. Pages and pages about the socio-economic structure of Lithuania! Who cares? My family's FROM Lithuania, and I don't care! But worst of all is that he sits in judgement of these people. With every line, he suggests that he - and therfore the reader - is better than the people about whom he writes. He needn't sugar coat their lives and their motivations for living such lives, but he could tone down the holier-than-thou quality that makes him just as unlikeable as his characters. Further, lines like, &quot;It made her want to pinch her own nipples&quot; come off as sophomoric, written by a man who believes that girls have pillow fights in their bras at slumber parties.

I am struck by this wonderful and dare I say, important work.  So many themes are delicately covered(cornered) all revolving centrally around family.  The novel is an act of unwinding the tight, prison-like familial constructs of the past(mistakes or not... lovely ambiguity is the key), while each member of the nuclear unit that is the Lamberts embodies their own slew of entanglements, dramas, tragic sparks of disorder and glee.  These swirling themes include contradictions in academia, issues of acceptance, lust v. intellect, rash passion, passionlessness, image, materialism, American ideals v. the reality of their achievement, sexuality, morality, political consciousness v. action, the malleable fluid self, the obstinate and static self, death, the stock market, and (there are more but this is no dissertation), of course, corrections(in the economy, yes, but more specifically, the corrections we make in ourselves and in our lives... our responses and reactions to our upbringings and relationships and hopes and failures).  <br />      Though The Corrections centers around our white, middle class, Midwestern Lamberts, the distilled themes of their story are wholly universal, a sober, inspiring, fully creative work. All the while it's a sincere rendering of a distinct American experience. The meticulous plotting is deceptively fluid(not linear, but ingeniously pieced, like the chronology is fixed to a slightly erratic pendulum), each member of the family appropriately developed, the past emerges like paint from a brush adding color and depth to these characters so fashioned with love, I found it hard not to weep on many occasions.  I wept for their humanity, their confusing life struggles, their collapsing rationales, their attempts towards doing good, living right(whatever right is), and their noble failures and self-deceptions.  Franzen does all this without the slightest hint of condescension, he lays it allout there, with a brave honesty and says many things I'm sure many people don't want to hear about life and dreams in this country, this world.  All this in a prose that is brisk and at times dizzyingly, beautifully, poetic.

He uses time and plot structure in a more conventional manner than Vonnegut.<br />But the book is good, even great.

Sex-obsessed, and self-obsessed, Chip is having a rotten day, as his girlfriend has chosen right now to dump him.  Chip is an amusing character because he's believable yet over-the-top.  Denise takes over the lunch duties when Chip deserts the family to speak with a lady about a movie script.  How he ends up on a plane to Lithuania is really pretty great.  At this point, I wanted to know more and to stay with Chip on his adventures in a former Soviet state.<br /><BR>Unfortunately, Franzen had other ideas.  The book is spent chaotically shifting from one character's life to another.  Just as I would get to a point that I cared about a character and his situation, Franzen yanked him (or, in Enid's case, her) from me.  Okay, I can be a good sport and play along for a while. Halfway through the book, however, Franzen is still yanking me around like a dog on a training leash by introducing yet another new character right after a rather dramatic plot point for Alfred and Enid on the ship.

The further I got into the 342 pages I tolerated of this book, the less convinced I became that there was any hope for redemption for any of these people.  And frankly, I started being really creeped out by the people around me, and feeling like maybe there's no chance of redemption for any of us; like we're all just pathetic, self-absorbed, bitter, angry freaks on the short road to the cemetery, cluttering the lives of people aroundus with our misery.<br />The surprising thing about this book is that the writing is quite good.  But I think this proves that good writing does not make a good book.  Even the stories (and make no mistake, there are definitely multiple stories going on in this book) are interesting.  But the characters and their lack of insight into their own cruelties, the lack of any indication of a shot at redemption for any of them, just destroyed this book for me. <br />If you like dark, can handle a large cast of characters, and can be content to taste bitter through at least the first 450 pages of the book, you may enjoy \\""The Corrections.\\""  More likely, you should just read a Russian novel.",2002-01-22

Scenes are choppy and distorted, either lacking crucial details necessary for a fully developed picture to be achieved or awash in too many details irrelevant to the action. Then there is the question of empathy.<br />To become engrossed in any story, you must either hate or love at least one character. In The Corrections neither is possible.

Each of the members of the family are dysfunctional and tortured in their own ways, but Franzen gives an equally critical and sympathetic attitude toward each. One of the children of the family, Gary, is a determined businessman, bent on a self-help book form of fulfilment. It seems to me ironic that Opera initially wanted this book as part of her club when her show so commonly preaches his kind of internally motivated and overly analytical desire for bettering the self. The novel revolves between the family's perspectives drawing you to understand with the mysteries of their different personalities. They all exemplify classic stereotypes of their generation captured in the transformative nature of chance. Franzen loads us with their sensations mounting to an enormous accumulation of detail and description of life in America. It addresses international relations, drug addiction, homosexuality, capital underhandedness, Alzheimer's disease, environmentalism and many other loaded issues of relevance. Many novels have given us a broad look at a culture such as this, but where this novel truly excels is the way it cuts through the cynicism which so naturally accompanies a survey of this kind, especially one which the author himself comes out of.  This is exemplified in the character of Chip, second son of the family, who is an anxious young man whose authority is undermined in scenes such as a cultural studies class he teaches, by his students' reactions and the cynicism is turned on its head. Chip himself actually becomes a very hopeful character (as do some of the others).

The Corrections is ambitious to say the least - at times brilliant, full of insight into the nature of the dysfunctional family, and keenly aware of the idiosyncrasies of modern-day society.  The Lamberts are in many ways a typical American family, seemingly normal on the outside and lovingly pathological on the inside.  Alfred, rapidly succumbing to Parkinson's disease, stubbornly persists in his daily routines despite an increasingly obvious inability to perform basic tasks and control his bodily functions.  Enid, his wife, lives in a perpetual state of denial, refusing to admit her failings as a mother and a spouse.  And their three children pursue their lives with, at times, reckless abandon and disregard for the pitfalls that lie ahead.  The Corrections, at its heart, is a story of learning from your mistakes and from life's experiences.  It is also a sharp, biting portrayal of early twenty-first century American culture, complete with its miracle drugs, stock market trends, and Eastern-European instability.<br />Franzen develops an elaborate plot that follows each of the five main characters through the ordinary, and at times extraordinary challenges of their everyday lives.  Denise, the youngest child, is perennially involved with married men and a workaholic chef at a trendy Philadelphia restaurant.  Chip, the middle child, has lost his tenure-track teaching position because of an affair with one of his students, and is now pursuing a quasi-legal, highly lucrative venture in Lithuania.  Gary, the oldest, and seemingly most stable of the three children, is gradually sinking into a rut of depression and frustration with his ornery wife.  As they each pursue their individual lives, Enid aggressively pursues her hope of having one last family Christmas in St. Jude, the archetypal Midwest city of old-fashioned values.<br />The Corrections is a portrayal of the sometimes deliberate, sometimes random process of growing as a human being.  Each character in his or her own way is flawed, and yet each is propelled by an inherent yearning to get things right.  Franzen creates intelligent, immensely human characters whose triumphs come more often than not in baby steps.  And while he creates a novel that is, at its core, character-driven, he eloquently juxtaposes traditional Midwestern values of Enid's and Alfred's generation against the rapidly-changing world of their children.  Only time will tell whether The Corrections becomes a classic period piece of the early twenty-first century, but regardless, it is justly praised for its rich characters and big-hearted plot.andom process of growing as a human being.

To package that understanding in a hilarious, humorous, poignant, and touching story is no mean feat. <br />Corrections has been described as a sarcastic look at the American way of life. True, Franzen uses (arguably) typical American mannerisms to paint his story. But that, I daresay, is just the means. Peel off the veneer and you're left with emotions that are truly universal.

It gave me a great point of comparison, and I have to say that JF's writing style was great and certainly did not include gratuitous descriptions as some have claimed -- it all fit.  <br />I will say that its characters could be hard to stomach at times with their faults and dysfunction in dealing with their own lives and one another.  But the description of each and their situation helped me to feel that I really got to know each of them, how they related to one another as a family, and just as I had hoped, it really came together in the end.  <br />This book is long and sometimes hard to read, but often challenging fiction is like that.  I found the ending and the way the family grew and changed made the read more than worth it, and I genuinely enjoyed the book despite coming from a well adjusted family, so not really having a whole lot to compare my experience with the characters.  I think the book does in fact live up to its well deserved hype.  I think the comparisons to DeLillo are valid (I think they are both highly skilled and acclaimed writers), although I found Underworld to be a bit over the top for my taste, so I wouldn't read another book by him.

From Denise and Chip's self-destructive behavior, to Gary's sense of entitlement and self-righteousness (when it was painfully obvious that he had nothing to be self-righteous about), to Enid's sickening keeping-up-with-the-Joneses obsession, and Alfred's stodgy fifties-man persona, I hated each and every one of them.

But the author always regains his footing, and I always knew I'd make it to the end. It's a deceptively ambitious book. Instead of one, the novel has five main characters, each one requiring separate and equal treatment. Many of the book's difficulties stem from this need, and it's imprssive how well the author succeeds in weaving the individual lives into a single story. The novel is essentially the portrait of a family and how it deals with a crises. Much mention has been made of the family's 'dysfuntionl' behavior. While it's true the family members are questionable role models, their relationships to each other are actually not so atypical,driven as they are by rivalry, guilt, and need. The immediate crisis facing the family is the physical and mental decline of the father. Frazen does an excellent job of describing the tension between the desire to maintain independence from each other and the pull of family responcibility. The main subtext of the story seems to be that one's family history is impossible to excape from. In this case, the five family members tumble through their lives making mistakes and without much looking back. The 'corrections' they finally arrive at are slow in coming and hard-earned.

It is hard, but not impossible for one family called the Lamberts.  In the book, The Corrections, author Jonathan Franzen tells the story of  the Lambert family and the events leading up to, during and after their last Christmastime gathering.  Franzen highlights around 40-50 years of Lambert family episodes starting in the 1950s, leading up to the last Christmastime family gathering, and ending with satisfying conclusions for each member of what I consider a dysfunctional family.  Unlike my opinion, the author sees the family as much more of a typical American family where anything could happen.   <BR>Franzen's writing style is crass as he reveals the inward thoughts and secrets of each member of the Lambert family.  The mother Enid is a tired nag who cares too much about what other people think and seems to always be trying to impress others or trying to fit in to the upper-middle or upper class neighbors.  Enid pushes for the last family Christmas in the family's midwestern hometown called St. Jude.  The once manly husband and father, Alfred, has Parkinson's disease, whose health, is fading away fast. Alfred's thoughts are crazy as he fades in and out of reality and has a hard time doing even the simplest of things.  <BR>The three grown Lambert children have issues too.  The oldest son Gary married into money, works at a boring job in some bank and he is accused of being clinically depressed by his manipulative wife. The couple and their three boys live in Philadelphia and Gary's wife does not want her or the children to go to St. Jude for Christmas.  She can't stand Gary's mother mostly, so Gary goes alone to St. Jude.  The middle-child, Chip, is an ex-college professor who was fired because of his involvement with a female student.  He lives in New York City and his writing career and terrible screenplay is going nowhere as he lives off money he borrows from his sister.  Then he lands this nutty but exciting website propaganda job in Lithuania.  Chip makes it to the Christmas family gathering in the nick of time after an exciting adventure escaping out of Lithuania.  The last born of the Lamberts is the youngest child, Denise, a divorced well-known chef.  (...)   <BR>I think the book is called The Corrections because throughout the book, corrections are mentioned and made.  The author mentioned corrections that were made in the stock market.  After Chip had some life experiences, he made corrections to his screenplay and it became a success.  There were many corrections in people's attitudes and personal lives throughout the book (like with Gary's change of attitude at the end).  There are also corrections that may have been forced on the characters because of social standards and rules (Chip and Denise getting fired).  I think what I can get out of this unusual book is that we all make mistakes, but we can correct them to make our lives better.",2002-01-06

After all, if both the snobs and the great unwashed masses could see the merit in this book (highly sarcastic), surely I could too.<br />Well, I can't. David Foster Wallace's fiction is groundbreaking, complex and thoughtful; to draw an analogy between his work and this book is absurd (although both writers seem to share an intense dislike of cruise ships). Franzen has written a book that perhaps hits so close to home for so many people because it is hackneyed and cliched -- therefore, it resonates because we've heard it all before. One brother is a former professor run out of town because he had a sexual affair with a student. The other brother is a Wharton grad dissatisfied with all the trappings of his seemingly perfect life. The sister is a sexy chef who has an affair with her patron and his wife. Come on: this is beach reading here, not serious literature.

One mark of great literature, for example, is that you shouldn't have to repeat a word over and over and over and over again for your reader to understand, &quot;Hey, CORRECTIONS! There are CORRECTIONS everyone is trying to make with their life!&quot; Did Dostoyevsky have to keep repeating, &quot;There are crimes...and there are punishments&quot;? <br />I had a good time reading it, overall, but thought the characters were paper cutouts for whom I developed no feeling. David Foster Wallace and Don DeLillo, for that matter (writers to whom Franzen has been compared) get into the hearts of their characters. _Underworld_ made most of the same points as this book, but was much better written. _Infinite Jest_, in my opinion, trumped _Underworld_ on nearly all fronts.

When a book like The Corrections is saddled with media hype, glowing reviews, and passionate endorsements, it tends to make me more than a mite skeptical. Can any tome be as great as this one is touted to be? Is there a reality to these hyperbolic assessments, or is it all cleverly crafted, artificial propaganda? I am more than happy (and a little bit shell-shocked) to report that YES, almost everything you've heard about this book is accurate. Franzen is a talented, insightful author, and the &quot;truth&quot; is definitely in here.<br />The Lambert family is a motley assortment of lost souls who are tied together by blood and bickering. Knowing one another's weaknesses, frailties, and neuroses, the three siblings and their aging parents are able to cripple and confound with ease. Gathered together for what could be their father's last Christmas, the family congregates to tiptoe around lineage land mines and never-healed long-ago bruises.<br />However, rather than being a maudlin, self-important look at middle-class people and their middling problems, The Corrections is alternately hysterical, satirical, comical, and always logical. No matter how improbable the scenario, it seems real for these people, real for this world. While Franzen does, more often than not, play these characters for laughs, he does have a soft spot for their failings, an empathy for how helpless they are to correct their pasts, their presents, and maybe even their futures. He is bitingly critical, but also refreshingly empathetic. At times these people are monsters, but they're HIS monsters.<br />This is a fabulous book to read when you want to confirm your own vulnerabilities and insecurities. It's an even better book to explore when you want to uncover the flaws and foibles that link all of us together.<br />True, The Corrections is about one family, the Lamberts.

I was interested therefore to see that out of 305 reviews (clearly a pretty broad sampling of Amazon readers), the average review was only 3 stars.  I guess that the pros must have different standards and criteria than us hoi polloi.  I gave it 3 stars as well, but not perhaps for the same reasons that others were critical.<br />I had no problems with the disfunctionality of the family.

The fact is that, notwithstanding all of that, the author has presented us with an absorbing and thought-provoking portrait of a family in chaos and disarray.

The result of this surplusage is that there are numerous portions of the book which are simply boring or added little to the story and which could have been excised altogether.  By way of example, I felt that the &quot;At Sea&quot; portion was way too long and almost all of the material on Chip' adventures in Lithuania was just boring.

His command over language has become more impressive since his last novel, &quot;Strong Motion&quot;, and some sections are brilliantly and achingly told - such as Gary's inebriated struggle against his depression, Denise's adolescent acquiescence to loveless sex.<br />There's no one writing today, in my opinion, that can best Franzen in deploying the omniscient third person narration. He deftly moves in and out of his characters' thoughts, molding them expertly with the social landscape/significance. Every individual thought and action of the character is made to hold a significant social, and even, metaphysical import.<br />At the same time, Franzen's approach to his characters as an unbiased, omni-socially conscious narrator makes certain portrayals of the characters appear stock, and stereotyped to fit a certain mold. Even some of the most acute of observations seem this way at times. Enid and Alfred's failings especially are portrayed in this fashion, and makes Franzen's style seem manipulative.<br />The plot of the book is meticulously thought out and weaved, and I'm blown away by the intricacy with which Franzen has navigated through the lives of the Lamberts. However, mechanisms aside, there really isn't a compelling 'story', and Franzen himself has made it clear that he was interested in the inner lives of these characters over a fictionally contrived story. But as I came away deeply impressed, immersed and moved by the novel, I don't see myself assessing it as a work that will monumentally change the notion of 'literary fiction' as some critics and author himself had mentioned. <br />Certain self-conscious post-modernist touches are distracting as well. The Schopenhauer quotes in the middle of the book are needless and aren't half as pertinent to the character's thoughts as Franzen wishes them to be. Franzen didn't need to highlight the inclusion of these quotes, either. <br />Patches of writing are alarmingly over-written. There are laundry lists of descriptions and ideas that go on and on and on...<br />&quot;The Corrections&quot; is a movingly told downward-spiralling tale of the Lamberts.

Their three boys are spoiled brats. <br />Later in the novel, however, all of the characters (with the possible exception of Gary) change for the better. Franzen puts his characters under a microscope, and as the book went on I also became more aware of the fact that if anyone's life was scrutinized so closely, he or she probably wouldn't look so hot either.

Many have criticized the book for being unoriginal--do we really need ANOTHER novel about a dysfunctional family? they ask--but, as Tolstoy once observed, all unhappy families are unlike, and in this sense, the Lamberts and their myriad dysfunctions ARE unique. Yes, at times the characters in Corrections do behave reprehensibly, but for this reader, this only lends to their veracity, and by the end of the novel, many of these faults are explored and explained enough to provoke, if not sympathy, at very least empathy. Perhaps the &quot;Orprah&quot; crowd, attracted to the book by the celebrity's endorsement, expected something more palatable and less provocative. By pointing this out, I don't intend to sound snobbish, only to observe that this IS at times a demanding book, and probably unlike the usually fare they're accustomed to. While the prose is sometimes turgid and clumsy, more often than not, Franzen is a talented writer able to turn an elegant phrase, reminiscent of Cheever, Updike, Moody and Delillo in its copious cataloguing of domestic detail. Moreover, his dialogue is edgy, spirited and often humorous.

Just what the world needs: another book about a dysfunctional family.&quot; Now having finished it, I'm still not sure the world needs it, there's no new ground broken here, but it is well written and worth the time. None of the Lamberts are sympathetic characters, try as Franzen might at times to make them so. The only difference is the degree to which they are unlikeable, with Gary scoring off the charts and Enid deserving of both pity and censure. One weakness in the book is that, with the exception of daughter Denise, we never really learn specifics of what happened in Gary and Chip's childhoods that made them become the people they are. Where Franzen is right on is in skewering early 21st century America. The conglomeratization of Alfred's railroad, biotech companies and their wonder drugs, the high-flying stock market, the faux attempts at market economies in former communist countries is all wonderful. There are laugh-out-loud observations like the bank that went under because of lack of demand for its Dilbert Mastercard.

As it is a great book, the stigma will pass.  What matters most for Mr. Franzen as a writer (and he is one hell of a writer), is where he goes from here. <br />I know that many people have a problem with the attitude that Franzen seemed to reveal with the Oprah comment. To be honest, I don't really care all that much about it.  Maybe it's just that I agree with what he said, I don't know.  What is troubling to me is that implicit in the Oprah debacle is an ugly contradiction: by accepting the endorsement, Franzen received nearly three million dollars from his publisher. By turning it into a scandal, he probably earned even more money.  All of which, I suppose, is great for him.  I don't really have a problem with Jonathan Franzen getting rich from this book.  I wish more quality writers had the opportunity.  I just don't like how he did it.  If he loathes talk TV, if he is repulsed by everything she and it stand for (whatever that might be...), if he is truly a traditional intellectual who values the distinction between marketing and art, he could have quietly turned down Oprah's endorsement.  He didn't.  Rather, he turned a rather embarrassing public denunciation into marketing itself.  That was sort of vulgar.<br />That said, I think the book is brilliant.  It's true that in the two months since I've read it, I have had some second thoughts about its overall value.  Even after all of my reconsidering, I'd say that it deserves the National Book Award. It probably deserves the Pulitzer Prize and any other applicable distinction you could throw at it.  It is a seriously ambitious book that artfully combines the artistic with the entertaining.  And, AND, on top of all of that, it is a great leap from his previous novels (worth reading, if only for the pleasure of watching a writer develop).<br />As for the hate thing, I suppose Franzen's particular contempt never much bothered me. I mean, depicting aclassically screwed up family as he did doesn't seem especially malicious.  Maybe he hates his family.  Maybe he feels undeserved contempt for everyone.  That might make him an ass, but I don't think it diminishes the value of his book.   <br />I think writers like DeLillo excelled in the post-cold war era because they directly addressed the suburban malaise that was left when the fear of annihilation passed.  DeLillo (and the cadre of like-minded post-modern authors) never offers relief, but if you dismiss the possibility of any capital letter truth, what relief is there?  <br />Fear and anger offer an odd break from it all.  September 11 bloodied our face.  It instantly complicated life, filling what had become mundane with meaning and altering (if only temporarily) the challenge of creatively depicting contemporary society.  In the 1990's, with the simplifying (albeit temporary) illusion of Pax Americana to gird them, people fell easily into the mundane.  But then, if there's nothing over the horizon to terrify you, a dark possibility (or, to be fair, a happy possibility) against which to check your own existence, how do you define your life priorities?  Once again, we are afraid and we are angry.  We have received a wound and it has grounded us.  And yes, it does make it easier to look at Franzen's book with diminished enthusiasm.  I think that would be a mistake.",2001-12-18

Franzen endlessly tosses out ten-cent words like 'paragon.' Readers can easily get lost because there's no clear plot and because Frazen likes to jump from timezone to timezone, person to person. It's very easy not to like any of the characters, particularly because a positive spin never gets put on their actions, and because they engage in bouts of depression, extramarital affairs, and alcohol and sex addictions while never contributing anything positive to the world.<br />And those are all valid reasons to hate the book after trudging through it and cursing at every pageturn.<br />But those are also the exact reasons that can make a reader love the book. To read Franzen describe the inner workings of the individuals that comprise a family in 568 pages is almost magical--you may despise the characters and the way they interact with the world, but at least you'll know who they are, and you can then easily identify yourself or someone you know with them. They're enjoyable to follow, if for no other reason to see what mess they'll get into next and whether they'll correct their messes in the end by means of family. Franzen laments the characters' problems but also allows you to laugh at them. <br />Franzen's attention to detail and his explicit descriptions of hedges and the sky and the colors of chairs, make the book a joy to get through, if for no other reason than to see what ordinary situation Franzen can make interesting without attempting to bore the reader by saying something tired like, &quot;the room was pulsating with energy, almost like spirits of forlorn pasts were circling overhead.&quot;<br />Thumbs up from here.

Maybe some illustrations were warranted, or maybe some readers should just stick with the abused-child-overcomes-obstacles-and-becomes-whole-and-healed (junk) that passes for the Oprah-ization of fiction.<br />The Corrections is a difficult book, but then so is An Instance of the Fingerpost, This Side of Brightness, The Human Stain, and Underworld. But being difficult is not a sign of a bad book; it's the sign of a mature work of fiction that challenges the reader to see the world in a completely different way, to approach 'experience' from a different perspective. Are the characters unlikable? Sure. Do they seem real. Yes, they do, warts and all. Does it have a happy ending? Depends on how you see it. Should it have a happy ending? I don't know, ask Madame Bovary.<br />The backlash against The Corrections is not against what lies between the covers, but the expectation that the readers bring to it. If you bought it because of Oprah, you'll probably be disappointed. I don't know if she should be commended for challenging her followers or condemned for trying to cash in on what is obviously one of the best pieces of fiction to come about in the last few years.

In the midst of all that, it's funny as hell, and I am glad that I read it and plan on reading it again at a later date to savor the pungent writing a bit more.<br />A few years ago I had the opportunity to interview a \\""cult\\"" author about his work and I asked him why his writing wasn't universally admired. I asked him if there was anything he should do differently. He replied that, in fiction, an author 'shouldn't' doanything that they didn't want to do. That art shouldn't have to be something specific to the viewer, or be anything it didn't set out to be. That the author presents, and the reader interprets. Each has their own duty, and if anything 'should' happen, it should be that each 'should' fulfill their part of the bargain.<br />Buy the book if you think you can appreciate it.

It rests on a solid core of fully realized characters; effective suspense and drama; and great storytelling.<br />Recall Curt Cobain's music: The surface is post-modern, a bit dissonant, somewhat jumpy (but underneath is a very effective traditional pop melody that ties everything together and relentlessly propels it forward).",2001-11-15

Unfortunately, it's not that easy.  The book, standing on its own merit, didn't justify the pre-Oprah hype, and it probably doesn't deserve to be completely lost in the post-Oprah backlash.  (For those who don' t know:  The book was selected for the Oprah book club; hundreds of thousands of extra copies were printed; in interviews the author said he wasn't happy about the Oprah selection and that his book really wasn't  appropriate for Oprah readers; perhaps figuring that anyone so stupid as to look this gift horse in the mouth wouldn't be smart enough to fill an hour-long show, Oprah cancelled his appearance). <br />Let's start with the cons.  First, Franzen's prose is frequently overblown and too self-conscious.  A sample description of a windy day:  &quot;A sheet of newsprint wrapped itself around a parking meter with erotic-looking desperation.&quot;  Please.   Let's just say he's light years behind Toni Morrison. Second, the book starts very slowly.  I'm an easy sell, and it took me over 200 pages to get truly interested.  A minor plot point in the book is that one of the characters has written a screenplay.  The big tip off that the screenplay is garbage and that the character has no idea what he's doing is that the screenplay begins with a six page monologue.  Hello!   Third, given that this novel is character-driven, it's unfortunate that a few of the leads are so poorly drawn.  The women in particular are ill-defined.  Which leads to point number four:  no question about it - there's a huge streak of misogyny throughout the book.  Rather consistent with the author's bashing of Oprah book club readers.    <br />Now for the reason we shouldn't all blithely ignore &quot;The Corrections.&quot;  This is basically the story of a family struggling to come to grips with the slow and painful deterioration of its patriarch from Parkinson's disease.  Here Franzen hits all the right notes.   The children have always known their father as a formal but unapproachable man.  Only as his dignity is being slowly and painfully stripped away do they begin to know him.   If Franzen hadn't cluttered the book with so many extraneous sub-plots and self-indulgent development of secondary  characters, this could have been a truly great book.",2001-11-12

In particular, I found the parenthetical italicized Schopenhauer quotations didactic and demeaning.The way these quotes break into the text is like a flashing weather report moving across the bottom of a TV screen,leaving no mystery as to the meaning of a character's actions.  One quote shows up on p. 280 to tell the reader what Al thinks as he overpowers Enid with his male member.(Schopenhauer: The people who make money are men,not women; and from this it follows that women are neither justified in having unconditional possession of it,nor fit persons to be entrusted with its administration.)(p 280)   <BR>In addition to didactic drop ins, Franzen overdoes the theme of corrections, guilt, and retribution. An example of this is the painful liver dinner scene. Al's son Gary has made a jail with an electric chair in it out of popsicle sticks. If the reader hasn't gotten this theme yet, she will after reading another Schopenhauer news release: &quot;(If you want a safe compass to guide you through life...you cannot do better than accustom yourself to regard this world as a penitentiary, a sort of penal colony.)&quot; Franzen continues with further direct references to imprisonment and corrections throughout the novel. <BR>Recently  author Michael Chabon, winner of the Pulitzer prize for literature, stated that the secret of good prose is that it appears effortless.

There is a great deal of somewhat simple-minded game-playing.  There is an overweening self consciousness that occassionally intrudes into what is quite an excellent depcition of &quot;the sins of the fathers.&quot;  The dysfunctionality of the family has been called contrived and unbelievable; however, as Tolstoy points out, every unhappy family is unhappy in its own unique way.<br />While I could have done with less of the pretention and game playing fewer sentences trying to suggest what parkinsonianism is about, less about the political climate of Lithuania, and less of the occasional overwritten verbal bombast (Particulary off-putting in the first couple of pages)--I still think the author has constructed a wonderful story and created characters that  seemed very realistic to me.  In fact, I was occassionally depressed to recognize some of these people among my own family and acquaintances.  <br />What Franzen's book ultimately did for me is make me ask the question, &quot;How does my life look from the outside?&quot;  In that it provides a marvelous impetus for reflection and change.  While Franzen seems dubious about that possibility, the novel has too short a duration in actual time to suggest whether or not the corrections will actually have a substantive effect on the characters.<br />As I generally hate anything postmodern, I do give this two thumbs up--because if it was &quot;post-modern&quot; it was so in a way that was at least palatable and not inchoate.",2001-11-07

I believe that Franzen has used all of his gifts of articulation in rendering Alfred's angry, silent life.<br />Not far behind (if at all) is Enid, Alfred's wife, who brings an all-too-real frantic calm to the unsuccessful management of her family and her own hopes for life.  <br />While there's no question that the reader may want to smack some of the grown Lambert children for their capricious, self-destructive and outright bad behavior, there's no missing the tremendous writing and invention behind their characters and actions.<br />I particularly enjoyed the book's coda, as Franzen lets all the air and tension out of the story, returning the Lambert family and us, the readers, to normalcy: that is, the normalcy in relationships, that stands in for a truce.",2001-11-07

But you really should get ahold of this excellent novel.  I devoured it in one night's frenzied reading.  Yes indeed, Franzen has taken the somewhat inaccessible avant-garde concerns of writers like Don DeLillo or the David Foster Wallace of &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; and placed them in the context of a mainstream novel about *family* and how it prepares you to function (or not) in the larger world.  Franzen manages to create a little universe that mirrors our own crazy world, yet makes the madness more comprehensible.  He is devilishly funny, in a laugh-out-loud sort of way, yet his message is ultimately one of forgiveness and reconciliation.  The Lamberts, the screwed-up family at the heart of the story, have the feeling of real people you know.  That are unique, unforgettable  individuals, but you may squirm when the self-destructive ways of Gary, Chip or Denise remind you of the stupid mistakes you have made in your own life.  Alfred and Enid, the mom and dad, will make you shake your head; when did Franzen meet *my* parents?

For a young woman who was Daddy's Girl, the future holds a string of failed relationships and the am-I-straight? routine.  Enid and Alfred Lambert, the parents, must be unorthodox in a very prescribed fashion.<br />Franzen does not disappoint here, establishing five individual paths so relentlessly that the stereotyped Lamberts emerge on the other side as complete cartoon figures, perfectly matching the unrealistic plot.  (Enough reviewers divulge plots, as if that was the only element in a book, so it won't be addressed here.)  As in a sitcom, where spit-takes and mistaken identities occur all too often, in this book sexual mistakes, marital discord and illnesses come across as tired devices.  So what is Franzen up to in utilizing them with such vigour?  Before one can answer that, another element must be talked about, something that strikes one from the first word.<br />The narrative voice is rarely differentiated from the internal voice of the main figures.  To the unnamed narrator the world is completely poisonous.  If he was commenting on you and I having tea and coffee in a café, then the discarded brown sugar packet lying on the table would be a turd, and the packet would have been vanquished, breathing distress from its crushed brown lungs as it expired in the too chilly air-conditioning.  This would chime in with what you and I would have said to ourselves, that in the sordid light from the fluorescent lights, or the waning daylight from a livid, smog-tainted sunset, the clientele look sullen and sallow.  Nothing is good or restful for either the narrator or the main figures - which might come off as unfair, since the narrator just has to do the telling, not the living - resulting in an even tone that makes the work a tightly-knit piece.<br />_The Corrections_ is so densely woven that none of the figures has space to move.  Generally, tailors leave a little room for the body to expand, say after a dinner, yet Franzen, perhaps out of a dislike of ambiguities, doesn't want readers to carry away any message other than what he has said.  This is revealed tellingly in the one or two moments of freedom a figure experiences.  Alfred enjoys - probably not the right word, considering his circumstances - a few moments to himself, away from the defining confines of his tics, when he can recall the quiet pleasure he took with his children in, as Franzen's narrator, or Alfred, puts it, &quot;plain vanilla closeness.&quot;  It could be either speaking because the figures and the narrator have been so welded together that for there to be a separation would be to say there was a loss of vision and crack of tone, which likely would go against Franzen's desires.<br />In one respect _The Corrections_ is very realistic.  When the major figures are bothered it sounds close to how people think, which is no small achievement.  However, this isn't enough to prevail against the uniform mind that utters every line.  There is a comic's stance in the narrator's presentation, or else in Franzen's, with the narrator performing to an audience and having complete control.  One minor figure, late in the book, repeats the familiar-sounding line &quot;A tragedy rewritten as a farce,&quot; and that points to two things the book is not.  There can be no tragedy when the anvil drops on the coyote, and without characters there isn't much that can be farcical in a serious way, if that doesn't come out like a contradiction.  There is nothing larger than fictive lives at stake; there's no connection to humanity.<br />In exercising dominance Franzen must be aiming at a very specific target.  It is the rare novelist who doesn't sound flat now and then over the course of a few or several hundred pages.  William Gaddis' _JR_ is a magnificent whole from first line to last, as is Henry Miller's _Tropic of Cancer_.  Whether or not one likes them, they are delivered in one breath, as if instead of being novels they were one line of pure poetry.  _The Corrections_ exhibits the will to succeed along those lines, but instead of being a series of notes, as in Gaddis and Miller, the material is delivered in a monotone.  The narrative voice is, essentially, totalitarian, coming through a megaphone and not a human throat.<br />Unknowingly, the narrative voice addresses its nature in a passage where Gary is thinking to himself: &quot;But _enough_, he told himself.  A too-annihilating will to specialness, a wish to reign supreme in his superiority, was yet another Warning Sign of clinical D.&quot;  In _The Corrections_ the narrator's supremacy is based on Irony.  Not the technical device, but the attitude, which in its ripest manifestation regards all actions, plans, scenery, devices and sentiments as ludicrous.  The narrator is so much smarter and above-it-all than anyone, and this attitude is shared among the Lamberts, except when they've been outmanoeuvred.<br />There are risks to writing satires that mock everything without provoking considered thought on the problems or situations the author has raised, particularly when the fun is at the expense of cartoon figures who repel a reader's emotional investment.  One has to think that Franzen knew those risks and was willing to be judged on his successful schematization.",2001-10-30

Through 568 pages, Franzen chronicles a lifeless, ordinary family called the Lamberts.  The book is equal parts domestic drama and social commentary targeting everything from consumerism, the penal system, HMOs, luxury cruises, the pharmaceutical industry, celebrity culture, and even Oprah Winfrey.  <br />The big criticism Franzen draws is about his characters.  They are shrill, depressed, and immensely dysfunctional, but they are, nonetheless, empathetic.  Franzen does not want us to like these characters, nor does he want us to condemn them.  He merely wants us to observe them, and from their miserable lives perhaps the reader may be able to glean some sort of understanding and connection. Franzen trusts his characters enough to make them almost unlikable, but he also trusts the reader enough to be patient and understanding. The last 200 pages are a marvel of restrained emotion.  The book's finale is Franzen's reward to the reader for our patience and attention.  <br />In a way, &quot;The Corrections&quot; is a cautionary tale, but to see it merely as that would be to minimize its force.  &quot;The Corrections&quot; is an unflinching, wildly entertaining, and surprisingly tender-hearted novel about family and America.

So, playing &quot;Monday morning editor&quot; here is what I would have changed to make this epic into a more polished work: First, Franzien needs to get rid of all the dry cooperate nonsense. Let's face it: that is just plain boring, and even the pep rally of the Axom Corporation's fireworks are dim. I don't care about the politics of a rail road that runs through the Midwest. While I did feel that the central characters in the novel were particularly well fleshed out, some of the sub characters did nothing to add to this sometimes plodding book.<br />There are funny parts, I'll admit that. An especially witty scene is when Enid goes to complain to the ship's doctor about her husband. That scene must have been inspired by Kurt Vonnegut, as it reminded me of some of his works. And there is some excellent writing here. But why oh why does the reader have to suffer through the details of a heinous murder scene that is the daughter of a passenger on a cruise ship who Enid just happens to meet. Why do we have to suffer through 3 pages of gore that do nothing to further along the story? I felt offended by that.<br />I wonder if authors today put in a gruesome murder/rape/torture just to get it read and recommended by Oprah? Has she EVER picked a book that doesn't have some form of violence against women?<br />I was relieved when the book was over, which is probably not exactly the emotion that Franzien was going for.

This to me is a great testament to the power of &quot;The Corrections.&quot;  Franzen deals with educated, amusing, often unhappy people who are fascinated equally by ideas and the promises of materialistic pleasures.  In this respect the book reminded somewhat of Tom Wolfe's &quot;Man in Full&quot; and &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; and especially of Kurt Andersen's &quot;Turn of the Century.&quot;  But Franzen succeeds where Wolfe and Andersen fail because the humor that laces his pages and his references to pop culture are not there simply for Franzen to show off and get down with contemporary yuppie homies.  Instead, he uses these devices to create an almost impressionistic version of life as we know it that is all the more real for being slightly loopy.  Franzen's use of language is so vivid and interesting (and sometimes challenging, judging from some of the other reviews), and his wit is so keen, that one sometimes forgets the darkness of some of his themes, and the pain that all of his characters suffer.  This gives the reader the experience of racing through the book for several hours with great enthusiasm, and then being himself suddenly feeling depressed -- and needing to take the night off.

Each member of The Lambert family has their own faults.  The patriarch of the family is Alfred Lambert.  He is a retired railroad engineer who works hard to support his family.  However, Alfred  doesn't show any affection toward any member of his family.  Alfred emotionally distances himself from his family.  This has an effect on everyone.  Enid Lambert is his long suffering wife who is taken for granted in this book by her husband.  Enid sacrifices his career as a book keeper to raise a family of 3 children Gary, Chip and Denise.<br />  Alfred never praises his wife for a job well done.  Enid practically raises their 3 children all by herself, because Alfred does not provide any emotional support for his children.<br />Enid becomes Al's  care taker when his health declines.  This becomes a burden for her which doesn't sit well with her children especially Gary.<br />At the beginning of his father's illness, Gary urges that Al should be placed in a care home.  This would relieve  Enid of her obligation to care for him.  This is a major issue in this book and  society today about who should take of the elderly when they get sick.<br /><br />Gary is a depressed family man who is unable to express his feelings.  Gary is incapable of showing warmth and detaches himself from everybody.  This is a trait that he obviously inherited from his father He fights with his wife over meaningless things not telling the truth about how she hurt herself. He is bitter towards his parents especially his mother for telling him how to run his life particularly how to raise his kids.<br /><br />Chip is a former college professor who loses his job after an<br />affair with a student.  Chip feels his parents don't approve of his life or his job.  To Chip, Alfred's lack of affection toward him as a child solidifies Chip's belief that Al never loved or understood him.<br />  Denise is a successful cook who happens to be a lesbian.  Denise's shortcoming is her failure to be honest with herself about her sexual orientation.  This leads to the breakdown of her relationship with her boss and her bosses wife.  She has an intimate relationship with both of them.  Denise is almost the mirror image of her mother in the sense that she feels obligated to take on a lot of a responsibility and is put upon by other people.<br />This book is a good escape for people who perceive their problems and relationships to be too great or stressful.

Franzen has no interest in the heartwarming or the poignant.  He is talking about what we as a nation have become.  I realize that our country is currently suffering a mild case of the blues.

We are disengaged from the people who gave birth to us and the people to whom we give birth.  We relate in only the most oblique ways to one another.  Yet we do try to connect and repeatedly fail because we have forgotten how those connections once fed us.<br />The Lamberts are coming apart at the seams.

I would happily call it a great American novel if not for some serious problems, which in my mind, keep it from achieving that higher level. I found the constant level of anxiety and the degree of self-centeredness of most of his characters to grow wearisome and indicative of a too pessimistic outlook. The plot also falters at several points where he allows his characterization to grow thin just when it would have benefited from some additional dimensionality.  Aside from these drawbacks, it is impossible not to be impressed by Franzen's talent as he describes a Midwestern nuclear family lurching along like a mini-juggernaut through adulthood and old age, making corrections at every step. One question of this book is whether or not the three adult offspring can rally to their parents' aid even though they resent much of what their parents stand for and their own lives are running dangerously off course. Each life is put up for examination, but most poignant is the fate of the father who is developing Parkinson's disease, still entrenched in rigid values while making end-of-life decisions. Franzen has a lot to say about each of these issues in a story that has never before been told quite like this.

On the one hand, the author's style is amazingly litterate and thoughtful; every word in the book feels carefully chosen in order to liberate the desired emotions/feelings upon the reader. On the other hand, this also creates a problem since Franzen seems to place more importance on the stylistics than on the plot and narrative.<br />What you end up with is a book with greatly defined characters but with very little substance. Here, the reader enouncters a family that is more disfunction than anything else. The parents are suffering; the mother is trapped between trying to keep her life the way it is why living with her Parkinson-and-dementia-afflicted husband. The children have all moved to different cities where they live empty, unhappy lives. As a matter of fact, no one seems to be happy in this book. Every time an event comes along which should make a character happy, this very character finds a way to complain his or her way through it. You never really identify with any of these characters because they seem to complain all the time. A little bit of happiness in their lives would not have killed them. But they all seem so closed up and distant that they refuse to let anything remotely happy enter their lives.<br />And yet, one has to admire the books for its style. Franzen's writing is beautiful and fulfilling. It's just too bad that this style isn't part of a more complete book, a book where plot and style do mesh together in complete harmony.

The story was most successful when it concentrated on presenting the lives of the main characters in the homes and towns where they live, which constituted about half of the book. The less successful parts, I felt, were the overly clever subplots about the evils of corporations and the politics of developing nations. Even the theme of medication, which was much more central to the Lambert family's situation, was too heavy-handed at times.<br />The book tried to fuse the postmodern style of Pynchon, et al. with a more traditional character-driven story, but overall I didn't feel that it was successful. Each section was heavily weighted in one direction or the other, so the tone of the novel flipped back and forth, instead of the styles working together.<br />With that said, the final section of the book, where the Lamberts finally got together for one last Christmas, was beautifully written and very moving. The author made me feel that the characters were really living through the pain they were feeling and finding their own ways to deal with it as the threads unraveled and snapped. <br />So, was the finale worth the time spent getting through the uneven ~450 pages that preceded it?

One cannot tell, given particularly that in this time of flag-waving patriotism there could not possibly be any agreement regarding what the themes or content of the GAN might be.  What Jonathan Franzen has created , however, is an engrossing, insightful, sardonically humorous journey into the heart of darkness that is the American nuclear family.  It's not perfect, but it sure is a satisfying read and definitely one of the better novels to emerge in this country in recent years.<br />Before I read the book, someone told me to expect a combination of the best of the writing styles of John Irving and Tom Wolfe.  That, in fact, turned out to be an apt description, so I will pass it along.  The tone is unabashedly derisory as he skewers the contemporary institutions of marriage and family with devastating skill.  Along the way, Franzen offers apt satire regarding other topics, institutions, and trends, including the arrogance and cruelty that underlie American economic &quot;globalization\\"" and the jargon-riddled snake pit that is contemporary academia.<br />Franzen's deconstruction of the complex and often contradictory ways that family members perceive and manipulate one another is superb. He shows how beneath our veneer of alleged \\""maturity\\"" we are overgrown children acting out emotional impulses borne of deeply buried wounds that are almost always opaque to ourselves.  Although much of what is presented in the novel demonstrates the pettiness and weakness that is apparently our lot as human beings, his message is not monolithically negative.  He shows that even the most bitter familial bickering can be punctuated by acts of devotion and loyalty, and reveals how even the most superficially insensitive characters (in this case, the father figure, Alfred) can surprise us through hidden acts of nobility.<br />Throughout, the writing is vivid and dazzlingly creative without ever becoming pretentious or impenetrable.  <br />This is a fine novel, but it is not without flaws.  Whereas Franzen demonstrates an uncanny ability to \\""get inside the heads\\"" of various contemporary male types, I found his attempts to capture the inner lives of female characters to be less convincing.  In particular, the thoughts, emotions, and motivations of the Lamberts' daughter Denise did not seem authentic to me.  For the most part, Denise's often inexplicable decisions seemed calculated to advance the overall story line rather than to demonstrate any real insight into how a \\""contemporary American young woman\\"" perceives herself, her family, or the world around her.  <br />Overall, however, this is one heckuva good read that once started, is hard to put down.",2001-10-10

She is trying desperately to have &quot;one last Christmas&quot; at the family home in the midwest, trying to convince her three grown children to leave the East coast where they now live to let her have this one dream.  Good luck Enid getting them all together.  Her youngest, Denise is the only one who agrees to come.  Denise perhaps has to escape the mess she has made of her life in Philadelphia.  Chip, the middle child, has left New York, after being fired from his cushy academic position for sexual harassment, and is somewhere in Eastern Europe perpetrating securities fraud on an unsuspecting American public.  And Gary, well Gary's wife doesn't see the point of dragging their three boys out there because she cannot get along with her mother-in-law.  Franzen explores this family through their various viewpoints.  We see their struggles, their despair, their happiness, narrated with an ironic wit that makes The Corrections a terrific read.  The Corrections is a big, long, enjoyable novel (that maybe could have used some editing, but there are only a couple passages I could see taking out).  It's funny, it's sarcastic, it's amusing.  (and, it's not your typical Oprah selection, if that's scaring you away; it's got much more edge).  Have fun with this one.",2001-09-28

Franzen is a really smart, maybe even brilliant, definitely talented guy.  When I read an excerpt from this novel which appeared last spring in The New Yorker as a short story, I thought it was one of the most profound and beautiful things I'd ever read.  I expected the novel to be a contemporary Anna Karenina.  Instead I got characters so flat, they seemed headed for a vacation on Gilligan's Island:  the harping, mindless, chirpy mother; the hot blond chick wearing tight blue jeans who doesn't enjoy sex with her husband -- how could that be? -- because, as it turns out, she's a lesbian; the henpecked husband and his pathologically manipulative wife, blah blah blah.  (Yeah, this novel is not &quot;epic&quot; enough to include even one mature female character.)  <br />Each of the main characters have their own subplots and I felt as if Franzen used the plots to flee exploration of character, and romp, instead, in irrelevance.  One of the characters is this hip, professor-guy who's disaffected (or something)and doesn't know what to do with his life.  He gets fired for having an affair with a student.  (By the way -- such a shocking surprise -- the student is a sex/drug crazed maniac who preys on her teacher.  Not the other way around.  How original.  Franzen's gone and reversed the stereotype.  How did he ever think up that strategy?)  So Franzen sends this down and out ex-professor character off on a wacky-hijinx-never-stop tour of Lithuania that seems to have nothing to do with who the character is or what he's facing.  For me, the most boring section of the novel.<br />When I finally got to the section I had loved as a story in the New Yorker, it flew right by and I had to recall its shape from memory.  I think that's because Franzen smushed it into the midst of so much shlock involving a highly dramatic bisexual love triangle.  Again, I didn't think the lesbian route (at least his totally un-profound rendition of it) goes toward the heart of who the Denise character is.  My sense is that Franzen used the story line to flee Denise.  Another thing -- The pacing and the shape of the novel as a whole are totally flat.  Every single moment in the novel is weighted equally.  It's just a string of episodes, with no breathers, no peaks, no valleys.  Practically every sentence is an episode.<br />The good stuff:  The Alfred character is real, absorbing, interesting, poignant.  Likewise the details about the railroad line where Alfred works.  Also, if you like Jackie Collins (as I do when I'm in the mood), this book provides exactly that kind of entertainment.  And if you're a prep school guy, you can pretend that your brain is being enriched as you read this 700-something page tome.  And how do I describe the profound &quot;subtext&quot; of this book?  Franzen bashes you over the head with it in the first chapter of the book, then periodically bashes you over the head again every time the word &quot;correction&quot; comes up (every 75 pages or so.)  If it's that frigging easy to bash readers over the head with your &quot;subtext&quot; maybe you should  just write it up as a five paragraph essay, and then if you want to write a novel, you can devote yourself honestly to character development and a thing called &quot;story&quot;, which is what a novel is supposed to be.",2001-09-28

The truth, of course, was that it was a little of both. After coming to know so many divergent characters so well, and after reading so many incisive and engaging portrayals of contemporary culture, it was unfortunate to have to leave them behind. But at the same time those last pages, in which Franzen tries admirably to bring some kind of closure to a wide-ranging novelistic world, only emphasize that what precedes them has the feel more of overlapping novellas, one per character (give or take), than components of a unified whole.<br />Still, I'm not complaining.

I found it to be a story of parenthood, childhood, adulthood and the search for individual recognition within the context and confines of family expectations and disappointments, the near-desperate reaching out from the limitations of being someone else's father/mother/son/daughter/sister/brother/husband/wife to find one's self and how long and hard that journey can be, how family is initially what defines us in all our relationships, and how we have to go through a series of &quot;corrections&quot; to discover what and who we really are.  Jonathan Franzen is adept at handling the emotions of each of the characters in the book.  While not offering detailed visual images of them in the form of physical description, the reader nonetheless is readily able to identify with each of them and &quot;see&quot; them, connect with them on an emotional level.  The lack of overt physical description, I feel, tends to make the reader intially somewhat stereotype the characters in their appearances and it is only until after I finished the book that I realized this was perhaps what Franzen had in mind...that we tend to disregard the typical until we discover what lies beneath, even more so with family members and the &quot;roles&quot; in which we cast them.  The author perhaps recognizes this tendency in each of us, to label, to see only the successful investment banker son, only the independent restaraunteur sister, only the loser brother with no direction.  With Franzen's facile use of simile, layer by layer, he bares the underlying soul and vulnerability of the apparently &quot;typical&quot; members of the Lambert family.

If he were telling it verbally to a group of campers around a fire, they'd all be snoring before he had completed three chapters. While extremely talented and skilled in phraseology, the excessive use of vocabulary for it's own sake soon became tiresome and often redundant. This book suffered from a lack of editing it down to a more essential, basic form.

There is dialogue that is familiar, tiresome, sometimes funny, hip or dated; and interior monologue that is occasionally moving and important. Franzen can write lucidly about anything and everything, and does so in this very long story. Unfortunately, nothing has been left out.<br />By now the plot is familiar to readers. There's not a lot to it. The pre-publication hype has been intense. A family (two parents, three adult children and several in-laws) is to gather from around the United States for one last Christmas together. This plot requires of the reader an agreement to assign &quot;Christmas&quot; a considerable emotional weight. (Some people really do watch &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; every year.) This will succeed with some, but not all, readers.<br />Parts of the text are nearly soporific. Here's an excerpt, about the matriarch, Enid: &quot;She told not only her friends but everybody else she knew in St. Jude, including her butcher, her broker, and her mailman, that her grandson Jonah was coming for the holidays. Naturally she was disappointed that Gary and Jonah were staying for just three days and were leaving at noon on Christmas, but plenty of fun could be packed into three days.&quot;<br />Is it an important book, and  will it change your way of seeing the world? Probably not. It's 570 pages long. It weighs two pounds. Some of the descriptions of the most commonplace things and inner states seem to stretch on for pages. Parkinson's disease afflicts the family's patriarch, and getting old is no fun, either. Franzen describes how the disease looks to others  but not, really, the experience of the disease. In more than a few places Franzen squanders the chance to go deep, in favor of yet more description of how things looked or sounded. For a novel that uses this much paper and ink to tell its story, the emotional lives of his characters are often frustratingly slight.<br />The visual-details-laden, dialogue-heavy tale of a complicated and somewhat interesting (but also quite average) American middle-class family is a sure draw, but readers old enough to recall the best-selling page-turners of the 1950's and '60's of Leon Uris, James Michener, Jeffrey Archer and even Harold Robbins might not be wowed by this novel.

From the dippy parents, to the food obsessed daughter, to a depressed son, to a mirrored version of that depressed son, another brother who seems to be completley lost in the mid thirties turmoil of deciding what to do. History's are shown from one to the other, train schedules are met, meals are cooked, cruises taken, science and the stock market even get their share of typed space.  If you want to read the most original novel of the last twenty years, and the freshest voice of the next twenty, then click on over to your shopping cart, fill it with this book.  If I could have amnesia and read it again, I would. It's really that fantastic.",2001-09-19

There is dialogue that is familiar, tiresome, sometimes funny, hip or dated; and interior monologue that is occasionally moving and important.  Franzen can write lucidly about anything and everything, and does so in this very long story. Unfortunately, nothing has been left out.<br />By now the plot is familiar to readers. There's not a lot to it. The pre-publication hype has been intense. A family (two parents, three adult children and several in-laws)  is to gather from around the United States for one last Christmas together. This plot requires of the reader an agreement to assign &quot;Christmas&quot; a considerable emotional weight. (Some people really do watch &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; every year.)  This will succeed with some, but not all, readers.<br />Parts of the text are nearly soporific.  Here's an excerpt, about the matriarch, Enid:  &quot;She told not only her friends but everybody else she knew in St. Jude, including her butcher, her broker, and her mailman, that her grandson Jonah was coming for the holidays. Naturally she was disappointed that Gary and Jonah were staying for just three days and were leaving at noon on Christmas, but plenty of fun could be packed into three days.&quot;<br />Is it an important book? Will it change your way of seeing the world?  Probably not. It's 570 pages long. It weighs two pounds. Some of the descriptions of the mostcommonplace things and inner states seem to stretch on for pages. Parkinson's disease afflicts the family's patriarch, and getting old is no fun, either. Franzen describes how the disease looks to others - but not, really, the experience of the disease. In more than a few places Franzen squanders the chance to go deep, in favor of yet more description of how things looked or sounded. For a novel that uses this much paper and ink to tell its story, the emotional lives of his characters are often frustratingly slight.<br />The visual-details-laden, dialogue-heavy tale of a complicated and somewhat interesting (but also quite average) American middle-class family is a sure draw, but readers old enough to recall the best-selling page-turners of the 1950's and '60's  of Leon Uris, James Michener, Jeffrey Archer and even Harold Robbins might not be wowed by this novel.

Their interaction with each other and the world unfolds in a fascinating tale.  Parts of this book are so overwhelmingly sad that it is difficult to go on, but it is worth the effort. (Parts of it -- especially the minor episodes of overheard conversations in a deli and an elevator are screamingly funny).  Franzen has a great way with dialogue and description, to the extent that you forget you are reading a book for minutes on end and are just caught up in it.

I suppose we could all gather round and pronounce this a &quot;social novel&quot; in the guise of W.D. Howells or those other pranksters under his bony wing. Meaning I suppose there is something to be said about the world, steering characters into social/political/medical formations and traps that seem to be obvious to anyone watching the Oxygen Network or reading the cliff notes to some of Updike's mistakes. Meaning these are things that motivate us to change.<br />I tend to look at this as a new kind of propaganda, since propaganda has moved from convincing us to supporting institutional wars and flashy products, to today where it has finally reached into the marrow of American fiction, from &quot;Underworld&quot;'s sunny trip in the Lexus, to the boredom of Moody's quiet sentimentality, to DFW's strain to keep the blood from his brain mechanically dripping onto the page. Franzen's attempts to resurrect the glamour of classified traumas of some personal instinct for politics.<br />And what is the message behind all of this, what is the strain, why are we so eager to swallow this whole? Supposedly because it &quot;says&quot; something. If this is the revelation, if this it was &quot;epic&quot; might mean in any NYTBR footnote, then we as readers will have to pass on this. It is a shame, because his style is appealing, more than the other jim jim boys that turn up on the shelf. But here, he is straining to depict both characters who live in the mind, to his ideas of what the world could be like, or what it is, or what it was. Suffocating the potential of the voices of the former, to the ego satisfaction of the latter.<br />Another New York novel sadly, even if not completely set there. What if all the writers decided one day to leave? Is there another America that isn't completely imagined from this island?

This is a well-written--at times quite stunningly so--novel that could have used the iron hand of an editor not quite so in love with his author. For anyone accustomed to reading Don DeLillo and William Gaddis and even retro old John Updike, the opening pages seem derivative. Then the reader begins to enjoy the characters, and Franzen's style, still faintly redolent, especially of DeLillo, catches its own kind of fire. In the end, though, The Corrections comes off more as five dense character studies in search of a more well-defined story. This would have made a wonderful novella, especially with its muted and rather reticent ending. It's been compared to Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks, but that was a a study not just of a family but of a whole social order in a time of serious change. But Franzen likes the sound of his voice, and there's no doubt many will like it too.

In this case, every member of the Lambert family is going through some sort of correction, from dad to mom and all three of the kids.

But now it seems that Franzen's fallen into the same slag pit of postmodern irony that has claimed so many other talented writers of our generation.  Franzen's writing style is unsurpassed in style -- witty, poetic, by turns tender and savage, reminiscent of Martin Amis and Dave Eggers.  But the artistry of  Franzen's writing only underscores the hollowness of the characters, the absurdity of the plot, and the utter lack of theme.  Maybe this is all &quot;intentional&quot; (artist-speak for &quot;I couldn't come up with anything else&quot;), but the book is less a novel of scope and ambition than a bulky compendium of bitter wit unredeemed by insight or wisdom.  It seems to me a failure of courage to take refuge in satire when Franzen clearly has the talent to write seriously about life. But this could have exposed him to charges of sentimentalism, that foulest of literary weaknesses, and he obviously is wise to that, as everyone seems to be praising this book for the very qualities it lacks.<br />We already have enough absurdist literature and rancid black comedy  whose main function is to showcase the wit of the the author at the expense of his characters (not to mention the reader still foolish enough to be seeking transcendence in American literature.) I finished the book in a mood of grim fascination, but overall I was disappointed and depressed. Like many other &quot;literary&quot; novels -- the very ones Franzen claims to despise --  the characters are glib riffs on contemporary stock characters (lesbian, yuppie, suburban psycho-matriarch) rather than characters that you believe in and might even sympathize with. The one character who comes to life is Chip, Franzen's surrogate, whose embarassing obsessions  and pathetic stabs of ambition made me laugh out loud (the salmon-in-pants scene was a brilliant, A+ combo of physical comedy and literary flash -- if only the whole book had kept the promising pace of Chip's saga of urban hipster pathos!)  I felt for Chip in a way that I never did for the other characters.<br />And I was really  put off by the unending saga of the father's battle with his failing body. There seems to be a belief among contemporary authors that unflinching, detailed descriptions of humiliating scatological scenes somehow makes a meaningful statement about the human condition. Actually, it comes off as a giant cop-out by someone who didn't dare to challenge the existential cliches of modern fiction.
