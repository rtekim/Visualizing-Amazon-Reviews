It's not hard to see why: the novel is beautifully written, with one of the most interesting unreliable narrators in all of fiction, and has enough FIGHT THE POWER to satiate any teenager.<br /><br />What's odd is what I remembered about it in the years between readings. The ending stuck, obviously, along with the gist of the plot - non-crazy man pretends to be crazy to get out of jail and winds up discovering just how insane the world can be - but if you'd said One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to me, the image that my mind would immediately have conjured would be the surreal night terrors of Chief Broom, trapped in bed as the bottom drops out of his world revealing the true machinery of life, where men are strung up on meat hooks before being sliced into rust and ash.<br /><br />So I remembered the metaphor and the prose, and happily forgot the underlying racism and misogyny. I've no problem at all with the antagonist being a vile, controlling woman, but it's hard to sympathize with a hero whose suggestion for improving her temperament is sexual assault. I take the work as a product of its age...but still. Gah.<br /><br />Kesey's novel is still vibrant and riveting, and though the passing decades and (thankfully) changing times make its imperfections seem more glaring, its underlying message about living in a world that chews up and spits out anyone who doesn't conform to the rules and standards of normalcy remains as pertinent as ever. So it's still the truth...even if it didn't happen.",2015-08-29

When that theme is at the forefront this is a wonderful story and it produces a number of excellent set pieces of passive aggressive confrontation between the two as they manipulate the others to be on their side in their dispute.    The story is narrated in first person by \\""Chief\\"" Bromden, a half-Indian inmate of the mental asylum where the story takes place, and that may not have been the best choice. The problem is that Bromden's narration is constantly sidetracked by his own hallucinations and remembrances of his past (which may or may not be accurate). To me these passages bog down the narrative and sidetrack the main story.    There is also a nasty strain of misogyny underlying the narrative, as Ratchet's bullying nature is entwined with her gender (there seems to be a particular fascination with the size of her breasts) while two whores the inmates become involved with are treated sympathetically because, well, they are what the male characters want them to be--easy. The final confrontation between McMurphy and Ratchet isn't cathartic so much as sleazy and cringe-inducing even if you are on McMurphy's side. Twenty-first century readers may also be put off by the way the black characters are treated and referred to but this isn't unusual for a book published by a white author around 1960.    In this his debut novel, Ken Kesey displays an excellent writing flair and a sense of the dramatic but I think he strained too hard for profundity with Bromden's extended speculations on his life.",2014-11-15

Much more depth to the characters not found on screen (it seems the movie was mostly a showcase for Nicholson). We are told the story from the perspective of Chief Bromden, and his paranoid rantings make the book greatly enjoyable to read. Instead of just watching McMurphy on screen, we see his impact on a very personal level with the emotionally confused Bromden. It's a great book, it made me laugh on several occasions along with generally feeling sympathy for the characters. Now that I've read the novel, I can understand Kesey's dissatisfaction with the film. They sucked the life out of his characters: it became a battle of McMurphy and the nurse.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest!","Ken Kesey was inspired to write this classic American novel based on his own experiences working in a mental hospital in the 1960s. Life isn't easy there for the patients led by the infamous Nurse Ratched. An American Native Indian, Chief Bromden, narrates this dark and uplifting tale of life there.    Until recently, many mental asylums have closed permanently and left abandoned. This mental hospital lacks the warmth and encouragement for the patients to get better.    Nurse Ratched is determined to keep a strict control over her Ward. She fixes the time. She puts the Ward in a foglike state to keep them obedient and to her will. She also makes most of the decisions and has help from three sadistic African American men to keep the patients all in line. Nurse Ratched is revelation of a female character. Nurses were seen as maternal and nurturing but not Nurse Ratched. She is an unlikable character with a sadistic element in her nature. She is not the kind of nurse that you want for a mental ward.    The patients include the introduction of a colorful Randle P. MacMurphy who chooses to spend time there than a prison. He would have been safer there. Nurse Ratched wasn't going to let him take over her Ward. She was determined to make an example of him.    The novel is about 300 pages long. It is both an entertaining and enlightening read. This book probably changed the way that mental hospitals were viewed as a place for the undesirables and outcasts. There the patients were subjected to abuse of all kinds and inhumane treatment.    Like Upton Sinclair's classic novel, \\""The Jungle,\\"" this novel explored and changed society's view of mental health. I would have wondered if Kesey had more to say about it. This book inspired the classic film of the same name later awarded with Academy Awards. Louise Fletcher was absolutely perfect as Nurse Ratched. Jack Nicholson's performance of R.P.

Kesey highlights a different perspective, deeming society and government the oppressors and stressing individuality. The struggle begins when a new patient at a Psychiatric Ward named Randle McMurphy wages war against Nurse Ratched, who is a tyrannical force within the ward. Nurse Ratched is part of a mass machine called the \\""combine\\"" which symbolizes the destructive way in which society attempts to control its members. I have to admit, the novel was a slow start, but as it developed I eagerly anticipated the next hilarious plan McMurphy would devise to strip the Nurse of her power (in the end, this coincidentally takes on a literal meaning). I was fascinated by the uncertainty of each patient's sanity, and Kesey provided a perspective that allowed each reader to develop his or her own opinion. A mental patient named Bromden, who experiences frequent hallucinations, narrates the novel. His vivid hallucinations, although considered an example of his mental disability, are actually metaphorical interpretations of how the combine works on its patients. What makes this novel so captivating and unique is that it is told from the perspective of someone who could possibly be mentally disturbed or be completely sane, a man who faked being deaf and dumb for a majority of his time at a mental hospital. Kesey shows that the term \\""normal\\"" is subjective; it is forced upon us by society and makes us form preconceived notions of normality. The main characters of the novel attempt to break free from the constraints that have rendered them \\""freaks\\"" of society in order learn what it is like to feel normal. I highly recommend this book, and I look forward to reading it again in the near future.",2013-11-03

I ended up finding the book to be far superior to the movie because of the unique perspective achieved by having Chief Bromden narrate the story. Chief Bromden frequently hallucinates that there is a dense fog holding him down and hiding him from others. However, the reader is not ever informed that this fog is imaginary and the only way to pick up on this is to notice how Bromden seems to be the only one bothered by the fog. The fact that Bromden doesn't think anyone else can see him when in this hallucinating state allows him to narrate with an outside perspective . This is not the only advantage of having the mentally insane in a novel.<br /> This book is also unique because Ken Kesey is not restricted to a logical train of thought because a person who is completely insane doesn't have to make any sense. The benefits of this are endless. I particularly enjoy the use of crazy people as comic relief. Colonel Matterson is always yelling such hilarious nonsense as, \\""The but-ter ... is the Re-pub-li-can party. ...\\"" and \\""The pillow is ... a horse!\\"". Kesey also uses the mentally insane characters to increase the gravity of a situation. An example of this can be found when Old Pete hits one of the aides in the face in a flurry of anger, yelling, \\""I'm tired!\\"".<br /> Overall, my favorite aspect of the novel was the storyline itself. I got sucked into the anti-authoritarian messages of the novel and even found myself seething when Nurse Ratched would commit injustices. The ending was a release of all the pent up hatred for Nurse Ratched. When McMurphy finally stopped restraining himself and strangled Nurse Ratched, I found it extremely emotionally gratifying because of how involved I felt I had become in the battle against Nurse Ratched's tyranny. Although tragic, I thought the conclusion with Chief Bromden freeing McMurphy from his \\""already dead\\"" state was excellent. This wasthe most entertaining piece of literature I have ever read.",2013-11-02

The novel is told from the viewpoint of a half Indian Chief Bromden who describes the hospital's proceedings from his observations on the patients, staff, and their interactions. His attempt to be invisible by pretending to be deaf and dumb allows the reader to indulge in an eavesdropper's perspective constantly. Bromden's hallucinations and fear of an outside controlling force he labels the Combine, establishes the reader in the intriguing mindset of the disturbed. The novel's center conflict is between a  Randle Patrick McMurphy, who feigned insanity to avoid going to prison for battery and gambling, and the head nurse, Mildred Ratched. Ratched runs the hospital with an iron fist, and is described by Bromden to be a t the center of an invisible network of wires in which he controls every facet of the institution. The novel follows McMurphy's continuous attempts to break apart that system, as well as his indirect goal of helping the patients to realize they are men, and not the pawns of an oppressive system. The vibrant and frequent conflicts between the patients led by McMurphy and the staff carry the plot and all add to a continuous build up of tensions between two forces. As the patients become more and more self-discovered the hospital only grows more dangerous and surreal. Kesey uses his personal experience as an orderly at a psychiatric hospital to paint an accurate picture of this world of the disturbed. You will have to experience it yourself to decided whether the staff or the patients are more so.",2013-11-02

Nurse Ratched is not so different from most people in this way. She is also vindictive and authoritarian, like many incompetent authority figures. Her maliciousness in therapy and her delusions of altruism take her outside the realm of just incompetence, but other than that I saw her as human.<br /><br />MacMurphy enters the scene and stirs things up. He pals around with the patients and treats them like equals that don't have actual problems. He does some good things, like getting Chief to open up just by talking to him, because he doesn't know \\""the way things have always been\\"" or doesn't care, but he also behaves recklessly in other situations. I don't know whether I'd say he treats them like human beings, because he also may be an antisocial personality.<br /><br />One one extreme, Nurse Ratched treats patients like objects to be minimized and quieted.

That was heavy.","I've gotta' say that my reading of this novel was undoubtedly colored by the fact that I had just finished Rousseau's Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men before starting it. I had never seen the movie, so going into it, I was a clean slate. I had no real preconceptions, and thank God for that, because this was one of the most incredibly fresh and interesting novels that I've ever read.<br /><br />It opens with our narrator, Bromden, \\""Chief\\"", giving us a schizophrenic, nightmare rundown of the Asylum, a stronghold of The Combine ruled by the icy Nurse Ratched, \\""Big Nurse.\\"" Her almost hypnotic hold over the patients of the ward is challenged by the arrival of Randle Patrick McMurphy - a wild, gambling, Southern, red-headed con-man trying to escape four months on a workfarm by having himself committed. The stage is then set for the clash of two titanic personalities and the forces they come to represent. Faceless, unaccountable, institutional power, The Combine, represented in the figure of Big Nurse. Fundamental humanity, agency, and the dignity of natural man championed by McMurphy.<br /><br />Because that is what McMurphy becomes to the men on the ward, who are disenfranchised and alienated even within the hospital, which Nurse Ratched strives to make a microcosm of society at large. And man, did I feel the joy of their brief and glorious triumph. Kesey writes with such honesty that, as Bromden says, \\""...it's the truth even if it didn't happen.\\"" Bromden's narration is a key part of what makes this novel so stirring. His paranoid schizophrenic fantasies turn the ward into a hellish dystopia, all the more terrifying because he is arguably more attuned to the reality of what is happening than anyone else. His hallucinations are in touch with the unseen, coercive power of the institution, the insidious nature of which is much more dangerous, subversive, and divisive than outright acts of force.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of criticism of the book online for perceived sexism, which I'm not sure I agree with, as I believe that's not really giving Kesey enough credit. Demasculinization, castration - these are symbols used, but I believe that if you look deeper, Kesey is really talking about the enforced alienation of humanity from our sexuality by society as a means of control and dehumanization. As surely as the sterilized figure of the Big Nurse uses desexualization as a weapon, Candy uses sexuality as a means to heal Billy Bibbit. Indeed, even McMurphy says at the outset that the ball-cutters can be male just as easily as female. The Ward doesn't simply desmaculize the men, Ratched defeminizes herself. The institution isn't being painted here as a tool oppressive only to men, it is robbing everyone of their humanity.<br /><br />I was really legitimately surprised by how much I enjoyed this novel. I was expecting something more sterile, more academic, I think. Really, this novel is a wonderfully emotional book, while diagnosing the modern schizophrenic disconnect of the individual from the mechanical institutions of society by a demonization of the natural impulse (even laughter is foreign to the men of the ward). It mirrors in some ways a lot of the reading I've been doing lately (Catch-22, Rousseau, Marx) in highlighting the dangers of modernity: in this case, that, in the face of an insane institution, the sane man is necessarily a lunatic.",2013-08-21
US,51847912,R4D609RPLBU1M,0451163966,808414399,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,Books,5,1,1,N,N,"A Maniacal Masterpiece","My literary hat is off to Ken Kesey for writing one of the best English language novels of the 20th century! It belongs on the shelf next to [[ASIN:0156030306 Flowers for Algernon]], [[ASIN:0316769487 The Catcher in the Rye]], [[ASIN:0679745653 Breakfast at Tiffany's and Three Stories]], [[ASIN:0743273567 The Great Gatsby]], and other great American novels that took characters to new heights in the past century. The title of novel is taken from a children's rhyme:<br /><br />Vintery, mintery, cutery, corn,<br />Apple seed and apple thorn,<br />Wire, briar, limber lock<br />Three geese in a flock<br />One flew East<br />One flew West<br />And one flew over the cuckoo's nest<br /><br />One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest shines brilliance in every corner of the dark asylum in which it's based. It's a place where patients are hosed down, tied to their beds at night, their mouths stuffed with colorful pills to make them behave and if they don't, if they should dare challenge the bulking nurse--Miss Ratched--they are given a ticket to the amusement park funland called the electro-shock therapy lab.<br /><br />The novel is told from the POV of an American Indian who has no business being in an insane asylum other than to escape his oppressive upbringing. Times are hard until McMurphy enters the asylum. The Jack Nicholson movie of the same name is quite good, too, but even the great actor cannot measure up to McMurphy, the character he plays in the movie. He lands in the looney bin for no other reason than to escape a hard labor sentence for his crimes. That's when the fun really begins as he incites the others to stand up for themselves against the oppressive regime.<br /><br />One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was published in 1962, nearly 120 years after Charles Dickens toured the North East insane asylums of America, which he recounted in his \\""American Notes.\\"" There he told of a cruel system that did little to rehabilitate the insane. Edgar Allan Poe and many others felt Boz did American wrong when he returned to England and wrote his unflattering account. Three years later Edgar Allan Poe would pen one of the first English language short stories set in an insane asylum (\\""The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\""), in which he lampooned many politicians of the day as analyzed in [[ASIN:1933747188 Edgar Allan Poe's Annotated Short Stories]].<br /><br />Sadly, little had changed from the Victorian Age of Dickens and Poe, to the early 1960s when Kesey published OFOCN. The novel, however, did what Charles Dickens was unable to do by changing the way the insane were treated in America. It's still not a perfect system and probably never will be, but one that is less reliant on drugs and that has nearly eliminated lobotomies. So says my aunt who spent nearly her entire career as a nurse in an insane asylum. I can still remember as a boy, sitting wide-eyed around the table, while she told of the many fascinating things that when on there. Some of them were funny and some were downright creepy.

Three years later Edgar Allan Poe would pen one of the first English language short stories set in an insane asylum (\\""The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\""), in which he lampooned many politicians of the day as analyzed in [[ASIN:1933747188 Edgar Allan Poe's Annotated Short Stories]].<br /><br />Sadly, little had changed from the Victorian Age of Dickens and Poe, to the early 1960s when Kesey published OFOCN. The novel, however, did what Charles Dickens was unable to do by changing the way the insane were treated in America. It's still not a perfect system and probably never will be, but one that is less reliant on drugs and that has nearly eliminated lobotomies.

I have seen the film several times, but the book differs in a very key way. The narrator of the book is the presumably deaf/mute Chief Bromden, and his running commentary gives the book a different flavor from the film. His status as being supposedly deaf and mute gives him access to the asylum's dirtiest secrets, and it is fascinating to see the action through his eyes. \\""I had to keep on acting deaf if I wanted to hear at all,\\"" he states.<br /><br />It is interesting to look at Chief Bromden as a possible unreliable narrator in the novel.  We know from page one that he is in a mental hospital, and the Chief has had several rounds of treatment in the \\""shock shop.\\"" He even has episodes where he returns to his youth in his mind, filling out his fascinating backstory. Bromden played high school football and is partially driven mad when his father, the first \\""Chief Bromden\\"" in the book, is swindled out of his tribe's land on the Columbia River, where they have speared and net fished the salmon going upstream at Celilo Falls for generations. Ultimately the Dalles Dam is built, covering the entire area with water in 1957. Celilo Falls is an interesting bit of history in itself, and it makes for fascinating reading.<br /><br />Bromden tries to give a factual account of what is going on inside the hospital to the best of his ability, but that account is somewhat slanted because we see it only through the lens of his illness. He is paranoid to the point of thinking that there is a \\""Combine\\"" that manipulates and controls individuals in subtle ways, such as machinery in the floors and walls. His paranoia is exacerbated by Nurse Ratched's very real iron hand in the running of things on her ward.  In a critique of the novel, author Richard Gray explains that Bromden's vision \\""may not be literally true but it is symbolically so because, to quote Emily Dickinson... `Much madness is divinest sense.'\\"" Traditionally an unreliable narrator is a narrator whose credibility has been severely compromised, usually to deceive the reader. Although Chief Bromden is clearly delusional from his schizophrenia (oozing walls, buried machinery, shrinking and growing people), he is at least trying to tell the truth as he sees it, for the greater good of the other patients.<br /><br />Bromden reveals his ability to hear and speak to McMurphy, a free spirit who cons his way into the hospital faking insanity, thinking that time spent there will be easier than the jail sentence he is serving. McMurphy immediately locks horns with Nurse Ratched and bucks the system in a classic clash of the individual against the establishment. Chief Bromden and the other patients take heart at McMurphy's antics, and finally begin to come into their own as people instead of being scared and manipulated by Nurse Ratched, who only seems comfortable when wielding ultimate control over them. After a wild after-hours party on the ward near the end of the novel, one of the patients named Harding says that he is nearly ready to leave on his own, with all \\""the traditional red tape,\\"" and that the others are \\""still sick men in lots of ways. But at least there's that: they are sick men now. No more rabbits, Mack.\\""<br /><br />Author Ken Kesey's inspiration for the book came from the time he spent working as an orderly on the night shift at the Menlo Park Veteran's Hospital, a mental health facility in California. He saw how the institution worked and interviewed patients. During his time there he also volunteered for  Project MKUltra, a covert research operation by the CIA's Scientific Intelligence division experimenting in the \\""behavioral engineering of humans,\\"" which included experimentation on subjects with psychoactive drugs such as Peyote and LSD. Kesey's experimentation and writings eventually went on to influence the counter cultural movement in the United States and elsewhere in the mid to late 1960's.<br /><br />One Flew over the Cuckoo's nest is a great and entertaining read with timeless themes that give you a lot to think about long after finishing the last page.

The story is told behind the observant and quiet eyes of Chief Bromden, who springs the words to life as if the reader were listening to him speaking around a campfire. The Chief tells of his experiences in a mental institution ruled by the guileful Big Nurse who is challenged by the boisterous and charming newcomer, Randle P. McMurphy. McMurphy fills the ward with life, adventure, and defiance towards meager rules, going against the status quo of not only the Big Nurse, but also the shrouded controllers and manipulators of the world. The battle is packed with ups and downs and many surprises which lead to a realistic and inspiring ending. Though, the novel isn't a complete roller coaster of excitement. In fact, whenever McMurphy isn't in the scene, the pace of the book tends to slow down. The narrator, Chief Bromden, often delves into the description of major themes such as shrouded tyranny, fear, insecurity, and the importance of individuality with great detail and many literary devises. This leads the reader to think over many things while also enjoying the action and comedy throughout the novel.<br /> Reading intensely through the novel, I appreciated every aspect it had to offer.

One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is an extraordinary novel that portrays this wonderfully. It all starts with a mental asylum; Chief, the narrator of the story, tells us about the atrocious nurse and the melancholy patients. Everyone just sits around all day, and follows the same schedule day by day until Randle McMurphy shows up. He would be considered the protagonist of the story. He doesn't have the same beliefs as the malicious, ancient nurse Ratched. He tries everything in his power, all day and every day to change her revolting rules. He does succeed some but you can only accomplish so much. She is the head of the asylum and he is just a measly patient.  Who do you think would win? There are many themes in this novel. One of the main themes is freedom. It is what some of the patients long for and what others don't think they deserve. You will see the theme of freedom in this novel often.  Another core theme would be rebellion. Rebellion is McMurphy's middle name, but in this novel that isn't bad. He is just trying to get everyone to be actual people again by showing them how to be normal. For example, he wants them to laugh, watch the World Series and play cards. Also, the ending was not my favorite, but I do believe it was an outstanding ending that shows us what our world has come to and what society can do to you. Other than that, I truly liked this book. You laughed sometimes, and wanted to cry sometimes, and occasionally you would want to yell at the nurse. Ken Kesey did a great job tugging at your emotions. I believe everyone should read this book. I believe this because it shows you how blessed you are to be free and it tells you to always be yourself; to stand you for what you believe in. Any book by Ken Kesey would be a winner.

The 1975 Milos Forman adaptation of this novel appears on the list (#20 on the original list, #33 on the later revised version), and I have a rule about not seeing movies based on books unless I've read the book first, so of course I found myself picking up this novel.  I usually enjoy reading books regarded as classics, but I wasn't particularly looking forward to this one.  Having spent quite a bit of time in psychiatric facilities between 2000 and 2003, including over a year in a semi-long-term facility when I was around 20, I tend to steer clear of fictional treatments of mental illness, for a multitude of reasons.  The idea of a *comic* novel set in a mental institution didn't sit well with me at all.<br /><br />Then I actually read it.<br /><br />There's been enough said already about the plot.  You probably already know the core storyline of this novel is the battle of wills between the malicious \\""Big Nurse\\"" Ratched and the malingering convict Randle McMurphy.  Ratched is a wickedly effective villain, in whom genuine malice is seamlessly commingled with the impersonal force of compulsory conformity.  (It can surely be no coincidence that her name so resembles \\""ratchet,\\"" a mechanical device that allows movement in only one direction.)  McMurphy, the lusty swaggering gambler, is perhaps the least saintly Christ figure in all of literature.  Less attention, unfortunately, has been paid to the novel's narrator, \\""Chief\\"" Bromden, whose delusions hold more truth than most people's view of reality: the one-man Greek chorus who comes into his own as protagonist and, in so doing, holds out hope for all of us who aspire to something more than just getting by in an insane world.<br /><br />\\""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\"" is, of course, a counter-cultural novel in which the mental ward is symbolic of a conformist society.  Although Ken Kesey was inspired to write this novel by the time he spent working on a psych ward, his primary goal wasn't to call attention to the mental health system per se.  Still, I found it almost frightening just how perfectly he captures it - and just how little some things changed in the four decades between this novel's publication and my own hospital experiences.  There is, of course, plenty of exaggeration in these pages, of both the dramatic and the comedic varieties; as the Chief himself admits, the reader may well \\""think the guy telling this is ranting and raving . . . you think this is too horrible to have really happened, this is too awful to be the truth! . . . But it's the truth even if it didn't happen.\\""  No, they don't actually have patients lobotomized for having the audacity to ask what exactly is in those pills that they're taking - but that doesn't mean they encourage that sort of curiosity either.<br /><br />I've seen staff mock and ridicule patients, and even provoke them when they were in crisis.  I've had them use their knowledge of my trypanophobia to force me to behave as they wished, even when I wasn't doing anything that would legally justify their so much as laying a hand on me.  I've been to the \\""Community Meetings\\"" where no one in charge actually gave a damn what the \\""community\\"" had to say.  When I noticed how often I was given the wrong meds, and brought this to the attention of the higher-ups on behalf of the other patients who might be less diligent in checking the contents of their pill cups before swallowing, some of the nurses labeled me a troublemaker.  I remember how many of my fellow patients bought uncritically into the therapeutic model they were offered: \\""If we can't work together as a community in here, we can't do it out there,\\"" one of them proclaimed once, to the approval of staff, while I shook my head in puzzlement, wondering what getting along in a closed group of heterogeneous strangers, among whom the only common element was severe psychological illness, had to do with getting along in the outside world.  Kesey touches upon all of these things, with such compassion - never stated, but plainly obvious, and never descending into pity - that I was able to empathize completely with the characters, rather than feeling isolated by the memories of my own trauma.<br /><br />As for the comic aspects of the novel, I found myself enjoying Kesey's dry, dry, brutally ironic wit.  Never does he go for cheap shots at the expense of the mentally ill; the characters do sometimes behave in humorously absurd ways, but Kesey refuses to mock.  Unlike the men on Nurse Ratched's ward, I found myself laughing often during my time in the hospital - but it was a bitter laughter, the kind that comes when you just can't cry anymore.  In fact, one of the most triumphant moments of the novel has the men learning to laugh again.  McMurphy, according to the Chief, \\""knows you have to laugh at the things that hurt you just to keep yourself in balance, just to keep the world from running you plumb crazy.  He knows there's a painful side . . . but he won't let the pain blot out the humor no more'n he'll let the humor blot out the pain.\\""<br /><br />Kesey's writing is beautiful and challenging.

The story takes place in a mental hospital, located in Oregon.  The patients live a dull, routine, and orderly life, until a man named Mr. McMurphey introduces some life into the hospital with his charismatic and energetic personality.  He formerly worked on a farm, but supposedly pretends to be insane in order to avoid all the manual labor.  Although his arrival appears to be positive, the head nurse, Nurse Ratchet, has a problem with him trying to take control of her own domain.  The novel deals with a power struggle between the two and the challenge that McMurphey faces when trying to get the patients on his side.  An additional twist added to this book lies in the narrator, a psychiatric patient named Chief Bromden.<br /><br /> The characters are well developed and are interesting to read about.  Each patient is given their own defined characteristics and their behaviors are a representation of the harsh and controlling influence of Nurse Ratchet.  After being provided with key facts about each of the patients, you begin to question whether or not some of them are actually mentally ill.  This ties into the many topics discussed in this book including what makes a person insane, a person's desire for power, man verses man, man verses machine, and many more.  The plot thickens as McMurphey realizes that the day he gets released is determined only by nurse Ratchet.

But lately I have been getting interested in Kesey.  There was an interesting article about him and his fight to make his son's death (in a car accident on an icy road) meaningful in a literary journal a couple of years ago, and I also saw the documentary \\""Magic Trip\\"", which shows clearly that Kesey was a  ringleader of the avant-garde group that was ushering in the counter-culture explosion of the 1960s.  (Apparently he eventually turned his back on the movement he did so much to create, but that is another story.)  I decided it was finally time to read something by him.<br /><br />I quickly discovered that this novel was much more than a good template for a movie.  Nor was it merely a popular novel by a young man who became a cultural icon.  This is a Great American Novel.  Not only is the story and the main character fascinating and richly drawn, the prose hums with energy and color.  The descriptions are full of detail (the author worked in a mental institution for a while, and knew what things were like).  Kesey was capable of some very nice prose, but things never get stuffy.  The story moves along nicely, and there is a lot of insight into the minds of, not just the troubled men depicted here, but men generally.  My guess is that he was influenced by Kerouac and Burroughs, and probably by some traditional Western novelists too, such as Wallace Stegner, who was the director of the writing program at Stanford, where Kesey got his MFA.  One of the interesting surprises here was how well Kesey wrote about the sights and sounds of rural Oregon, where he was raised and where he spent most of his life.<br /><br />I won't bother going into the plot or the characters of Randall McMurphy or Nurse Ratchid here, since they are so widely known.  There are some interesting secondary characters who get a fuller description in the book.  Professor Harding,the erudite but sexually confused and cowardly gentleman, is a bigger player in the book, as is Chief Bromden, who narrates the tale.  There are large sections of hallucinatory prose in which the chief lets his twisted fantasies run wild which are fascinating to read.  He also thinks back a fair amount to his childhood in a rural Indian village which was wiped out to make room for a dam.  Billy Bibbitt seems very much the same on both page and film.  In fact, the screenplay does a masterful job of condensing the story.  A couple of incidents are cut out and others conflated, but for the most part it stays very true to the book.<br /><br />The themes are fairly clear from the beginning.  Society breaks people down, robs them of their freedom, and forces them to conform.  Lunatic asylums are mostly places where the mentally weak have come to lay low and avoid dealing with a world that has no use for them.  This harsh, cold, overwhelming pressure to conform is personified by \\""the big nurse\\"" (as Nurse Ratchid is called) a manipulative, heartless bitch who has no love for her patients or desire to cure them, but wants only to make them give in and follow the rules.  (I am sure by the way that feminists would have some issues with this book, since the women in it are mostly either kindly prostitutes or Nurse Ratchid - but it is important to point out that the book takes place in a men's mental hospital.  I would hope that Kesey's female characters were deeper in other things he wrote.)  \\""Cuckoo's Nest\\"" presents a rebellious young man's view of the world to be sure, and the author was a rebellious young man when he wrote it.  This way of thinking was a big part of the 1960s ethos - personal, individual freedom from social mores and restrictions was seen as an unquestionable good.  Kesey was one of the people who put it into words and images and characters, and he did so brilliantly in this novel.",2012-03-17

I can sum up this book quickly by saying that it is very well written, that Kesey was a literary genius, and that it is deservedly called a classic.  So what's the bad news?  Let's just say it's not a book I recommend for a first date!  If you want a book that drips cynicism and psychological violence, this is the one.  The subject matter is about a man who is in revolt against the very corrupt powers that be in a mental hospital.  The problem for me is that he is as much a criminal as they are, but his criminality is glossed over against their greater violence, a common theme in literature.  Randle McMurphy, to me, is not a sympathetic figure, but he is made to look that way because his \\""freedom\\"" comes through attempts to defy an extremely oppressive power structure.  Indeed it is mentioned that he once led an escape from a Chinese prison camp...but his behavior is still very much  thieving and unexemplary.  Among many other things, his stautory rape of a yong teenage girl is decidedly glossed over; but for me that one act robs his character of much of its sympathy.      If you want a book that purports to be an expose' of mental hospitals in the mid-twentieth century, without a single redeeming quality, (personally I cannot and will not believe that all of them were such hell-holes) then this book is for you.  I'm reading it because, again, it is very well written, and since I am in a production of it on the stage as my very first drama, I want to do my job thoroughly, and that's why I am reading it.

There is discussion value.","STORY BRIEF:<br />McMurphy was at a work farm prison.  He arranged to have himself transferred to the asylum - supposedly because it was easier and had better food than the work farm.  Miss Ratched is the nurse who runs the ward.  She is powerful like a dictator.  She represents the System.  She demands conformity and submission from her patients and will use evil and fear if she doesn't get it.  The men on her ward are cowed by her - like rabbits.  McMurphy is a loud, laughing (sort-of-con-man) who organizes card games and other activities for the men.  She wants McMuprhy to conform but he refuses - even when he knows he will suffer at her hand.  She has power over McMurphy because she determines when he may be released and what treatments she will give.  She can order electric shock treatment and lobotomies if she wants.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />This is tragedy - there is no happy ending.  It is not an entertaining escape.  This was assigned reading for my teenage son, and I read it out of curiosity.  I'm glad I'm not in high school anymore and forced to read things like this.  Unfortunately I regret my curiosity.  It was no fun, but I can see value for classroom discussion with topics such as: the all-powerful system - you can't win but you can effect changes for others - although you may suffer or die as a result.  All choices represent loss.<br /><br />During the first half of the book my reaction was dreary.  The second half was better.  There were some interesting characters.  There were some interesting events.<br /><br />One interesting scene had a patient observing \\""Never before did I realize that mental illness could have the aspect of power.\\""  Gas station workers were making fun of the patients until McMurphy told them (a lie) that these patients were murderers which frightened the gas station workers.

It seems in-coincidental that the main character's surname, McMurphy, is similar to that of Larry McMurtry, one of Kesey's Standford classmates in the Wallace Stegner writing program in which they were enrolled while Kesey was writing the book--perhaps a nod of fond respect or gratitude. Also consider that Kesey was likely to have been under the influence of LSD-25 while writing the book. It was before LSD had been declared illegal, and he'd volunteered to take it under a school-sponsored program funded by the CIA. The drug could account for some of the book's more hallucinatory scenes.<br /><br />Kesey's been tagged by critics as misogynistic, unfairly in my view. It is no more misogyny when villainous female characters are depicted than it is misandric when badly flawed males are featured. This book is richly endowed with both. When characters exist in society, it's a writer's duty to serve them up with craft and gusto as Kesey does, lifting the veil on Nurse Ratched's cruelty and passive aggression. Female cruelty is also evident in Harding's wife, who flirts openly with other men in the ward to torture him. Nor does Kesey spare the topic of prostitution in the characters of Candy and Sandy, who go about their work with charm and enthusiasm.<br /><br />Lesser villains are the black orderlies, Washington and Warren, who extract a vicious toll of hatred against the virtually all-white inmates.<br /><br />The main character, McMurphy, is well drawn and believable, driven to inevitable combat with Nurse Ratched as the plot moves relentlessly forward.<br /><br />My only real complaints are the choppiness of Kesey's writing style and the hallucinatory mental wanderings of the narrator, Chief Bromden. I also found Bromden's first-person subjective point of view to be distracting in places, too. It is through the Chief that unrealistic insights into the mind of Nurse Ratched are conveyed. Omnicient qualities are more effective when conveyed in third-person.<br /><br />Sheep attract wolves and frogs, snakes.

The book contains an interesting assortment of characters:  The most noticeable character is Randle McMurphy: a fun loving, gambling, free spirit who went to the asylum to avoid finishing out a sentence at a hard labor camp.  He arrived and injected life into a place that had been devoid of it for long. The patients had become complacent by the routine, strict rules, and the ever-present threat of shock treatment or lobotomies if they stepped out of line. The drugs they were constantly administered clouded their consciousness and numbed them emotionally. Bromden called it the fog, and McMurphy was constantly trying to lift them out of the fog.   The narrator of the story is Chief Bromden: a seemingly mute half-Indian whose has a case of extreme anxiety. His dad, once a mighty chief, was reduced to a miserable alcoholic once the government took his tribes' land and homes. Gradually, McMurphy teaches him to have courage and believe in himself. Bromdon has an extravagant imagination and describes many of the events that occur with very colorful and creative metaphors. This adds to the richness and enjoyment of the book.    The villain in this book, Nurse Ratched (Big nurse), is very controlling and manipulative. A warm and caring faÃ§ade is always displayed to the patients, but in reality she only wants absolute control of everybody and everything in the asylum. She has carefully selected her staff for that purpose. She constantly has a caring smile on her face, but do not be fooled. Everything she cunningly does or says is to secure control.  Throughout the novel, big nurse and McMurphy constantly butt heads. The patients, led by McMurphy, gradually become more defiant, which results in a shocking climax at the end. This novel was an absolute joy to read. I could relate to the fears and insecurities many of the patients struggled with. Most of the acute patients were not crazy just sort of stuck, unable to overcome certain difficulties and were comforted by the security the asylum provided them.  A life lesson to take away from this novel is that even though society, government, political pundits etc. say they are doing things for your own benefit, they may actually doing them for more selfish and insidious reasons. Another important message to take away from this novel is that no matter what pain and problems life has thrown your way, have courage to fight on.

The book is sometimes seen as a stirring fable of human individuality triumphing over over stultifying conformity.  But despite the engaging plot, the book relies on its share of cliches. The book almost romanticizes sociopathy and rebellion, casting the non-conforming protagonist McMurphy as a martyr. In real life, when a sociopath like McMurphy does enter a psychiatric unit to avoid a prison term, the results are quite different. These individuals exploit the mild mannered or more dependent patients, disrupt routines, raise the stress level by their manipulations, con the staff for medication, and take enormous resources away from patients who are there to get better rather than there to avoid incarceration in a prison.  They can also be quite charming, and others (such as Kesey) may be prone to romanticize the type, and indeed media tends to find a prurient interest in the bad boy. Despite its intellectual problems, the book can be praised as being part of the movement to humanize psychiatry.

I didn't get to read it, but now that a new year has started and considering I have more time on my hands I searched for this in the school library expecting a good read. Now that I'm finished with the book It's safe for me to say I really enjoyed reading this.     First off I've never seen the movie of One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest, but want to after hearing it praised as being one of the greatest movies to be created. After reading this book I'm REALLY curious now.      The story is basically about this crazy, messed up mental asylum run by this evil b**** of a nurse known as Nurse Ratched. She runs this place with a smile, but don't be fooled because shes really a wolf in sheeps clothing. Seriously I think she's got bigger mental issues than the supposingly crazy people shes supposed to be \\""fixing\\"" for society. Then comes Randle McMurphy! A big, red-headed, man who faked his insanity so he can avoid serving out his sentence in the hospital. I can guarantee you out of all characters he's the one, most likely, only character you'll love beside Chief Bromden.

I at first found it strange because hes not the true protagonist, but after awhile I got used to it. Plus later on I grew to really like the Chief and felt he became somewhat of a hero in a way. Its not that often I read books with a first-person narrative by someone other than the protagonist.  This actually got very confusing at times though, because in some scenes in the book the Chief is experiencing odd hallucinations brought on by a machine in the ward. On other times the story will suddenly bring up a flash back of his life too. This added to my confusion in some areas because the transition into these flashbacks just felt off.     What I really love about this story is that it makes you think. How can you tell if someones sane or insane? Are the methods of helping mental patients really ethical? Is society what makes a person what they are? It brought up many curious questions. After this I really want to check out the movie now.

The setting is located almost completely in a mental hospital. The world that is described might as well be the mirror image of our own society. His style and his relationship with the characters that he picks apart for us is astonishing.<br /><br />Kesey is an amazing writer who digs deep into the character of \\""Chief\\"" Bromden. He hints lightly at the experiments of the past and of the future that were performed and would be performed on patients in mental facilities around the world. One of the most common hints is to frontal lobotomies which becomes significant much later in the story. The horrid concept of a lobotomy is also accompanied by general authorial gestures to disorders. Some are obvious like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder while others can only be guessed at. The world outside the mental hospital, which tends not to be much different form the inside, is populated by nature but also a definitive presence of repetition, stagnation, annexation of creativity, and replicas. This theme is represented in the system that the mental hospital is run as.<br /><br />Our narrator, \\""Chief\\"" Bromden pretends to be deaf and dumb so that he can secretly acquire information during his stay, which is inexplicably long, on the ward. Unfortunately, what he does with that information is nothing. Even when McMurphy arrives and he begins to drag Bromden out of his shell he continues to stay quiet about the intel he gathers. He is quiet, sensitive to his surroundings when he's not hallucinating, yet unreliable because he cannot, at first, tell what is reality and what isn't. Frankly, I believe that this is never actually resolved since reality is a perspective, like an opinion, that not everybody shares the same truths to. At first he hallucinates repeatedly to escape from the problems of this world, the ward, and says at one point \\""You were safe from the enemy, but you were awfully alone.\\"" McMurphy, however, would change that.<br /><br />Before getting into that, however, the system should be reviewed. The system should be run by the doctor but is instead run by the Big Nurse. Three \\""black boy's\\"" are like her henchmen in the process. The boy's work like a tripod and can rarely function without the help of the other two. They are sinister but it's made clear that they should not be. The system outside of the mental hospital and the system inside run by Nurse Ratched created them.<br /><br />Nurse Ratched is and should be hated by the reader. There is this love/fear/hate of Nurse Ratched when it comes to the perspective of the incarcerated psychotics on the ward. However, she is, in total, to be hated. She has a false smile slapped on her face constantly, embodies machinery and ice imagery, and encourages betrayal and absolute order on her ward. She digs into the minds of the weak like a needle and wiggles around in there until the world complies to her. However, Bromden and many of the other men on the ward soon realize that she should be pitied. It's a fleeting thought, but she should. She, like the black boys and the actual \\""psychotics\\"", is a product of society. A product of the system. One of her main problems is that she tries to hide and subvert her feminism to get by in a masculine world and to hold all the power. She knows no other way of existing and that, in of itself, is sad. In a more obscure fashion, McMurphy attempts to not only help the men on the ward but also Nurse Ratched. She just fails to listen.<br /><br />All this talk about a McMurphy character! He is our cure. He is what we secretly wish to be but can never have the courage or the strength to become. He looks at a system and laughs at it. He can show you who you are and never be wrong about it. He sees past the fogs of life to the point of the matter and drags it to the surface kicking and screaming because true reality is the ability to look at yourself and accept. He, unlike the system, is constantly moving and sociable. He does not stay stagnant and has this zest and rambunctious attitude that makes us wish we were kids again. His smile counteracts and ridicules Nurse Ratched's while reaffirming his stance on life.<br /><br />Kesey does not speak of nature much in this novel. Nature is only painted during a few scenes and it is normally beautiful. McMurphy is the representation of nature throughout all other scenes. He is, literally, a force of nature. He is chaotic, unpredictable, often calm, sometimes storming, and he makes SENSE. In an insane world he is the pivotal point in which truth can be found. Because of this he turns into the father figure on the ward. It would not be a stretch to say he is Jesus-like. The boat scene is where he has 12 members following him, like 12 disciples, and he smiles and laughs watching them come into their own skin and realize their own potential. The men begin to depend on him and only at the last is their self-dependence being seen in the other characters. In truth, he helps them to stand on their own so that his bigness, as Bromden would put it, could be transferred to the others. Then they can make it their own and become who they need to be.<br /><br />The novel is replete with descriptions worth rereading ten times over and a sense of awe and degradation and hope that is rarely combined in such an eloquent fashion. It follows a trend like Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and moves at about the same pace. Dystopia moves to Utopia but not without its losses and pain.e does not stay stagnant and has this zest and rambunctious attitude that makes us wish we were kids again.

Nature is only painted during a few scenes and it is normally beautiful. McMurphy is the representation of nature throughout all other scenes. He is, literally, a force of nature. He is chaotic, unpredictable, often calm, sometimes storming, and he makes SENSE. In an insane world he is the pivotal point in which truth can be found. Because of this he turns into the father figure on the ward. It would not be a stretch to say he is Jesus-like. The boat scene is where he has 12 members following him, like 12 disciples, and he smiles and laughs watching them come into their own skin and realize their own potential. The men begin to depend on him and only at the last is their self-dependence being seen in the other characters. In truth, he helps them to stand on their own so that his bigness, as Bromden would put it, could be transferred to the others. Then they can make it their own and become who they need to be.    The novel is replete with descriptions worth rereading ten times over and a sense of awe and degradation and hope that is rarely combined in such an eloquent fashion. It follows a trend like Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and moves at about the same pace. Dystopia moves to Utopia but not without its losses and pain.",2010-07-20

Few books are able to allow the readers full access into a man's mind in a way that makes them lose themselves, but this one does so in an achingly simple way. It will leave you with little sense of satisfaction, but with that sensation of wonder and regret that you feel after reading a book that you know may well be one of the best you will ever read. I dare you to read this book without letting it gnaw at your understanding of freedom, or sanity, or yourself. But One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a novel that you must experience, one you must sit with and absorb, before trying, if you must, to make any concrete sense of it. And we, as readers, must allow ourselves, and our sanity, to be lost as we read. You may just find, as I did, that in doing so you begin to see the sanity in a group of men who are, undoubtedly, insane.               One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes place in a ward of an Oregon mental institution. The book is narrated by Chief Bromden, a half-Native-American who is so used to being ignored that he allows himself to be mistaken for deaf and dumb for years. The novel tells the story of what happens when the ward, run by the brutal and tyrannical Nurse Ratched, is turned upside-down by the arrival of R.P. McMurphy. McMurphy feigns insanity in order to be transferred from a work farm to the mental institution. Though Bromden is the narrator, the protagonist is clearly McMurphy, whose larger-than-life attitude and refusal to accept society's terms make him something of a celebrity on the ward. His battle against Nurse Ratched and her sadistic staff, puppets of society's machine that Chief Bromden calls the \\""Combine,\\"" begins to change the other patients, and, if you let it, just may change you, too.           This novel takes you on a journey with a group of men who, though labeled insane by the outside world, are insightful, enlightening, and engaging. In reading it, you will discover a world of sadism, cruelty, and an odd sort of beauty, all through a somewhat jarring juxtaposition of poetic language with the cold, concrete atmosphere of the ward. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a novel in which the lines between reality and the surreal aren't just blurred - they're not there to begin with. \\""But,\\"" Bromden says in the beginning of the novel,  \\""it's the truth even if it didn't happen.\\""",2010-04-11
US,16423197,R2FKBJ98NUA4SC,0451137094,808414399,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,Books,5,3,4,N,N,"Superb Conceptions of Real Living Beings","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest depicts a certain Native American's (Indian's) last months as a patient in a west coast mental hospital, sometime during the late 1950's to early 1960's.  Kesey's first person narration and life-size characters highly intensify both the absurdity and the validity of human existence, making this novel a classic.    Chief (\\""Broom\\"") Bromden's narration permits the reader to view through his eyes the horrors of the ward that the Big Nurse (Ratched) and her black boys control with such precise efficiency.  The Chief introduces the reader to the other Acutes and Chronics - and to a new Admission by the name of McMurphy.  The reader knows, just when Chief Broom does, that McMurphy is quite different from the other patients on the ward; McMurphy's presumptuous style makes it impossible for him to be classified as either Acute or Chronic - or insane, for that matter.  Because Chief Broom has remained silent for so long, everyone considers him deaf and dumb; but it is through him that the conversations of staff personnel are heard and interpreted.  The reader quickly acquires an understanding of the patients' fear of the Big Nurse and of those around them.  The Chief's perception of McMurphy and his knowledge of this ward are far greater than that of any other, effectively giving the novel a limited and, therefore, ultimately powerful perspective.    Kesey's characters are superb conceptions of real living beings.  Most of the patients develop from timid \\""rabbits of the rabbit world\\"" to stronger, self-assured humans who realize that they can take charge of their own destiny.  The most notable of these are the giant Chief \\""Broom\\"" Bromden (a Chronic) and the Acutes Harding and Bibbit.  Having been huddled within himself for years, Bromden evolves from a fearful, silent broom-pusher into a man who feels as big inside as he is physically.  Harding, ashamed of his own feminine mannerisms and sexual preferences, develops into a clear-headed, intelligent individual and eventually leaves the hospital with his wife.  Bibbit matures from a stuttering, thirty-something year old child into a happy, giggling adult - or, at least, almost.  The exceptions are Big Nurse and McMurphy.  Both display an iron-core strength; both manipulate the other characters to their own advantage; both pit themselves against each other; and both are inevitably broken.  It is this conflict between the two strong characters that allows the weaker characters to find strength in themselves.    Both Chief Broom's interpretations and the characters in the ward magnify the novel's powerful emotional charge.  The Chief sees the struggle between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched as something bigger - something a man can't ever win, something a man's got to keep fighting - but he doesn't ever state exactly what that something is.  However, he realizes that control of one's life lies within the self and that as long as a person keeps laughing, keeps smiling, then just maybe that something can't win either.  Bromden realizes that for all its absurdities, life is essentially good.  While he finally states he has \\""been away a long time\\"" in the context of his childhood home, the reader gains the impression that it is really life he is returning to.    Kesey's novel, although dealing by an extreme with the insane, gives all human life a resounding stamp of worth and value.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest keeps the reader on an emotional pendulum: laughing at McMurphy's pranks, recoiling from Nurse Ratched, strengthened by McMurphy's courage, defeated by the patients' helplessness, and cheering for their victories.  It appears that for Kesey, a person without a spirit is just a blank, empty shelll.  His regard for meaningful life stands strong and clear.",2010-01-21

You might expect that the treatment is obvious or heavy-handed, but there it is done with skill and care.  (And, if anything, it softens the often scandalous treatment of the institutionalized mentally ill.)    But there is more: there is Kesey's fantastic penetration of madness itself.

Through the voice of Chief Bromden, a mental patient in an asylum, the story tells of harsh treatment and the blurred line of what is sane and insane in this life. The character R. P. McMurphy enters the scene, changing and questioning all limits and preconceived notions of how things work in the world. He represents hope, and how it can change any situation, even one of suppression and evil.   The story starts off on a usual day in the asylum. The Big Nurse is introduced. She is a harsh, stern woman who sets the clockwork of the unit ticking seamlessly. There is no escape from the dull life of the patients. That is, until R. P. McMurphy enters. He is clearly sane, but in this setting he sticks out, making you question what exactly is sane and insane. Throughout the story he gives and gives to his fellow patients, restoring them with some degree of dignity and respect for themselves. The Big Nurse questions his motives, and along with the scene, she sees him as malicious and conniving. Yet, the patients, ranging from Chief Bromden, the paranoid and hallucinating Native American, to Dale Harding, a former college-graduate, grow to love Randle McMurphy. As the two forces, freedom and restriction, collide with each other over and over again, the story takes a turn for the dramatic, climactic events that harrow your soul and hook you into the story.    Personally, I loved this book. It was not an easy, light read by any means, but it is among the classics with its ability to change your view on life. In the beginning, the facts of the patients' lives are so harsh and sobering, it was hard for me to push on and continue reading. But with the help of Randle McMurphy, I was intrigued by the course of events that played out with the new character. Though it has many adult themes, I believe that, as a teenager myself, many other teens would likethis book who are interested in reading different books besides the clichÃ© teen love story. The book questions authority. What is organization and where does the control start to become ultimate power that does not benefit the lowly? Where do scientific procedures and inhumanity separate? This book does have light moments however. The characters are so faulted that they seem seamless. The internal view of their quirks and misgivings makes you realize that they are not so very different from you and with this realization, you stop seeing them as separate individuals from your life, and they start to represent a whole. And with this change of mind, you see them as human and what is being done to them as inhuman and brutal. You start to care for the characters you once saw as \\""freaks.\\""   The book is powerful, giving you an intimate look at others and yourself. It is moving in a way that I have not seen before and the connection that develops between you and the characters will surprise you in the end.",2008-12-14

I can somewhat understand ones initial boredom with the novel, for it is written slightly longwinded, but the prose is so genuinely engaging that its style quickly becomes its biggest drawing point.<br /><br />Many know of `One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest', not as a novel but as an Oscar winning motion picture starring Jack Nicholson.  While the film is brilliant on just about every level, it all started here, with this fantastic novel.  Ken Kesey had inside knowledge of his subject, having worked the graveyard shift at a mental hospital himself, and this knowledge is present on just about every page.  He beautifully (albeit tragically) filters through the lives of the patients and the staff, exposing the darkness (masked in humor at times) that permeates the lives of those living in such conditions.  The novel pits two very strong willed and independently centered individuals against one another in a game of `good cop/bad cop' as either one attempts to attain complete control of the ward.<br /><br />First we have the ruthless Nurse Ratched who establishes order through an iron fist.  She forces and manipulates and destroys those in front of her, namely the patients as well as fellow staff.  She degrades the men in her ward and blackmails the doctors, all the while carrying a sense of duty, as if her actions were for the betterment of those around her.<br /><br />Next we have McMurphy, the rookie patient who is a Vietnam vet with a history of violence and insubordination.  He opted out of the work camp and chose to serve his time in the mental ward, hoping for a quick pardon.  He uses his time to try and selfishly dethrone the evil Nurse, masking over his actions with the air of sincerity, as if his actions were for the betterment of those around him.<br /><br />The novel is narrated by the Chief, a large patient thought by all to be deaf, dumb and unintelligible.  This allows him to watch everyone and judge accurately, for they are open around him, thinking that he cannot understand.  He takes us up close and personal, letting us into everyone's circle and exposing their true intentions.<br /><br />What I remember most about the film was that it left me conflicted as to my thoughts on insanity.  The film painted so vividly the thin line that runs between the stable and unstable that I found myself wondering if we all weren't just a little insane.  The novel does this very same thing, just to an impressively grander degree.  Each character is fleshed out in a way that his mental imbalances come across in subtle waves, and then violent crashes, almost hiding them before our eyes only to explode before us.

Differing greatly from the movie, the book is seen through the eyes of the Amerindian character, Chief Broom. McMurphy comes off in a similar, but also different way than the McMurphy in the movie. The biggest difference to me was that in the book McMurphy was the best therapist in the whole hospital, helping various patients get over and deal with their issues. He even makes the head shrink on the ward feel like a real living man again during the fishing trip where the Doctor catches a huge fish. The Chief while showing obvious signs of real mental illness, some of what is used to showcase that, the \\""Combine\\"" and the \\""Fog\\"" are also obviously symbolic of some very real things. But I don't want to get into a bunch of mental masterbations about what various things and characters in Cuckoos Nest are representative of. I'll leave that to the eggheads of the world. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey is a great book and I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />But what about Kesey himself? Ken Kesey had LSD experiments done on him at Stanford by the guy that ended up in charge of the CIAs Mkultra mind control program. This really makes me wonder about Kesey. Its more or less accepted history that the first LSD to get out on the street level was what Kesey stole from the medicine chest at his job as a night shift janitor at a mental hospital and distributed it among his elitist friends. So they give out keys to the medicine chest to the nighttime janitor and he knows just what those fancy new fangled drugs that make the crazies act even crazier are called eh? Ha ha! Yeah man give me a break. I believe Kesey was given LSD to dole out by certain people for specific reasons.<br /><br />Kesey went from writing what was probably the best novel written during the 1960's to, while becoming a counterculture hero, never writing another thing worth reading again.

Kesey was not happy with the movie version of his novel (despite all those Oscars).  I had never understood why, until now.  The very essence of Kesey's characters were gutted by the movie (not just their physical appearance but the very core of who the characters are and what they represent).  Nicholson's performance, which seemed like a tour de force before, now seems superficial to me.<br /><br />The novel is written from the perspective of one of the patients (the Chief) who everyone on the ward believes is deaf and dumb.  The Chief is essentially a `fly on the wall', observing all that happens, virtually unnoticed (at least initially).  His tenacious grasp on reality (his hallucinations and paranoid delusions may be the result of drugs he is forced to take, mental illness, or a combination of both) provides a fascinating perspective and allows Kesey to use the Chief's altered sense of reality as a source for much of symbolism in the novel.<br /><br />The movie may be good (possibly even great), but the novel is much richer, more complex and profoundly tragic.

ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, first published in 1962, was Ken Kesey's debut novel.<br /><br />The setting is a ward at a hospital for the mentally ill, probably in the late fifty's.  Chief Nurse Ratched has absolute control over her ward.  Through insinuation and intimidation, she has oppressed the patients, aides, junior nurses and even the ward doctor into wimps.  We see this through the eyes of the narrator, Big Chief Bromden Jr., a half-Indian who pretends he is a deaf-mute.  The staff ignores him, and allows him to clean the staff room during their meetings.  He's the all knowing fly on the wall.<br /><br />Enter the new admission, Randal Patrick McMurphy, the roughneck gambler who got himself transferred to a mental hospital to escape the rigors of a prison work farm.  McMurphy considers most of the patients essentially sane, and cannot understand why they have allowed Nurse Ratched to dominate and humiliate them.

Things to keep in mind: I did see a stage production of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, but I have never seen the movie.  I am not going to summarize the book, I will just get to my point.  I will say that Cuckoo's Nest is not by any means a breezy read, and I also had a little bit of difficulty in the beginning fully comprehending some of what was going on mainly because it is not written in any typical fashion and yes, it is written from the perspective of a mental patient whose perception is not always clear...or is it?  Not only that but Kesey was volunteering to take part in LSD testing during the time he wrote the book, which he wrote from his experience working in a Veteran's hospital.  The first portion of the book is a bit slow, but once you get past the introductions, so to speak, and adjust to the style of the narrator's prose it takes a turn and you can't help but care for these characters and feel what they feel and go through and how they change and evolve.

She doesn't go out of the way to torture the patients or anything, but as a nurse (one who helps and tries to cure patients) she doesn't treat the patients, or consider them as human beings at all.

All this is true for \\""One Flew over a Cuckoo's Nest\\""; however, the fact that it has contributed a phrase into the common vernacular means it should definitely be required reading.<br /><br />The story is quite compelling as we follow Chief Bromden's account of what happens in a Midwestern mental institution run by the infamous nurse \\""Ratched\\"" when a spunky newcomer enters the scene and attempts to challenge authority. The narrator has pretended to be deaf and dumb for many years, and he has been able to act as \\""a fly on the wall\\"" in various situations. The new guy on the block is McMurphy, a flamboyant, boisterous and randy jailbird with a temper to match his red hair. However, even though McMurphy is the delightful protagonist and provides the most fun for the reader, it is Nurse Rathced who remains the most memorable character - not much unlike Big Brother in 1984 (another must-read novel that has provided a whole set of commonly used terminology).<br /><br />The language is cleverly descriptive - the sound of the starched nurse's uniform is \\""like a frozen canvas being folded\\"", and the feel of the institution atmosphere is quite haunting.

The first several pages of the novel started off a little slow because I was unsure of where the novel was going, but very shortly after I found myself becoming more interested and attached to the novel. Furthermore, towards the end of the book, I found myself feeling like I knew the characters and felt almost a bond with the character McMurphy, as well as some of the other characters. <br /> <br />The novel begins with the main character, McMurphy, who has moved from a prison to a mental hospital. The reasons for him coming to the mental hospital have nothing to do with him being insane, but rather that he is trying to escape the terrible prison work farm that he was in before. Upon arriving to the mental hospital, McMurphy learns about Nurse Ratched who uses force, lobotomy, and \\""electroshock therapy\\"" to control the patients. Because Nurse Ratched is an evil lady, the patients of the institution do not speak out against her because they are scared of the power that she carries, the power that she has to hurt them, and the fear that they carry about not being in conformity with all of the other patients. The novel continues to show McMurphy's desire to disobey Nurse Ratched's authoritarian control as there are several incidents that occur while he is staying there that jeopardizes his life, and ultimately ends up jeopardizing his friends life. During his stay at the institution, McMurphy meets many friends, and teaches some of them how to stand up against the evil nurse and how to show their own individuality. Throughout the novel many people, including some of the guards, begin looking up to McMurphy and the way he never becomes submissive to Nurse Ratched's control. The novel keeps the reader intact at all times, with an urge of following McMurphy's every move. The main themes of the novel deal with ones freedom, as well as, the power that conformity has on taking over a person's life. <br /> <br />Ken Kessey's style of writing is remarkable. Although the novel is sometimes difficult to read and has many underlying themes and messages about mankind (that can sometimes get confusing), Kessey's writing is beautiful and allows the reader to enjoy the book to its full extent. Also, the book teaches a great deal about human nature and the way that mankind acts in specific situations. I highly recommend this novel to others, for its strong impact that it had on me and in addition, the way that it made me think about the issue of conformity and freedom.

McMurphy. Sometimes it seems to me that in this day and age novels hardly seem to have any value by their own right; the luckiest of novels, like this one, get good cinematic adaptations. The rest get bad ones. That makes me just a bit sad.    Still, try to overlook everything you know about the story and just read this, and you'll find a masterpiece that is very unique and separate from the wonderful movie. Most importantly, the narrator and protagonist here is not McMurphy but \\""Chief Broom\\"" Bromden; that in itself gives anyone who saw the film a fascinating new angle on the story. Bromden is a man who pretends to be deaf and dumb to be left alone by the staff in the mental ward in which he's hospitalized. Through this self-imposed solitude Bromden is a highly astute and accurate observer, and he gives the reader a full and personal account of the arrival of the rebellious new inmate R.P. McMurphy and his war against the management and especially the Big Nurse Ratched; through his ominous dreams and hallucinations he illuminates the nature of life in the ward, and the effect McMurphy's presence has on its routines and inhabitants.    Nurse Ratched is hardly a secondary player in this story; she's as central and fascinating a character as Bromden and McMurphy, and the tension between her and the uproarious Irishman makes the novel tick. Once again, brilliant casting and acting - Louise Fletcher as the nurse - made Ratched as well as McMurphy a timeless cinematic character in addition to a literary one. Still, Kesey's presentation of Nurse Ratched through Bromden's simplistic eyes tells you everything you need to know about the woman and her motivation; it also tells you from the very beginning what will happen at the ending, an ending that is inevitable as it is shocking and surprising. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a powerful and captivating read from start to finish, and a difficult and harrowing one too; and if there's some comic relief in there - and there is, rest assured; the novel is often remarkably funny, filled with quirky characters and absurd, nonsensical dialogue - it serves only to make the rest of it all the more powerful.

Although the inmates certainly have non-trivial mental issues, it is the authoritarian rule of the hospital and its matriarchy that proves the most damaging to their psyche.  The ruler of the inmates, per se, is Nurse Ratched (the \\""Big Nurse\\""), who proves herself to be a controlling, conniving figure who uses a divide and conquer technique to assert her authority at all costs.  She uses shame, guilt, and unbridled fear to keep her inmates in line, not to mention the antiquated \\""treatments\\"" of electroshock and lobotomy. <br /> <br />The foil to Nurse Ratched is McMurphy, a scrappy Irishman and con artist who fakes insanity to escape a prison work farm.  Little does he know that the insane asylum is far more repressive than his prison work camp.  Yet, McMurphy uses humor as a powerful weapon against the forces to be and it is he, not the odious staff, that produces the stunning turnaround in confidence and self-awareness of the inmates.  Although he may have his own financial motives, McMurphy proves ultimately to be a martyr, whose own suffering benefits the other inmates in untold ways. <br /> <br />The events are told through the perspective of Chief Bromden, a towering 6'7\\"" Indian, who pretends to be deaf and mute.  It is up to the reader to piece together the puzzle of the Chief's history, as he flashbacks to his days in an Indian village on the Columbian River and the Army.  Although suffering from hallucinations, the Chief provides insight into the conditions and state of mind of the other inmates.  The Chief perceives society as whole as a Combine, a vast mechanized factory that has dehumanized its victims.  Through vivid dreams and his imagination, the Chief depicts the damaging effects of a non-tolerant society on those who dare to be different and non-conformists.  It is ultimately McMurphy who lifts Bromden out of his fog of obscurity and back into the realization that he is a mighty man. <br /> <br />Repressed sexuality plays a large role throughout, as it is the realization of one's own sexuality that proves to be the most therapeutic element in the treatment.  Of course, the Big Nurse attempts to repress all sexual expression and shames those who partake of it.  Her shame is so severe that she goads one of her patients into suicide for daring to lose his virginity.  However, once this wall is broken down, the patients are able to become men again.  Yes, they are still men with mental problems, but their confidence has grown and they are able to assert themselves in a sometimes hostile society. <br /> <br />This novel is a true classic.

I was startled by how good it ended up being, I had thought it would be just any book: good but ordinary. Reading it was like reading a combination of Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger and 1984 by George Orwell: two of my favourite books. <br /> <br />The novel is the following of Chief Bromden in a psychiatric ward. Like Holden Caulfield of J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye he only listens, he doesn't exist to others and hardly exists to himself. But he lives in the world of Big Brother, also known as Big Nurse. Put in the light of realistic situations, the same distopian images and themes of 1984 emerge clearly and are vividly frightening.  <br /> <br />Unlike 1984 a muddy glimpse of hope is given through the canniving and crafty McMurphy. McMurphy is a gambler, a fighter and a ladies man. We are confused to his motives, not sure if they're selfish or selfless, not sure if he's sane or insane. Big Nurse has some of the same questions brought up about her character, is she just a deluded helper or really an evil conspirator. The book walks the line of reality and unreality through the mind of what seems to be a schizophrenic. McMurphy and the Big Nurse become locked in a battle of wits, emotion and force; as the battle goes on, the stakes rise rapidly. This war is paralleled by Chief Bromden's inner battle as he looks at his psychological, emotional and spiritual problems. <br /> <br />The novel's realism strikes a chord. All the characters are deeper and more complicated than ever; just as you figure you know, them a little more is revealed. It's like maneuvering in a world of ice bergs (to use one of the most over-used metaphors ever). One of the biggest payoffs is that you discover that you yourself are an iceberg.  <br /> <br />But not only are the characters lying in a gray zone but the plot is ambiguous. What's happening is always multi-layered. The writing as well is diverse and fresh, at once comedic and then sad. The voice the writer uses is a breath of air for all of us. <br /> <br />This was only my original response, my awe at the story's power was expanded upon seeing the movie. A lot of the movie was not at all how I expected it and points I found important were left out. At first I was disappointed but as I watched I began to see what it had offered to these people. I realized how the book continued, after days of reading the last sentence, to show me new perspectives.  <br /> <br />The movie also helped me just appreciate the book more in general. What the film did well just enriched those parts of the book and what the film missed just expanded my love for those parts. <br /> <br />In total the book is one of the richest reading experiences I've had lately and also helped open my eyes to a new part of the world. It is an incredibly worthwhile read and I would say it has something to offer to everybody at every stage of his or her life. If you have not read this book, read it. If you have read this book, read it again. If you're presently in the process of reading it, finish it, wait awhile then read it again.",2006-07-18

The narrator, a deaf/mute Native American, goes through hallucinatory episodes in which everything is surrounded by a foggy mist.  This is in reference to his time in Vietnam, where he was so mentally affected by the horridness of the war, whenever he feels threatened or in danger, the fog takes over.  As the book progresses, it becomes easier to distinguish between reality and his hallucinations.  As in every book, there is an antagonist and a protagonist.  Nurse Ratched, who plays the part of the antagonist, is a controlling factor in the book.  She has the upper hand for everything that has to do in the ward.  McMurphy, obviously, would be the protagonist.  He is fighting for the rights of the patients in the ward, along with his own freedom.  It is a little unrealistic that anyone would be able to get away with the stuff that McMurphy gets away with, but it makes the book just that much more interesting to read, and the whole time you are rooting for the rabbits, and against the wolf!",2006-05-17

One  central idea is freedom vs. confinement. Robert Patrick McMurphy and Nurse Ratched are the two central characters of the novel. McMurphy represents individuality in the asylum. He does what he pleases no matter what society thinks. Ratched could represent efficiency, order and control at all costs. The fear of Nurse Ratched's control makes the patients easy victims of her rule. These patients chose to give up their freedom to be in the asylum because they are not able to cope with the problems and pressures of society. It turns out that the asylum isn't much better than the outside world. There is an enforcement of strict compliance to accepting authority. <br /> <br /> Another issue that the novel addresses is power vs. authority. Robert Patrick McMurphy and Nurse Ratched choose to display their power on the patients in different ways. McMurphy treats his fellow inmates as equals. He accepts them for what they are and offers chances for them to forget their problems. A McMurphy act on his conscience by doing what he thinks is right. He is a metaphorical 'Jesus character.' Nurse Ratched uses her power in physical discipline and control. The other weapons that she uses are the therapy treatments. They are run like 'medieval torture sessions.' The men break down with the continuous onslaught of questions by their peers. She is able to torment and humiliate the men in this way. McMurphy represents a thorn in Ratched's side. Authority (Ratched) ultimately prevailed in the end. The shock treatments and lobotomy on RPM show the extent of what Ratched will do to maintain her control on the ward. One cannot win when they battle the system.  <br /> <br /> The final issue that the novel addresses is individuality vs. conformity. Most of the men have not lost their minds. They may have lost their way sometime in their lives. Their placement in the asylum worsened their problems. Most of the ward members questioned themselves so much that it caused them to lose confidence. This is a result of their problems and the asylum. RPM is a challenge to the system because he demonstrates individuality, courage and determination. Society has labeled the mental patients as rejects. Ratched's obsession with following the rules can also be considered an illness.  <br /> <br />If you enjoyed the  novel, be sure to check out the Oscar nominated 1975 film adaptation directed by Milos Forman. Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher give Oscar winning performances as Robert Patrick Murphy and Ms. Ratched.   <br />",2006-04-26

Being a giant, half Native American man in the 60's, no one has ever really recognized the narrator, Bromden, as a human being.  However, by acting deaf and dumb, he knows everything that goes on in the hospital, since no one finds any need to keep quite when he is around.  He knows so much that he can even tell you that the hospital is entirely boring.  Everyday is exactly the same at this hospital in Oregon.  That is, until a man by the name of R.P McMurphy enters the ward and turns the place upside down.  A witty, gambling addict, McMurphy brings the patients to rebellion against the leader of the ward, the Big Nurse. <br /> <br />One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes you on a journey through the lives of the hospitals patients by way of the mentally ill mind.  Except for hallucinations, seizures, and the hospital's constant sanitized smell you would think that the characters were ordinary people, which they are.  Kesey brings the reader into a world where few travel; a place where most people would think that no one has a mind.  He shows the true side of a mental asylum, not a house for animals, but a place where real people with real problems can go for help.  It is a humorous, but tragic story of those in need of a few laughs, friends, and a medical miracle.  It is a heart-wrenching story, but with a slight twist to it.  You can never tell what will happen next and will be captivated by the exciting adventures of the patients. <br />",2006-03-19

It explores the life of one Chief Bromden, an Indian and White hybrid who, due primarily to the harsh effects of a hypocritical and cruel psychiatric ward, has lost control of his mind and senses.     In the novel, Miss Ratched (a name which means to crank up the tension), runs the ward. She employs a strict schedule, has complete control over her patients. The Big nurse can ratchet up the pressure, or bring it to a low. She has the ability to speed up time, in Chief Bromden's state, and to slow it down. This utter control is the goal of the Combine. It represents a society intnet on producing a generation of \\""vegetables,\\"" people who are helpless, totally subjugated, and free from any ability to express individual thought or expression.    As the novel progresses, and more clues are given, the Combine takes on a more direct meaning. It becomes known as a community or society. It consists of all the poeple who want conformity, want things done in only one way. They do not like change. They do not like individualism. They don't like freedom of expression. So, they surely do not view Randle P. McMurphy from a positive perspective.      The Big Nurse's goal of neurotic subjugation, coupled with her brain-scrambling tactics, perpetuates the Chief's state of hallucination. To gain his permanent withdrawal means her simultaneous victory. It is not until Randle P. McMurphy, Ken Kesey's enthusiastically unique character, arrives that the fog shrouding Chief Bromden's eyes begins to recede and he starts to regain his sensory awareness. Thus, this shock-shop veteran lands on a transient vehicle of conciseness, one which treks the darkest, most fear-instilling corners of his mind until, against all odds, the bright light of reality shines through the illusions before him.     The story is extremely interesting and powerfully creative. At times, it is difficult to be sure, as a reader, what exactly qualifies as truth or illusion. It is actually more intriguing this way, in that it is up to the reader what they decide to partake as a reality.",2006-02-12

In Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest this very question is posed. We are immediately introduced to Chief Bromden, a patient at the hospital. He describes the Staff, the Chronics and the Acutes. The Staff is led by Nurse Ratched, a wretched woman with rules for everything, accompanied by all the floors orderlies. The Chronics are all the patients on the floor that remain merely vegetables due to lobotomies and electro-shock therapy. The Acutes are all the patients that are still functional; they play a crucial role in Kesey's novel. Chief Bromden is an acute but thought to be a mute, that is until Randall Patrick McMurphy arrives. McMurphy has been released from a work farm to have his sanity evaluated. McMurphy is loud, outspoken, and vulgar a vast difference from the other patients. McMurphy has brought upon himself the task of destroying Nurse Ratched. McMurphy, who is known for big ballin' and bar brawling' disposition, thinks this to be an easy task and a way to keep himself entertained. What McMurphy discovers are limits and the harsh reality he faces. Kesey uses both McMurphy and Chief to illustrate societies destruction of natural impulses.<br /><br /> Kesey worked as an orderly in a Virginia State Mental Hospital while in college. He was also acting as a lab rat for the government at the hospital aiding in the testing of hallucinogens such as LSD. With unlimited supplies of such drugs he spent a lot of his time working in the hospital under the influence. While working one day he hallucinated an Indian sweeping the floors of the hospital and thus we have Chief Bromden. Considering how much time Kesey spent around patients and under the influence as some of the same drugs as them he seemed to have a lot in common with them making it easier to write from that perspective. Some of his most insane moments he admits to have written while greatly influenced by these psychedelic drugs. Kesey's experience in the field allowed his characters to be believable. The question of which of the patients were sane and which were truly gone was omnipresent.<br /><br /> McMurphy is a liberating character for the other patients. He teaches them that they have to learn that they alone can control who they are. Society has put a label on them and broken them down to the point they too believe they are crazy and incurable. McMurphy leads them on an outing one day in which they escape on a boat to go fishing with beer and a girl. This newfound freedom for them is one of the best medicines they could have gotten. They realize that they would like to be back in the world and be able to do the normal sorts of things they would like to do.<br /><br /> I would recommend this book to everyone. I think it is a great tool to learn not to judge people. It shows such a profound form of personal growth and loss that I wish I could at some point be able to experience something equally eye opening. I give this book five stars and consider it a classic.acters to be believable.

I had never given it much thought that society label's psychiatric patients and society decides when, how and what to cure.<br /><br />The happy gambler and convicted conman, R.P. McMurphy, tricks himself into a psychiatric hospital, because he has found out that these places offers a much more pleasant stay than a jail work camp. He is meet by worn down shells of men, lacking happiness, embarrassed by there sexual desires and without any drive. He quickly discovers that the head nurse and here staff is as much responsible for these weak men's condition as are there psychiatric disease. The rest of the story is a tour de force of McMurphy's one man battle for freeing these men. A battle which he ultimately succeeds in but end up paying the price himself.<br /><br />A grotesque, provoking and ultimately tragic story filled with gripping characters and written in a highly witty language.

I am glad I did.  <br /> <br />The story is told by Chief, the Big Indian. Through his eyes we see the ins and outs of life in the mental ward. The author uses the Chief's own inadequacy to set the tone for the other patients in the hospital; each goes through life with the pace of a crawl. The processes and procedures are in place to help them acclimate themselves to life outside the ward in hopes that some day they may rejoin society. Or that is what the staff tells them anyway.  <br /> <br />We are introduced to a few figures with relative authority over the goings-on within the hospital walls, though their power is usurped by one woman. The head nurse. Over years she has manipulated the people around her, scaring off doctors and ward staff that she did not feel she would be able to control. As we join the story, her pieces are in place. She has a doctor overseeing the ward that is too timid to deny her control and three hospital attendants that are as immoral as she.  <br /> <br />She has her way with the patients' minds. In group therapy sessions she asks the men to point out the shortcomings of others thus reinforcing their insecurities. These same insecurities are the reasons that for many of the men are in the mental hospital in the first place.  <br /> <br />She keeps them weak and afraid, exerting her control until one new patient comes along and begins to question authority. R.P. McMurphy has bucked the system in every environment he has entered. As a result he had seen every form of punishment except one: the mental hospital. He was, maybe for lack of a better excuse, labeled a psychopath and duly committed. Now he has a new set of rules to break. <br /> <br />McMurphy may be euphemized as out-going, though others may prefer to call him obnoxious, pushy and loud. He is, in all respects, both the complete opposite of every other patient on the ward and the exact thing the nurse has worked so hard to avoid. With relative ease she has broken the spirits of every man before McMurphy and they both get creative as their rivalry grows.  <br /> <br />She has control over the men's daily routine and has guided their thoughts as well for so long. McMurphy obtains control over their sense of freedom, but will that be enough? <br /> <br />The mental hospital was a great microcosm for society at large. The patients are everyday people. The nurse, more abstractly, is societal expectations and normal, \\""acceptable\\"" behavior. The Chief could be you or me. He, more than the other patients, has acted in a way that is in line with what others have assumed about him and not how he wants to act. He conforms to what people tell him he is. McMurphy represents the small portion of the population that thinks outside the box. He is the free thinker who teaches us that it is ok, and should even be encouraged, for us to question authority.  <br /> <br />Too often we do things because that is...just what you are supposed to do. We get out of bed, get dressed, go to work, go home, have dinner, kiss our spouse and go do bed. We are \\""grown ups\\"" now and that is what grown ups DO. But why? Why not shake things up? We have the ability to carry ourselves with the integrity of adults though we live freely from others' expectations of us.  <br /> <br />McMurphy champions the mentality (to keep with the setting of the book) that we need to maintain some sense of autonomy. You can control where I live and you can control what I do during the day, but I will not let you control how I think and feel. And most importantly the lesson he focuses on is that no matter how tough the going gets, never forget out to laugh. This is an incredibly powerful tool we can use to avoid being swept under the control of societal pressure and expectation. With our laughter we show others that we are still in control, but you haveto mean it. <br /> <br />This may be completely off base with what Kesey had hoped to portray in his book, and it may mean something else entirely to you. But that is, after all, the beauty of it. I am not head nurse. I am not here to tell you how to think and feel about this book. But I do recommend you read it and find out for yourself. As I got into the book it was good, but not great. By the end I was pleasantly surprised by how much I really enjoyed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.",2006-01-12

It is full of confusing yet attention grabbing twists that will keep you entertained throughout the whole book. The book is about a man named Randle McMurphy who is sent to prison, but is then forwarded to a insane asylum for fighting too much. McMurphy has no complaints over his move, feeling that the hospital will be better than any prison yard. Upon his arrival he opens up immediatly and shows his true colors. He comes into contact with other patients at the hospital and gains their trust as a leader, and so he becomes the leader of the men. On his quest for power he encounters a rather large obstacle, the dictator, Nurse Ratched, who is the head of the ward. After spending several weeks at the hospital he decides he needs to escape and also decided to take one of the other patients with him. After various escape attempts --foiled by Nurse Ratched-- and resulting in the death of a fellow patient, by being over electricuted in the punishment chair. He finally finds one that he thinks will finally work, he gets the chief (another patient) to help him get out one of the windows of the hospital. But then the unthinkable happens and this is where i stop summarizing the book and tell you just to read it your self to find out what happens with McMurphy and the chief. So if you want a good read that tricks your mind and gives a sense of inspiration than this is a book for you to read. Ken Kesey is an excellent author and i would have to say that I found this book to be my favorite of his. So for an excellent read, check out this book.",2006-01-11

He finally gets a woman and then Nurse Ratched, the \\""bad person\\"" of  the story, finds this out and threatens to tell his mom.  He ends up committing suicide.  Ratched represents repressed life while McMurphy is very outgoing.  I recommend this book to any person in high school or above.

The story is told through the eyes of a mental hospital patient, usually called Chief.  Although Chief tells of the happenings in the hospital, he is not the protagonist.  One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest focuses on a new patient named McMurphy and the effects he leaves on the other patients.   <br /> The story told from the viewpoint of a patient is very effective because this allows the reader to experience an unbiased depiction of the hospital.  Although Chief's seemingly crazed thoughts are sprinkled among true events, Chief offers a childlike view of the hospital.  Therefore, the reader can form an opinion of McMurphy without the bias of a narrator.  I enjoyed the way Chief describes the hospital before McMurphy; the infirmary appears mellow and mundane.  McMurphy's first contribution to the patients is as simple as laughter.  Chief describes his laugh as \\""free and loud and it comes out of his wide grinning mouth and spreads in rings bigger and bigger till it's lapping against the walls all over the ward.\\""  Even the imagery of the novel becomes more colorful and lively.  From this sudden change in tone, the reader can tell the importance of the new patient, McMurphy. <br /> McMurphy is also essential of the development of the theme:  the harmful effects of an abuse of power on the rehabilitation of patients.  McMurphy is the first patient to point out Nurse Ratched's faults; namely, her ill use of authority which actually depletes the sanity of the patients.  Kesey's use of such a vile, unlikable antagonist is effective because it helps the reader sympathize with the patients.    <br />Also causing sympathy for the patients is their mistreatment.  Kesey is effective in describing the unnecessary shock treatments for somewhat sane patients who, because of the treatments, become insane.  Kesey's obvious distaste for the manner in which mental hospitals were run is obvious. Much like Chief's description of government authorities as having \\""seams where they're put together,\\"" Kesey also believes that those who perform the \\""dirty work\\"" for the government are merely machinery.   Thus, the author invokes the reader's sympathy for the patients, particularly for Chief,  with each word.  <br />In addition, Kesey's use of motif makes the novel more enjoyable. For example, McMurphy is constantly paralleled along Jesus.  Because of McMurphy's many sacrifices he makes for his new friends and the way he takes the patients to fish on open sea, much like Jesus did with his apostles, McMurphy becomes a Christ-like figure.  This comparison causes the reader to subconsciously be drawn toward McMurphy as a type of savior for the patients.   <br />Ken Kesey's use of theme, point of view, and motif make One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest an enjoyable read.  Many would enjoy this novel because of its theme and its universal appeal:  all people are scared to be unjustly punished or mistreated, like the patients of the novel often feel.     <br />",2005-10-27

The entire ward is turned into disarray when a new patient, Randle McMurphy, arrived and challenged all rules and authoritative figures, something no one had dared to even think about attempting. Throughout many arguments and actions of rebellion, his innovative style began to rub off on the other patients and all learn how to break out of their monotonous actions.

This novel, set in a mental ward, depicts a group of powerless and despairing men controlled by a feminine society personified in the domineering figure of Big Nurse.  The story's hero, a fast-talking manly man named Randle Patrick McMurphy, whose assertiveness is his sanity, enters this world to liberate the mental patients and restore their lost manhood through such activities as deep sea fishing, substance abuse, and sex with prostitutes.  Masculinity in the novel is usually defined in terms of sexual prowess, referred to as \\""whambam.\\""  A man's maleness is proportional to his whambam.<br /><br />The mental ward is clearly a microcosm depicting the wider world, in which encroaching technology and bureaucracy succeed in elevating women at the price of men's masculinity, so that the men of the story are left without a place, able to find refuge nowhere but in their own psychoses, which ironically play them into the hands of the System, the Establishment, or as Kesey's narrator calls it, \\""the Combine.\\""  This notion of a need for wildness and untamability as a core necessity for men's mental health is a prominent theme in American thinking, derived in part from the concept of \\""frontier,\\"" a place of untamed wilderness where men can escape the effeminizing effect of civilization.  Since the disappearance of the frontier, this sense of masculinity lost has, in some circles, grown more frantic.  Kesey injects his modern myth into this situation and succeeds in producing a dynamic and fascinating, if grim, story.<br /><br />There is little hope for a happy ending.  This battle of the sexes, as Kesey depicts it, can end only with the complete emasculation and disempowerment of the male or the humiliation and subjugation of the female.  A macabre vision indeed.  While the face of menacing authority is consistently female, Kesey appears to cringe on occasion from the full import of his work, producing a few likable female characters and one criticism of the negative way a certain character treats his wife.  Nonetheless, these brief sections hardly mitigate the novel's forceful theme.  No notion is ever suggested of male/female cooperation, let alone equality.<br /><br />It is evident that this book has resonated with a surprising number of readers, given its distinct anti-feminist tone.

I should phrase that differently; it's been awhile since I've had a good read.  Ken Kesey's book had an interesting setting-it was unlike any other book I've read before.      I have to admit that this book caught me off guard.  I honestly was not too intrigued at the beginning, especially with the thought of reading through the eyes of a hallucinating narrator.  But as I continued to read the novel, I found myself enjoying Bromden's hallucinations.  The symbolism was mind-boggling.  Also, the Kesey's intelligent choice of using Bromden, a man pretending to be deaf and dumb, as a narrator allowed the reader to read conversations that would have been otherwise kept from other characters.    Kesey did an excellent job with his characters.  McMurphy has got to be one of the most peculiar characters I've read about.  Yet, he's one of my favorite characters of all time.  I've never read about a character who could challenge authority like McMurphy did.  Kesey was a genius-his characters are all so original.  I mean, who could come up with characters like the Big Nurse and Harding?  They're all so real in a sense.  And even despite Bromden's description, the Big Nurse has very realistic qualities.    The ultimate question that I asked myself at the end of the novel was: what really is sanity?  In Kesey's novel, it seemed that society set the standards for sanity, and everyone had to conform to them.  So basically, those who are unusual, or not normal, are insane.  Those who cannot fit into society are simply labeled as insane.  However, how does this truly constitute sanity?  Society has ever changing standards, so what really determines who is sane and who isn't?  Kesey's novel causes the reader to ask such questions.  It all boils down to, were the characters in fact insane?  I think what Kesey was trying to get at with his unorthodox novel.      Despite the fact that I was not very interested in Kesey's novel at first, it proved to be a very worthwhile read.  The time spent reading it was not a wasted amount of time-I actually enjoyed reading it.

The decade marked a drastic proliferation of books that looked at psychiatry and mental illness but garnered little diagnostic or therapeutic value. Despite the prestige of these publications that usually attuned to academic standard in intellectual circles, none of such literature had the widespread impact of this novel written by Kesey who worked the graveyard shift at a mental hospital in Menlo Park, California. He participated in government-sponsored drug experiments during his employment with this hospital and became sympathetic to the patients and began to seriously question the boundaries that had been created between the sane and the insane.  <br /> <br />ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is an unforgettable story of a mental ward in which the despotic Nurse Ratched reigns over the doctor and all the inhabitants. She exercises a somewhat cultic tactics to render her patients completely submissive. In what she embellishes a Therapeutic Community, an outwardly democratic entity run by patients, she imperceptibly manipulates them into grilling each other as if they are criminals. She has over the years has welded an insurmountable power over the ward that even the doctor is rendered frightened, desperate and ineffectual. She has no need to accuse or to enforce obedience because all it takes to maintain that tight grip of power is insinuation, which allows her to force the trembling libido out of everyone without an effort.  <br /> <br />The Nurse's unchallenged tyranny begins to whittle as McMurphy, a 35-year-old Korean veteran who has history of insubordination and street brawls, resolves to oppose her every step of the way and raises the racket in her ward. His defiance is justifiable: he is surprised at how sane everyone is in the ward. Nobody and nothing in life have got much of a hold on this boisterous personality, who knows that there is no better way in the world to aggravate somebody (like the Nurse) who is trying to make it difficult for him than by acting like he is not bothered. McMurphy's fun-loving arrival at the ward brings about a different shade of opinion among the staff and the patients. The latter come following him as if he is their Savior, for he is utterly different and has not let what he looks like run his life one way or the other.  <br /> <br />ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is narrated by a patient in the ward, a Columbia Indian whom everyone thinks deaf, mute, and unintelligible, but who throughout the years of his commitment has overheard all the trickery of staff meetings. He epitomizes the mishap of the erroneous boundary with which the sane separates them from the insane. McMurphy's arrival and his friendship with the Indian Chief spur him on to recover his own identity and rebuild his self-esteem. The novel examines the notion of madness in the sense of its own and in the sense of the term being patronized by mental institution. The narrator's seamless observation and eagle-eyed description of the ward illustrate salient flaws of such a mindless system that targets only at reducing patients' mental capability. Kesey considers whether madness really means the common practice that confines to a mindless system or the attempt to escape from such a system altogether. Like its audacious protagonist, the novel itself is a literary outlaw. <br />",2005-04-26

The book's narrator is Chief Bromden, a half-breed Indian, who (unlike Macmurphy) is actually crazy.

From Bromden we get a clear picture of the clinical division of the patients--Acutes who are \\""still sick enough to be fixed\\"" and Chronics who are \\""in for good\\""--and of the methods used to care for them and keep them in line, which include occasional electro-shock therapy and lobotomies. <br /> <br />The ward is in the hands of Nurse Ratched, a strict disciplinarian just short of a tyrant.  We learn very little about her background, but it is obvious she has much experience as a psychiatric nurse because she is masterful in the way she browbeats and controls her patients (all of them male) through psychological methods like imposition of guilt and deprivation of privileges, while the orderlies act as a sadistic sort of police force.  The only other figure of authority is a meek male doctor named Spivey, who is decent enough to fraternize, if not sympathize, with the patients. <br /> <br />One day a new patient enters the ward--a petty criminal named Randle Patrick McMurphy who is apparently sane but is feigning insanity to get out of incarceration at a work farm.  Jocose and gregarious, he warmly introduces himself to everybody in the ward and encourages them to have more fun, which to him means card gambling and taking the guys out on a fishing trip.  Of course, his measures conflict with Nurse Ratched's rules and result in what is essentially a struggle for power; she tries to diminish his influence on the other patients by hinting to them that he's really only taking advantage of their gullibility and making money off of them. <br /> <br />One criticism I have is that the main characters are not as fully developed as they could be; Bromden, the Nurse, and even McMurphy seem somewhat thin for the considerably demanding requirements of their roles.  More appealing to me were two other patients--the sententious Harding, who has a knockout for a wife and observes the folly of the ward with a cheerfully ironic sense of humor; and Billy Bibbit, a bashful, suicidal stutterer with an overprotective mother.  I would have preferred Harding over Bromden as the narrator, but of course that would have necessitated changing the tone of the entire novel. <br /> <br />\\""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\"" is often said to be allegorical in its depiction of the rebel versus the establishment, but that aspect of it doesn't really interest me because Kesey doesn't even try to be subtle about it; no, I think the novel's value is in the sheer momentum of its narrative, which burns like the fuse on a stick of dynamite.  Even for those who have never seen Milos Forman's fantastic 1975 film version of the novel, the sense that the story is leading up to something big and explosive is palpable and pulsating. <br />",2004-10-03

The United States' mind in the 60's was to be rebellious and to fight the machine. Ken Kesey put this thought into his novel but switched things around such as: The United States is a Insane Asylum, the rebel Is Randle Patrick McMurphy (aka Mack), and the machine is personified as Miss Ratched. <br />An Indian inmate called Chief Bromden tells this book in the first person. He pretends to be deaf and dumb so he can avoid being annoyed by other inmates, and this makes his appearance almost invisible. This is important to the story and the reader he is then able to go into staff meetings that other patients are not allowed in and is then able to know what is going to happen to the other men or the asylum. He has done this ever since he has arrived to the hospital. This changes though after McMurphy arrives.<br />It is hard however in some parts of the story to know if what he is seeing is actually happening since he is insane and has hallucinations at random parts in the novel. This can be confusing and also weird at times. Such as the fog he sees over and over in the asylum.<br />The story picks up right away in the first five pages of reading. It starts with Chief Broom mopping (he helps out with cleaning around the asylum) and then a new inmate is brought into the hospital and is named Randle Mcmurphy. The instant Randle steps in he is automatically taking charge of the inmates and introducing himself as a gamboling man and would like to play with the inmates sometime. Miss Ratched instantly knows McMurphy will be a problem in the ward. \\""That is exactly is what the new patient is planning: to take over. He is what we call a `manipulator'\\"" (Ken Kesey page 29). It then picks up with McMurphy starting to hang out with the Acutes (patients in the ward that have not been there a better part of their lives) and becomes basically their leader. McMurphy is then introduced to group meetings and does not like how they are done, so he then starts to use him into his and other patients advantages such as turning the bathing room into  a gamboling room and starting a basketball team. He also does other big things with this advantage but you will have to read to find out.<br />Something though does not settle right with Mack. He notices that No one in the ward was or has ever laughed sense his arrival and that it seemed no one ever spoke or even asked of something to Miss Ratched. He then spoke to one of his better friends (later becomes his best) in the ward: Harding. Harding then starts to tell Mack about the shock therapy treatment and worse the lobotomy that Miss Ratched is capable of using on patients. This then gives McMurphy another reason to get on the Nurse's bad side. After that Randle starts coming up with more and more outrageous stuff to do in the ward. <br />Chief Broom then reminds us about that Miss Ratched has always got the upper hand on things and that if you wanted to win the war with her you cannot win two out of three or three out of five, but you must win them all, then you have your victory.<BR>The thing I loved most about this book was how Chief Broom's literature got better as his state of mind got better, such as: in the beginning it is really weird on what is happening or not and that his words were messed up, and as the story progresses his literature gets a whole lot better and he starts using better and more advanced words in his sentences. This change struck me as very cool. Another great thing about this book was the character development, with your antagonist and your other protagonist. These characters also change as the story progresses. The conversations between inmates in this book (especially McMurphy and Harding's) are hysterical and witty. All of these things give the book a very good realism affect.<br />I would suggest this book to anybody who likes reading comedy, adventure, drama, and conversations. Overall this book is one of the greatest of all classics out there to read and enjoy. It is one of my personal favorites.

Little did I know that I had made a great choice.  I have always enjoyed books that centered on individuality and rebellion's against the rest of the society.  This book is no different.  It follows the story of Randall McMurphy, who throughout the novel tries in every which way to disobey those with power in order to find a way out of the mental hospital for himself and to help the other members of the ward in escaping as well.  He becomes a teacher for the ward, a helper for them.  Many characterize him as a Christ like figure, as Kesey does provide enough evidence that he may have been notioning such an idea from the beginning through language, character descriptions, and events that parallel events from the Bible.  This novel has become one of my favorites and opened up my heart to other classics such as The Great Gatsby and Catch-22.

There are those books that are incredibly boring, and others that grab the reader and touch their hearts or perhaps chill them to their bones. But Â¡Â§One Flew Over the CuckooÂ¡Â¦s NestÂ¡Â¨ is something in between all of this. Not something that feels too extreme, yet more of something that makes the reader wonder. <br /> Taking place in the a mental ward in the sixties, the story is told through the thoughts and eyes of a Native American Indian chief Bromden, who escapes into the fog which is created by his own paranoia till the new patient Randle Patrick McMurphy arrives. The boisterous McMurphy brings a spark into the depressing mood of the hospital, breaking the monotonous pattern of life in the ward and challenging the authority of the Big Nurse Ratched. <br /> But to tell the truth, the plot was not what interested me but rather the characters themselves. Each was so vividly described from appearance to personality; all were well defined and varied from one person to another. Perhaps it was just the fact that each of them had various different mental disorders that made them act the eccentric ways they do, like Bromden who is lost in his fog, hiding from the world and Harding whoÂ¡Â¦s sophisticated speech contrasts with his squeaking laugher.<br /> But to come back to the point, the book really is something that seems somewhat enigmatic to me. Perhaps it is just that I read too much fiction, but the line between the delusions and hallucinations of Bromden and what is really happening in the ward are blurred. Creating a soupy mixture of reality and illusions, which at some points confuses me (thatÂ¡Â¦s why its four stars not five).<br />As a reader I found myself wondering what it all was; what was the root of the problem, why was it attacking Bromden and various other questions. Here the human trait of curiosity is played on, and I found myself falling deep into the storyline seeking to satisfy my inquisitiveness. Undeniably a very good read.<br />",2004-02-15

PC-ness aside, actually it is hard to believe that such a book would be written in the 90's. It smells counterculture; it smells like the sixties. This story wouldn't come from a mind of a contemporary writer, because by our time the issues have change. Have they?<br />Ken Kesey's `One Flew...' is usually read as an allegory of the individualist. Free-spirited McMurphy is the rage against the machine --personified as the nurse Mrs. Ratched. After the new patient is admitted into the hospital the `fatal attraction' is instant and mutual. They both represent different things, and fight for different sides.<br />The story is told by Chief Broom an Indian --or a Native American, pick which one you prefer-- that pretends to be deaf and dumb, just to be left a lot and not be bothered by the other inmates. As he is an almost invisible presence --at least before McMurphy arrives-- he is allowed to some `privileges' that the other ones are not. He can clean the meeting room white a meeting is taking place, and he can hear --although the staff thinks he cannot-- what is being discussed. Having this character as a narrator gives the reader the chance of knowing the inside side of the story; at the same time one can have the required distance with the Chief's observations and comments.<br />Sarcasm is one of the Chief's chief use of language. He has a unique mind to comment the events around. For instance, at some point, talking about the hospital he says that `there is something strange about a place where the men won't let themselves loose and laugh'. Besides, even being considered a lunatic, he has a very down-to-earth view of reality. When thinking about the nurse after she has another big fight with McMurphy, the Chief tells to his readers: `to beat her you don't have to whip her two out of three or three out of five, but every time you meet'.<br />This is a wise person --after all, Indian Chiefs are the smartest ones in their tribes--commenting that the system, the Establishment is powerful and knows that it is not easy to defeat it. But it is not impossible either. This was the purely 60s way of thinking --and one must be grateful to that, otherwise the world would be even worse.<br />There is a movie version, directed by Milos Forman and staring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. The author Kesey abominated the movie --and reportedly never watched it-- because the Chief is not as important in the film. However, it is still a good and interesting movie.<br />A contemporary writer would probably tackle the issues in another way, not so plain and sincere as Kesey did, creating a metaphor that will last until the day we have master and slaves. And, the last time I checked, it is not going to end very soon.every time you meet'.<br />This is a wise person --after all, Indian Chiefs are the smartest ones in their tribes--commenting that the system, the Establishment is powerful and knows that it is not easy to defeat it.

Popularly seen as a struggle against the Establishment this novel was the darling of the 60s generation.  I have to admit, after my first reading I saw Nurse Ratched as the Establishment and Murphy as the Free Spirit who comes against it.  But older and wiser now, I see it differently.<br />This is not a novel against the establishment but against tyranny.  The Establishment is presented benignly- it is the county police who arrested McMurphy, it is the jails across the Pacific Northwest that McMurphy was a frequent visitor, it is the doctors who are intimidated by Nurse Ratched it is the nurses who just try to do their jobs. These are not evil people; rather they are people who are trying to make the world we live in a good place to live. McMurphy, for the most part, is getting just what he deserves- he is a con-man who gets caught. Only in trying to manipulate the system for his own ends, does he find himself in the domain of Nurse Ratched and begins his epic struggle against tyranny.  As we read this novel it is clear that Nurse Ratched is the anomaly.  She misses the bad old days of the mental hospital when she ruled with an iron hand- she intimidates the doctors, nurses, staff and patients for her own ends.  It is only in his encounter with Nurse Ratched that McMurphy becomes a hero.  <br />But McMurphy is a tragic hero.  He does not understand the power that Big Nurse wields.  The object of war is victory, not making a statement. He makes a statement and loses the war- Billy commits suicide, McMurphy is lobotomized, and the rest of the acutes are traumatized.  Throughout the book, McMurphy is warned by others than Big Nurse of the consequences of his behavior; yet, he persists until, in the end, he loses.  <br />One more observation, the language of this book is beautiful.  It grabs you by the throat and drags you into McMurphys world.  Not an easy book to read, but well worth the effort.  Speaking about language, one sentence had over 170 words in it.  Wow! It takes a master at the English language to pull off a feat like that and keep the readers interest.",2004-01-01

I think this is a significant fact and shouldn't just be looked over. I think that the style of writing portrays the characters by giving each character similar problems that teens have now.<br />All of the characters are searching for themselves in some way. Something that is common for all teens to do while they are trying to fit into society and become adults. It may be how they feel about sexuality like Billy or Harding, or they feel small like Chief they are searching for a part of themselves that they have lost that they need in order to fit into society and McMurphy is the person who does what he can to help them out. <br />McMurphy plays a surprising and amazing character to me. He is like a friend that everybody whishes they could have. He is smart and funny, but he also has a charisma that draws people to him. He isn't afraid to test the boundaries, and he has a wining attitude that says to everybody things will turn out just like he says. I enjoyed every seen in which McMurphy showed up, his character brought hope and courage to the patients, he worked with them and gave them back what they had lost peace by peace with all of his tricks, and jokes, and laughs, he gave them back the strength and courage they lost. He brought them out of their pacified state of mind allowing them to think for themselves even when they were standing in the face of their enemies. All of these characteristics can be found in teens today, but it is a rare treat to be such a natural leader, the way McMurphy is portrayed. <br />I remember one line in the book over all the rest its when McMurphy is talking to the patients after his first day, and he says, \\""your all just as sane as everybody else out in the world\\"" that is an interesting thing to say in his situation being in a mental clinic and all that, but coming from a personality like McMurphy's its something I am able to believe.<br />There was only one seen that I didn't like where McMurphy showed up was at the end and it was not even him who I was mad at, it was the Head Nurse. There were times when I found her character to be pleasant, humorous nonetheless. To go as far as she did in the end, to sentence him to such a life, a life worse then death, to prove that she could just to \\""win\\"" and have the last say, that was sickening to me. She knew as well as everybody that McMurphy was as sane as anybody but went against the \\""combine\\"" and made his living that way. I think that is justification for what the Chief did. In fact I think that if McMurphy was there he would have told him to put that pillow over his face, I know he would have because after his operation he was no longer McMurphy he had no personality left he was no one at all just a shell with a face.<br />The only thing I would really change with this book to make it more appealing to newer audiences is the characters ages. The characters are much older then they are made to appear. There personalities don't support the ages that they have been given, and it throws me off a bit. I notice the book is much more enjoyable to me if I picture all of the characters are what I believe them to be, based on their personalities. For me they resemble teenagers but for others they could resemble something else. I think that by taking out the ages of the characters it creates a much more personal bond between the characters and the reader because you can believe them to be what ever you want instead of having them be generations older. But that could be part of why they are in the clinic in the first place. If they aren't pertraied as adults to the world, but they are of the same age as sesoned adults then what are they? Other then that I enjoyed reading the book after I got through the first few chapters that made me sick to the point that I couldn't continue to read if the book was goingto continue on as it does in chapter one. But when McMurphy is introduced everything changed and I could hardly put the book down. His character adds so much to this book and there is always enough humor to take along with the darker side of what happens in the world.",2003-12-02

One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a fantastic book, a highly recommended read, both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, truly a masterpiece.",2003-05-19

The book was a response to the author's experiences testing mind-altering drugs for the federal government and his later tenure as a nurse's aide in the same facility. In the introduction to the novel, Robert Faggen places this seminal novel in its proper context, arguing that this book incorporates several themes of the 1950's: the Cold War, the plight of the Native Americans, the reliance on psychiatry as a cure all for social problems, and the vestigial remnants of McCarthyism. Even if you could care less about how Kesey's book fits into American cultural history, you could hardly fail to miss the overarching theme of his novel: the tensions between the individual and the state, between those trapped in an industrial society and those who wish to live in freedom. There is a film version of this book starring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher that adequately captures Kesey's stark visions.<br />The author's tale takes place in a mental asylum at an unknown time. Perhaps this is because time has little importance to the inmates in the facility. The people in this particular ward of the hospital fall into categories of `acute' or `chronic,' depending on whether they have hope of recovery or are irrevocably ill. The days are full of drudgery, an endless round of medications interspersed with playing cards against the background of canned polka music. Everyday the acute patients meet for group therapy that really doubles as a McCarythyesque tattling session. The name of the game is acquiescence to the myriad rules and regulations of the institution. Those inmates who violate the rules earn a trip to the disturbed ward or a quick trip to the electroshock chamber. Repeated disobedience could lead to a lobotomy. Predictably, fear is the perpetual state in which most of the patients live. But with the appearance of a nonconformist named Randle McMurphy, fear starts to give way to a burgeoning hope that life will become better in this hospital.<br />The narrator of this story is Chief Bromden, a mixed blood Indian who is a patient in the ward. This man spends his days mopping and sweeping the floors while hearing and seeing everything that goes on around him. The Chief fears that something called the `Combine' controls the world. For him, the `Combine' is the machinery that fills the walls and floors of the hospital, constantly spying on and controlling the men in the ward. He believes that those who work in the asylum are actually full of cogs and gears, are part of this giant, controlling machine. Moreover, the staff and the patients believe that Bromden is a deaf mute. He isn't, but Kesey's choice of this Indian as the narrator of unfolding events is a stroke of brilliance. Since no one thinks the Chief can hear or speak, he becomes privy to every activity in the institution. The staff speaks freely around him because they feel they have nothing to worry about. His cleaning duties allow him full access to every area of the floor, including the room where the staff meets to discuss other inmates. You cannot help but like Bromden, and you quickly question whether his observations are truly the ramblings of a madman.<br />The central figure in Bromden's `Combine' theory is Nurse Ratched, sometimes referred to as `Big Nurse.' This seemingly grandmotherly woman personifies the Chief's fear of control and cold aloofness. Ratched runs the floor from her little glass booth, her hands on the levers of the machinery that controls the lights, the music, the group therapy sessions, and even most of the doctors. Her voice alone controls the destiny of the inmates. Ratched enforces the rules and regulations, and she decides who receives punishment or release. Big Nurse encourages stool pigeons and belittles the patients with implied threats and stony glares, often masked under an ersatz exterior of patience and cheerfulness.With the arrival of McMurphy, Ratched prepares for a battle of wills that by extension is a war between the individual and the state.<br />Randle McMurphy is a boisterous, tattooed, redheaded troublemaker ducking a sentence on a work farm by acting crazy. Right from the start, McMurphy undermines the rules and regulations of the hospital. He gambles for money, wonders the hall wearing nothing but towels, sings, and challenges Ratched's authority by going to the floor doctor to receive rule waivers. But far, far worse is McMurphy's effect on the other inmates in the institution. His breezy spirit and tenaciousness encourages others to demand changes in the daily routine. Randle is a subversive of the worst type, and Ratched will do anything in her power to slap down this upstart to her fascistic rule. The end of the story seems to mark a significant defeat for the concept of individualism, but if one reads closely it is apparent Kesey keeps the dream of freedom alive however ephemeral it may be.<br />Although I disagree strongly with Kesey's career as a counterculture mainstay, I loved this book. Everything about it is brilliant, from the characterization to the tight writing style. The Penguin edition even includes pencil sketches of people Kesey drew during his work as a nurse's aide. These haunting sketches add a special dimension to the text. Ultimately, the novel works because of its messages of freedom versus entrapment and the dangers of both conformity and nonconformity to the human soul. I recommend you run, not walk, to get this book.With the arrival of McMurphy, Ratched prepares for a battle of wills that by extension is a war between the individual and the state.<br />Randle McMurphy is a boisterous, tattooed, redheaded troublemaker ducking a sentence on a work farm by acting crazy.

Cuckoo's Nest follows the life of Chief Bromden as he silently observes the antics of the patients and staff of Big Nurse's ward in an insane asylum.  Cuckoo's Nest is well written and after the first 50 or so pages I was hooked.<br />This is the type of book that raises a large number of questions about our society.  On one level it treats the issue of man vs. machine as the inmates square off with the emotionless staff at the asylum.  On another it will cause you to question who really is insane and are those people insane because they are truly mentally challenged or do they simply see the world differently than the majority?  Kesey shows how even the insane remain human and desire freedom and emotion and thus follows the tale.<br />While very different in approach, this novel shares some central themes with the modern &quot;Life of Pi&quot;.

Set in a mental hospital, the novel is told thru the eyes of a Native American named Chief Bromden. One Flew Over the Cookoos Nest is a story about how fear can make you do what others tell you to do and how hope can change things around for you.  Two of the central characters of the novel represent these emotions, namely, Nurse Ratched, fear; and McMurphy, hope.  By following the interactions of these two personalities, the reader sees how their behavior can change the lives of others.<br /> All patients in the psychiatric ward are classified as being Acute, able to be cured, or Chronic, those who behavior leads to electroshock therapy or lobotomies.  The staff in the mental hospital is mean and cruel and is led by the Big Nurse, Nurse Ratched.  But things change when a new patient, Randle Patrick Mc Murphy arrives. Mc Murphy is different than the other patients as he constantly refuses to do what he is told.  He openly dislikes Nurse Ratched and eventually convinces the other men to do the same.  This is easily seen when Nurse Ratched turns off the power to the television and Mc Murphy has the patients sit with him and watch the blank screen.  When McMurphy learns that Nurse Ratched decides when he can leave the hospital, he begins to follow the rules better.  However, the suicide of another patient puts McMurphy back on the rebellious track and he smashes a glass window to get at cigarettes. McMurphy takes some of the patients on a fishing trip despite Nurse Ratcheds warnings of danger.  Ratched becomes furious at McMurphy for defying her power and tries to get the patients suspicious of him.  This works for a while but then McMurphy and the Chief get in a fight with hospital aides who are mistreating another patient.  McMurphy and the Chief both receive electric shock treatments for this action and are now seen as heroes by the other patients.  Some of theAcutes now feel strong and are ready to leave the hospital but they see that McMurphy is becoming weak and plan his escape.  But McMurphy is unwilling to leave since he promised a friend, Billy Babbitt, a chance to have sex with a prostitute.  When Nurse Ratched finds Billy in bed with the prostitute, Billy kills himself out of fear of punishment.  McMurphy becomes furious and tries to strangle Nurse Ratched.  He is sent to be lobotomized and when he returns, the Chief suffocates him.   The Chief then escapes from the hospital.  Chiefs escape from the mental hospital is a victory for McMurphy.  Even though he has died, McMurphy has made Chief free and able to resist authority.  <BR>Although confusing at times, One Flew Over the Cookoos Nest, is a good story to read.  The reader can learn many lessons.  Following authority without thinking can be bad to any individual as it leaves one with little individualism.  Also, rebellion can be a good thing if it maintains your freedom and your rights.",2003-04-27

Having the story told not from the point of view of the main character, but from that of a person committed by the state for the same mental instability that R.P.

Twenty years down the line, I understand completely what I liked so much.<br />Kesey wrote this book after having participated as a guinea pig in Veterans Administration studies of psychedelic [chemical substances].  He also worked in a mental hospital and even underwent electric shock treatment, just to see what it was like.<br />As I see it, McMurphy and Bromden are alter egos, both aspects of Kesey.  The charming, redheaded, muscleman is quite transparently Kesey.  He is an old-fashioned Everyman.  In the regimented, industrial world such a man is both a legend and a throwback.  There is no way for him to regain his former dominance, though, by his strength or his machismo.  He has to go inward and find something else.<br />A key passage is the one in which Bromden notes his surprise at McMurphy's \\""feminine side.\\""  The side that paints pictures and writes letters.

Once Bromden finds his voice, his escape is inevitable, and so is the [end of life], literal and/or symbolic, of McMurphy.<br />What I found jarring, and what I think dates the book, is the reliance on certain ...types as metaphor -- \\""the frigid woman\\"" (Ratched), the wise, inscrutable Indian (Bromden, whose mother is a white \\""Ice Queen\\"" who emasculates his father), and the black boys carry much of the message via established ...types.<br />Overall, the book is a rich modern version of the ancient myth of awakening.",2003-04-21

This novel is about a man named Randall McMurphy or Mac as some of the patients called him is sent to a psychiatric ward instead of prison for a crime that he was tried for and the outcome was spending time in the hospital.  McMurphy figured out that if he acted crazy, he would not have to go to jail and spend time working and he could lounge around and do nothing in a hospital.  Here at the institute, he sees that there are quite a few people whom he will have fun by giving them a hard time.  McMurphy's main advisary was a woman by the name of Nurse Ratched.  Nurse Ratched was a large lady and Randall knew that it would be a task to annoy her but that he was willing to accept.  Just within a couple of minutes of entering the hospital, McMurphy notices this one large gentleman whom appears to be Native American.  His name is chief and he is supposed to be \\""deaf and dumb\\"" yet in reality does not want to converse with anyone.  Chief's first impressions of McMurphy are not good, however further on the fantastic voyage, they will have become best of friends.  McMurphy eventually changes or at least has a large impact on many of the patients in the hospital and then everyone notices what his purpose that he felt like serving there really was.<BR> I would recommend this novel to those readers who enjoy a story about a supposed nut-case whom fools everyone and while noticing that the way people are treated in the hospital is unfair and unjust, then he would attempt to change it.  Also if readers are looking for someone to show caring, sympathy, and special bonds being friendships to emerge from this experience, then I would really recommend this novel to anyone.  You can really see how the detailed description of different characters view on events, or items that either go on or are in the hospital appearto be.  Different patients, different illnesses, different perspectives, and different emotions turn Ken Kesey's novel into a masterpiece.  Kesey was able to create two characters that would have the biggest impact on the audience, as well as the novel itself.  Those two were McMurphy and Chief; the friendship that once was dislike and then slowly evolved into something passionate and heart warming would melt those whose hearts buckle for two people who care about someone with everything they have.  Chief helped McMurphy to escape when he wanted and although he had a chance, he would not allow chief to be taken and abused, so he decided to stay back and endure the agonizing struggle to survive under Nurse Ratched's power.",2003-04-09

He tells the story of his experience through the eyes of an individual that hides his identity by living a little white lie; pretending to be deaf. The characters treat him naively, being ignorant to the fact that his act of playing dumb is only an escape for him. Not till the day that Mc Murphy checks into the ward and causes a disturbance resulting in the individual characters revealing themselves to the rest of the ward does Chief Bromden learn more about himself, his past, and his potentials. Mc Murphy challenges the boundaries of everyone's personalities and engages with their extremes. The individuals that were once hiding behind their rejection from society now learn who they are and how to achieve their prospective. They make themselves heard, and learn to experience. They learn to engage and interact with another and their surroundings. Mc Murphy, the leader of the pack and cause of disturbance to the ward, takes advantage of his role. His entering upon the asylum is based on attempt to escape from the outside world, and therefore claims to be in need of help as an excuse for his lack in character. He is portrayed as the Hero; he has no inclination of leaving before his job is done and before all limits are tested.

As a result, one gets a sense of what the disease really does to its victims.  For the entire ten years the Chief has been there, he has been making everyone believe that he is deaf and gives way for an insightful and understandable read.

For centuries, there have been stories of peasants and commoners against tyrannical beasts and monsters, but this story offers a twist of plot and persona.<br /> Instead of being the usual fairy tale, this book presents a realistic look at life in a hospital, through the eyes of one of the patients, a \\""chronic\\"" Indian named Bromden. \\""Chief\\"", as he is called by some of the patients on the ward, does little more than mop and clean and listen to conversation. Bromden hears and knows everything that goes on at the hospital, and even many of the things that none of the patients know, mostly because everyone believes him to be deaf, and will pretty much say anything around him. The main conflict exists between the head nurse, Nurse Ratched, whom the patients call the \\""Big Nurse\\"", referring to her size and the intimidation she has over them, and the patients themselves, and a new patient named Randle Patrick McMurphy.<br /> From the time he first enters the ward, McMurphy butts heads with the Nurse, trying her patience at every chance he gets. Randle begins to represent the most liberating force that the other patients have ever known, and he finally gives them the strength to stand up for themselves. Soon he comes to the realization that to get out of the hospital, he must conform to the rules instead of breaking them, and in the end he is consumed by the \\""Combine\\"" of society, to meet an inevitable fate. At the same time, he ultimately becomes a savior to his \\""followers,\\"" the patients on the ward whom he befriended during his sentence.<br /> Not only is this book a story of triumph against authority, but also an analyzation of what modern society can do to people. The danger of conformity and need for individuality are both revealed in the story, as well as the pain that can be caused by ignorance, shown by the emotions felt by \\""Chief,\\"" and McMurphy as well. They both have underlying emotions not seen by anyone except in a small slip of a facial expression or a bad choice of words, and both work hard to cover it up. McMurphy, especially, wants to keep up a strong front in order to keep the trust of the others, but he is slowly being eaten away by the pressure that is now on him to do this as he attempts to get on the good side of the Big Nurse at a last chance of being released. He desperately wants to get out, unlike many of the others who are there by their own admission.<br /> Centered mainly around the actions of the \\""acutes,\\"" the book gives a funny and interesting look at the lives of people most of us only hear about.

Kesey has managed to tell a story whilst making a complex political allegory, and that is incredibly refreshing.  The characters are so vivid, both loveable and sometimes vile, and Kesey finds the balance between making their exploits humorous, and not patronising the patients of the asylum.  McMurphy is a classic hero, but far more complex than most so-called Christ-like figures in literature.  The Chief however steals the show for me.  The writing during the time he tells how alcoholism is destroying his Father is incredibly moving.  Using the Chief as the omnipresent narrator is a superb device employed by Kesey, as it allows a unique, personal and sometimes confusing insight into all the proceedings.  Like all great literature, it makes you think, but does it with a unique sense of humour and character, and handles its heavy subject matter with ease: this is a simple read but devastatingly effective.

Randle Patrick McMurphy is a newcomer to the asylum, and his self-assured competitive outlook on life upsets the rules and regulations of the ward.  He is the first to challenge the ultimate authority, the Big Nurse, and he helps the other men gain the bravery and willpower to stand up for themselves.  McMurphy helps Chief Bromden find himself and ultimately break out of his shell.  This book presents some ideas and images that are difficult to follow, but this only makes the book more realistic, because it is expected that it would be hard to comprehend the workings of a troubled mind.  As the characters evolve and adapt to their changing surroundings, Kesey sheds light on human morals, and the sometimes corrupt short-term solutions to problems that people come up with to make their lives easier.  Through the power struggles between the Big Nurse and her patients, Kesey also demonstrates that there is a fine line between sanity and insanity.  Many of the narrator's mysterious observations are metaphors for how people act in reality, and it is fascinating to journey through his warped mind and see the world as he sees it.

Well written and very addictive, this book is ostensibly about mental patients in a ward dominated by an oppressive and evil nurse. Yet it is really an allegory on many levels. It works as a biblical allegory because, although R. P. McMurphy has a shady past and his behavior is by no means perfect, he does indeed try to set the men free by freeing their spirits. Throughout this book Kesey uses imagery and symbolism to drive home his point. The indellible image of McMurphy on a cross-shaped bed about to be shocked into submission further proves this. It works as a societal allegory. Nurse Ratched and Co. are the ruthless enforcers of an invisible code, their power coming from apathy (or ignorance) on higher levels, or it is given willingly because nobody else will get their hands dirty. There is a lot more to this book, it is an engrossing and memorable experience. If you are thinking of renting the movie instead, I actually would recommend seeing the film first. Why? Because, as is always necessary, the film preserves the same themes from the book and has virtuoso acting from everyone, especially Jack. The woman that they got to play Ratched is excellent too. If you watch the movie first, it works as a good intro to the deeper, more complex book.

He worked for a spell at a similar mental hospital in Oregon, even going so far as to subject himself to shock treatments.  These experiences allowed him to add authentic detail to his world, such as the classification of the patients as Chronics, Acutes, Walkers, Wheelers, and, most ominously, Disturbed.  The lucid descriptions he provides of each phylum are heartbreaking.  Life in his ward world is made up of mindless repetition and routine, where patients are watched over by hapless staff, and institutionalized racism is never given a second thought.  All of these aspects of the hospital work together to provide a nifty little microcosm of a radicalized 1960's America.<br />Much of the novel is internalized.  Chief Bromden, our humble narrator, begins life as a deaf and dumb Chronic.  Only he's got a secret (I'll never tell).  The story, as told from the Chief's point of view, is disjointed and fragmented.  This is not an ineffective technique, however.  In fact, it helps bring the reader into the mind of the insane, because as the Chief suffers through his hallucinations, we get to suffer along with him.  Kesey, to his credit, never goes overboard with the Chief's dreamlike states.  He works hard to keep the Chief's meanderings intelligible, always getting back to the story just in time before he lost the reader completely in that mania.  He lets the Chief reign himself in if only to provide lucid commentary on the events at the hospital.  This duality, this schizophrenia, makes the Chief one of the great unreliable narrators of the postmodern age.  He's not consciously covering his tracks to make himself look better.  He really believes the things he says, even if the reader can't fully.  &quot;[What follows is] the truth,&quot; he says early on.  &quot;Even if it didn't happen.&quot;<br />The real strength of &quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is that it not only givesus a strong internal narrative, but the external one is pretty strong as well.  Otherwise it would have made for a pretty convoluted movie.  Most novels do one well but not the other.<br />The reason that the external portions are strong is that they're anchored on the fate of a truly memorable literary character: Randall Patrick McMurphy.  McMurphy, a former work farm employee just new to the hospital, is a more complex character than I thought he'd be.  I was expecting from him only unbridled, ego-less action.  Instead, he was also quite focused, rational, and well thought out (listen to him cut through Harding's bull, with his neat &quot;'peckin' party&quot; analogy).  This brings up one of the novel's central questions: whether or not McMurphy really should be in the asylum, or if he's just faking to get off the work farm (in fact, this question can be asked of all the novel's characters, except, of course, for the Chief.  We've been inside his head and can surely testify that not only does he have a few loose screws, but also his screwdriver is broken).  This question makes the ending all the more tragic.  I'll not give the ending away, but be aware that knowing what ultimately happens to McMurphy didn't lessen the experience for me, and it probably won't for you.  Kesey manages to hold the suspense until the reader gets there.  When he finally lets go, the shock of it hits you like a fist through a window.<br />The novel's central and scariest truth is that the system (i.e., what the Chief calls &quot;the Combine&quot;) can't be beat.  That's very much a 1960's attitude, but still relevant in contemporary culture, especially for those of us still trying to make our way in the world.  It is personified here by Nurse Ratched, who, no matter how persistent you are as an opponent, will always hold all the cards.  And the sad irony is that this fact, once known, makes McMurphy's final punishment seem more like a blessing than a curse.",2002-01-08

Like always, I feel that setting is very important to a novel. In a lot of cases, and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, the setting almost takes upon the role of a whole new character.  The novel is set in the Pacific Northwest, in a mental institution. The mental institution has a great deal of meaning for it is the backbone of the theme.  Kesey, who wrote the book in 1962, tied in a lot of his own experiences and uses, in a sense, flashbacks. Kesey grew up in Oregon and worked with patients in a mental institution. A lot of the narrative is developed from experiences in his life. The most obvious literary device, however, is the use of symbolism. Developed from  where the book is set, the mental institution, symbolism is abundant. The most important is the meaning in which Kesey tries to get across. Using the setting, many will agree that he uses the mental institution to symbolize the oppression which is present in modern day society. His main idea, it to get us, the reader, to really question the meaning of  sane or insane. Kesey uses the problems of today and ties them into problems that Chief, McMurphy, Billy Bibbit and even Nurse Ratched face in their lives. One thing that I thought was brilliant on Kesey's part was choosing chief as the narrator.  Pretending to be deaf and dumb, he has access to information that the other patients do not. This makes him a great narrator. This demonstrates somewhat of an ominiscient point of view.  I really enjoyed this novel and I love the Movie. I am sure everyone who has read it found it interesting. If you can understand the four literary devices I described, you will enjoy One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest",2001-11-09

The book is really something else.<br />Written in 1962 by Ken Kesey, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST establishes what people face day to day, the Establishment! We in our society deal with rules, policies, and laws -- and this book throws those same laws right back in the faces of those enforcers. The hero is Randle Patrick &quot;Mack&quot; McMurphy, a man sent to an Oregon state mental hospital after causing problems in a prison farm; the other is the villain (or should I say villainess) in the guise of the &quot;Big Nurse&quot; Mildred Ratched, who dominates the entire hospital. McMurphy fights against Ratched and her system, and eventually &quot;waking up&quot; the patients on the ward. <br />We meet other patients -- the Acutes: Harding, Martini, Scanlon, Cheswick, Sefelt, Fredrickson, the stuttering Billy Bibbit, and the narrator of the story, the supposed deaf and dumb Indian Chief Bromden, as told through his eyes. <br />The book takes many liberties in defining the realities of a mental hospital. But it actually is much more than that. It's about the freedom of the spirit, the right to make your own choices and not be bullied by the Establishment, or dare I say even the government! McMurphy embodies that spirit, that certain rebel within us all that will not stand by and let other dictate our lives. Of course, in the end, there is a loss felt by everyone including McMurphy, Nurse Ratched, the patients, and the entire staff of the hospital.<br />Needless to say, this book is very different from the 1975 Oscar-winning film that starred Jack Nicholson as McMurphy and Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, both of whom won Best Actor and Actress that year -- and the film winning Best Picture. But the film doesn't haven't the endless description by the Chief as the book has; in fact, the Chief doesn't say a word until half way through the film. Kesey even went on to denounce the film and say that it completely ruined the idea ofhis book. However, many would disagree that the film ruined book and vice versa. (But to be honest, I did find the film much more accessable than the book.)<br />My one complaint is, as always expected from a book, the endless description from the Chief about the hospital, about McMurphy's nose, about Nurse Ratched's breasts, about his papa and his boyhood in the Dalles. Does it really matter? Quite frankly, does anyone care to know this? <br />Here's a lesson to everyone: UNLESS YOU WANT TO PUT A FACE ON THE CHARACTERS, DO NOT WATCH THE FILM VERSION BEFORE READING THE BOOK! You'll just get bored with description and subplots.<br />But CUCKOO'S NEST is a very good book! I would recommend this to anyone who like that story of the underdog against the system.

Miss Ratched, nicknamed Big Nurse, runs a rigid schedule that is compared repetitively throughout the novel to the systematic and never changing operation of a machine. Randle Patrick McMurphy, on the other hand, is a boisterous, red-haired man with a mission of disruption and chaos for the ward and the freedom for the patients to actually be able to make some basic decisions for themselves.

And that jarring juxtaposition between cruelty and brilliance is what makes the whole thing tick.<br />Cruelty is personified in the book's antagonist, an Army nurse who uses her position and her bureaucratic influence to sustain a reign of quiet terror on her inmates. Brilliance is embodied by the protagonist, an irascible rebel who uses his wit and sheer zest for life to instil courage and a sense of self worth in those same inmates. The contest between them is a struggle for souls. It mirrors the larger struggle we face between the spiritual death of slavish conformity and the spiritual vitality of chaotic abandon. Sometimes, to live at all, one must live madly.<br />And it is all shown to us so naturally that we never know we are learning it until we pause for reflection and thought. This is the sign of a great writer.<br />The book also has faults. For one thing, it is sexist. The women are either emotional fascists, like Ratched; or spineless, like the other nurses and Bromden's mother; or tarts, like Candy. It would have been nice to see a woman with substance and backbone as a counterpoint to the depressing figures cut by the female characters. Moreover, there is a rather misogynistic subplot hinting at Ratched's repressed sexuality and old maid syndrome as the reason for her sadism. The women are placed in positions where they lord it over the men, from the obvious to the barely perceptible, and we are vaguely made to feel that this is against the natural order of things. Kinda cheesy, and frankly, a cheap shot by the author.<br />But the book was written in 1962, before writing had become stilted and sanitized by political correctness. Perhaps it is the more honest for being what it is: a story set in a men's mental institution being run by women.<br />This book isn't really about mental institutions or old maids or the politics of the sixties or even the virtues of rebellion. It's really about power. Power to live, powerof control, power to transform and, in the end, power to escape from whatever makes us small. This theme is the skeleton. The story fleshes out the bones. In its way, it is Orwell's 1984, brought down to the level of a single institution, Big Brother replaced by Big Nurse, Winston replaced by McMurphy, and the totalitarian state replaced by the totalitarian cuckoo's nest.<br />It isn't a cheerful read. There is tragedy and loss. Some may find the book depressing. I found it inspiring. If you can step back from the characters, the setting and the plot, and look at the author's world as a coherent whole, Kesey is telling us that the Ratched's don't prevail. The cost may be painfully high, but if we are willing to pay it, we can triumph over the spiritual strangulation that Big Nurse wishes on us all.",2001-10-27

I must say, that it truly stands out from anything I had read before it, be it this summer or anytime for that matter. Ken Kesey weaves a tale that is smart, witty, sometimes insane and ultimately tragic. Though the setting is mainly in a mental asylum somewhere in Oregon, this story has a universal appeal to it that can be felt by anyone, anwhere in this world.<br />R.P. McMurphy is a sane man that, due to a brush with the law, opts for being committed in a mental asylum rather than be incarcerated with hard labor. Upon his entry in the secluded world of the asylum, he strips all the barriers formed and starts laying his own rules, in his own way. This leads to problems with the head honcho of the place. A big, gruesome, and menacingly evil Nurse Ratched, dubbed Big Nurse for her huge frame and even huger bosom. The rollercoaster, that patient McMurphy takes the inmates through, finally leads them to realize the ultimate goal. That man, no matter the situation, can always hold his destiny in his hands. This knowledge, achieved in the end, does not come without a price.<br />Set in the late 60s, early 70s, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a gem of modern literary works that came out at the time. It brought out a wonderfully-made movie, starring Jack Nicholson as McMurphy. The role defined him as an actor to be reckoned with. Though the mavie is seen through the eyes of McMurphy, the novel's perspective looks at things through the eyes of a big half white, half Native American inmate, that acts deaf and dumb in front of the asylum's staff. The narrative, because it is through the eyes of a mental patient, can at times be truly insane. That's where the fun really lies. Kesey works his magic in making us feel the insanity and despair of the patients. He can be funny, in a laugh out loud kind of fashion. He can also be tragic, when you realize what the inmates go through each passing day. The novel is a definitive treatment of the age old abode of individual versus establishment.<br />This is a very human story, with a lot of suffering and exploration of man's insecurities. It has become a classic that some schools have even recommended as part of their curriculum. Through all the ups and downs of the story, I was, forever inspired and ultimately liberated in mind to finally realize that you can take away a man's life, but never his freedom.

Nearly forty years on, with over 8 million copies sold, it has become an essential part of postwar American literature.<br />The setting: a mental hospital in Portland, Oregon, in the 1950s. The terrified, ill-treated inmates cower under the evil Nurse Ratched, who is all-seeing, all-controlling. Enter the hero, Randall Patrick McMurphy, a brawling, gambling womaniser who, as his initials suggest, is there to induce a revolution. The slowly escalating conflict is played out in a simple four-part structure, building towards an inevitable and moving climax. &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is narrated in the first person by Chief Bromden, a half-Indian thought by all to be deaf-mute, and his extended flashback of events allows Kesey to mix reality and hallucinations to brilliant effect. By presenting the mental hospital, explicitly, as a microcosm of broader society, Kesey urges us to consider our own lives in the light of the events he describes.<br />Its simple structure belies the fact that &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is a feast of allegory: of good versus evil, man versus machine, sexual freedom versus repression; of McMurphy himself as humorously subversive Christ figure, as bringer of fertility, and many more - and watch out for the white whale shorts and stuttering Billy, &quot;Faulknerian brain burning&quot;, and even some hidden rhymes at the end of part 3! <br />But spare us the half-baked Freudian interpretations which Kesey himself so roundly mocks. And pay no heed to the charges of sexism and racism levelled at Kesey's novel: his playful plotting and comic-strip characters make such criticism futile. Kesey balances it beautifully: amidst the ribald humour, there is just enough realism to keep us engrossed; and this reviewer little doubts that the systematic cruelty and dehumanisation practised by Ratched and her aides is commonplace in our prisons, mental hospitals and wherever else we lock away the &quot;undesirables&quot;. <br />Indeed, it isn't surprising to find that Kesey worked in a mental hospital before writing &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, and his acquaintances there filtered into the novel; some a little too obviously, perhaps, viz. the (originally female) &quot;Public Relations&quot; who sued Kesey in order to get her character changed. Kesey also tried out electric shock treatment firsthand, and was part of a government program testing psychoactive drugs, his experiences with LSD forming the basis of Bromden's electrifying hallucinations. Now, although Kesey himself may be pretty wacky, he has no personal experience of schizophrenia, and his portrayal of mental illness and its causes has been justly criticised as simplistic. But &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is not, primarily, meant as a contribution to psychiatric therapy, and criticism of it on these grounds is somewhat wide of the mark. We should be glad that Kesey successfully attempted a greater task: to write an anti-authoritarian novel of immense power, forcing us to question the &quot;Combine&quot; seeking to control us all.<br />Kesey's next book &quot;Sometimes A Great Notion&quot; (1964) is more subtle: a long, complex, involving tale set in an Oregon logging town. Fans of &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; should perhaps first try &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; by Tom Wolfe, in which Kesey himself challenges 1960s America with some crazy escapades of his own, thumbing his nose at authority in the same spirit, one senses, as his hero Mr McMurphy.",2001-01-30

Now I would like to go pick up another book like this and read it because it pulled me in. The understanding of this book was easy. I just kept on reading and reading this book. I think that the movie is going to be much better because it gives a visual presentation of the book. But if you already have a good imagination then you don't need the movie. If you visualize this book as you are reading it then you are in good shape because it becomes more fun and more interesting to you. Believe me, I really hate reading but this book changed that. Now I would like to start reading again and read books like this one.",2001-01-04

His views portrayed in the novel were a direct result of the era of which it was written. One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest was written in a time when the world was questioning the authority of governments and felt quite trapped by the idea that life was so easy to rule and could be thrown around however the forces that be pleased to do. Kesey's crusade for mental and spiritual freedom is metaphorically identified in the novel to his exact lifestyle and views of society.   The novel is written in a mental hospital from the view of a mental patient named Chief Bromden. The chief is a veteran of World War II and plays himself off as deaf and dumb. The patients mainly keep to themselves and do not expose their views on society and the ward itself. Nurse Ratchet is the head nurse and symbolizes all authority and government. She is the sole reason that no one in the hospital speaks their mind and are somewhat trapped. One day a stought young buck named R.P. McMurphy walked into the ward  off the street looking for an easy way out of a conviction for battery charges. As soon as he walks into the ward everything changes. His charisma and energy transforms the mental ward from what might as well been a graveyard into a ruckus of mixed opinions and outbursts towards the authority of the combine. Before McMurphy came to the ward, the patients were to scarred to speak out in fear that they would be punished. When McMurphy arrived at the ward his ways of defiance and playful conduct baffled the nurse and changed the wards view of authority. As the combine becomes more and more intolerant of McMurphy, Nurse Ratchet gives McMurphy a frontal lobotomy  and shows the combine just how in control she is.   The novel is a magnificent display of society shrunken into a small example. There are hero's and villains and the general population. The book is a fine display of 20th century literature and in my opinion taught all over the nation. To me One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest symbolized the fight between an under-powered hero and his people against one sole villain and her power of controlling the combine.  This novel is quite good but very hard  to interpret. It takes a huge amount of analogy and without it would not be close as magnificent. Prior to reading this book set aside some time so that you can fully understand it.   I strongly recommend this book for everyone to read and also strongly recommend that everybody see the movie as well. Whatever you do, do not rush read this book. Parts may even have to be read two or three times until fully understood, Even though a bit hard to understand to a younger audience the material is basic just the linguistics complex.",2001-01-01

Everything on the ward is run tight and strict by Mrs.  Ratched, until a man named McMurphy shows up to show the men how to laugh  and live again.  Kesey's story of friendship and loyalty is easily related  to everyday life.  It was a fun and interesting book to read, and it  definitely kept you awake with all of McMurphy's games and hysterical  fiascoes to upset Mrs. Ratched, and amuse the other members of the ward.   Through all of this he touches each member differently, personally, and in  their own way.  Mrs. Ratched tried to blame the death of Billy on him, but  nobody believed any of it.  They trusted McMurphy because he had helped  each of them grow so tremendously, especially Chief.  He was a completely  different person at the end of the book.  He started out so shy that people  thought he was deaf but throughout the book he opens up more and more,  first to McMurphy, who knew better than to doubt his mental or physical  strength.  Inside his rough exterior was someone with more feelings than  any of the other men, and he proves that in the book, without losing his  trouble-making image.      Kesey tells a great story about standing up for  yourself, while still being able to keep things funny at the same time.  He  also tells a story with a sad, yet understandable end.  Even though it may  have been difficult to follow while trying to translate the words and  meaning of a man from an asylum, that is what keeps the reader interested.   It was unique to see it through the eyes of Chief, rather than knowing the  whole truth from the narrator.  Sometimes the truth symbols, and hidden  meanings were complicated to find, but the story is understandable on many  levels, so the message is still revealed.",2000-09-13

On one level, we see through Big Chief's narrative, a clouded view of the world, and try to interpret his observations with the view point of a more sane person.

McMurphy is also a goldmine for a symbolism.  I don't think there is any  ambiguity that he is the hero of the novel.  He rescues the inmates.  But  we can also consider what else he is the hero of.

The first exposure I ever had to this book was my freshman year in high school.  A friend of mine found it in the library and thought it had a cool title, so he did his freshman paper on it.  I teased him,  saying that the title was childish and dumb.  But, that was six years ago.   Since then, I fell away from the &quot;essential classics&quot; that jr.  and sr. high had taught me, books like Moby Dick, which, are good, but no  16 year old will ever admit to and I picked up Jack Kerouac's &quot;On the  Road&quot;.  This one novel was what turned me on to Kessey.  I looked at  Kerouac websites and there were Kessey links, and after a year's worth of  teasing my pal about the book he'd chosen for a report, there was no way I  could've forgotten the title.  I read about Kessey, and of coarse, his bus,  Furthur, and the Acid Tests, and Neal Cassidy and all that fun stuff.  I  wondered about the book and bought it and read it.  It was no mistake.   With colorful characters like McMurphy and the Chief, a world of chronics  and acutes, Kessey unfolds a surrealistic world that mirrors modern  socioeconomic hierarchies.  You have the haves, the staff, and the have  nots, the patients.  The staff rules over the patients like a regime, and  within this hierarchy lies another like a set of Chinese toy boxes.  The  Chief's got no money, McMurphy's a gambler, the other patients don't know  that McMurphy is swindling them, and so on and so forth.

It follows the up's and downs of his journey and growing relationships with other patients in the mental ward run by the ultimate villain Nurse Ratchet or 'The Big Nurse' who enjoys using her power in her role as caregiver to employ other sadistic caregivers and to inflict pain and mental, and physical anguish on the patients who are left in her care.  I decided to read this book because I have loved the movie since my early teens, and although the characters were colorful, and the plot was one that you did not want to put down, I did find the writing style confusing and somewhat monotonous throughout the second half and towards the end of the book.  I do think however if you are interested into a look into what psychological treatment might have been like for patients during this point in history (1960's) this might be a good reference to read, or I'd recommend the movie.  As far as the novel itself its not one of my favorites but it was alright.  For me as someone with multiple psychology degrees hearing how the author chose to have the patients describe themselves, and their disorders was very interesting, and hearing how their main caregiver used therapy to manipulate them for her own means to really in a way torture then psychologically was disturbing to me and just makes me want to help people in a positive way even more.",2014-03-09

I want to be able to articulate this brilliant book in big fancy words, but I can't. It's beyond my vocabulary. It's about the man against the system, and its written so eloquently, but the eloquence hides underneath the rough, the primitive, the every day stuff that doesn't hold much sophistication. And yet, it's poetry. At times entire passages in this book made me want to reread them again and again, they were so beautiful. Have you ever read a book that seemed to send a very important message and yet when you tried articulating it to someone, no sound came out, and all you could do is just feel? Feel this cocktail of emotions you couldn't explain? That's how I feel. The story itself is simple. Some guy gets committed into an asylum and tries to fight some nurse who has established a firm grip on her ward and isn't going to suddenly change things because of one stranger. It would be too simple to describe it like this. There are so many layers here, and yet all of them are portrayed so straightforward, they left me speechless. I think more than anything this book is about the poison of unhappiness and how it can infect everything around it, crushing life to death. The poison is the nurse, and one who tried to challenge her is Randle McMurphy. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me tell you what the story is about.<br /><br />The story is told by Chief &#34;Bromden&#34;, a large man whom everyone thinks deaf and mute, whiling away his time as a committed patient in the nuthouse. Enter Randle McMurphy who pretends to be crazy to escape prison and lands himself in the same asylum. He is initially shocked at the atmosphere on the ward, the surgical cleanliness, the order, the lack of humanity in patients, who are afraid to even laugh out loud, all fisted in the firm grip of the head nurse. Randle takes it upon himself to challenge the order and bring life into the inhabitants, locking horns with the nurse, Ms. Ratched, except it's not her who is the enemy, it's the entire system of institutionalization. They engage in power struggle that gradually escalates to a heart breaking end. Along the lines, Randle manages to change the lives of those who have spent years and years thinking they couldn't toe the line chalked across the floor for them, except it comes at a price. I would say, this book accomplishes an astounding study into human psyche pigeonholed into a mechanical existence, processed and sorted and distributed like a thing, and various ways of escaping this oppression. There are, really, only a few, either to physically make a run for it, or to escape into madness, or, the most extreme solution, death, either by suicide or by succumbing to be crushed. I will be rereading this book, to pick up more layers, because I feel like I only scratched the surface and there is more, more to learn and to marvel at and to comprehend. Ken Kesey is a genius.who is the enemy, it's the entire system of institutionalization. They engage in power struggle that gradually escalates to a heart breaking end.

Where the movie shines, and where the book doesn't is in the characters.  The characters in the movie were much better than the book, they seemed stale and flat, even McMurphy and the Nurse in the book just didn't have half the impact that Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher hit you with in the movie.  In the end, what this book really needs is a serious editing, because many of the chapters just drone on and on long after the author has made his point.  He doesn't just beat the dead horse, he mangles it.

I decided to read the book for the first time and then see the movie, which I had seen years ago.  What a great read and what a great movie.  Like most book-to-movie productions, the movie lacked the depth and nuances of the book and there is a key perspective shift from the book to the movie that I won't describe (it is such a pleasure to discover the shift by reading and watching.) Differences notwithstanding, both the book and movie are classics and thoroughly enjoyable and disturbing, and the stories behind the production of both are fascinating as well.

It looks similar to some of the documents that I've run through OCR in the past.  I would have expected that before the final product was sold online for $10.99 a copy, someone would have taken the trouble to proofread it.

The narrator gives a different prospective from inside a 1960's mental institution.  Chief Boredman is a veteran at the Oregon clinic. He is the silent eyes and ears of the place. Everyone else believes that he is dumb, blind and deaf,yet he watches everything.  The ward is run by a very strict Nurse Ratched. Nobody defies her because of fear of electroshock therapy, which is looked down upon society yet still practiced in the ward. The whole dynamic of the ward changes when a gambling man named Randle McMurphy is admitted.  The first rebellion takes place when McMurphy rebels against the television schedule. After this, McMurphy encourages others to follow his lead and rebel against Nurse Ratched. The changes McMurphy makes to some paitents allow them freedom and impendence. In another case, McMurphy damages and drives one patient to a more insane state than before.  For the most part I really enjoyed this novel.  If I were to write this book I probably would have had a happier ending.  Positively thinking, it would have been a better ending if McMurphy and the patients rebelled against Nurse Ratched and won.  Also, if McMurphy didn't get drunk and fall asleep the whole plan to escape would have worked out a lot better. This is upsetting and I wish this would have worked out better in the end. I would recommend this book to people interested in psychology. A certain maturity age must also be required to enjoy this novel. This being, kids in high school will definitely appreciate One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. - s.rozycki",2010-06-01
