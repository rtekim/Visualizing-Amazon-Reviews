Anyone disappointed by this novel should try Ghost Writer, which is more compact and substantial, without so much self-indulgence in suburban philosophy.

On a certain level I understand why the book begins with the Nathanial Zuckerman, with the mystery of the Swede, with the high school reunion... I know that the novel is part of a trilogy. I understand that the opening echoes the WASPy Gatsby. And I am sure that a close study of the opening will reveal some statement on the structure of the American novel. But in the end, I do not believe that the opening--some 112 pages long--really adds to the central story. The opening of the novel creates a lens through which the narrative can be viewed. An attempt maybe to shift the reader's reading. The reader suddenly knows the narrator, the fictional writer of this story; knows something of his world, his concerns. The reader is suddenly not just reading the story as it is, but also reading the story as it might be read or understood within the world (middle class, educated, baby boomer, New Jersey, Jewish) of the fictional narrator. Interesting perhaps, but what of it? And to be perfectly honest, when the writer as character enters a work I am immediately turned off. I am just not as interested in writers as I am in \\""real\\"" characters.    I appreciated the insights, appreciated what the characters did and said. The writing was quick and smart. But I kept thinking there had to be more to the novel, that the narrative would lead someplace other than the familiar old idea that those rich white folks ain't so perfect after all.     The narrative, in the end, did deliver--sort of. It created a world in which the extremism of groups like the Weather Underground is placed in contrast to the common order of America. But there is a moment, right in the middle of the book, where the mythology of common America is shown to be no less a fallacy than the mythology of terrorist/revolutionary ideologies. The protagonist realizes this. And it really is a brilliant moment. But that is as good as it gets, and there are over 200 pages yet to go. Everything from that point forward is simply a less dramatic and less engaging restatement of this central idea. Marriage is a myth. Family is a myth. WASP history is a myth. Politics is mythology. Religion is of course a myth. The heroes (if that is what we can call them) of the book emerge as those who release themselves from the yoke of American mythologies. But they're rightous jerks in doing so.     The idea that America is the sum total of its conflicting mythologies is graphically drawn out in the novel. And it never becomes an idea driven novel.

The Swede was the hero of narrator Nathan Zuckerman's youth, the \\""household Apollo of the Weequahic [New Jersey] Jews.\\""  The Swede's blond good looks and athletic prowess became \\""the repository of all their hopes\\"" -- and allowed the neighborhood to forget the war.      To Zuckerman, the Swede had been the embodiment of the hero of his favorite childhood book, \\""The Kid From Tomkinsville.\\""  The Kid was a star ball player, a \\""modest, serious, chaste, loyal, naive, undiscourageable, hard-working, soft-spoken, courageous\\"" boy, who, in the final pages of the book, was struck down on the field and carried off inert through the mob on a stretcher.  Zuckerman had secretly viewed this story as an augur of the Swede's own life.  Zuckerman had wondered if it had occurred to the Swede \\""that if disaster could come and strike down the Kid from Tomkinsville, it could come and strike the great Swede down too?\\""    The Swede's mythic power stays with Zuckerman throughout his life.  Forty-five years later, out of the blue, the Swede contacts Zuckerman -- now a renowed writer --  and invites him to dinner, ostensibly to talk about the Swede's father.  Zuckerman accepts the invitation, but is incredibly disappointed in how the Swede has turned out.  Although he still had the face and physique of a God, the Swede seems to be almost unbearably bland -- every word from his mouth is good natured and unobjectionable.      Zuckerman sadly concludes that the Swede has turned out to be \\""the embodiment of nothing,\\"" but soon finds out that his assessment of the Swede is wrong.  A few months after the dinner, Zuckerman runs into the Swede's younger brother Jerry at their forty-five-year high school reunion. Jerry reveals that an unbelievable, unthinkable tragedy had befallen the Swede twenty-five years before, and the horror of that eventhad destroyed the Swede's life.      For the rest of the book, Zuckerman explores \\""the brutality of the destruction of this indestructible man.\\""  Zuckerman imagines the Swede's internal life over the course of a half-century.  The Swede's story unfolds in a spiralling structure that goes back and forth through time, as the Swede obsessively tries to make sense of the inexplicable.    Through the Swede's ruminations, Roth explores incredibly weighty themes: a parent's love for a child, the nature of perfection, the randomness of life, the delusion of control and moderation, and the helplessness and hopelessness of trying to figure out why things are. Most of all, Roth seems to struggle with the notion that there cannot be depth without suffering, and that without that depth, life would be meaningless.  You get the feeling that Roth wishes he could appreciate the ordinary guy -- the bland, honorable, decent people who live their lives with relative equilibrium.  Roth seems to regret that it is only the Swede's tragedy that makes him interesting, and that it is only in imagining the Swede's excrutiating pain that Roth can identify with him.    Overall, the book's tone is intense and dark, but there are moments of humor that are funnier than just about anything I've ever read.  Roth's description of the Valentine's gift that the fifteen-year-old Jerry makes for his secret crush had me laughing for days.",2006-11-19

Apparently this is true of people and books as well.   Since starting this wonderful, passionate, infuriating novel, I have often returned to the same page, the same paragraph rereading what serves as the thematic statement of the novel.<br />&quot;You fight your superficiality, your shallownes, so as to try and come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogacnce...take them on with an open mind, as equals man to man, as we used to say, and yet you never fail to get them wrong.&quot; <br />There it is, simple and straight forward.  Phillip Roth is a very giving novelist.  He states his point.  Not just once, but again and again he echos this sentiment.  And still people never fail to get this book wrong.<br />The superficiality is to take this book as the tale of the Swede's tragic undoing.  Or to take it as a recounting of Merry's misguided rebellion.  Or even of Nathan Zuckerman's obsessions.  This is a book about how the self is infinitely unknowable. How one can never truly understand oneself, much less others.  What makes this novel so brilliant, in my humble opinion, is not simply the very true message the book carries. In the hands of a lesser writer, this could come off as a platitude, a cliche, so overstated as to become meaningless.  Instead, Roth gives you a collection of dazzilingly complicated characters, beyond simple definition, only knowable through the words of themselves or others, but unknowable all the time.  <br />One reader complained of being frustrated with not knowing whether this was truly the story of the Swede, or a fiction of Zuckerman's mind.  And to that I say, that is the point.  We can't know the Swede except through the fiction we create in our own mind, our attempt at understanding that is always a little fiction, a little wrong.<br />One person accused Roth of overwriting.  no doubt, they had in mind the long passages detailing the making of gloves in dazzling overspun details.  To that I say, this is absoluetley necessary to the structure of the novel.  That these trivialities occupy so much of our time and our lives.  That superficiality and depth know no difference in the swamp of our mind or our estimation of people.  Swede, the man judged to be just a father and a business man, a normal people, a collection of surface details.  How could a responsible writer leave all of that out?<br />This book, engaging and complex, is what all great literature should be, a life in and of itself.

A star athlete in his college days, owner of a successful glove-making factory, married to a former Miss New Jersey, and living in the big country house he always dreamed of, he is the embodiment of the 1950s American Dream. And specifically, the immigrant dream - Swede is third generation Jewish-American, each generation having become a little more successful, a little less Jewish, better educated, more assimilated, more American. And why shouldn't that progression continue with the fourth generation, Swede's daughter Merry? Born to every advantage, cosseted and loved, what causes this girl to become involved with the anti-Vietnam War movement and, aged 16, bomb the village store and, in passing, kill a local doctor? This is the question that torments Swede during all the long years that Merry is on the run.<br /><br />The story is told by Roth's alter-ego, Nathan Zuckerman, who appears in several of his novels. In this one, Zuckerman was at school in Roth's old hunting grounds of Newark with the Swede's younger brother at the time when the Swede was winning glory on the football and baseball fields. To the young Nathan, he was a hero whose sporting skills lifted the morale of the community in the final years of WW2, and who was living proof that success was attainable for anyone from any background in the great meritocracy of the US. It's only after the Swede's death in the present day (late 1990s) that Zuckerman hears the story of Merry and the bombing. So the reader knows from the beginning that the story Zuckerman tells is not in fact 'true', except for the barest of bones, but instead Zuckerman's imagining of it. The struggle to make sense of it all is in fact Zuckerman's rather than the Swede's. As a result, neither Swede nor Merry are fully real, not even in the fictional sense of that word. They are representations - Swede of the '50s and Merry of the '60s. Though that in itself is too simplistic, since Merry actually represents the most extreme aspects of the '60s - the ones that leave Swede (i.e. Zuckerman) baffled and horrified.<br /><br />Zuckerman talks of the Swede as 'bland', an 'incognito', a 'human platitude'. He is stuck in his '50s rut, a man so pleased with his life that he can't see beyond its boundaries. His reaction to the race riots in Newark is one of incomprehension - it has never occurred to him to try to see the world through other people's eyes, or to consider that the path to success might not be as easy for others as for him. He assumes his values are right and therefore shared by everyone. When Merry plants her bomb, she doesn't just destroy the village post office, she smashes the smug certainties of Swede's world and, by extension, destroys the '50s American Dream he epitomises.<br /><br />Merry exists not as herself, but only as Swede's idea of her, and as a result her motivations are as incomprehensible to the reader as to her father. At first she appears as the idealised child he adores and later as the object of his anguish and bewilderment. She comes to represent everything Swede doesn't understand about this new generation: who look outwards rather than in, who are contemptuous of the values of their parents, who get enraged about things that don't directly affect them, who think the political system has failed them, and some of whom resort to violence to achieve their political aims. As she grows into adolescence and then adulthood, she turns into a monster, almost feral in her rage against everything Swede holds dear - especially the America that he loves. And when Swede finally finds her again, many years later, she has transformed into something so disgusting in his eyes that she appears barely human. And his tragedy is that still he loves her.<br /><br />The writing is superb - Roth at the very top of his game. Scalpel-like as he performs his dissection of this man, but filled with emotional power as he describes the Swede's feelings of grief and despair. Beyond the two I've concentrated on, there is a whole cast of characters, each one carefully crafted to fill out Swede's world. Dawn, his wife, desperate not to be forever pigeon-holed as a former beauty queen, but finding in the end that her beauty is a shield she can hide behind when her world collapses. Swede's father, venting his anger and frustration at the world that made his grand-daughter into a monster. And the ambiguous Rita Cohen, the revolutionary friend of Merry who tortures and taunts the Swede, playing on the vulnerability of his desperate love for his daughter, using sex as an ugly weapon in her desire to humiliate.<br /><br />The descriptive writing is just as strong. Swede's pride in his business is shown through the lovingly detailed descriptions of every aspect of the glove-making process, from selection of the skins through the stretching and cutting to sewing and fitting. This is a place where craftspeople reverently produce items of beauty and quality for a world in which women still keep a glove drawer, with different shades and lengths to match each outfit - a '50s style that also faded as the '60s progressed, with Jackie Kennedy being perhaps the last great glove-wearing icon.<br /><br />This is an astounding book, well worthy of the Pulitzer it won in 1998. There's enough realism in it to read it simply as a powerful and often deeply moving story of parental love and despair, but it's true power is in Roth's depiction of the massive culture shift that happened somewhere in the sixties, the rebellion of child against parent, youth against authority, citizen against state. And, fairly uniquely, we're seeing it not from the perspective of the young looking back either with indulgence or anger at the past, but from the point of view of that past, that portion of society who saw the future unfold in ways they couldn't understand, their values rejected by the children they had nurtured, their dreams crashing around them.espair.

The story is that of an immigrant who comes to America and starts up a tannery business in the industrial area of New Jersey. This is dirty smelly unpleasant work be he prospers. There are two sons - the elder  a handsome sporting hearing at the Jewish school, a the younger son who is quiet and thoughtful and ambitious to excel in a profession and becomes a specialist physician. The elder son decides to take over the family tanning business, and becomes successful, changing it to be a processor of fine leather which he makes into expensive gloves. He marries a glamorous Miss New Jersey. However she is from a Catholic family who oppose the marriage to no avail. However the comfortable life of a wealthy business man is shattered when his eldest daughter becomes involved in a fanatical sect in her teenage years. She bombs the local post office, kills the local doctor who was  accidently nearby then disappears. The father then hears that she is in New York with the sect and eventually is tracked down and found. However the reunion was very fragile and the novel finishes with a dramatic finish.<br />The novel is well written with a strong narrative, but I felt that there was too much rambling on about seemingly irrelevant detail about the social life of the community and the group of families with which they associated.

This one is his masterpiece. It is one of the great books of the last century. It is a story about the perception and reality of happiness and success.<br /><br />The hero, Seymour Levov, is the son of a successful glove maker in Newark, New Jersey. It starts at the end of the 2nd World War. Seymour is fair haired and blue eyed, the greatest athlete in the history of his high school. Nicknamed &#34;The Swede&#34; he is a legend in his community. He is almost too perfect to be true. He sets every record, joins the marines and, when he is discharged, marries the stunningly beautiful Miss New Jersey. He goes on to take over the management of his father’s business, makes a fortune, buys an historic home in the country, and hobnobs with the Yankee bluebloods of New Jersey.<br /><br />Our narrator, Nathan Zuckerman, was friends with the Swede’s brother. He meets the brother at their 45th high school reunion and mentions that he had lunch with the Swede. Zuckerman goes on to tell the brother that the Swede was everyone’s idol. The brother just laughs. “I’m here because I just came from my brother’s funeral. He had a horrible life.&#34;<br /><br />Thus starts the tale.<br /><br />At the age of 16 The Swede’s incredibly obnoxious teenage daughter, Merry, blows up a post office in their small town as a protest to the war in Viet Nam. The explosion kills a small shop owner. Merry goes underground and continues her terrorist ways, setting off three other bombs and killing a total of four people. But appearance have to be maintained. How does a perfect family deal with this? How do they explain to their own families and friends that it is not their fault? How do they reconcile the fact that their daughter has insisted for years that her parents and the values they represent are the root cause of all the suffering in the world? Why is it wrong to work hard, to succeed and prosper, and then try to makethe world a better place?<br /><br />The factory falls into disrepair because The Swede cannot get or keep the skilled craftsmen he needs. Newark becomes a violent, lawless husk. His marriage falls apart. At the end of the book the Swede discovers that his perfect wife is having an affair with one of the local WASPs. The daughter returns. She has embraced some manic eastern religion whereby it is forbidden to eat or bath. The family is destroyed.<br /><br />This perfect man is vilified by his daughter and her proxy, Rita Cohen. These are easily two of the most obnoxious characters in fiction. The lovely Rita toys with the Swede saying that she will arrange meetings between himself and Merry if only he gives her money or sex. And through it all she viciously mocks everything the Swede stands for.<br /><br />What the Swede stands for is the question. Is it wrong to work hard, to be successful, and to want those things that we believe will make us happy?<br /><br />It is a story of the fifties and the sixties. The rhetoric is shrill but insistent. I found it a tough book to read because the Swede’s questions are, in many ways, my questions.",2013-01-18
