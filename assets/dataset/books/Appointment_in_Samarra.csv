If any one of these authors was ever important to you, please pick up O'Hara.  He's critical to understanding twentieth century American authors.  At the very least, you can engage in the unending debate on whether he's worthy of joining this pantheon of writers.  Worthy of an airport paperback rack?  Smalltime trashy romance writer?  Or do you think he paints a richly textured canvas of an America and its high society about to be turn the corner on the first half of the 20th century?  An important Irish-Catholic writer?<br />My tip:  read this book.  If nothing else you'll learn about  bituminous and anthracitic coal, the United Mine Workers, how to mix a martini, (and throw one), why fraternities were ever important, and what a flivver was.  It's certainly a period piece, and O'Hara does not hold back with the language of the jazz age...which may confuse modern readers (it was a gay party, his chains dropped a link, etc.) In fact, O'Hara was an early adopter of using slang and vernacular in writing the spoken word, and you can be the judge of whether or not he gets an Irish mobster's (or a \\"high hat's\\") tone correctly.<br />He's really at his best with character development, because Julian English (our protaganist) is our bigoted confidante, our tiresome spouse, our wretched boss, our surly neighbor, our spoiled college-boy brat, our pretentious friend and our preening big man about town all in one.  O'Hara waltzes us through Julian's  demise and we root for him, for one more chance, all the way down.	2002-10-16

The depression era setting and dialogue seem dated now, and the characters and plot are not very interesting. If you like lyrical writing, this comes off as flat. It probably belongs in the potboiler category sold at airport bookstores rather than on Random House's top 100 list. If you want to read about a small town, read Main Street.	2002-07-26

A man, trapped into a rigid social order, bursts out uncontrollably.  Amazingly, this novel focuses on modern themes that still exist today, despite being written seventy years ago.  <br />One man, going to dances and social clubs, trying to keep his community standing in tact, maintaining his marriage, just couldn't take it anymore.  A simple thing like disliking a man's story later tears his life apart.  Such a simple constrained life blew up like a high-pressure balloon. <br />While not a story with action or a plot, it is a literary device that portrays the upper-middle class life at that time.  It's a nice timepiece and gives the reader a sense of living that life.  A typical small Depression era American town with a country club and speak easy.  <br />It's a suprisingly quick and easy read, with a good description of life, and an opening for social interests.  Unfortunately, it doesn't captivate readers like many other literary masterpieces.	2002-02-18

Lawrence, if you care to think of it in those terms. Not only do I recommend the book for its social insight into the club-set of the 1930's (like Fitzgerald,) but I also recommend it for its brutal honesty. O'Hara, like D.H. Lawrence, could take any character, a woman, a man, a priest, an alcoholic, and tell you what they would do, why they would do it, and what they would *think* while doing it. We know the lies that they tell themselves, simply because O'Hara knows them and would never let the character get away with lying to his readers. He knows the ins and outs of every kind of mind. In effect, we feel the jealousy, anxiety, anger, and hopelessness of a great range of people.<br />This book is excellent for those readers who are a little weary of carefully non-offensive works. Prepare for some 200 pages of frank sexual discussion, *real* mental insight, and a story that ends the way it would in real-life.	2001-12-12

I was led to read it by an article in the Atlantic Monthly that lamented the pretentiousness of much of contemporary writing.  Not only is the writing pretentious, but it doesnt say anything intelligible.  Appointment in Sammara, by contrast, tells a story in a direct manner while still revealing to us hidden truths about the human spirit.   Its not giving anything away to say that the story concerns the self-destruction of one Julian English.  Julian is suave, Protestant, lives in the finest neighborhood, and hangs out with the in crowd.  But Julian makes the mistake of throwing his drink into the face of a powerful, nouveau riche Irish Catholic. Suddenly, Julians support structures dont seem so firm. Julians descent is heart breaking because, although he is not an especially likeable person, John OHara still manages to make us care for him.  OHaras book was prophetic in that it portrays the end of WASP domination in America.  The book takes place in 1930 and was published in 1934  just six years after the Catholic Al Smith was denied the presidency by a virulent anti-Catholic backlash led, in part, by the Klan.  We're told that some of the locals in Pottsville are members of the the Klan. Twenty-six years later, in 1960, an Irish Catholic would be elected president.   Appointment in Samarra is a must read for those who are serious about the American novel.	2001-08-15

The title comes from a tale attributed to Somerset Maugham (reprinted just in front of the first page of my edition).  As story goes, the servant of a merchant in Baghdad sees Death in the marketplace, is sure she's coming for him, and asks permission to go hide from her in the town of Samarra.  The merchant agrees, but then goes to the marketplace himself to have some words with Death about how she treated his servant.  (I wish I had a boss like that!)  Death denies having threatened the man, \\"I was astonished to see him in Baghdad, for I had an appointment with him tonight in Samarra.\\"<br />From the very beginning, then, we know that the novel concerns someone with an inevitable appointment with Death which he/she cannot escape.  Within a few pages, we even know who.  Only the particulars remain - or so it would seem.<br />Julian English does make his appointment with Death, but the author deliberately destroys the impression of inevitability he spent most of the novel creating.  Up to the very end, we believe that Julian's impulsive act of throwing a drink into the face of Harry Reilly, his most important creditor, sealed his fate.  We, together with Julian, believe that his alienating Reilly leads inevitably to Julian's financial ruin, and, seeing no way out, Julian commits a series of ever more self-destructive acts culminating in his suicide.<br />And then we learn that Harry Reilly attached no significance to the thrown drink and that he liked Julian all along.  Julian's death was not inevitable after all.  Also, far from trying to flee his fate, Julian rushes headlong into it, leading one to conclude that Julian isn't the one with the appointment in Samarra after all.<br />At first that seems absurd - Julian is the central character of the novel, after all.  But Julian isn't actually the center of the novel - the people of Gibbsville are.  We learn all about the state of Gibbsville in 1930, meeting about fifty different characters from all walks of life - incredible in such a short (240 pages) novel.  O'Hara's has no sympathy for the upper classes, and he depicts their society as decadent, corrupt and declining - people who try to pretend that nothing has happened despite the Crash of 1929 and the loss of the coal market, even as a new generation of entrepreneurs like Harry Reilly displaces them.  They don't deserve the fine things they have, nor will they keep them much longer<br />O'Hara shows his real sympathies in the short segments about Luther L. Fleigler and his wife at the beginning and ending of the book.

It takes place in a town called Gibbsville (actually O'Hara's hometown of Pottsville), located on the edge of the coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania, during the Christmas weekend of 1930.  <br />Julian English, president of the local Cadillac dealership, and his wife Caroline are among the town's leading young socialites, with a large circle of influential and prosperous friends.  During a fateful forty-eight hours over this festive weekend of excessive drinking, Julian makes three foolish mistakes which send him spiraling to his destruction.  At a Christmas Eve party, he becomes irritated by the longwinded Harry Reilly and throws a drink in his face.  The assembled throng is shocked; Reilly is not only one of the town's wealthiest citizens, but also happens to own Julian's dealership.  The next night, at another party with his wife in attendance, Julian again causes a stir by making a move on the girlfriend of a local mobster.  He makes his third mistake at lunch the next day when he gets into a fight with Caroline's cousin over the previous night's transgression.  Combined with the stress of meeting his financial responsibilities at the dealership, he can feel the walls quickly closing in, and there is only one way out.  <br />Julian is an overgrown frat boy.  He has the best of everything in his life -- a beautiful wife, a good job, popularity, a good education -- but he is tragically compelled to do all the wrong things and burn his bridges, possibly due to an underlying sense of low self-esteem and shame.  Reading this novel is like watching an impending car accident -- you can't resist observing the impact, even though you know it's going to be brutal.	2001-03-12

Just as Scarlett O'Hara instantly brings to mind a well-defined personality, so does Julian.  O'Hara (John, that is) is that good.  His eye and ear for time and place are uncanny.  I can see and hear the characters in their surroundings, like seeing a movie and reading a book at the same time.<br />&quot;Appointment&quot; is inevitable from the time Julian throws a drink in the face of the town's leading businessman.  Its tone is elegiac as in a Greek tragedy.  I always think of Caroline English as the Chorus.  She sees the path Julian is on, but there is nothing she can do or say to change a step he takes. I don't think there is a word wasted in the entire novel.<br />O'Hara still has not been quite forgiven for being too successful in his own lifetime.  His sin is that he is too readable, too good a storyteller and; therefore, his books sold like hotcakes.  He had the temperament of a wounded grizzly bear which alienated almost every friend he had.  I believe he will find his way back to his reader's affections; he writes too well to be ignored.	2000-12-17

For the first hundred pages I was unsure that O'Hara was even a competent writer, nevermind author of one of the century's great novels. His narrative technique and dialogue both are steeped in the jargon of his heyday, Prohibition Era, small town America. But O'Hara deals with big themes and the idiom of his day becomes secondary. He seems to want to take on big questions: why is the moth so driven to the flame? Why do we so willingly capitulate to baser instincts? Why can't we be satisfied, even happy with what we have? Why are we so often driven for more? More of what? At what price? Why are human beings insatiable? Julian English is an affluent man in his early thirties with a going business, a beautiful wife, Caroline, and social status in Gibbsville, a small town north and west of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania Dutch Country. His alcoholic habits drive him to dismantle every important social relationship in his life until he becomes essentially a social misfit, incapable of decent behavior among his family, friends, peers and colleagues. He seems determined to keep an appointment with death and has a death wish entombed in his heart. O'Hara's brief experimental flights with stream of consciousness propel us into the inner depths of his characters where we can feel their agony. His treatment of big themes with such a natural voice sets O'Hara apart. Be sure to experience this one of a kind American literary voice.	2000-10-06

O'Hara famously called Hemingway the greatest writer since Shakespeare. But O'Hara once said he never read Tolstoy. How can you call a writer the greatest since Shakespeare when you've never read Tolstoy? O'Hara mainly read Fitzgerald and Hemingway over and over, and I think his work suffers for his not have read more broadly. &quot;Appointment in Samara&quot; is very good at contrasting status--something O'Hara was obsessed with--in an American town.  But I find O'Hara's dialogue--that he gets so much praise for--dated. Whereas Hemingway's dialogue in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;--written BEFORE &quot;Samarra&quot;--does not look dated at all now. O'Hara famously wrote his fiction quickly. It has that feel to it in spots. In the 90's there was an attempt at an O'Hara revival. Well, that revival fell flat. I can see why it did fall flat. He wasn't that terrific a writer. But, this book is pretty good. (I don't understand the last passage of this book, that conversation. Who are those people talking, and what's the point of it?)	2000-10-01

While much of this book is excellent, its flaws are jarringly obvious. There are plot holes galore, characters  who inexplicably appear and then are never heard from again, and so much  detail that it just boggles the mind. I suspect that when O'Hara sat down  to write this book, he just started typing whatever came to his mind, and  without consideration for structure, grammar, or punctuation. After he was  finished, he sent it off to his publisher and no one, including O'Hara,  knew how to edit it. I've read several of his short stories and they  suffered from these same flaws. He is, however, a matchless winner when it  comes to writing dialogue; all of his characters are distinctly real in the  way they talk. Alas, sometimes, I wonder what ever happened to John O'Hara;  he was one of the literary lights of the first half of this century, but he  is largely forgotten today.	2000-03-17
