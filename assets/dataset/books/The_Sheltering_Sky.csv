I don't even remember why I bought it, or why I started reading it, and in truth, I read it (the first time) very slowly for the first 100 pages or so before I caught on to what it was saying.  You can read other reviews on here that focus more on the plot, and they're true enough - this does tell the story of three Americans, who may be sort of &#34;shallow&#34; (as many reviews describe them, although perhaps a better word is &#34;naive&#34;... although &#34;shallow&#34; isn't wrong) wandering through the edges of the horn of Africa after the end of WWII.  There is too much emphasis on sorting out the &#34;what,&#34; however - the plot details are important but they're just the beginning.  What are Port and Kat, the central characters, looking for?  Why are they traveling?  The characters themselves might not be able to really tell you, except that when they more or less wish to shed their bourgeois American values, the Sheltering Sky becomes the greatest story ever written about being careful what you wish for.  Some reviewers on here have also focused on the similarity of the book to many of Bowles' short stories, and thematically it's true - his short stories condense the book's theme neatly (one story, &#34;Tampiana,&#34; probably described it best: &#34;What is freedom in the last analysis, other than  the state of being totally, instead of partially, subject to the tyranny of chance?&#34;).  But The Sheltering Sky's dark, wounding secret is that the events themselves are just the pretext for a journey into the depth of self and the darkness of the human condition, even from two characters accurately described as &#34;shallow.&#34;  It's written with the simplicity of of a Hemingway novel merged with the dark poetry of William S. Burroughs (who himself became an acolyte of the novel), and manages to become a kind of exorcism of the madness within.  I hesitate to go more into depth about that idea, as discovering and ruminating over the power of the novel was the best part of my experience in reading it - like the greatest novels, it altered my consciousness, and I've spent the years since reading it the first time dying to have others to talk to about it.

While death exists for most of us in the realm of &#34;not yet,&#34; most people feel the press of it in quiet moments, when we are no longer able to distract ourselves.  What happens when we strip away consciousness--that intricate web of neurons and circumstance woven into the picture of a self?  What is left over?  Bowles shows us these moments where the lack of consciousness and language threaten to reduce human beings to something less than what we presume to be--in particular Kit's time in the desert, and Port's illness.  An illustrative passage of the soul-weariness Bowles's characters undergo so far from home:<br /><br />“When I was young” … “Before I was twenty, I mean, I used to think that life was a thing that kept gaining impetus, it would get richer and deeper each year. You kept learning more, getting wiser, having more insight, going further into the truth” – she hesitated.<br /><br />Port laughed abruptly. – “And now you know it’s not like that. Right? It’s more like smoking a cigarette. The first few puffs it tasted wonderful, and you don’t even think of its ever being used up. Then you begin taking it for granted. Suddenly you realize it’s nearly burned down to the end. And then’s when you’re conscious of the bitter taste.”<br /><br />Paul Bowles was the type of writer who understood what it meant to kill his hero halfway through the book.  He also knew exactly how to do it: with masterful aplomb.  What is so powerful about this shift in focalization is that it breaks the lie of fiction: that if a character survives to the end of a book, then they never die.  Bowles shifts so fluidly from Port's delirium, to Kit gazing on Port's corpse that even we as readers begin to understand that we are not life's focal point anymore than the Earth is the center of the universe.

The Sheltering Sky is his generally acknowledged masterpiece, a book often cited on &#34;Best Novels of the 20th Century&#34; lists.<br /><br />Briefly, it is the story of Port and Kit Moresby, two very self-centered (and, frankly, pretty dim) Americans traveling in North Africa just after the end of the Second World War (the book was published in 1949). The novel vaguely adapt's Bowles' acclaimed earlier short story &#34;A Distant Episode&#34; into the narrative in both its opening and closing chapters, first with one American character and then with the other, though the resolution in each case is different. All three (including the short story version) show a naive Westerner coming into contact with the natives of the region, with consequences ranging from tragic to near-tragic.<br /><br />For a reader in the early 21st century, there is an additional fascination in the depiction of native Arabic culture just before the rise of Arab nationalism and, later, Islamism. Religion doesn't seem to be a big issue as the Westerners swill alcohol with abandon at practically every stop and Kit doesn't seem to get any grief for prancing around in Western duds, at least not until she takes it too far. On the other hand, there is a hint of things to come as one minor Jewish character mentions how he is routinely disparaged by the Moslem natives even though they do business with him (The Sheltering Sky was published just after the founding of Israel and the first Arab-Israeli War).<br /><br />I very much liked this book and the portrait drawn of two very shallow people (three if you count their hanger-on Tunner) who are in a situation way past their capacities, though they are not bright or self-aware enough to realize it until it's too late. Each is perpetually going into extended narcissistic self-explorations while outwardly they continue a sham of a marriage and, at least in Port's case, a totally undeserved self-perception of savvy worldliness. Port in fact is so savvy about traveling that he skips getting the recommended inoculations against native diseases, while Kit decides that it's a perfectly great idea for a woman alone to hitch a ride on a caravan traveling into the sticks. Both get what's coming to them and I can't say that I felt particularly sorry.<br /><br />The Sheltering Sky was Bowles' first novel and I am very tempted to seek out his other ones (Let It Comes Down, The Spider's House, Up Above the World) on the strength of this one.",2013-12-04

Married twelve years but staying in separate bedrooms, the Moresbys travel to Morocco with another American named Tunner, a single man enamored with their spontaneous style (and possibly with Kit).  This threesome and the Lyles, a mother and son from Australia, are uniformly self-centered, superficial, spoiled, ignorant, and insensitive, and Bowles's level of detail in showing the Lyles' cringe-worthy lack of respect for the local culture through their insulting dialogue suggests that he has overheard dialogue like this more than once during his two years as an expatriate in Tangier.<br /><br />Eventually, Port and Kit decide to travel together, hoping, belatedly, to revitalize their marriage.  Both are so self-absorbed, however, that improvement seems unlikely, especially since Kit suffers from personal \\""terrors\\"", and Port, a nervous man to start with, begins to wake up from nightmares, sobbing in bed.

When Port becomes ill with typhoid on his way to a town that has shut down because of a meningitis outbreak, he and Kit find a primitive place to stay so Kit  can be nursemaid to the seriously ill Port. \\""I'm very sick,\\"" he confesses. \\""I don't know whether I'll come back.\\"" Kit, however, gets tired of nursing and leaves him alone in the room, seriously ill, for hours.

Thus I picked up 'The Sheltering Sky' without any idea what it was about. I struggled through about half of its horrible content before deciding to flip it over and read the blurb to see if anything would ever develop. And according to the jacket blurb, this is a book about \\""Americans' incomprehension of alien cultures\\"" and how that \\""leads to the ultimate destruction of those cultures\\"". And right there you have, in one pretentious, smug sentence, a summation of the stupidity of this novel.<br /><br />First, that is decidedly not what the book is about. The American characters are not the only non-natives in the novel, and they certainly aren't the most uncomprehending. The only non-native characters in the book are the main characters (three Americans), a pair of horrible traveling English people, and the colonial locals. And of this set, the American characters - while incredibly self-absorbed and tiresome - definitely come out the best. They are even the most admired in the story. We are repeatedly told how local characters enjoy their company or find them fascinating or are attracted to them.<br /><br />Second, the actions of the main characters have aboslutely no cultural impact, because they're just shallow nobodies. They stumble about and whine about the horrible conditions and engage in pedantic bits of juvenile philosophical dialog and monolog, but they affect nobody around them.<br /><br />Third, the journey they take and Bowles' interminable description of their journeys and inner thoughts are completely unremarkable, except in the stunning tone-deafness of the prose and bizarrely inhuman ways in which the characters act and react. The end of the novel in particular is quite laughable; to accept it as plausible one has to have the most ridiculous, early-20th-century chauvinistic 'literary' preconception of a female.<br /><br />So what is the story really about? In a nutshell: three Americans decide to slum around Saharan Africa. Two of them, Port and Kit, pretend to be married (many claim they are actually married but this is not specifically stated, and it is repeatedly hinted that they are simply saying they are married to avoid any questions about cohabitation). The other, Tunner, is their caddish friend who secretly wants to conquer Kit. Incidentally, the ridiculous names should perhaps be a hint as to what's in store. They travel together for a while and have empty conversations. Then Tunner seduces Kit while she's drunk. Kit doesn't tell Port, but they work together to divert Tunner so Port and Kit can be alone. Then Port's passport is stolen (by one of the English couple) and Port gets typhoid. It takes him forever to die. Tunner comes to meet them right as Port dies, and Kit goes insane and walks off into the desert. Tunner waits for her to return. The last third of the novel describes Kit being abducted by desert nomads and repeatedly sexually assaulted until she can escape.<br /><br />And that's it. It's nothing like the back summary (which sounds like the kind of thing book club members say to each other while nodding approvingly). In fact, if anything it's exactly the opposite: Bowles' entire point seemed to be that the desert, and its people, are permanent and enduring; those who come to conquer or even partake of its beauty go unnoticed and may not make it out alive. It's hubristic to think our mere existence is 'destroying cultures'. Unfortunately even this point is presented in such an incompetent fashion that it's just not worth the trouble.<br /><br />There is precisely one good quote from the book, and Brandon Lee knew it by heart. Just search for that, save yourself the trouble of reading it.",2012-03-16

They appear to have little emotional bond with each other and no connection to the exotic land and culture through which they move. Initially, I kept reading this book hoping for redemption - imagining that the alien environment in which the characters found themselves might somehow force them closer to each other.   There is no redemption. There is no hope. As my sense of foreboding grew stronger, I was increasingly tempted to put the book down. It is testament, at least, to Paul Bowles writing that his story was engaging enough to keep me reading through to the desolate final pages. We all know that the sky cannot shelter - it exposes people. Bowles attempts to do this, delving at length into the inner thoughts of his main characters. Unfortunately, all of this wordy introspection makes the characters seem self obsessed. The reader desperately wishes that they would just, for a moment, turn their gazes away from their belly buttons and see the people around them. They lack any grip on reality. They appear to have nothing to fall back on - no relationships, no beliefs, no community, no truth. To them, Northern Africa is not a land of real people, food, culture and languages - it is merely the backdrop to their personal existential crises.   The journey that Kit takes in the second half of the book does not ring true. It is perhaps too easy to attribute this to the fact that the author is a male, but I suspect it might be the case. Kit did not appear to want to be in Northern Africa. If anything could shake her out of her introspection and send her back to her homeland, surely it would be her husband's exit. Instead, she embarks on a journey alone into the desert that has consequences which for most females would be deeply traumatic, but which she seems to invite and at times even enjoy. It is deeply unsettling to read and ultimately I could not accept the way her character was crafted by Bowles. Perhaps this is what he wanted - seemingly happy to destroy the relationships between his characters and the characters themselves, perhaaps he is content also to break any bond with his readers.",2011-10-18

Bowles' descriptions of foreign environments are exquisite in terms of telling detail and psychological intent.  His dialogue is sophisticated and profound, leaving the reader with the impression of human complexity, even if his protagonists lack emotional depth.  The plot, slow in parts, and elaborate in attempt, moves like a caravan through the vast regions of the diaspora with a subtlety that resonates, suggesting the wayward, crippling tendencies of people who lack faith in the world or themselves. Drifting aimlessly in search of diversion from anxiety and propelled into the outer reaches of civilization by a sense of personal emptiness and desire for novelty, Kit and Port Moresby are incapable of human intimacy.  These are despairing, damaged people whose intelligence and education have convinced them of their superiority.  Yet Bowles is quick to point out that their existential dilemma is the inevitable fate of all who cannot, for whatever reason, shoulder their fates in the modern world.  Thus are Bowles' protagonists destined to wreak discord among their compatriots because they lack the psychological tools to understand their fellow man.  They retreat from relationships rather than grow through them.  There are no heroes in Bowles' book, no caring, empathic people on whom one would pin his hopes for civilization and humanity; there are only parasites of a disillusioned modernity, yet the less civilized natives dwelling in the extremities of the Sahara also exhibit little understanding of their fellow man.<br /><br />The book centers on Kit and Port, a young, bored couple of means who ostensibly set off for Africa to divert themselves from the stalemate of their marriage.  They book separate rooms, treat each other with civility and feigned concern, but neither cherishes the other or is particularly affectionate or caring.  Instead each attempts to reassure himself/herself that the other is worthy of allegiance.  Kit has an affair and then is remorseful, Port lapses into sexual indulgence with a woman procured for him on one of his many excursions without his wife.  While Kit sees Port as her safe harbor (\\""port\\""), she cannot love him; meanwhile he is forever seeking her approval, as if her respect defines his identity.  Both are critical of others, particularly their friend Tunner, who has accompanied them on the trip - a man of singularly simple motives and predictability.  They scorn him as they do another couple they befriend, for a lack of intellectuality and seeming vulgarity.  Yet these people have somehow accommodated the world into a schematic from which they can make their lives work, whereas Kit and Port cannot \\""squeeze the universe into a ball\\"" and assume the responsibility necessary to function in a world where choices and action are required, not escape and endless brooding.  Because they cannot fall back on any beliefs that justify their tired lives, they continue to wallow in their despair until their poor choices and lack of action result in self-destruction.  Port, for one, seems to harbor a death wish: In a particularly depressive incident, he dreams of \\""blood\\"" and \\""excrement\\"" and concludes that he must \\""reach out, pierce the fine fabric of the sheltering sky, take repose.\\""  At that defining moment, he realizes that he is relieved to acknowledge a lack of meaning in life and love.  The interminable choices no longer have to be made if one gives up caring and submits to his fate.<br /><br />The book is about boredom.  The couple is bored with their marriage.  They are bored with their lives and what each sees as his own failed choices.  Kit focuses on her stylish clothes and the mask of her carefully made up face and superficial beauty.  Port takes refuge in a Hemingway notion of manhood by taking care of their travel arrangements and seeking out voyeuristic thrills in the creepy outbacks of the Arab world, flirting with danger which allows him some refuge from his doubts about his masculinity.  Yet when he returns from his adventures, he seeks out his wife for reassurance.  Port is a fearful man, one who would be a hero or at least a man of art and literature, but he is ridden with a million little fears, fears about what he really is in the enigma of life.  It is this failure to understand life, despite his constant pondering, that not only dooms him, but increases his anxieties to the point that they dominate his vision.  No one understands life, but some have faith that it has some kind of coherence, like the Arab couple to whom Kit eventually turns for refuge.<br /><br />Thematically, what is most important in this book is implied in the title's metaphor and evident in the plot.  Although as one reviewer pointed out, the characters are not definitively revealed, it is their very lack of development that not only relegates them to lives of entitlement, complacency and superficiality, but also makes apparent the reasons for the malaise of much of contemporary society.  Whether you view their underlying anxiety and its concomitant traits of escapism, voyeurism, and mindless chauvinism as pathology or merely the unavoidable existential angst of modern life, you still have here two people unable to cope with the challenges inherent in an immense and impenetrable universe, symbolized by the \\""sheltering\\"" sky.  One presumes that wrestling with the absurdity of life would be, as it is for them, fruitless and demoralizing unless one had some kind of certainty to fall back on.  For some of us this is the love of family and friends or the absolutes of religion, at least some governing passion by which we build lives of meaning that fortify us in the face of despair.  Alas, for Kit and Port, such insight does not occur.  Instead they look inward at the chaos of their own fearful minds, seeking reassurance in each other to mitigate their nihilistic leanings.  Yes, life is ultimately absurd; it does not make sense, even in the most predictable circumstances.  Still, most of us forge on, endowing our lives with meaning by the decisions we make.  Underlying those is a sense of who we are, a knowledge that evades Kit and Port, although both of them are self-absorbed enough that were they to connect emotionally with anyone, they might grow to the point where they not only understand themselves somewhat, but find enough meaning in life with which to sustain something close to satisfaction.<br /><br />Instead Port more or less gives up, and Kit submits to the dark forces of her own untethered fears.  Her downward spiral reflects an emptiness beyond despair.  She lacks imagination and the capacity to empathize, among other traits.  Alas, it is no wonder that she sinks into degradation, seeking in her victimhood compensatory punishment for her disloyalty to her husband as well as her own vacuity.  Her insanity is her final self-inflicted retribution for a life led without principle and direction.  She is at the last  pathetic in her unwillingness to be present, to be seen for what she is: an irresponsible reprobate that has buried herself so deeply in her own abyss that there is no hope for her because she cannot acknowledge responsibility for what she is.  She wallows in masochism.  In her denial,her subjugation is not her fault; in this vein she avoids responsibility for her behavior and still experiences the decadence her need for novelty has driven her to.  She is the classic existential character or she is a pathetic, superficial, uncaring woman.  You decide.  I choose the latter.  Ironically it was Port whom she clung to for refuge; when he could no longer protect her from her nameless fears and propensities, she slid into the oblivion of mental illness as easily as did he submit to illness.<br /><br />The desert metaphor is powerful and incisive.  The heat, the light,the aridity, the alien culture, the predatory flies, the filthy dust, the dark horizons and alleyways, all are images that stay with you because Bowles weaves them into his rich tapestry of African life.  One is reminded of \\""The English Patient\\"" in the images of limitless sand and incomprehensible people, languages, customs and the omnipresent shadows and looming dangers of the Sahara.  The important theme here is the idea of how strong a person must be to meet life head on without fear.  Such strength is not attained through education, imagination, money or entitlement.  Instead it is acquired through the daily struggle for self-betterment and commitment to others, goals neither Kit nor Port can embrace.  Without marriage, intimacy or empathy, the challenges of life can suggest an overwhelming unfathomability both the uncertain and fearful may yield to.  This is spiritual defeat, and this is the stuff of Bowles.  He portrays these lost and drifting individuals with great insight, illustrating how bereft life is when one's relationships are shallow.  Like his predecessor, Joseph Conrad, Bowles penetrates the heart of darkness in people who for whatever reason have grasped the full horror of life and been unable to cope with its lurid truths, the same terrible epiphanies that occupy every man's psychological abyss.  Yet sooner or later, this is human fodder, and so man must confront those fears with courage and equanimity.  Drifting around the world and from each other simply won't do it, as Kit and Port ultimately realize.  Nor will intellectuality ameliorate the darkness of life.<br /><br />For the most part, the book is well realized, if repetitious in parts and even if the triviality of moment by moment experiences is dwelt on rather than minimized.  The characters are well drawn and the themes of alienation, fear, marital unhappiness, and the shadowy uncertainty of life are well developed and universal.  The book is polished in style and believable in most aspects.  At the same time, it is a rough ride into the dark and mysterious realms of the tormented psyche.  The book is full of extended internal monologues where a character's mind confronts the enigmas of life, only to arrive at the same paralyzing fears of death and the stark recognition of the insignificance or insubstantiality, not to mention the infinite \\""unknowingness\\"" of life.

The only real thing we are told about her is that she is a person who is scared of everything, which doesn't jiv with her action of taking off alone into the desert on foot.     I think Bowles was being intentionally shocking to sell his stories.  This was published in 1949.    Kit's husbands actions were just as incongruous and reckless.

Just the hint that Port and Kit come from New York, that Port has a mother in New York. In this sense The Sheltering Sky is more modern than the Volcano.     Port and Kit have every bit as much reality as Jacques Laruelle, Hugh Firmin, Yvonne (but perhaps not the Consul, one of the great characters of literature). But is Bowles as deep as Lowry? Deeper? Less deep? That is in the eye of the reader.     Bowles' cold, clinical style is worlds away from the convoluted, often affected writing of Lowry. Comparisons could be made between the alcoholic who intentionally brings about his own death and the sophisticated white woman who allows herself to become the harem slave of an Arab trader.

Atmospheric, absorbing.","The movie led me to the book, which I'd never heard mentioned.  In the preface of the edition I bought here, the Author seems to have something against the movie, but as far as I can tell, it follows the book quite nicely, whether or not the book actually went to Morocco (it didn't).  The first quarter of the book was a devil to get through as the primary characters, three Americans and two Brits, all white, are fairly unpleasant to say the least.  It is very reminiscent of the post WWI books by Hemingway and Fitzgerald, where the characters are Oh-so sophisticated that the world and everything about it bores them, and everyone they meet is below them.  And they have the luxury to travel without end, and no job.  So whack me with a dose of that, I'll write about it too.  The English couple turns out to be a bit perverse, and larcenous, and the Americans never seem to care about anything, or anyone, including each other.<br /><br />The blurb on the back says the book illustrates the way in which \\""Americans'  incomprehension of alien cultures leads to the ultimate destruction of those culutures\\"", which I can understand on a national/foreign policy level (and especially if you take into account how European colonizing of the same region had an even more destabilizing effect) but the North African Arabs described here  don't seem the least bit disturbed by the self absorbed and self destructive Americans that sweep through their midst, and eventually find themselves at rope's end.<br /><br />After the first quarter, the reader must have come to terms with the characters, and having determined that the only way forward is forward;  quite suddenly, the book takes off.  Soon you are at the middle and then the pages start flying by like those calendars in the old black and white movies. You can't put it down; if you're at the sort of job where you can read in your down time, as I did, and then go back to work, you find that you are part at work, and part in North Africa back when, and your days take on a rather magical cast, if also rather burdened by the omens the story puts forth, especially if you've already seen the movie and know what happens...<br /><br />Mr. Bowles definitely knew this part of Africa and he brings it all to the reader, in its glory, its squalor, and its sun bleached, dusty, sandstorm misery.  These are not modern characters as we know them.  They're not so dated that we don't know them, but we write differently when we write at all, and it's been a while since we've had the sort of war that inspired the Hemingways and the Bowles, we don't have that perspective.  Of course, in this economy, I found my patience not quite in attendance for a bunch of people who don't have to work for a living, and who still find so much to complain about, but what can I say?  This book is a very good read, and the reader who hasn't spent much time in older books would do well to choose this one to familiarize him or herself with an earlier era that isn't so far away that we can't understand the people who lived in it.",2009-08-17

The couple is troubled, and finding an aim amid the sandy waste is also expected to solve their sexual problems. But what can be expected from a journey to nowhere, except that it should lead into the void?    Paul Bowles's The Sheltering Sky differs in all respects from the movie. Bowles's Sahara isn't that of Bertolucci's technicolor photo; it is cruel, unforgiving, dirty; it is full of flies, of petty colonial officials and impenetrable locals, a stark and treacherous place. Port and Kit aren't a romantic and courageous couple, at least not initially, more a spoilt pair, self-centred, sometimes mean. Kit only comes into her own later, and Port never does, though the typhoid scene is beautifully written (the same in the movie must be Malkovich's worst piece of acting).    Indeed, that's just the thing: Bowles's novel is convincing; it feels real. At the same time, this is a philosophical as well as a psychological piece. Two characters search for meaning in a vast, bleak, empty landscape where they can only hope to get lost; life's quest must end in death, and all meaning can only be incidental, such as the devotion to Port Kit rediscovers in herself when it is too late. The strength of The Sheltering Sky is that it does not lecture, however; it is never blatant or pompous. Only the ending is dubious; here the philosophical point takes over, perhaps, at the expense of psychological likelihood. Bowles himself is supposed to have declared later, in an interview, that it was `idiotic'. More equivoque and provocation? You will have to judge for yourself.",2009-07-28

We all have tensions and disappointments with our societies, countries, families and friends, but Bowles reveals the terror of complete alienation that happens when we leave it all behind.  If you've ever wondered what it feels like when your protective bubble pops, you'll like this book.  The plot, characters, and settings in this novel are merely vehicles for communicating this idea.  Bowles is poetic: his impact grows within the reader as his words are absorbed.    In response to a previous review:     Bowles spent a great deal of time in North Africa and would have understood a typical American's perceptions at the time.  Of course those perceptions are now outdated - would one expect otherwise?  After all, the book was written only a few years after World War II ended. Good literature attempts to portray characters within their historical context, and to offer insights about the human condition - not to mold characters in accordance with someone's political views.  I can't think of anything more boring and less literary than a novel portraying characters acting in ways that many university liberal arts faculty think they SHOULD act.      It's pointless to judge a novel written over 50 years ago by today's standards.

His later novels, especially THE SPIDER'S HOUSE, have gotten more praise & acclaim (even from Burroughs) than this one. But still, I read a synopsis of the novel and it looked appealing: a writer in a strange land having estranged, strained relations with his wife. I felt right away that I could relate to such a situation and that it would be a good novel to read; as a young man in high school I felt like a stranger in a strange land and I had a serious, steady girlfriend of more than 4 years, and my meteoric rise as a young, compulsive writer of \\""autobiographical fiction\\"" coincided with the disintegration of my relationship to this girl. <br /> <br />But, alas, reading this book I felt no such empathy with any of the characters.

Truth is the novel didn't really interest me from the start; the first page has some nice sentences, but other than those the book failed to capture my interest. <br /> <br />Again, it may be my own fault as a reader for not getting into this book -- I'm not an avid reader of books these days and haven't been one for years now, mostly just going back and re-reading old favorites for kicks and to pass time -- but I sure hope his later novels are better than this one, or I am inclined to suggest the man's reputation as an excellent writer is unfounded. <br /> <br />Because of THE SHELTERING SKY, I am extremely reluctant to read his later novels, and his short stories, etc. for fear of wasting more money.",2006-08-15

Bowles is good at describing the trash, poverty, bad food, and illness his characters discover in Africa. Instead of sweeping that under the rug, he makes it a key part of the story: it's through learning to accept the third-world filth that Kit and Port free themselves of Western convention, and come to embrace the emptiness behind the sheltering sky. But I think the real force of the novel isn't so much in its philosophy--a fashionable `50s existentialism--or its spare descriptions of the East, where Arabs aren't much more than talking landscape, but in its portrait of Paul and Jane Bowles, the glamorous writers in fashionable exile in Tangier.

I think Bowle's portrayal of Kit was shallow and unrealistic. He says she gets through her days balancing an internal dialog of omens and signs, yet after he mentions this, there's no evidence of her doing this. I think he got the female character way wrong, expecting her to validate her existence only if there was a man in the picture. And his portrayal of the \\""natives\\"" of the various locales was incredibly unflattering. Why go deeper and deeper into the desert seeking a \\""real\\"" experience if you're going to dis the people who live there? Alienation, existential angst, yadda yadda yadda.

In prose of breathtaking, pellucid elegance, Bowles takes us on the tragicomic final journey of wealthy New Yorkers Port and Kit Moresby across French North Africa in the late 1940s. (Their names alone are deeply ironic; \\""Port Moresby\\"" waves all sorts of danger signals for those who know their geography, while \\""Kit\\"" implies a kitten, willful yet tragically dependent on the kindness of friends, strangers and enemies alike.) On one level, the novel can be read as a tale of two more stupid Americans imagining themselves as enlightened travelers and coming to grief because of their illusions. On another, it can be taken as a tract on the impossibility of dealing with the world as it truly is, and on the various defense mechanisms people create to ward off either death or insanity. (Bowles uses those mechanisms to create some unforgettable characters, especially the horrible Lyles--putatively mother and son--who resemble a grotesque, unholy experiment between P.G. Wodehouse and the Marquis de Sade.) Meanwhile, the Sahara, vast and arid, remains what it is, forever, as Bowles makes plain toward the end of the book: \\""The coming of day promises a change; it is only when the day has fully arrived that the watcher suspects it is the same day returned once again--the same day he has been living for a long time, over and over, still blindingly bright and untarnished by time.\\""",2006-05-07

I walked out a few hours later, liking it alot, but kind of feeling alot went unexplained and so I immediately got hold of the novel... <br /> <br />That novel seriously changed my life.  I was in my young twenties and desperately trying to find some meaning to life at the time.  Well, to make a long story short, Bowles confronted me with all those sweet & scarey existential things about life that I had suspected.  Life at the time seemed amazing and full of joy and promise, but also really terrifying and tragic, too.  I guess I become a bone fide signed up member to Existentialism because of this book. <br /> <br />I am now in my mid thirties and whilst my rabid Existenitalism is now tempered by practical realities.  The Sheltering Sky has become something of a bible of sorts to me.  Here is why: <br /> <br />First of all, it's style of writing.  Cold and clinical.  It looks at the psychologies of these people like they are ants under a microscope (and in a sense they are,  three people in a huge empty wide space (the desert = the world) under a, not so much merciless, but rather a 'benignly indifferent' (to borrow from Camus) 'Sheltering Sky.  To me, these people in a strange land are really a metaphor/analogy for our place in the universe:  How we are 'thrown' into existence with no objective reference.  How we almost find ourselves in the world (surely a strange place at the best of times) and how we desperately try to connect with others (sometimes successful, sometimes not). <br /> <br />Anyway, it is a book that I read atleast once a year.   <br /> <br />These are merely my subjective feelings - I'm certainly not going to say 'it is the best book ever', or something to that effect.  But it is certainly my favourite book.  Mostly because it demonstrated to me how another humans artisticendeavour can inform and help someone else to find their own answers.

So much so, that I sat and cried for the better part of an hour. <br /> <br />Kit's desire to be close to Port leads her into the desert chasing his love of the desert, and her twin desire to be rid of all responsibilty whatsoever comes to pass as her captivity in the harem. I heard in my head the admonishment to be careful what you wish for as I read this book, and it seemed as if almost everything the character's wanted they were given, but the finer points which they failed to elucidate in their wishes were spelled out for them in lieu of further clarity on their parts as to what they wanted from their relationships to the world. <br /> <br />I identified strongly with Kit. Port was her connection to reality, and at one time, I had my own, which mired me within the ports of the sane. For a time, I took a trip on the road to insanity, and finally found the connection to reality within myself. Kit's passage on her own trip felt frighteningly familiar. I daresay, that the description of her descent into madness is neither facile, nor unbelievable. I found it very disquieting, and the memories it engendered were quite painful. The feeling of being at more than a loss for words that Kit's character describes at one point rang all too true. At a certain point you can feel as if your native tongue is like a foreign language that you do not know, and therefore you cannot give an accurate account of your tenuousness to bystanders.  <br /> <br />All of this brings me to the point that if the ultimate journey to be made is into our own souls, then running and hiding from everything that surrounds us, looking for the exotic won't change the ultimate destination. We cannot get away from ourselves. The world is our house of mirrors. At the risk of soundingfacile, we can be our own worst enemies, or own best friends. <br /> <br />And in the adventure to understand ourselves and others, the unrelenting, and often harsh world of nature will be none to happy and emotionless about helping us to find what it is we seek. Nature, represented by the desert in this harsh existentialist tale, is a demanding mistress. The presence of the desert as a character makes me wonder about the necessity of Tunner as a character on the trip with Port and Kit. More likely, he has the significance to the story of a fly on the nose, while the desert is the true third party in this 'love triangle'. The desert is almost a transferance and personification of Port's desire to be close to the love of his life, Kit, and her intellectuality not withstanding, Kit's emptiness, her vacuousness that lies at the core of her intelligence, her veneer of intelligence, is consuming. <br /> <br />Could not the 'sheltering sky' be like the veil of existence, or equally like the impenetrable mask of make-up that Western women apply to their faces, and which Kit obsessively does so often in the book, almost as if to keep up the barrier between what lies on the outside and what lies beneath? <br /> <br />And what lies beneath can be almost like a seperate identity, another side to oneself that is indifferent to misery and happiness, that just exists like the blackness behind the sheltering sky. Neither good nor bad, but simply malleable in either direction. Port's mistress as the desert, is really his desire to understand himself and his relationship with Kit. He cannot fathom it. Kit, for her part, attempts to understand his fascination with the desert in order to learn the truth of both her existence and Port's, and what she learns makes her appear to everyone else as if she has been robbed of her sanity. But who truly knows? <br /> <br />This novel is all about the unanswered and unanswerable questions of existence. More than just existential, it is a meditation on the meaning of life that refuses to give pat answers to the Hollywood crowd who wants a neat resolution in 120 minutes. Life is not like that, and neither is Bowles novel. This may deeply chagrin some who read it, and drive them to conclude that the novel is all pretention, while others like myself will read it and be bowled over by the frightening intensity with which Bowles holds the magnifying glass to the smoking insect of our lives...much as Kit does to a particular insect at a certain point in the novel. Need I mention that Bowles uses metaphor mercilessly. The glare of the sun on the truths of our lives is relentless, like the heat of the desert, and no amount of putting sheets over windows, or the locking of doors will ultimately be able to keep that out.  <br /> <br />Bowles is exceptional as a writer for his ability to make the reader see where the doorway is into understanding their own existence. This novel was never meant to be purely \\""entertainment\\"" or escapism. It cruelly leads you off on that path, and then turns, when your water has all run out, and the camel is tired, and lets you see the edginess behind its pupils that you somehow seemed to miss upon first glance. Some people cut out early on the journey, as did Port, while others finish it to the bitter end. The question is, ultimately, is it really bitter? I think the enigmatic quality of the ending only points up that nothing is ever really writ in stone.",2005-12-12

Bowles was an American but he lived in Tangiers, Morocco beginning in 1947.<br /><br />Bowles also was an American composer of art music and wrote scores for the plays of Tennessee Williams, a writer I admire greatly.  Thus I was pleased to have the opportunity to read Bowles's great novel, \\""The Sheltering Sky\\"" (1949).  It is, indeed, a remarkable book and captures well moods and feelings that are all-too-common.<br /><br />Bowles's novel is set in North Africa at the close of WW II.  There are three primary characters: a married couple, Port and Kit, and their friend Tunner.  Port and Kit are educated, intelligent, and financially comfortable.  They have been married for twelve years, most of which has been spent in aimless<br /><br />wandering to obscure places.  They decide to visit North Africa and their friend Tunner, a newsman, accompanies them.  The novel begins upon their arrival and remorselessly chronicles the deterioration and destruction of Port and Kit.<br /><br />The story is told in spare, understated prose and moves  easily. The destruction of the characters unfolds slowly and in detail.  The book presents a compelling portrait of  outsiders -- of people who are alone, alienated from their families and friends and their own societies with no sense of purpose for themselves.  In part, the book amplifies upon the theme of the \\""Lost Generation\\"" following WW I and explores subjects, but with a far greater degree of discipline and restraint, that the Beat writers would also explore.<br /><br />We don't learn many details about the protagonists -- about the reasons for their estrangements and feelings.  The marriage of Port and Kit is deeply troubled as they sleep in separate rooms and have difficulty talking. An inevitable triangle develops with Kit and Tunner becoming lovers for an instant. During the book, both Port and Kit takes steps to become closer to the other -- with Kit filled with remorse for her affair with Tunner -- but to little avail.  The book moves with the force of doom as Port dies midway in the book and Kit, after a series of harrowing experiences, descends into madness.<br /><br />There are vivid pictures in the book of the Sahara Desert, of many towns, trains, hotels, and buses in North Africa and of a host of secondary characters, including French military officials, native inhabitants, and other wanderers of bad or uncertain purpose.  We see the shallowness and foolishness of our three travelers in venturing witlessly into a forbidding land that they don't understand.

It is not sad in the sense of being powerful, but sad and strange in a completely different way.  There is no real resounding message or theme that ultimately comes through.  But its very nature seems to depress.  The characters are real, in a weird way.  I think the sublime description Bowles used about the world around them is the most significant aspect of the novel.  It describes the setting and emotions with clarity and originality.  I don't know if there is a point to it all, but it is a very interesting ride to take. <br /> <br />The story opens in caf in Northern Africa.  Here we will be introduced to the characters we will follow throughout the remainder of the story.  One is an ambitious traveler named Port.  It never explains fully how he acquires all the money to go on his trips and journeys.  One thing is for certain.  This is how he lives his life.  He is with his wife named Kit.  She is a complex character who is beginning to feel estranged from her husband.  They really have little in common.  The third character is named Tanner, who is a friend of both of them.  Tanner secretly lusts after Kit and will eventually sleep with her later on in the novel.  Kit never will tell her husband about it, but it will remain with her. <br /> <br />Together the three make their journey deeper and deeper in the Sahara.  Tension increases, the weather escalates in climate.  Port and Kit seem to constantly be arguing, and on one night of drunken passion inside of a train, Kit and Tanner commit adultery.  That is not to say Port is perfect either.  There are a couple of scenes in which he attempts to sleep with women, but both turn out badly and he never gets the chance.   <br /> <br />Eventually, Port ends up ditching Tanner in an attempt to be alone with his wife and spend some together.  It seems the more they are alone, the more distance elapses between them.  They continue to travel deeper and deeper into theSahara desert.  Conditions become worse.  Tanner continues to follow them.  Port, however, becomes very ill and only in his final moments is there any moments of closeness between him and his wife.  But it feels forced. <br /> <br />After his death, Kit realizes she really did love her husband.  She ends up going mad from the whole experience.  She runs away.  The novels final moments show her in her frenzied state and Tanner's quest to find her.  These scenes are well drawn out.  While before the narration used to comment frequently on her thoughts, after she loses her sanity, the prose suddenly halts.  We do actually feel that she is crazy. <br /> <br />I felt both sad and intrigued reading The Sheltering Sky.  It was highly creative with its use of language and feeling.  I guess the main point was to describe the dissolution and strain of relationships.  But again, the message was a bit muffled.  Nevertheless, my mind didn't think about it all too much.  I enjoyed the beauty and depression of it all.  It manages to do both at the same time and it works. <br /> <br />This is an odd and appealing story.  One, despite how familiar it should be, manages to put a fresh spin on its content.  Bowles is certainly a talented writer.  His description is flawless and the characters are eccentric and believable.  It unfolded much like a haunting dream one has, or the haunting moments we fear will never come to pass in our own lives.  It is unfortunate that for Port and Kit, their nightmares really did come to pass, but we can't help but be fascinated to experience it. <br /> <br />Grade: A-",2005-05-24

Sheltering Sky is poetic and beautifully written. Bowles weaves both dream and fable into the fabric of the novel also. Sheltering Sky is an exceptional existential novel that tears the veil of illusion for the American consciousness in much the same way that Sartre and Camus did for Euro-centric consciousness. The title is a supreme irony, since the sky does not shelter us, the blue is illusion, the darkness is the reality. The characters in the novel carry all the illusions and arrogance of Western civilization with them into a Muslim country and step by step the illusions are stripped from them, challenging their relationships, identities, health, and lives. Bowles is the master at revealing personal identity as a social construct, a fragile collection of illusions and memory and attachments. Bowles sees this personal identity as extremely vulnerable when put under pressure and in Sheltering Sky a rich arrogant well-educated couple are put into the pressure cooker of the Arabian desert. <br /> <br />It is a story of loss and adjustment to loss. For example, the protagonists, Port and Kit, have a shell of a marriage and have fallen out of love. They enter the stage partially dealing with this loss. They struggle and never recover. Bowles carefully paints them as selfish, aggrogant, rich, spoiled, intellectualizing, Western-centered folks who actually represent a large portion of the American upper middle and upper classes. Are these characters likeable? Not really, but do we read because we want to \\""like\\"" the characters? Rather, Kit and Port are real characters, we feel ambiguous about them, and we shiver as they lose their thin veneer identities under the assaults of contracting cultures and extreme challenges of the natural world.  <br /> <br />Port and Kit travel to Morocco where they must struggle against a vast and hostile nature and a foreign and unfamiliar culture. Then,step by step they lose every illusion which sustains their flimsy identity. They are forced to confront their mortality and Port does not pass the test. Kit's final situation is more ambiguous. She loses her mind, she becomes the slave concubine of a nomadic camel driver, she is rescued and returned to an oasis of Western culture, yet she escapes back into the dessert. <br /> <br />Bowles is the master at stripping away fantasy and illusion, revealing the amazing fragility of human existence and meaning.

The Sheltering Sky takes itself very seriously indeed.<br />Alas, Paul Bowles' enterprise is completely undermined by the (actually fairly well observed) characters: the lead roles in this Saharan melodrama are played by a husband and wife who have fallen out of love with each other. If this were all, I think Bowles might have got away with it. But crucially, the couple - Port and Kit - are also two of the most dislikeable lead characters to be found anywhere in contemporary fiction.<br />Port is selfish, unfaithful, rude and arrogant. Kit is hardly better: duplicitous, similarly unfaithful, hysterical, and given to an annoying irrationality which, towards the end of the book veers inexplicably towards sheer lunacy.

The beginning was slow but once you get going into the book the more interesting the journey becomes. The three American's are not very sympathetic people in the book, except maybe Port who seems to want to try to understand the native people and have relationships with them such as Marhnia, but her story of having Tea in the Sahara is as imcomprehensible as her and frusturating because I wanted to connect to Marhnia and understand her story like Port but could not. I also like the way the author writes about the minds of other people like the Lieutenant d'Armagnac;&quot;His overt attitude toward the people of Bou Noura was that they were an acessible part of a great tribe from whom the French could learn a great deal if they would only take the trouble.&quot; What's interesting about Lieutenant d-Armagnac is that he wanted to communicate and understand the local's but also failed to do so despite his best intentions. Overall The Sheltering Sky is an excellent story about how Three American travelers are tragically link to a culture that they, like most travelers do not know very much about in that they failed to take in the realities such as the heat, food, disease, and the native people intil it was too late.

The desert provides more than just imagery; it creates an atmosphere in which drama and tension thrive. The prose is beautiful throughout.<br />Yet the novel completely falls apart in the final section, in which Kit undergoes an emotional exile and (false?) return. The competency Bowles displays earlier in the novel in depicting human emotions and motivations completely disappears; the plot becomes an extended male fantasy of sexual imprisonment that cheapens the quality of the novel as a whole.

The action and events of the story are mostly angst-based, anxiety and uncertainty providing much of the motive force that get its characters through their adventures.  After a wonderful start, complete with some passages of rather detailed psychological insight, we are taken along with these hardly exotic American strangers through lands that seem every bit as alien to us as they do to them.  And the tension of being a stranger in strange lands crosses the boundries of fiction and somehow invades us in our homes.<br />It is a slow to appreciate book (at least it was for me), with a desire for something to happen and a continuing frustration when nothing does.  Near the end of the novel I began the see the power in this particular approach: to put the reader literally there with them, seeing that the character's romanticized delusions and high-minded ideas about themselves are a large part of the reason they are all so unsuccessful in their endeavours.  And, what's worse, that the boredom we might experience when winding through the occasional meandering, exhaustive passages describing for pages on end the windswept sub-structures of the calcified desert sand is also what these characters are feeling, kind of a helplessness under the power of something they cannot comprehend, much less control.<br />Here is a book about being pushed to the limits.  It tells of the numerous personal failures a traveller might accomplish, of the ways in which they respond to crisis and of how ultimately futile all of this is if you're more interested in what a foreign land says about you than what it actually says about itself.<br />Beautifully written and only slashed down to four stars (on the four-and-a-half I give it) because anything under five has to get rounded down.

Also many characters along the journey; the descriptions of the Lyles were incredible: A wonderful picture of such a disgusting and despicable pair. There were many other characters like the menacing Captain Broussard, the frightening yet intriguing Belqassim.<br />For the first part of the book, we met Kit and Port, who supposedly went to North Africa to rekindle their marriage, although I didn't get that impression simply because a) Port invited his friend Tunner and b) Kit didn't seem to share Port's interest in North Africa and c) neither Port nor Kit seemed interested in each other once they got there. At some point, all three of them had cheated on each other, betraying each other's trust, friendship, and love, though the issue was never confronted by any of them. In fact, these characters' personalities and relationships to each other were the most bewildering issues of the book.<br />There was a constant criss-crossing between a desperately strong sense of duty (without knowing why) to utter complacency and indifference between Kit and Port. They, along with Tunner, seemed rich, spoiled and ignorant. I couldn't understand their reactions to certain situations; such as Tunner's thoughts as to how his friends at home would interpret Port and Kit's disappearance, or Kit's reaction to Port's death, or Port's overreactions to Kit!

In a deeper level it is really a terrifying, exhilarating journey into the depth of human existence. Kit and Port Moresby's marriage was jeopardized. They came to the desert to escape from civilization, to escape from one another. The couple had never settled down in any one place, but rather they casually intended to move from one place to another in Africa in order to avoid places that had been touched by wars. The couple was also joined by a mutual friend Tunner and with whom emarked on a journey into the forbidden Sahara. What this book strikes me the most is the way Bowles examines the ways in which Americans apprehend an alien culture (as well as alien land). The very same apprehension at the end in a sense destroyed these Americans. As they emarked on their journey, further and further away from civilization, we can see how the cultural superiority of these fellow Americans dominate their thoughts-how they not trust the locals, the Arabs, the porters of town, the butler at inns. The journey forced these Americans to push the limits of human life. Each one of them was touched by the unspeakableemptiness and impassive cruelty of the desert. I don't want to give away the ending of the tale but this is definitely not a page-turner as you, the reader, will have to emark yourself on this journey and think about the limits of human reason and intelligence, about the powerlessness in controlling our fate.

Port and Kit Moresby, husband and wife, and their friend, Tunner, are &quot;travelers,&quot; not &quot;tourists,&quot; as Port says early in the narrative. &quot;The difference is partly one of time . . . Whereas the tourist generally hurries back home at the end of a few weeks or months, the traveler, belonging no more to one place than to the next, moves slowly, over periods of years, from one part of the earth to another.&quot; Like travelers, Port, Kit and Tunner seem to have little in the way of an itinerary, their days languourously slipping by, one day into the next, without purpose, marked only by a palpable psychic discomfort. <br />But there is another important difference between the tourist and the traveler. As Port relates, &quot;the former accepts his own civilization without question; not so the traveler, who compares it with the others, and rejects those elements he finds not to his liking.&quot; In doing this, however, the traveler runs the risk, if the degree of cultural separation is too great, if the foreign culture is too extreme, that he will become completely untethered from reality. As Bowles once said in a 1981 Paris Review interview: &quot;Everyone is isolated from everyone else. The concept of society is like a cushion to protect us from the knowledge of that isolation. A fiction that serves as an anaesthetic.&quot; <br />It is, ultimately, the removal of this anaesthetic, the removal of societal and cultural moorings, which drives the narrative of &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;and determines the fate of Port and Kit and Tunner. One does not survive; another will never be the same again. Disturbances of the interior landscape, the landscape of the psyche, become the catalyst of this psychologically discomforting novel. And this stunning mingling of interior landscape with the landscape of the Sahara-the sands, the sky, the maze-like passages of the cities, the alien culture-brilliantly unfies and completes the narrative of &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, marking it as a profound and compelling work of genius.",2002-04-29

Sometimes too removed, always visually descriptive, not wholly satisfying, occasionally heartbreaking.<br />Post-colonial Algeria presents the couple with a false sense of belonging in a strange place; and a feeling of arrogant entitlement which they are reluctant to acknowledge in themselves. At once, they view themselves as a part, and apart, of the environment. They distinguish themselves from boorish stereotypes, (Mrs Lyle and her son), by their liberalism, and validate their presence abroad, as travellers, who are exploring not imposing.<br />Landscape as a metaphor -  its bleakness and aridity mirrors the state of love between the two protagonists. Its monotony of sky and sand dunes and dirt causes a gross discomfort (for the couple) - similarly, the familiarity of their relationship provokes insecurity. The sky does not shelter; nor what's beyond the sky (Port reaches here through death).<br />The slow breakdown of Kit and Port's relationship is recorded, through its absence, rather than its presence. Their isolation from each other, runs parallel to their alienation as westerners within north Africa.  <br />Tunner provides a foil, of sorts, to this event (as well as being an object at which tensions are directed). He directly aids its destruction through his clandestine affair with Kit, but also, he remains the ubiquitous third party with whom one, or neither, of them side. By turns, he brings them together, and splits them further apart.<br />Port's death sees the renewal of Kit's life. It gives a release that she has presumed she would never find again. She abandons her superstitious outlook, realising that the only `omens' she discovers, are of her own making. She takes control. Previously, control was shared, and responsibilities dictated by this sharing.<br />However, her control is short-lived. Effectively, she's swallowed up by the Sahara. Stylistically, the third section of the novel, with its automatic and unconscious narrative, echoes this. Whilst the previous two parts are rooted in realism, the third gives over entirely to complete surrealism. The descriptions of place, become even more vivid - they take precedence, as the desert overpowers Kit. <br />Kit successfully loses herself - a strangely satisfying ending - to insanity, the desert, and anonymity, her aloneness (only compounded by grief), becoming unbearable. The novel consistently remains a subtle drama, allowing the reader only ever half way into the characters, at which point they become merely symbolic, often frustratingly so. Theme - the psychology of post-war existentialism - predominates characterisation. <br />Bowles' attempts to remove focus from the straightness of the plot can be skimmed, although all sub-events work towards, rather than against, expression of the former.

That's a lot of work for a novel to do, but this one pulls it off.  This is a novel that deals with three Americans on the run from themselves, from each other, and from preconceived notions of identity.  Set in the aftermath of World War II, the novel exposes and disrupts firm ideas of national identities and international relationships - between the Americans, French colonials, Arabic African natives, and a wealth of other ethnic/national categories - and shows how they react to and resist each other.<br />\\""The Sheltering Sky\\"" begins with Porter and Katherine Moresby, a married couple who have never stayed in any place too long, in a North African city, with the intention to casually move from one place to the next, idealistically hoping to stay away from \\""the places which had been touched by the war.\\""  Accompanied by their wholly annoying friend Tunner, they embark upon an unplanned meander southwards into the vast, forbidding Sahara.  The remainder of the novel shows these characters' adventures in Africa, and the resulting changes to their highly individual, naively constructed ideas about being-in-the-world.<br />Among other points of interest in \\""The Sheltering Sky,\\"" one thing that particularly grabbed my attention was the omnipresence of the main characters' sense of cultural superiority.  Despite Port's early insistence that he is a 'traveler' and not a 'tourist,' he and his companions soon discover that knowledge of maps, hastily gathered information about the next town on the route, and knowledge of the French language are insufficient to acclimate them to their surroundings and insure their comfort.  The novel does an excellent job of disrupting cultural stereotypes, particularly of the region's Arabic inhabitants, as the travelers make their way south into the Sahara, further and further away from 'civilization' as they understand it.  It also forces us as readers to take into account the perceptions of what we consider foreign from the point of view of 'foreigners' in their own element.  <br />The journey southward exposes the characters increasingly to peril - threats of thievery, disease, and existential despair - and the environment plays a large role in this.  The sky itself, often characterized similarly to Ahab's 'pasteboard mask' in Melville's \\""Moby Dick,\\"" as sheltering the characters from knowledge of the infinite, looms as a challenge to each of the characters.  Continual encounters with sand, heat, hills, and the difficulties of transportation complicate the experiences of Port, Kit, and Tunner.  The most independently mobile and problematic characters in the novel, the British/Australian Eric Lyle and his eternally irascible mother, provide an interesting counterpoint to the strictly-considered 'native' or inherently existing impediments to travel and stability.  <br />\\""The Sheltering Sky\\"" is a very oppressive and depressing novel - but don't let that stop you from picking it up - sometimes oppression and depression are necessary to force us to reconsider our relationship to the world.

My experience with Africa amounts to a day spent in Morocco at the turn of the century as a chaperone to a group of students.  I loved the experience but many of the students were uncomfortable.  I think this was because the culture there is so very different from anything most Americans ever experience in their lives.  I am amazed at how well Bowles is able to bring to life this land and culture in his novel.<br />Interwoven with his portrait of this desert culture is the story of a couple, Port and Kit, who are traveling through the region with a friend named Tunner.  Port and Kit are the main characters here.  They are a pair of well-off Westerners who travel with no itinerary or time limit.  They indulge themselves not only in the pleasures of the places they travel but also in their knowledge of the other's nature.  They desire closeness with each other but create distance in their denial of their own knowledge and wants.  They try to escape in their travels but they have arrived in a land that will force them by its harshness and beauty to look more closely at themselves.  They are incredibly interesting characters who undergo very moving tragedies.<br />On top of that there are a number of wonderfully drawn minor characters in this novel.  Besides Tunner, there is the horrible and yet comic mother/son pair, the Lyle's.  There is the sick French commander, Lieutenant d'Armagnac, as an example of a man who has made his peace with Africa and enjoys it.  There is the Jewish merchant, Daoud Zozeph, as well as Belqassim who adds Kit to his harem of three other wives.  All of these, and more, populate the novel with intriguing takes on what it is to survive in this world.  I recommend this novel to anyone.<br />A final note for fans of the band The Police and their album Synchronisity.  The song &quot;Tea on the Sahara&quot; from this album is drawn from this novel.

Port, Kit, and Tunner, had an open schedule and slowly traversed in and near Sub-Saharan Africa.  Thoughts of life, dismay, the past and future, are all here.  The desert and sun were constant and relevant characters in this book.  One would likely appreciate these latter &quot;characters&quot;  more if they had been the the region prior to reading &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;--so go there first.  The prose and some of the wording is of the 1940s, when the book was published (1949).  Tennessee Williams' review that appears in the beginning of the book is good but read it after reading the book--he gave too much away.       The last part of the story takes on an intelligently gloomy quality and setting.  Glimpses of Kit's and the others' neurosis and insecurity become evident as they are one of the few eccentrics  lucky enough to live and go where they want to go, when they want to in general.  She and her companions can stay in a particular town for a day, week, month, or the entire Winter if they choose.  that is freedom.  Freedom of the mind and physical environment.  They develop relationships with the locals they come across, as well as some who are on the road, or Sand Dune as one might say.

One can read The Sheltering Sky in a number of ways. To begin with there exists enough of a plot to read it straight through without considering the existential philosophies integrating into the narrative. I do not suggest such a bare reading. You will be left feeling both empty and partially disgusted by the novel. However, one may, with a deeper vision, uncover the extensive thought and emotion with which the book was written. There is substance, perhaps more than you are prepared for in your own reading of it. Bowles' language varies from the sparsest of descriptions to such heart-wrenching of psychological analyses that the reader may need to put the book down to contemplate the situations of the characters. Bowles' structure is supported by the subtle and affective repetition of themes. From the opening scene, he continually draws our attention back to characters while they are in or emerging from states of utter rest, and unconsciousness, even.  The Sheltering Sky exists now as a classic of 20th century literature. If you are interested in the travels of such mid-century artistic renegades as Ginsberg, Kerouac, or Gysin, this novel is essential in understanding their fascination with the author and his setting. Indeed, one would be hard pressed to improve on Bowels' description of North Africa and its inhabitants. Although he doesn't bombard you with flowery prose, he captures the essence of the land and the people who he encountered there.",2001-05-23

They are travelling in the Sahara Desert,  far from their familiar culture.  Things happen to them which compose the story, but the novel is great because it captures the tension in the relationships between people.  Nobody seems to be able to understand the others, and each of the three characters are in some ways as foreign to each other as they are to their surroundings.  Eventually, Kit emerges as the main character, unable to comprehend her identity in a place that has stripped her of the sureness of her existence.  In a sense, she loses her post-War American psychological angst, and becomes immersed in the more basic anguish of fear and surrender.  Finishing the book is like waking from a bad dream.",2001-05-18

It has all the things the other reviewers suggest--Bowles captures vividly the ultimate strangeness of a culture so different that one might as well be on another planet. The descriptions of the dark streets, the monochromatic beige--grey--white of the desert and cities, the filth and poverty, the sand--all perfectly drawn. The author's picture of a terrible death from the point of view of the person experiencing it was truly frightening--he depicts death as an experience of the mind rather than the body. The section depicting life inside the home of the Arab who takes Kit across the desert was intriguing. But ultimately I was frustrated by the characters--I suspect this all has to do with the postwar existentialist view of the world. I closed this book with far too many unanswered questions--why are these people in North Africa to begin with? Money seems to be no object--why aren't they being driven around in a Mercedes? Port and Kit are estranged but each longs to make a connection with the other, and they subconsciously conspire to dump Tunner sothey can be alone. But we have no idea how they came to be this way--although their inability to reach out to each other is real enough. Who is Tunner anyway? These characters seem to deliberately create a hell for themselves in order to reinforce the view that life is meaningless, we are all alone in the end, etc., etc. This is not a funny book, but after arriving at a hotel strewn with garbage and diseased babies (lying on the garbage pile no less!), finding vermin in the beds, and eating soup laden with weevils and a disgusting stew with pieces of fur floating in it, Kit exclaims &quot;I wish we had gone to Italy!&quot;--I had to laugh!",2001-04-09

Port and Kit's marriage is shaky, made more so by the sly presence of Tunner, who has his eye on Kit.  (This love triangle is vaguely redolent of the trio of safari hunters in Hemingway's &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.&quot;)  These three widely-traveled Americans are so bored with the refinement of their lives back home and the predictability of more popular tourist attractions that they feel an itinerary through the exotic, if often filthy and diseased, land of the Sahara will provide an exhilarating change of pace.  What they find is that they cannot escape their own personal demons.  <br />The novel begins in Oran, Algeria, from which the trio plan to travel more or less aimlessly from city to city throughout northern Africa, by bus or train, seeing the sights and staying in the hotels.  At a hotel bar, Port meets an odd and sneaky young English man named Eric Lyle who is traveling with his querulous, overbearing mother.  As the Moresbys and Tunner arrive in different towns, the Lyles have a tendency to turn up again like a bad penny without much purpose to the plot or effect on the main characters.  The Lyles offer a lot of interesting plot potential which Bowles unfortunately does not bother to explore.  <br />I was puzzled by the last third of the novel, which seems strangely detached from the preceding events.  Port eventually comes down with a fever and dies, and Kit inexplicably runs off into the desert.  She gets picked up by two native merchants traveling by camel, and continuing southward through the desert, they ravish her on a regular basis, which she does not entirely resist.  One of the merchants takes her to his home and holds her captive in his harem.  This descent into a symbolic hell seems to signal the end of her carefree life of innocence and luxury, a life to which she can no longer return. <br />The book is beautifully written; Bowles depicts the Sahara's geography, people, and cultures with the kind of rich detail such a story deserves.

What follows next is a sunburned account of a descent into mental hell. Throughout the novel, time seems to stand still. The characters wander around beneath the hallucinating atmosphere of the Sahara, under the sheltering sky, so brilliantly blue you'll see it and feel the dry heat coming from the sun.

As Port relates, \\""the former accepts his own civilization without  question; not so the traveler, who compares it with the others, and rejects  those elements he finds not to his liking.\\""  In doing this, however, the  traveler runs the risk, if the degree of cultural separation is too great,  if the foreign culture is too extreme, that he will become completely  untethered from reality.

Kit, not so keen on either the desert or Port, has  nevertheless agreed to Port's wishes, albeit reluctantly.  The third person  in their party, their friend, George Tunner, accompanies them more on a  whim than anything else.<br />Seeking the exotic, the trio really doesn't know  what to do with it when they find it.  The sun is too bright, the labyrinth  of city streets too dark, the excess of sensual delights a surfeit that  imprisons rather than frees.<br />Becoming more and more dissatisfied with  both themselves and with those around them, they decide to leave the  restrictiveness of the city behind and venture farther south, into the  wild, harsh, dazzling beauty of the Sahara.  They meet the Lyles,  ostensibly mother and son, who claim to be writing a travel book but whose  real business appears to be far more sinister, much like the duo's own  obsessive Freudian tangles.<br />Port, who at first, found himself drawn  inexorably to the beauty and remoteness of the Sahara, soon becomes  violently ill and dies, and Kit, grateful to be rescued by a passing,  enigmatic Arab, finds that things are not always as they seem.  Her rescuer  becomes her imprisoner, and as the sun grows ever brighter, the shadows  grow deeper.  The bizarre eventually becomes so real that Kit gradually and  terrifyingly loses what fragile grip on reality she once  possessed.<br />Although The Sheltering Sky may, on the surface, seem like a  lurid and melodramatic tale, it is anything but.  A masterpiece of  understatement, plot is always secondary to theme in Bowles' writing; the  real changes take place in the minds of the characters who must face an  immensity of experience they cannot even hope to understand much less  prepare themselves for.<br />The indifference of nature and the unforgiving  quality of the desert also play a huge part in this story.  The book could  be a metaphor for the meaninglessness of most 20th century relationships.   Port and Kit's journey into the heart of the Sahara mirrors our own journey  into the depths of the soul and we either come back altered forever (Kit)  or we don't come back at all (Port).  It is significant that Tunner, more  superficial in both his outlook and psychological makeup, fails to make the  journey into the depths of the desert and, as such, he remains untouched by  it.  He emerges essentially the same as he was when the story began.<br />The  Sheltering Sky could have been a character study, but Bowles wisely eschews  this venue.  Although we gain flashes of insight into each character, we  really don't get to know them in-depth.  An existential novel, the  characters in The Sheltering Sky are more symbolic than fully-formed,  fleshed-out people.  In a highly thematic book, however, this is exactly as  it should be, and Bowles never fails to manipulate his characters with  anything less than sheer perfection.<br />The inner emptiness of the  characters is emphasized by the incompleteness of their emotional  experiences.  Every time Port or Kit seem to be on the verge of discovering  a deeper connection, to themselves or to each other, Bowles pulls the chair  out from under the reader.  The scene that best typifies this lack of depth  is Kit's as she spends her final moments with Port following his death:   &quot;Softly she laid her cheek on the pillow and stroked his hair.  No  tears flowed, it was a silent leave-taking.  A strangely intense buzzing in  front of her made her open her eyes.  She watched fascinated while two  flies made their brief, frantic love on his lower lip.&quot;<br />Although The  Sheltering Sky is, for the most part, written in beautifully understated  prose (the vivid place descriptions are the exception), there is nothing  subtle about its message.  And, while one emerges from this strange and  complex novel as if from a dream, a little reflection makes it clear that  our dreams can so easily become our nightmares.<br />The real setting of The  Sheltering Sky is not the vast, uncharted Sahara, but the vast, uncharted  reaches of the modern soul.  Like Bowles' characters, we won't find the  journey to the depths an easy one, but if we are going to do more than live  on the periphery of life we should, however, find the journey  necessary.<br />Polished to perfection in every way, The Sheltering Sky is the  strangest, and most strangely familiar, book I've read in a long, long  time.",2000-07-12

On the whole, I got the impression that the  Moresby's were procrastinating their life and merely subsisting.  Bowles  exposes their weaknesses in all areas, Kit's especially. Both the Moresby's  lose their sanity at the end, if not more than that.  I would give this  book four stars except that it didn't give me the desire to read it again.   Some passages were very hard to discern and some details seemed  unnecessary.  As I said before,a very disturbing read.",2000-06-07

Re-reading it reminded me how many scenes had become part of my unconscious thinking (conversations between the main characters;  descriptions of the desert; the odd mannerisms of some characters,  especially the mother-son American expatriots; and especially the last  section of the book which simultaneously departs from reality yet  intensifies the reality that was established throughout the novel).  The  sense of how two people can be deeply in love, with a profound and needy  connection, and yet be unable to form words for their closeness until one  of them is lost, are painfully poignant in this novel.  Adding to this  poignancy is the idea of how war can drive people to a place like the  Sahara--a place far away from the society where those wars were begun and  fought--and yet take away your voice for expressing the horror that drove  you there, even with your partner, who travelled to this far-off place with  you for the same reasons.  In this sense, the desert becomes a metaphor for  a place we can all end up in, where we feel passionately, but where our  &quot;tongue turns to stone,&quot; as W.B. Yeats once wrote.  In this book,  the desert is a landscape where there are both infinite possibilities, yet  a great inability to move with energy in any direction.

Bowles, in this slyly subversive book, reverses that. The three Americans who start out on this  largely pointless journey into the North African desert, hope the mere fact  of movement will resolve their deep spiritual lethargy - or at least delay  their having to face it. They imagine themselves sophisticated, wearing  their cynicism as a talisman in a cultural landscape of troubling  strangeness. But they are simply unaware. Faced with an elemental vastness  that cares nothing for their conceits, they dis-integrate. Only one  survives and she is so utterly changed - physically and in spirit - that  she can no longer recognise herself, nor see a future for herself in the  world she formally inhabited. Although the prime characters are  fundamentally unpleasant - at least for most of the book - the lasting  impression is of an eerie, spectral beauty.

As alienation and a growing sense of incomprehension take hold of and tighten  their grip on the travellers' psyche, they fall victim to the strange  cruelty of the desert which takes on the role of the antagonist in this  travellers' tale. It is tempting to imagine that the all-enveloping and  terrifying vastness of the Sahara is the root cause of their troubled  psychological state. If this reflects the conventional reading of the  novel, I beg to differ. I found all three principal characters cold, edgy,  unhappy and ultimately selfish. There is no genuine communication in their  human contact. A pervading sense of alienation clouds their private  thoughts and deliberation. The condescending attitude of the colonialists  (including the Lyles and the French officials) towards the natives and  outsiders is all the more ironical when it becomes apparant that the latter  (eg, the old Jewish couple) is capable of basic human kindness which the  colonialists cannot even begin to comprehend.

The goal  of the husband seems to be as useless as humanly possible, while his strangely subservient wife tags along, worrying away in her own hotel room.

Later, what actually drives the plot is more passive: sickness and death.<br /><br />The question I have is: Why has this been such a highly acclaimed novel?  For one thing it has a mysterious, evocative title.  In what way does the sky shelter?  Particularly in the desert, the big sky alerts a person to the impermanence of national borders. My guess is that timing of the novel's appearance was also important. The book was written in the late 1940s.  Then the artistic set felt alienated from the mass movement in the U. S. towards family creation.  Especially for homosexuals at that time, a family in the suburbs, even openness about identity, was not even a dream.  Instead, many artists became  expats in exotic locals. Their national boundaries ceased to exist.  At that point, whether in the desert, or out at sea,  perhaps the only shelter to be had was from the sky. Finally, judging from reviews on Amazon, some fan had his/her high school English class write five-star reviews. There are hundreds written by people who couldn't have read the book.<br /><br />There is a natural urge among some to set off and explore the exotic and the unknown.  That part of the novel made sense to me.  A generation after Kit and Port set off for the Sahara, thousands of us followed instructions in 'The Whole Earth Catalog' by taking local buses from Europe to Kathmandu. By the early 1970s, rather than luggage and alligator pumps, it was a backpack and hiking boots.",2015-03-07

Some reviewers have called The Sheltering Sky &#34;a masterpiece.&#34; Others have gushed that they &#34;love&#34; the novel, which seems to me an inappropriate response to an unsparingly bleak view of the human condition. I admire Paul Bowles' writing, even when it is infuriatingly enigmatic, and I respect his stature as an icon of what we today call the Beat Generation. But the story? Well.... The story, such as it is, centers on a young American married couple, Port and Kit Moresby. The fact that the husband's name is the same as the capital of Papua, New Guinea, is never commented upon and remains a minor irritant throughout the novel. It is 1949, the aftermath of World War II, and the Moresbys, rich and seemingly carefree but decidedly unconventional, have come to North Africa to experience what they hopefully think of as one of the last &#34;unspoiled&#34; places on Earth. They are soon joined, more or less accidentally, by another American, the doltish Tunner, and a revoltingly crass couple, the Lyles, who may be (or may not be) mother and son. The Moresbys escape these parasites by fleeing deep into the interior of the vast Sahara Desert without plan or direction. The result, predictably enough, is disaster and a deeply troubling d&eacute;nouement. The point here may be that one can find reality only by tearing away the false curtain of civilization (the &#34;sheltering sky&#34;) and confronting nature, human and otherwise, in its most primitive and frightening state. But the question of what to do with that dreadful knowledge goes unanswered. Bowles' novel remains as mysterious as the Sahara itself. Those who read The Sheltering Sky are in for a thoughtful, disturbing, and challenging journey in the company of one of the Twentieth Century's greatest writers.",2014-02-19

The Sheltering Sky is about Kit and Port Moresby, whom Bowles fully explores. He reveals them as self-indulgent and sophomoric but paints a compelling picture of alienated co-dependence. Unfortunately, he neglects some of his secondary characters, namely Tunner and the Lyles, who become mere devices for advancing the plot. Tunner on the train with Kit, the Lyles in the car with Port...at no time does any of the three become more than a sketch. This is unfortunate because, while not particularly sympathetic characters, they deserve deeper looks, and might have added more to the story.<br /><br />Interestingly, Bowles gives us a much deeper look at Belqassim when he appears, despite the fact that we hear him say virtually nothing. Bowles capably renders this new character based simply on his actions, whereas the actions of Tunner and the Lyles seem progressively thinner and more random. The explanation for Tunner's decisions seems almost an afterthought and the Lyles end up being stock characters who needn't have had names, or even been characters at all.<br /><br />Kit's time with Belqassim is perplexing and yet the heart of the book. It ends up defining her and, somehow, defining her relationship with Port. Is it madness? Guilt? Freedom? I imagine it's a mix of the three with larger doses of the first two but, importantly, even with her foibles, she compels us to care and wonder. While Kit's story takes over and drives us to a tantalizing ending, the reputation of the book seems overdone when we remember the rather cheap plot devices it took to get us there.",2013-09-29

I was intrigued by the setting of the Sahara and curious to uncover the praised prose the book was said to contain.<br /><br />Three aloof rich folks--a young couple (whose marriage is clearly on the rocks) and their supposed friend (who neither of them likes)--decide to travel in Northern Africa. World War II has ended and it seems none of them really know what to do with themselves. The husband is consumed with wanderlust, the wife is neurotic, the friend is an oaf. They encounter characters who are just on the edge of being interesting, but nothing ever comes of them. Eventually, the exotic locales and inklings of plot get set aside for barren lands and disease, and the book grinds into emotional numbness and existential musings. Bowles puts forth some nice turns of phrase and a couple great moments of philosophy during these existential bits, but it wasn't enough to make me ultimately enjoy the book.<br /><br />Also frustrating is the fact that, after tragedy strikes our characters, the whole book takes a detour that feels unrealistic and verges on cliche. Bowles works so hard to illustrate his characters' mindsets for the first part of the novel that their sudden post-trauma-shift seems totally against everything he initially created. I recognize a person can go through a mental break during tough times, but the wife's journey during the last third of the book was more like a bad Laura Gemser movie than \\""literature\\"".<br /><br />In the end, I'll remember this book as one where bad things happened to people I didn't like in places of desolation and flies punctuated by rare moments of nice writing.",2013-07-16

Rejecting, then rejecting, they move further inland, further into a bored American's Heart of Darkness, attitude and identity similarly removing themselves from the malaise'd bodies with every mile, every dune crossed into the suppression of that finalizing sheltering sky.<br /><br />An issue taken--these American Travelers are so flatly self-centered and unlikeable. Never are we meant to like them, or the many characters--namely the Lyles (byech!), so far absorbed by the Sahara they no longer witness their identities past and current as viable--interacting with them, there to receive readers' smiles, but the juxtaposition of bloated and bloating selfishness and ignorance by these enlightened Travelers is too overwhelming it inches miles past the point of believability; the result dissonantly ahead of its time--the marriage of wealth and aimlessless so common and approachable since the `80s--and a simple revival of his `20s inspirations.
