It is a grossly overwritten rambling piece of work. Towards the end you begin to suspect that it is not only you the reader who is growing increasingly weary but maybe the writer herself, having worn herself out and wishing to put this \\""great\\"" endeavor behind her, suddenly, anti-climatically brings the story to a feeble dead end marked by a cheesy bollywood style re-entrant coincidence. For the poor reader who has patiently endured and is looking for at least some pitiful resolution this can only seem like a major cop out by the writer.  <br /> The ending is only a minor point of annoyance. Zadie Smith is actually a talented writer. Unfortunately she appears to be far too much is awe of her own sense of endless wit. This gets in the way of her writing. It also squeezes all her characters into comic book style stick figures. The novel is not so much a story as a long drawn out situation where each character having started promisingly gets stuck in endless repetitions.  <br /> A reader of Indian origin may find the novel jarring. There is a weird and incongruent evocation of a little remembered nineteenth century historical figure Mangal Pandey who becomes a long running tiresome joke in the novel. Zadie Smith mixes up her geography of the Indian subcontinent quite a bit so that Dacca and Delhi become interchangeable cities. She is ambitious to attempt to inhabit the mind of a middle aged male South Asian immigrant in London. This leads to moments of exaggerated convolutions: the superhuman energetic masturbatory spree of Samad Iqbal, a man supposedly in his fifties would make many a male reader cringe not so much in awe as in disbelief. The cliched and stale bar room conversations of Samad and Archie bring forth a bemused embarrassment. Clearly Zadie Smith has spent little time in the pubs of London. <br /> One can do better than this hackneyed version of theimmigrant experience. For those of you who may have inexplicably enjoyed this book, may I direct you to superior sources of enjoyment for this kind of story: the brilliant small budget British films from the 80's and 90's: <br />My Beautiful Laundrette  <br />My son the Fanatic <br />East is East <br /> <br />And for those who have the taste for Salman Rushdie's style of writing, he remains the grandmaster of this sort of fiction.

It's about what it means to be English, but to the Britain-born and to immigrants from the ex-Empire, in this case Jamaica and Bangladesh. It's 1974 and Archie Jones, middle-aged white Londoner and not the sharpest tack in the box but a good man, meets 19-year-old Clara Bowden, black beauty with no upper teeth who has to escape from her Jehovah's Witness mother. At the same time, Samad Iqbal, a semi-lapsed but anguished Muslim and Archie's mate from the last months of World War II, is married off to the young but feisty Alsana Begum. Archie and Clara's daughter, Irie, and the Iqbals' twin boys, Magid and Millat, thus begin a complicated interweaving that stretches until the mid-1990s (and later), while the author shows and explains and relates and expounds and examines, and the reader goes along for a fascinating ride. There's a lot of pointed humor here -- Smith doesn't let any person or group off the hook -- but also a good deal of serious thought about culture and acculturation, about what people need from each other. This is an impressive first novel. Smith was only twenty-four when it was published and that makes it even more impressive. I hope she continues writing far into the future.",2006-01-16

However,simpler words could have been used in place of bigger ones to fit in with its respective context. The first half of the book was quite boring, whereas the second half picked up, then went down again. The characters in their teenage and early adult lives were interesting and funny.If Smith had kept to this detail more than going back into Archie and Samad's old days, the book would have probably been better. I also did not find the end of the story very strong. Some parts were just going on and on forever, hence becoming too predictable the next time around. For example, Samad's character was very real, but one knows he is never going to change his fixed mind, how he cannot fathom the concept of his children growing up in North London, being uber religious to the point that he turns to hypocracy by cheating on his wife, drinking, etc. Furthermore, Alsana's character, again very real, does not change. On balance though, this is what Smith most likely observed in her youth and decided to write about it in a journal (this is the impression I get)but there is a distinction between writing journals and novels. I think this needed a bit more work in the editing department. As someone mentioned in these reviews (\\""Did Smith have an eraser\\""?- are my sentiments exactly). Given the fact that she was only 23 when she wrote this novel, as stated above, I do applaud her, since this is her first novel. She wrote very well, but some of the basic stuff like whatever+ whichever= answer( I cannot remember the example) was unnecessary, it did not fit the context in order to make the paragraph/chapter fresh. Ironically, when Smith wrote in simple prose, it was fresh in its execution. She has wit and humour and I hope her new books are more consistent.

Smith addresses global issues (the relationship of former colonies to their erstwhile rulers and of the working class to the middle class, religious fundamentalism, the tribulations of assimilation) as well as personal ones (marital relations, the complications of siblings, forgiveneness) with a voice that is intelligent and skeptical as well as sympathetic.<br />The book's flaws are minor: occasional slow patches in the 450-page narrative, a (perhaps intentional, but still inappropriate in a novel of this length and scope) superficial treatment of the endgame.

This book should be read for enjoyment, and you will find its overall structure shies away from traditional novels.<br />Let me say that my observations of Zadie Smiths book should not be taken as criticism, but as my own observations.<br />1) The characters are phenomenal.  The myriad of cultural backgrounds divided amongst genders equally makes for some very humorous and real situations.  While many of these characters 'quirks' can be outlandish, at the same time you believe them to be true, and you know you have crossed these peoples paths in your own life.<br />2) Cultural commentary.  With such a diverse cast the reader is exposed to various cultural ways and ideologies that were prominent during the late 70's through the 90's.  While White Teeth's setting is England we are reminded much of Jamaican, East Indian (Bengali), English lifestyles while mixing in various religious and educational beliefs.  This make the characters even more dynamic, as each is much different from all the others, even the twins Millat and Magid.<br />3) Time frame.  As mentioned above this story, or should I say vignettes of characters lives take place predominately over the last 25 years of the 20th century.  However, there a few flashbacks to 1945, the 60's and else time.  But the story does jump around a bit, bouncing between years and decades, back and forth.  While this doesn't detract from the overall story, it can throw off the pace of the reader.<br />4) Plot.

Smith indulgently rambled through the story with a lack of focus and discipline, and as soon as I began to care about a character, she ripped him from the spotlight and exiled him to the background, sentenced to live out the rest of the novel as a one-dimensional cariature.

Add in the Chalfens, an English family with a righteous, alomost (benevolently) colonial temperament, and this fiery mix of personalities provides the crux for Smith's imaginative exploration of prejudice, personal and cross cultural relationships, scientific experimentation and religious fundamentalism. The subplots in the novel are similarly engrossing, with enough eccentric characters to fuel several novels. To mention just a few without spoiling the story: Millat wavers between a fundamentalist Islamic sect whose initials spell KEVIN and his natural tendency toward the role of neighbourhood Godfather; Alsana, Samad's wife, earns money by making fetish outfits; and Irie finishes off her schooling with her grandmother, a vehement Jehovah's witness.

I did not choose the book, but was heartened by the reviews and descriptions I found.  This seemed like a book I would enjoy--very meaty and full of interesting people.  Normally able to zip through a novel, I had to force myself to finish this the day before our club met to discuss it.  I asked myself over and over, &quot;When will I get into this book?&quot;, and by page 360, I finally found my answer:  &quot;NEVER!&quot;.  I enjoy a character driven novel, and although this appears to be a character study, it disapppoints on several levels.  <br />First, it introduces characters and never follows up with them.  For example, Alsana, Samad's wife--she had the potential to be an interesting character, and I enjoyed reading about her in the beginning when she was pregnant, but later in the story, she seemed wooden and flat.  So vibrant in the beginning, and seemingly so easy to understand, her later actions and motivations are a mystery to me.  Clara is another example of woeful neglect;  she is introduced as an amazing character, and as the book progresses, she is merely part of the scenery.  <br />Second, it introduces characters and spends TOO MUCH time on them.  Samad is a character that got a lot of space in the book, but didn't contribute much to the overall appeal of the story.  The more I knew about him, the less I cared about him.  His most intersting facet was his obsession with the twins' music teacher, and that was over in the first half of the book.  <br />Finally, I think the ending was rather poor.  I enjoy an ending where the entire plot comes together, and where all the characters left dangling earlier on fall into place.  I believe this was Ms. Smith's intent, however, she fell a bit short.  I found myself having to go back and LOOK UP who these people were.  I did not have the A-HA moment when I saw the big picture.  It was more like, &quot;Oh, I guess that was whyI had to slog through 50 pages of that whole WWII thing....&quot;  <br />Although Ms. Smith uses a lot of interesting vocabulary, and tries to spin a tale that captivates and intrigues, I found that I just didn't care enough about the people she emphasized, and found myself wishing to know better the people she swept under the rug.

You are always still, you move nowhere, and there is no progress. But multiplicity is no illusion.

As a baby you didn't have teeth, but as you start growing up teeth begin to appear and soon after they fall out again.  As an adolescent you start to grow in your permanent set of teeth.  Of course teeth are white.  But do teeth stay white all through out your life?  I`m pretty sure factors may influence the color of one's teeth...smoking, drinking coffee, not drinking enough calcium could be a few.  Basically, as life goes on, so do your teeth.  Your teeth now do not appear as they did ten years ago, but does anything stay the same for that long of a time?  Cars change styles, not to mention clothing.  Most importantly people change within time.  A person's viewpoint changes dramatically over a period of time.  As a young person, one's mind is not yet developed and their kind of thinking is basic.  As we grow up we learn many things about society, culture, and especially, ourselves.  Some may not see it, but teeth and identity come hand in hand.  In the book White Teeth, Zadie Smith tells a story of two families struggling to make the best lives for their children.  As most children, all of them grow up searching for their own identity.  Millat and Magid, twins of Bangladeshi immigrants Samad and Alsana, grow up with the companionship of Irie, daughter of Archie and Clara Bowden.  Samad sends one of his twins, Magid, back to Bangladesh in order to save him from the corruption of Western civilization.  Millat, the other twin that stays behind, becomes much of a rebel in his neighborhood.  Much of his activities includes smoking marijuana, causing havoc, and having promiscuous sex.  Above all he becomes very involved with  a Muslim activist group.  Irie, on the other hand, goes through many changes in the novel.  She grows up struggling with feelings of inadequacy brought on by her multicultural background being that of English and Jamaican.  The pressures of Western civilization cause her to try to straighten hernatural, curly Jamaican hair.  When Magid comes back from Bangladesh, it is odd that he is more English than Muslim.  Zadie Smith allows us to step in these children's lives and follow with them the search for their own identity.  Being brought up from different cultures in a foreign land allows these children to be strong-minded and unbiased.  Smith has portrayed their lives in a way that others can seem to relate.  As stated in the beginning, teeth change over time.  We see in this novel that the lives of Millat, Magid, and Irie change over time also.  This novel helps us realize that a child's life is a very dramatic one, and sometimes taken for granted.",2001-04-30

Not only is it wise, and well written, it is incredibly witty. To me, the story seems to be about the absurdity of humankind. It doesn't really matter which part of the world a person may come from, everyone is struggling to make sense of it all in their own inimitable way. She has a sagacity way beyond her years: the characters are real and human. It was easy to read the five hundred pages or so, because I was so curious as to what would happen next.  It makes a refreshing change to read an energetic book by a young woman that is not introspective nonsense  on `how to catch a man', but instead intelligently consolidates life experiences and complex issues in to an altogether more expansive view of the way people think today. This takes tremendous talent. I hope this paves the way for broader perspectives from 20 and 30 something authors. The book is chaotic, fun and vital and is very much London (or perhaps any other cosmopolitan city) today. I read the paperback version which I bought from Amazon.co.uk (if I'm permitted to say that), and so can only hope that the US version has not changed too much of the quintessential London everyday language into Americanisms. Zadie Smith has a great understanding of dialogue, that she could so easily be a playwright. Perhaps because I grew up in London, of a mixed race family, I can understand much of what she says. I had to chuckle to myself when on public transport, despite the strange looks I received on the T.  The book is topical and even touches upon scientific patenting, which was intriguing.

But in all honesty, White teeth is not without it's flaws.<br />Before anything, let me say White Teeth was extraordinarily well written, and for the most part entertaining. Smith's razor sharp wit will no doubt absorb you within the books pages at times - she's definitely someone you'd love to have a conversation with and just pick her brain. Throughout the book though, her linguistic acrobatics get somewhat tiresome... Personally I found some of the words she chooses to use, well, UNNECESSARY. I can't provide an example as I gave the book to my aunt to read, but she just seems to pick the most obscure words she possibly can at times. I found myself picking up my dictionary more than I ever have before which is not altogether a bad thing - but it creates blocks in my understanding and the flow of the story in my mind... it's just annoying after awhile!<br />I disliked the ending. The last quarter of the book was a chore to read and it was anti-climactic. The third quarter I realised I disliked the friggin' Chalfens, I disliked Magid. I disliked the fact that he was sent away, PERIOD, nor could I understand the logic in that turn of events in the book. I REALLY liked Alsana and the Niece-of-Shame - I would have loved to have more of them in the book, as well as Clara. I just feel like Smith introduced me to these fantastis people I would have loved to have gotten to know further, and then just left them hanging when she had a gold mine of stories and sub-plots she could have created. I would have liked the relationship between Irie &amp; Millat explored further, it just seemed to be glossed over and made insignificant to the greater story. By the end of the book, I didn't really feel for any of the character and didn't care about finishing the story - I did so only because I forced myself.<br />Perhaps Smith had spread herself too thin with the enormous scope of the book? She definitely had all the fundamentals of a perfect story in place, but somehow it didn't come together.<br />No doubt Zadie Smith is a talented writer and I'll definitely be looking forward to her next work. Most of my problems with white Teeth essentially stem from the fact that I disliked the way the story unfolded and the way the characters developed. I would have liked to have cared a bit more by the time I reached page three-hundred-and-whatever, but I was completely indifferent.

Well, I must say, I have received better Christmas presents.  No, not the Fine Young Cannibals CD, it wasn't that bad, but this novel was definitely overrated.  I have read quite a lot of the reviews here and they echo my feelings.  I was let-down.  Newsweek loved it, NY Times loved it.  Usually that's a good indicator.  Well, I didn't love it.  I think that Zadie Smith is a fabulously talented woman, younger than me and blessed beyond belief but at times it just feels like she's thumbing her nose at those with average command of the English language.  She is showing off.  I think she's long-winded and, although, like I said, very talented, I think she overreaches.  Someone else said that she didn't fill out her characters.  I'd agree with that.  I was really enjoying about the first 300 pages.  I thought the start was great.  But somewhere in there she got confused.  I couldn't tell what the focus of the book was.  Was it Samad and Archie?  At first it was.  Or was it Irie, who seemed to be the pivot for later events.  I found it hard to believe that such a prominent scientist as Chalfen (that whole Chalfenism thing had me chafing) would be so fulfilled and helped by a 17 year old???!!!!  Magid didn't exactly have the best genes.  And would a scientist of his stature need Irie to do his filing?  No, he would probably have a pro, a real trained secretary.  Now like others said, there's a lot to admire here.  She has a phenomenal command of English, a great ear for language and really, her prose is fantastic.  But I think she overreached in trying to wrap everything up quite so neatly.  I think that was her biggest mistake.  Her scope was too wide.  Someone before me said there was an &quot;embarassment of riches.&quot;  I'd agree.  If she had focused just on Samad and Archie's lives after the war and their lives (which was what I anticipated when we got through with the intro) it would have been excellent.

A first-time author, it is amazing to behold her maturity.<br />Smith writes with a biting, satirical wit.  I felt that she adores each character she created, yet she is unafraid to place her beloved cast into humiliating situations.  Samad Iqbal and Irie, especially, are treated exceptionally badly.  Iqbal is forced to go through an embarassing masturbation sequence, while Irie receives a nightmare hairdressing experience.  Both situations raise the laughmeter a notch but there is always a sense of pathos hiding behind the humour.<br />Sprawling across the 20th century but concentrating on the latter years, White Teeth concerns two men and their resulting families.  Archie is a slow, common Londoner, who becomes a sort of anti-hero at the unexpected, and somewhat unconvincing conclusion.  Samad is an Indian immigrant fighting a war between his heritage and popular culture.  He fails miserably.  Both marry and have children.  Irie, Magid and Millat, then take over the focus of the story while the adults sit back into a supporting role.  Another family is introduced later on in the novel, the almost perfect, Chalfens, an original family if there ever was one.<br />The novel is very much character based.  The story itself is episodic, plotless.  There is a conclusion to the story but it's a half-hearted ending as if Smith ran out of pages to write on.  Even so, a character-driven novel as good as this one is a rarity.  It is refreshing to find original creations can still be uprooted.<br />There are very few cavities in White Teeth.",2001-03-03

All I can think is that they actually think this book is an honest, sincere glimpse into the life of Blacks and Asians in London.  I think that is what's so frustrating about this book.  Nothing rings true.  If this book does open a floodgate of imitators (which I'm quite sure it will) I hope someone else with a bit more talent can improve on this.  The worse thing would be that anyone got the impression that this is what London life is really like for us.  <br />I finished this book not caring about ANY of the characters, which is surely not a good sign.  Not Archie, not Samad, not Clara or Alsana, not Millat/Magid /the Chalfens and definitely not Irie - who I'm sure was supposed to hold this whole story together.  There's not one sympathetic character within the pages.  By the end of the book, you're left wondering why you wasted so much time (and it is a long book) reading about such a pathetic bunch of people.<br />Most of the critics seem to be in awe of what they consider as the author's confident, assured and mature style of writing (especially considering her young age, it's her first novel etc.).  However, I think the tone of this novel is one of pure indulgence and arrogance.  It appears that a thesaurus was used the whole way through the novel, (for every simple expression, the most elaborate word is substituted in its place, which meant the story was made unnecessarily laborious to follow.  <br />The author also used half facts, and down right untruths about certain things pivotal to the story (i.e. the Jehovah's Witnesses religion, multicultural London life) to blatantly patronise and mislead the reader.<br />I am not a Jehovah's Witness, but I know for a fact, that Clara would not have been sent to a Catholic school, none of their members would wear a cross, they don't quote from the King James version of the bible and they don't sing secular hymns andthey are not your stereotypical Pentecostal churchgoers, in fact a Witness wouldn't use the word church, the rank and file Witness does not have any influence on what is printed in their magazines (unlike Ryan Topps) and they would never - I repeat NEVER organise a protest for ANY reason. <br />These are all things that could have found out quite easily.  The fact that it wasn't shows contempt for the reader as far as I'm concerned.  The Witnesses are an easy target, but singling them out for what amounts to amateur attempt of humour is quite spineless.  I<br />'m not an expert on the Muslim religion, but certainly this story isn't exactly a good advertisement for it either (but then it WAS recommended by Salmun Rushdie - perhaps that should have been a clue).<br />There was no real thread running through the story - it starts off following Archie, then skips to Clara, leaves Clara halfway through her story, jumps to Samad then to their children - but instead of fleshing out their characters, they're just left as empty shells, while the past history of characters who don't really have a lot of bearing on the story are delved into in far too much detail.  Clara, who should have been a strong central character, seems to disappear from the whole story.  Irie, who is a central character, ends up becoming spoil and vindictive.  Samad and Alsana are just Asian caricatures, no depth, just the regular stereotypes.  No one seemed to have any redeeming features..<br />There were a few times where I thought the story showed a bit of humour - the black hairdressers, the false teeth - even Joyce Chalfen (although she also seems to disappear half way through the story) but nothing about this novel was new or fresh.  I hope no one read this thinking they were getting some sort of insight into how Black/Asian Londoners live - it doesn't even come close. <br />And what was that ending about?  None of the ends are tied up.  It all comes across as if the author is trying just that bit too hard to be clever.

But to complete one that is deep on so many levels, so funny, so pertinent to how we live today, balances so many different plotlines without ever losing control of any of them, speaks in so many different voices (from a conflicted Bengali Muslim to a hardcore animal rights activist to a 85-year-old Jehovah's Witness, and many others in between) without ever sounding less than authentic, is so rare that one almost considers it a miracle. <br />Forget all those, &quot;all white people are bad, everyone else is good&quot; multiculturalism books they made you read in college that were universally lame. This is by far the most pertinent book about mutliculturalism that I've ever read, because it is based on real life as it is currently lived, not on guilt for the sins of our ancestors. It is about the difficulty in staying true to ones roots, but at the same time being a part of the present and future. This novel goes so much deeper than that though, because ultimately, it is not just about culture as a whole, but about the individual. About the desperate need of the individual to feel that his or her existence is important. I hope I'm not making this book sound too serious. Zadie Smith has an incredibly hilarious writing style, that keeps you laughing and smiling even as the more important messages of the novel seep into your mind. This novel isn't perfect (what is?), some characters that we come to care about early in the book fade into secondary characters a bit too quickly (Clara, for example) and some of the novels morals are not quite as subtle as the author probably intends. Still, this novel is so good I can't bring myself to give is anything less than five stars. Not to get too strung up in hyperbole, but reading a novel like this, by such a young writer who one hopes will only get better with time, makes one feel more comfortable about the future of literature.",2000-12-15

Erudite and irreverent, White Teeth traces the lives of just a few of London's inhabitants, namely the Joneses, the Iqbals, and the Chalfens. These families find themselves intertwined in various ways and their connection is the focal point of the novel. Smith delves into the issues at heart in many big cities that shelter immigrants. As Bangladeshi immigrants, Samad and Alsana must come to terms with living in a country constantly looks upon them as outsiders. As their twin sons Millat and Magid grow, Samad fears that Western culture will begin to separate the boys from the Muslim faith. His decision to send Magid back to his homeland has lasting repurcussions for all of the key characters.<br />Meanwhile, the docile Archie has married the beautiful Clara Bowden whose roots can be traced back to the plantations of Jamaica. Their child Irie wrestles with feelings of inadequacy brought on by her multiracial beginnings. Her love for her parents and her passion for Millat are constantly tempered by self-doubt and hostility. Irie also knows how it feels to be an outcast or perceived as different.<br />Through it all, Smith adeptly melds tragedy with comedy. Her characters are rich. The strongest chapters of the novel appear later as the Chalfen family attempts to &quot;save&quot; Millat and Irie. Her approach to religion and popular culture are especially entertaining. There is something decisively British about her humour even if the London setting is merely a microcosm for the Western world. Through her humour Smith tackles some very real issues: the battle between the &quot;materialist&quot; West and the &quot;traditional&quot; values of other cultures. The search for an identity seems to plague all of her characters regardless of age, sex, or race.",2000-12-11

But at the same time I was alternately beguiled, moved, and genuinely felt myself caring for these characters in a way no new novel of this year has made me feel.  <br />The theme of White Teeth is cultural displacement:  (When is the last time you read a new book and was actually able to decipher a meaning behind it?)  Two families - one Pakistani, one half-British/half-Jamaican - over the last 25 years with excursions into turn of the century Jamaica, WW2 North Africa, and colonial India.  It is essentially the story of what happens when immigrant children try to break ties with their cultural heritage to assimilate into their adopted land.  In some ways this book reminded me of the recent film &quot;East is East&quot; which dealt with a similar issue, also in a very humorous and poignant way.<br />For all its narrative and linguistic flourishes, White Teeth remains a singularly intimate book about family, culture, religion, and the challenges of growing up in an environment where no matter how hard you try to fit in, you will always be marked as different.<br />I was utterly charmed.",2000-11-28

To that end, Archibald (who is a paper folder by profession) chooses as his best friend, the Bangladeshi, Samad Iqbal, a one-handed Muslim London waiter.<br />White Teeth encompasses the time period from 1975 to 1993 and traces the friendship between Archibald and Samad.  As we learn more about the two men, we also learn about their friends and families, such as Archibald's toothless Jamaican wife, as well as their daughter Irie, and Samad's arranged-marriage, a marriage that was satisfactory enough to produce twin sons named Millat and Magid.<br />During the telling of her story, Smith makes several forays into rather bizarre and hilarious worlds:  a Jamaican hair salon; a school that was begun as a workhouse for Jamaican immigrants; and an Irish pub that has become a catch-all for Muslim immigrants in London.<br />Smith's characters are all eccentrics, with strange habits and quirks but who, nevertheless, seek to blend into the background of modern-day London despite their differences in race, style, language and religious belief.  The fact that none of them really does blend is something that simply escapes them altogether.  Take Millat, for instance.  This fifteen-year old boy was born and raised in London, but he looks like &quot;Omar Sharif, thirty years ago.&quot;  His efforts at &quot;blending&quot; are nothing short of enormous, &quot;He was simply too big to remain merely a leader of the Raggastanis..he had to please all of the people...to the Cockney wide-boys he was the joker...to the Asian kids, hero and spokesperson...and underneath it all...the feeling of belonging nowhere that comes to people who belong everywhere.&quot;<br />Smith writes about a London that is home to people who really have no home; i.e., a sense of place.  Her characters seem disconnected, at loose ends.  There is Samad's son Magid, who wassent to Bangladesh to learn to become a &quot;proper&quot; Muslim at the age of nine.  When he returns to London at seventeen he comes back wearing all white, &quot;ironing his underpants,&quot; speaking very, very proper Queen's English and eating English bacon for breakfast.  An aspiring lawyer, Magid is more English than the English.  Millat, however, is a different story.  Although he admits to being from &quot;Whitechapel...via the Royal London Hospital and the 207 bus,&quot; Millat is a rootless young man in emotional turmoil.  In an effort to put down some much-needed roots, he joins a group known as KEVIN.<br />Smith obviously knows London and both the East and the West.  She writes about diverse cultures and races with joy and humor and pathos.  When Samad complains &quot;birthplaces are accidents...everything is an accident,&quot; Irie counters with, &quot;the land of accidents sounded like a paradise...like freedom.&quot;  Obviously, colonialism, or any of its vestiges, plays no part in White Teeth.<br />Smith's London is, in fact, a true melting-pot.  It is a city that experiences excitement, aggravation, anger and edginess, but never out-and-out violence.  It is a world of muted shades of gray where nothing is black and white.  Its inhabitants are more intent on blending than on emphasizing individual differences.<br />Smith is an excellent writer and this is an excellent debut novel.  It is a bit unfocused at times and there are times when it goes on for pages and pages and we wonder what Smith is really getting at.  She seems to be a little like Millat, wanting to please all of the people all of the time.  Ultimately, however, we realize the Smith is trying to tell us to simply get on with getting on.  It's not a bad message and, although it's not perfect, White Teeth is definitely not a bad book nor one to be dismissed.",2000-11-03

Not many first-time authors dare to paint in brush strokes this broad (as a counterpoint, think of the Brat Pack novelists of the '80s and their skimpy, self-satisfied works). These strengths, however -- the sprawling, multi-generational plot lines and abundance of characters -- also form the core of the novel's greatest weakness. Simply, Zadie Smith just doesn't have the mojo to pull it all off. The rambling expository passages quickly grow tiresome (it took me several months to finish the book -- I read about a third at a time and took long breaks) and many of the eccentricities meant to liven up her characters occasionally land on the wrong side of annoying parody. That said, White Teeth should indeed be read by anyone with a serious interest in current fiction. There is some truly inspired writing on display, most notably in the scenes involving Samad, Archie and the War. It's a pretty safe bet that Zadie Smith will one day make good on the formidable promise she demonstrates here. She is, after all, only in her mid-20s (a fact which may explain why the book's critical praise has been so wildly out of proportion with its actual achievement as a work of art).

While &quot;White Teeth&quot; was an original and  insightful novel, it would have been even better if she had spend some  additional time researching the less-pivotal topics she planned to write  about.<br />For example, in the beginning of the book, Archie's character is  suppose to be suicidal, but, apart from him leading a mediocre life, she  gives no plausible reason for him to want to kill himself.  There wasn't  even a hint of him suffering from a sever clinical depression.   Furthermore, Archie's ex-wife's is described as having a mental illness,  but it is written without any true understanding of such disorders.  As  metal illness and suicide are very serious topics, greater care should be  taken when writing about them.<br />Also, as I have many family members who  are Jehovah's Witnesses (three genrations worth), the JW family depicted in  the book is so far from realistic, it isn't funny.  The teachings, the  terminology, the manner of speach, the name of the organization's  president, the number of members - all wrong.  It seems painfully obvious  that Ms. Smith obtained her information from people who were not, nor ever  have been, Jehovah's Witnesses.  I know that JW's beliefs are  unconventional, but they should at least be expressed with SOME  accuracy.<br />My last criticism is that she seemed to begin to write details  on certain scenes, and then does not follow through.  Although they were  always minor, it made it difficult to 'see' what was happening while  reading the book.<br />I don't mean for this review to be too critical, taking  away from the author's inspirational work.  Let it be said, that I wish I  was half as talented (and young).",2000-09-04

Zadie Smith's ability to portray a person, a  place, or an organization gets you so absorbed that you resent it when she  grabs you by the arm, and insists that you return to the plot that meanders  vaguely through the book. Where some authors might state that a character  clears his throat, Ms Smith provides us with &quot;Erhummmm, a  sound..(that) began in his arched nostrils and reverberated through his  slight, elongated, misshapen limbs like the final shiver of a hanged  man.&quot;<br /> Mind you she can be offensive to some. She's probably  alienated a whole country when she states that Bangladesh is God's attempt  at black humor. Ah, but the pictures she paints.

Then there is  that lengthy description of teens furtively smoking at recess, or the  history of Ibrahim ad-Din Shukrallah, founder of KEVIN, a militant Islamic  youth organization. He spent five years in his aunt's garage, never leaving  it until he had written his 637 often-incomprehensible rules for his new  movement.

It's hard to believe this is the work of a 24 year old woman.  She has an amazing command of language and a highly developed sense of irony for one so young.<br />This is the story of  the Jones and Iqbal families.  Archie Jones, a working class Everyman, is  saved from suicide by a cranky butcher who objects to folks gassing  themselves in the restricted parking space in front of his store.  Fated to  live, Archie meets and marries the 19 year old, Clara, a beautiful,  toothless Jamaican who is running from her Jehovah's Witness mother.  Their  daughter is named Irie, which means &quot;no problem&quot; in Jamaican  patois.  The name is definitely not prophetic.<br />Archie's WWII war buddy,  Samad Iqbal, weds the  cranky, opinionated, and aggressive Alsana in an  arranged marriage.  This union produces the dashingly handsome twins,  Millat and Magid.<br />As the lives of these two multi-ethnic families  progress, Smith addresses weighty questions of race, religion, sex,  history, gene tinkering, and the immigrants' very real fear of loss of  cultural identity as their children are assimilated into the culture of  their adopted land.  In an ironic twist, the &quot;good&quot; son Samad  sends back to India to study his native Muslim religion becomes an atheist  and a truly annoying scientist, while the &quot;bad&quot; son remaining in  England becomes a militant Muslim, but no less annoying.<br />I felt that the  book dragged somewhat in the last hundred pages, as Smith seemed to become  obsessed with her characters' obsessions.

It is hard to believe that a person in their early twenties would have the experiential and philosophical data base from which to inform as large a creative project as this one; but this is all we are told about Ms. Zadie Smith in the book's cover: that she is 24 years old and a graduate of Cambridge University. Neither of those conditions can account for what she has wrought.<br />She weaves themes such as racial identity, religion, sexuality, political activism, dematology, Englishness, adolescent ennui, gangsterism, war, murder, peace, genetic engineering, body contours, and toothlessness into a rambunctious, wild, energetic, and ultimately satisfying panorama. I suspect Ms. Smith will offend the Political Correct amongst us on the basis that certain things should never be spoken about. She talks about everything.<br />She has a fully developed sense of humor, Ms. Smith does, and along with it a sense of the ridiculous. Thus her surfaces are kept on the verge of slapstick, while underneath there are counter currents of sadness and of the futility of life. Characters are drawn masterfully, and therefore they are hard to forget even long after the book has been finished.<br />The signs of a true professional are a steady hand and a lack of nervousness about what they do. Ms. Smith's professionalism never abandons her, and it is for this reason that one can read her book without the fear of having to make excuses because of her tender age or her lack of writing experience.<br />I expect Zadie Smith will have an extraordinary career as a novelist.

And then the next 300 or  so pages will sober you up. By the end you'll only be able to wish you  could have adored the book as much as you had originally wanted to, like a  lover you move in with after a month, only to find yourself quickly,  abjectly disappointed by their ordinary human failings.<br />Smith's book  benefits from comparison to the mediocrity passing for serious fiction  that's received such currency the past five years or so. Its blend of high  and lowbrow humor and erudition allows it popular consumption while  stimulating the intellects of serious readers. Its famously bedazzling  passages will, indeed, blow you away at times. And the scope of the  author's imagination is, indeed, astounding. The book's strengths are  strengths that other recent fiction has conspicuously lacked. It is not a  trendy book, and it earns the frequent comparisons to  Rushdie.<br />Nevertheless, Smith showcases some major weaknesses. Most  seriously, her characters, who at first introduction seem so promisingly  complex, degenerate into caricatures who too often Speak For Their People.  How could Smith have glossed over Samad Iqbal's initial complexities and  let him become an utterly predictable Resentful Bengali Immigrant? How  could she have resorted to letting Archie Jones rest on his predictable  laurels as merely a Simple, Good-Natured English Bloke? The answer is  clear: those are the easiest ways to think about and write characters.  Everyone is familiar with stereotyped, predigested notions of Otherness.  Yet no one in real life is that cut and dry. And no one in the beginning of  her book is that predictable, either. Hence the disappointment. I found  myself wanting to scream out at times &quot;No,my Alsana would never have  said that! Or if she had, it would only have been  ironically!&quot;<br />Another problem is the heavy-handed pop existentialism  that informs the book and passes for its Big Idea. The book, beyond its  multiculti particularities, is essentially a treatment of the ageless  problem of free will versus predestination. What at first are subtly  suggested recurring themes become louder and louder, cruder and cruder  bombasts, articulated more and more overtly again and again (so that every  minor character and incident is retroactively subsumed into the book's  unfortunate &quot;argument&quot;), culminating in an arch finale that  redefines cheap and easy. <br />Yes, you can see I am bitter. I expected more  from White Teeth. Not just from its hype, but from its glorious first  hundred pages and the revivifying moments of greatness that followed.

And then the next 300 or  so pages will sober you up. By the end you'll only be able to wish you  could have adored the book as much as you had originally wanted to, like a  lover you move in with after a month, only to find yourself quickly,  abjectly disappointed by their ordinary human failings.<br />Smith's book  benefits from comparison to the mediocrity passing for serious fiction  that's received such currency the past five years or so. Its blend of high  and lowbrow humor and erudition allows it popular consumption while  stimulating the intellects of serious readers. Its famously bedazzling  passages will, indeed, blow you away at times. And the scope of the  author's imagination is, indeed, astounding. The book's strengths are  strengths that other recent fiction has conspicuously lacked. It is not a  trendy book, and it earns the frequent comparisons to  Rushdie.<br />Nevertheless, Smith showcases some major weaknesses. Most  seriously, her characters, who at first introduction seem so promisingly  complex, degenerate into caricatures who too often Speak For Their People.  How could Smith have glossed over Samad Iqbal's initial complexities and  let him become an utterly predictable Resentful Bengali Immigrant? How  could she have resorted to letting Archie Jones rest on his predictable  laurels as merely a Simple, Good-Natured English Bloke? The answer is  clear: those are the easiest ways to think about and write characters.  Everyone is familiar with stereotyped, predigested notions of Otherness.  Yet no one in real life is that cut and dry. And no one in the beginning of  her book is that predictable, either. Hence the disappointment. I found  myself wanting to scream out at times &quot;No,my Alsana would never have  said that! Or if she had, it would only have been  ironically!&quot;<br />Another problem is the heavy-handed pop existentialism  that informs the book and passes for its Big Idea. The book, beyond its  multiculti particularities, is essentially a treatment of the ageless  problem of free will versus predestination. What at first are subtly  suggested recurring themes become louder and louder, cruder and cruder  bombasts, articulated more and more overtly again and again (so that every  minor character and incident is retroactively subsumed into the book's  unfortunate &quot;argument&quot;), culminating in an arch finale that  redefines cheap and easy. <br />Yes, you can see I am bitter. I expected more  from White Teeth. Not just from its hype, but from its glorious first  hundred pages and the revivifying moments of greatness that followed. I  think we should start a campaign to demand that Smith go back and properly  rewrite the thing, giving her limitlessly promising book the time it so  deserved (you can still be this year's literary ingenue, Zadie, don't  worry).

Lodge's  &quot;The British Museum is Falling Down.&quot;  It has been a long time  but, finally, here is one more to add to the list.  In some ways, what Ms  Smith has done is even more impressive when one realizes that her humor is  spread among a very wide cast of characters, all of whom we come to know  very well, and a variety of times and situations.  The narrative has a real  drive to it and this, too, intensifies both the humor and the pathos of the  characters.  It is not as if these characters are particularly novel:  the  reader will probably feel that he or she knows them or their type.  But  what Ms. Smith does is to take the familiar and give it a twist or a shove  into some unexpected territory.  This ability as well as the broad cultural  [popular as well as the more traditional and literary] foundation from  which the author works make it all the more remarkable that this novel was  written when she was only twenty-one.  I suppose this is to her credit as  well as to the credit of the British educational system.  One thing is  certain:  This is one writer who seems to be able to see more facets of the  ethnic and cultural melange than just about anyone else.

And, having read Simone de Beauvoir's writing, I can  understand how a 24-year old can be brilliant. &quot;White Teeth&quot; is a  masterpiece: complex, confounding, existential, and hilarious. Smith takes  a wry look at social relationships, including friendships, marriages,  parent-child connections, young lovers, gangs, cultural groups, religious  cults, intellectual circles, and guys who hang aroung greasy pubs. She  meticulously attends to what she observes and deftly records all the  nuances of character and behaviour. She is the Jane Austin of the Age of  Aquarius. She is the Coraghassan Boyle of Britain.<br />Smith accurately  reflects and humorously depicts the times we live in--a world where  individuals are struggling to define the meaning of existence via  psychiatry, religion, science, and personal relationships. A world where  cultural imperatives are not nearly as critical as &quot;who made me&quot;  and &quot;why do I exist.&quot;<br />This is a story of generations and  generatonal warfare. Of children who don't understand parents, of parents  who don't understand children or each other. Of children who think someone  else's parents are superior. Of grandparents who are Jehovah's witnesses  and ride motorbikes with former boyfriends who have &quot;seen the  light&quot; and great-grandparents who start mutinies but fail to pull the  trigger.<br />Every thread of the narrative is woven into a seamless  tale--there are NO loose ends. &quot;What goes around comes around&quot;  until the end of time. What is set in motion affects the life that set it  in motion. Is this fate? Is it the result of rational thought and action?  Is it the will of Allah, God, Jehovah?<br />How is the Nazi Herr Ferret, with  the bleeding tear ducts, Archie Jones and Samid Iqbal encounter in WWII  Romania tied to the creation of the SuperMouse by Marcus Chalfen (alias  Chalpinski a Jewish emigree from Poland via Germany).<br />How do the genes  of Englishman Captain Charlie Durham (&quot;damn fool bwoy&quot;) who  sacrificed a thousand Jamaican people for a woman he never knew come to  reside in Hortense, Clara and Irie of Jamaican descent.

KEVIN seeks the destruction of all ungodly  behavior, including Marcus Chalfin's ungodly experiments with mice.

She's only 25, and was several years younger when she started writing it. So much is packed into it and it is driven forward by energetic, humourous, optimistic writing. It is tempting to say that Zadie  Smith has managed to pick up the part of London she lives in and drop it  neatly into a book, along with history, science, religion, and the colonial  roots of the wonderful array of characters. I'm sure if I'd been sitting  having a chat with Zadie a few years ago and she had told me what she  intended to write I would have nodded interestedly and said  'mmmm....brilliant idea...ermmm... bit too ambitious though maybe, don't  you think....what about just concentratiing on this idea.. or this idea..  or...'.  On the other hand, I don't know her from Adam, and if she  demonstrated the passion of ambition that is evident in the book, then I  would probably just nod and say, 'well.... you just go ahead.. we'll just  keep to our little ideas... and take life one theme at a time... but you  just go ahead and whack it all in there!' Obviously it is not perfect.  To  be really picky, at times she overwrites, she gets carried away by the flow  of the narrative and slips in words and phrases that could have been  smoothed off.  She grapples with big themes and shows a deep understanding  of them, but at times throws in distracting humour which holds us back from  a greater engagement with these issues. Not that I want to criticize her  use of humour.  It is wonderful to read a serious novel which also  entertains.  There is so much humour in life alongside the tragedies, the  racism and the poverty, and it is brilliantly captured here. There is a  wonderful balance between positive and negative in the novel.  It is the  author's energy which holds this all together.  How can she have such a  strong, seemingly-positive outlook at the age of 25 when she has also faced  and grappled with the darker issues of our times?   Very rarely do I read a  book twice,and certainly not within the space of six months, but I am now  reading 'White Teeth' for the second time and enjoying it even more than  the first time around.

For potential readers in the from outside the  London-area who may be concerned that it might be rather parochial, about a  small part of London, full of that odd English humour and so on, I have to  say 'FEAR NOT'.  Although the characters of the novel are all products of  London's own brand of multiculturalism, their ways of thinking, their  emotions, and the problems which they encounter have a universalism which  is likely to make White Teeth a success in all parts of the globe.

It starts off in 1975, the year of the author's birth, with the attempted  suicide of Archibald Jones. Anyone who was born in 1970s Britain cannot  fail but identify with the characters and events in this book. If you can  recall the VW badge craze, then this is the book for you. However, this is  not just a novel for the younger generation, for there is at least one  extended family in White Teeth, each member of which is brought vividly to  life. There's Archibald Jones and Samed Iqbal, who first meet in a British  tank in 1945, and who then meet up again thirty years later to start the  families featured within White Teeth. There's the brilliant and comic  portrayal of the aged Hortense Bowden, an avid Jehovah's Witness, who keeps  waiting for the end of the world.<br />Zadie Smith's novel has been described  as Dickensenian, but I think there's a touch of Thackeray in there too. The  author mocks her characters, and parodies them, but she also has a lot of  compassion for them. No one, in the world of White Teeth, is beyond  redemption. Zadie Smith's characters are truly vibrant. Take Samed Iqbal  and his troubles with 'slapping the salami'. As a reader, you begin to  wonder how Zadie Smith has such insight into the male mind and universe,  because it rings so true.<br />For anyone embarking on a Cultural Studies  course, this novel is a must. Throw away your textbooks with their dry  statistics! One of White Teeth's main themes is the mix of cultures in  North London, from the Bengali Iqbals, to the archetypal Englishman Archie  Jones, to the half-Jamaican Bowdens, and a slight smattering of the Irish.  The novel maps these characters as they try to live out their years in a  world which is losing religion and tradition. Samed kidnaps one of his sons  to be brought up as a proper Bengali back home, while his other son,  Millat, flirts with girls and joins the fundamentalist Keepers of the  Eternal and Victorious Islamic Nation (KEVIN - they've got an acronym  problem).<br />History and fate are intermingled in this novel. Hortense  Bowden's apocalyptic vision of the future is indivisibly linked to the  aftershocks of her birth. Samed can't stop boring people with tales of his  illustrious ancestor, the rebellious Mangal Pande. Irie Jones seeks to  visit her family's home of Jamaica. And Joyce Chalfen sees genius in each  Chalfen portrait, whilst Joshua Chalfen literally joins up with FATE.  Archie Jones, who leaves most decisions to the flick of a coin, also finds  that History has a nasty shock in store for him. However, the future's  present here also, with Marcus Chalfen's work on genetics forming a pivotal  part of the plot.<br />Like BBC TV's 'Our Friends in the North', White Teeth  is divided up amongst a handful of years relevant to the characters. So,  you can wallow in nostalgia as you see the Berlin Wall fall down once more,  relive of the turmoil of that October 1987 storm, and remind yourself of  the Bradford protest against The Satanic Verses. Salman Rushdie's review of  White Teeth is the only bit of marketing on the front cover, and indeed,  Zadie Smith has been compared favourably with Rushdie.<br />There are quite a  few pop culture allusions scattered throughout the novel, but I doubt that  these will date, as they tend to be of the immortal kind (references to  'Taxi Driver', and 'Goodfellas'). The plot of another gangster movie,  'Miller's Crossing', seems to reflect Archie Jones' dilemma. But please  don't point any tedious accusations of theft in Zadie Smith's direction.  She has her own, extremely witty, voice as a writer, and White Teeth comes  very much from her perspective. It seems that Zadie Smithhas been writing  this novel for a very long time: witness the similarity of the characters  and story in `Mrs. Begum's Son and the Private Tutor', a story short she  wrote for the Cambridge May Anthologies in 1997.<br />There are only a few  jarring notes. Smith has a tendency to write aesthetic words such as  'monstropolous', when there's really no need to do it, other than maybe  showing off. Having said that, you try looking up `monstropolous' in any  online dictionary, and you'll have drawn a blank. But if you look up  references to the word on the net, then it points all the way to Zora Neale  Hurston's `Their Eyes were Watching God'. Hurston's writing was  rediscovered and promoted by Alice Walker in the 70s, and this tome is  credited by many for being the first novel in which Southern U.S. Blacks  are portrayed as being independent from White society. Once you consider  the provenance of `monstropolous', there can be no possible objection to  Zadie Smith's prose. What had once seemed intrusive, now has a power all  its own. If a single word could tell a story, then `monstropolous' is it.  My first impression was wrong. There are no discordant notes. The music is  sublime.e Smith has been writing  this novel for a very long time: witness the similarity of the characters  and story in `Mrs. Begum's Son and the Private Tutor', a story short she  wrote for the Cambridge May Anthologies in 1997. <br />There are only a few  jarring notes.

Indeed it has, and it ought to worry him. For even if Zadie Smith's book is made on a recipe similar to  Rushdie's multicultural stew, her version of today's po-mo society is  definitely more tasty than what &quot;the sha of blah&quot; offered with  his overdone &quot;The Ground at Her Feeth&quot;. The plot is too elusive  to relate here, but that doesn't matter since it is the genuinly funny and  streetsmart voice of Zadie Smith that captures the reader. The Bookerjudges  can call off the search for a winner, White teeth is this year's novel, no  doubt about it.
