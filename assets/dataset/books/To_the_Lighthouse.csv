Well, almost at 84, I finally read it (OK, I did a lot of skimming through the interminable dinner in part 1 and most of the boat ride to the lighthouse in part 3) and must say it is greatly overrated. I seriously believe that most of the people who rate this book highly would hardly notice it if it lacked its great reputation. We are all afraid to confess it a bore.    Although a great craftsman with words, Virginia has no ability to make her characters seem real. With the possible exception of Mrs Ramsey and Lily Briscoe, most of the many characters (I kept track of 30 by listing them as they came along) are just names and relationships - I never felt like I knew any of them and found it hard to care about them. After some 300 pages when the boat finally nears the lighthouse and Lily at long last finishes her damn painting one can put down the book and say &#34;well, that was a lot of rambling thought about mostly nothing and does anyone care?&#34;    Oddly, it is only the short part 2 that comes alive. The descriptions of the Ramsay's house as it slowly disintegrates during the 10 year interval between parts 1 and 3 are vivid and colorful.

Start with the last section, the trip to the lighthouse, which is very straightforward. Then read the short middle section, Time Passes, which is only slightly less clear.

I first read TO THE LIGHTHOUSE more than forty years ago in my early twenties.  I thought it was a masterpiece (as I had been taught in college to think of it).  Re-reading it, I can acknowledge the craftsmanship of the mannered prose and I recognize the novel's \\""modernity\\"", but I never was fully absorbed in and by it; re-reading it was, in truth, somewhat of a tedious chore.  I don't know precisely what accounts for my less favorable response: perhaps advanced age, or less susceptibility to conventional critical opinion (i.e., greater independence as a reader), or simply changes in my personal literary tastes.  I do know that it is not that Virginia Woolf as an author leaves me indifferent:  I recently read \\""Mrs. Dalloway\\"" for the first time and I was very taken with it.<br /><br />For those who are not familiar with the novel, \\""plot\\"" is virtually non-existent.  The setting is the vacation house of the Ramseys on the island of Skye in the Hebrides.  Part One covers the rather mundane events of one day, a few years before World War I.  Those present are the Ramsey clan (mother, father, and eight children) and a handful of houseguests.  Among the events of the day are guest Lily Briscoe painting a picture; two other guests taking a walk along the beach and ending up engaged; discussion of a proposed sailing expedition the next morning to the lighthouse; and a large formal dinner with Boeuf en Daube.  Part Two is a short bridge to Part Three, which is set ten years after Part One.  In Part Three, the Ramseys, three fewer in number due to death, return to the house on Skye along with two of the houseguests from Part One.  Essentially all that happens in the one day of Part Three are that three of the Ramseys finally do sail to the lighthouse and Lily Briscoe finishes her painting.<br /><br />Again, there is much that is noteworthy about the novel, which was originally published in 1927.  In addition to the prose -- which is adamantine, in the sense that not one word seemingly could be changed without a slight loss -- there are the multiple points of view, the distinction between internal \\""lived\\"" time and external \\""objective\\"" time, a pronounced feminism, and an exploration of life in the shadow of an imperious father (no doubt much informed by Virginia Woolf's relationship with her own father, Sir Leslie Stephen).<br /><br />Much of the novel consists of the interior stream-of-consciousness thoughts of various characters.  As presented by Woolf, I found the myriad instances of stream-of-consciousness overdone.  For one thing, I don't believe that most people incessantly engage in such minute introspective analyses or flights of fancy while at the same time engaging with others and the world around them; I know that I don't.  (One small example from Part One was Mrs. Ramsey directing her many children and guests to their assigned seats at the dining table all the while wondering \\""But what have I done with my life?\\"".)  For another, far too many of the characters' internal thoughts were, for me, just so much blather.  That, in turn, is related to another source of dissatisfaction:  I don't much care for the characters of the novel, in large part because they all are effete members of an upper, educated class that takes it for granted that it is different than the servants, custodians, and fishermen who support them.<br /><br />To be flippant about it, TO THE LIGHTHOUSE is a magnificently written account of multiple navel-gazing by overly self-absorbed individuals from a class of people utterly foreign to me.adamantine, in the sense that not one word seemingly could be changed without a slight loss -- there are the multiple points of view, the distinction between internal \\""lived\\"" time and external \\""objective\\"" time, a pronounced feminism, and an exploration of life in the shadow of an imperious father (no doubt much informed by Virginia Woolf's relationship with her own father, Sir Leslie Stephen).<br /><br />Much of the novel consists of the interior stream-of-consciousness thoughts of various characters.

It's only March, but &#34;To the Lighthouse&#34; is far and away the front runner for worst book this year.<br /><br />I won't repeat what many other one- and two-star reviews of this book have effectively said in criticism -- I do recommend scanning through them if you are considering reading this. I will only add a few specific comments I haven't seen others make.<br /><br />Major - Nothing of interest happens throughout the whole story (ok, this is a frequent criticism in other reviews - but it is so important that I had to say it). Most of the book is spent inside people's heads, but their thoughts are so uninteresting I had to wonder why the reader was even supposed to care about the petty things that mattered to them. Readers generally want fictional characters to be worthy of their attention: (1) to be compelling and take us away from our own lives - not to recreate the frequently mundane aspects of our everyday worlds, and (2) to give us experiences normally unavailable to us and subsequent insights - to live and learn vicariously. That never happened for me in &#34;To the Lighthouse.&#34;<br /><br />Major - I hated how often Woolf rambled on and on. Many of her sentences, thoughts of one character or another (proofs that speak to the veracity of subjective viewpoint rather than objective experience) - many of them, which as it turned out, I had to restart once or twice to decipher what was being said, all too frequently - much as I intentionally mimicked with this sentence - went 30 words or more before THE VERB appeared.<br /><br />Minor - the Ramsay's had eight children; can you name them? I tried to and came up with ten names (well, one a nickname). Within the first few pages of the book, Mrs. Ramsay makes a comment that prompts &#34;her daughters, Prue, Nancy, Rose&#34; to imagine having a life different than their mother's. In the last section, we also see Cam (Camilla), a younger daughter, revisit the summer house after her mother has died. In the middle of the book, though, Mrs. Ramsay walks into the children's bedroom late one night to find the children awake. Reference is made to Mildred - who is she? Skimming through the book, I could only find one other reference to her. Is she one of the Ramsays, or is she a nanny? I could not tell. So that's four or five daughters. Regarding sons, early on, four are named - Andrew, Jasper, Roger, and James. However, there is also one passage that refers to what seems to be a teething infant, not identified by actual name, but by the nickname The Badger (a reference to his teething). We don't see him ever again in the story, though, so is he a Ramsay child or not? That, then, is four or five sons as well.  (Additionally, in the final section, after we have learned two of the eight children died, we only see two of the remaining children return with the father. What happened to the other four? No mention is made at all of them. To me, this made them simply window dressing, rather than pertinent characters.) As I admitted, this is a minor frustration with the story, but it is a real criticism I have of Woolf's storytelling and it was enough of a distraction that it contributed to my overall disappointment as well.<br /><br />This is the first book I've read by Virginia Woolf. And unless someone gives me a compelling argument for any other, it will remain the only one as well.",2014-03-30

So did a MOOC class with a professor from Brown who offers a class on relationships in fiction.  The prose is amazing.  As the Brown professor noted, no one writes like Woolf.  I didn't really identify with the characters in this novel.  The father reminded me of a kind of blustery Teddy Roosevelt type, the mother seems a bit disconnected to reality.  The children want the father to take them to the lighthouse.  Did the lighthouse have a kind of symbolism in the story?  Does it stand for the mother, who is the anchor of the story?

Some ideas - it stood for self, aloneness, perhaps even for Ms. Ramsey. It stood for eternity compared to the waves, or moments, of time.<br /><br />We all agreed that the writing is gorgeous in this novel and it's a brilliantly constructed novel.

My favorite books of all time are Hemingway's 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', 'Islands in the Stream','A Moveable Feast', and 'The Garden of Eden', and Thoreau's 'Wild Apples'.

It was a thoroughly challenging read in which you must read large sections at a time with few interruptions. I was prone to also rereading various passages to further gather the meaning that Virginia Woolf had delicately buried beneath gorgeous layers of prose. And prose is what this book is. It's the most lyrical thing I've read and seems almost to be one massive poem. Most of the books consists of notions and thoughts that meander amongst the various characters introduced (all of which I garnered some sort of connection with).

The Woolf family spent every summer at the same rented house in Cornwall, looking out on Porthminster Bay.  Woolf wrote in her diary that these stays at the summer house were some of the happiest times in her life and the novel was written to commemorate that.  Like in the novel, there actually was a trip out to a lighthouse that Virginia's youngest brother was not permitted to go on, much to his dismay.<br /><br />The novel is not only a portrait of Woolf's mother, but also her father.  Woolf's mother was a great beauty who actually was a model for the artists of her day.  Like in the novel, she was loving, caring, authentic and direct, but she was spread too thin.  Everyone in the family wanted more from her.  Through two marriages, she had given birth to seven children, with Virginia being the youngest girl.  Her second husband and Virginia's father, Stephen, was a very self involved and needy person.  In her diaries, Virginia describes him as needing constantly to be soothed and attended to.  If he did not receive the solace he believed he deserved, he would fly into a violent rage.  In addition to these duties, Virginia's mother was something of a nurse and was often asked to care for dying family members in their final days.  She did this quite well, but her frequent absences enraged her husband.<br /><br />Virginia's mother died when Virginia was thirteen.  I think the cause of death was something like scarlet fever, but exhaustion was also listed.  Her death marked a turning point in the life of Virginia.  Virginia's half sister then attempted to step into her mother's shoes and try to run the household and also soothe the easily disrupted ego of the father.  This proved to be quite a taxing task and sadly, this half sister then died two years later.<br /><br />When Virgina was 17, her father then appointed one of Virginia's half brothers, George, to escort her to parties and present her to society. It is so tragic to read that this half brother then began to sexually abuse Virginia.  He was 30 years old and in a position of guardian for her.  It is believed by scholars that George was also abusing Virginia's sister Vanessa.  In her diaries, Virginia attributes her mental breakdowns to the sexual abuse she suffered.  Two years later Virginia's father dies. Virginia, her sister and the two youngest brothers take this opportunity to sever contacts with the abusive half brother.<br /><br />In one of her diaries, Woolf wrote that from the ages of 13-44 she had been obsessed by thoughts of both of her parents.  Woolf describes it as an unhealthy, debilitating obsession.  In writing To The Lighthouse, Woolf wrote that she was able to give voice to some long held and deeply felt emotions about her parents.  She said that by writing about it, she was thereby able to release these things and get on with her life.  She said she had always before that point been a skeptic of psychoanalytic treatment, but after this experience, she saw the value in it.  Vanessa Bell, Virginia's sister wrote that reading the novel was like seeing her mother \\""raised from the dead\\"".<br /><br />It is now believed by scholars that Woolf suffered from bipolar disorder.  In conceiving To The Lighthouse, Woolf said she went for a walk in Tavistock Square and the whole novel came to her in a big rush, and she instantly had all the images and feelings of it.  During the writing, Woolf would be in the manic phase of the disorder, but she could feel the imaginative effort of it pushing her equilibrium to the breaking point. Once she finished a first draft of a novel, the depression would then descend upon her.  The creative process and pursuing her art took a huge toll on the life of Virginia Woolf, but we are fortunate to have her many masterpieces of literature.r to society.

None of these are labels which she has given herself. When she is in those moments of alone she faces this blackness which is really what we are without the identity which others have given us.

Looking at people from a distance, she thinks that this way of identifying and following others through their outlines is one workable approach. It can be taken, as I believe it's meant to be, as an analogy for the whole form of the book. In a way it's a book of intensely realized, complex, three dimensional characters each of whom encounters the other as if the outsider were a two dimensional sketch, lacking real substance. More than direct conflict, this aspect of the perception renders a deep insubstantiality in the social ties that people build, and the deep distance that they build more effectively. The isolation doesn't emerge just from self-absorption, rather it's a sense of lacking the language or real community for authentic relation. In this amazingly writen account that manifests not in the major dramatic disconnect we might expect but in quiet, subdued points of systemic, often unnoticed, rupture.     It's a beautiful, heartfelt and deeply sophisticated novel. Says a lot about class, gender, family and the way such conditions shifted into the first world war, all in under two hundred pages.

And that was what now she often felt the need of--to think;  to be silent; to be alone.""","In what many call her most autobiographical novel, Virginia Woolf creates a warm and intimate  portrait of a family which resembles her own-her parents, brothers and sisters-and the friends with whom they enjoy their summer vacation on the Isle of Skye in the Hebrides.  Mrs. Ramsay, the mother of eight children, is the linchpin of the fictional family.  She adores her husband, and though she often feels she fails him, she persists in smoothing his way so that he can work, managing the house and children, and inviting large groups of his students and friends to visit.  Often strict and always right, Mr. Ramsay loves being the center of praise, but rarely praises others, and is often insensitive to the hopes and dreams of his children.<br /><br />In Part I, Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay, their children, several women and men (including philosophy students), for whom Mrs. Ramsay enjoys acting as a matchmaker, all contribute their thoughts as Virginia Woolf explores some of her favorite themes during the course of one day on the island.  Mrs. Ramsay's running commentary on her everyday life emphasizes her vision of the role of women and opens the question of whether or not it is possible for women to find a meaningful role in life outside of marriage.  The importance of the thinking life-with peripheral attention paid also to the artistically creative life-reflects the intellectual climate of England in the lead-up to the First World War, and the desire of many thinkers to create a significant intellectual legacy which will survive them.<br /><br />Part II, a brief bridge, ten years later, focuses on the changes which have taken place.  The war has begun and ended.  Many key characters have died, and Mr. Ramsay, devastated, also fears that all his writing will have been for naught.  In Part Three, what's left of the family returns to the house on Skye for a visit after a ten year absence.  Perhaps showing his personal growth and desire to atone for his previous insensitivity to James's desires, Mr. Ramsay now insists on making the trip to the lighthouse with teenagers James and his younger sister Cam, though James is no longer even interested in going.  James commands the boat, however, and receives unaccustomed praise.  Back on land, Lily Briscoe, a young woman artist for whom Mrs. Ramsay was hoping to be a matchmaker, decides to begin work again on an unfinished portrait of Mrs. Ramsay, and as she works, she also realizes a new kind of freedom for herself.<br /><br />Taking a modernist approach, Woolf has no primary narrator, instead slipping in and out of the minds of several characters as they think about life and observe life around them.  Her modified stream-of-consciousness allows her to create a vibrant, free-flowing atmosphere which she peoples with unique characters who have revealed their innermost thoughts.  The overall effect is powerful, and Woolf's often lyrical prose conveys the sights and sounds of life on the island at the same time that it also enlivens the highly philosophical but very personal portrait of family life.

It's a simple story, but painfully beautiful in the telling.<br /><br />Written entirely in stream of conciousness, Woolf takes it one-step further than most and jumps from the thoughts of one person to the next with little to no warning. This can make it difficult to follow for many, but I only lost myself once and quickly figured it out. This is a storytelling device that has always greatly appealled to me and Woolf did not disappoint. The prose itself was more poetry than anything and many of the passages the words are strung together so beautifully that I can only describe it as hearbreaking.

Despite taking place within a set period of time, from 1910-1920, the conflicts and themes presented transcend far beyond the scope of the novel.  \\""To The Lighthouse\\"" is a unique standard bearer for early modern literature.<br /><br />To say that \\""To The Lighthouse\\"" is a tale about the Ramsay family would be selling the book short.  While this family and their experiences are the core of the novel, Woolf delves into some heavy examination of the roles that males and females are meant to play in society.  Mrs. Ramsay is beloved by all for her extraordinary beauty, still evident in her fifties, but she is tied down by a demanding husband, eight very different children, and her own need to oversee every facet of people's lives.  Mr. Ramsay, a selfish philosopher, depends upon his wife to build his ego, no matter the expense or the damage caused to his children.  This examination of their lives takes place at their summer home on the Isle of Skye in Scotland with their various guests.  Woolf begins by painting a loving and generous portrait of the Ramsays (modeled upon her own parents) before moving the action of the novel ten years into the future after the family has experienced a few catastrophes that they struggle to get over.  The novel ends with the perspective of the outsiders, trying to make sense of what has been lost and what it means to life as a whole.<br /><br />Virgina Woolf was an exceptionally talented writer, able to make mundane details vivid and able to capture the intricacies of family life and marriage without seeming sentimental.  Her prose is poetic, following tangential thoughts to complete her circuitous paragraphs.

To say it's about a family vacationing by the shore, about the delicate relationships between them and their friends, about how time changes them and their relationships between each other...is to miss the point entirely even if it is perfectly accurate.<br /><br />--As I understand it, this is a novel in which ten years passes in about fifteen pages, while the rest of the novel meticulously describes two days.<br /><br />--Yes, exactly. Like Proust, Woolf  begins with a childhood incident that will echo down through the years. Like Joyce, she concentrates on the epiphanic moment. Reading \\""To the Lighthouse\\"" is a bit like viewing a painting in which the characters move...but very slowly. Woolf passes from character to character, inhabiting each of their minds in turn, seeing the world through their eyes. Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay and their flawed but enduring marriage are the central bodies around which the rest orbit and Lily Briscoe, a spinsterish amateur painter, ostensibly stands in for Woolf herself, but it is hard to say that any of the characters are less or more important than any of the others--this is essentially the genius of Woolf's handling of psychological perspective. Everyone has a point of view and each point of view is essential to attain a vision of the whole.<br /><br />--But it is a novel essentially about family relationships?<br /><br />--And relationships between men and women, men and society, women and society, human beings and the inescapable fact of their mortality. Again and again, Woolf asks the question, \\""What does life mean? What is it for?\\""<br /><br />--Does she have an answer?<br /><br />--Yes. And no.<br /><br />--It's ambiguous.<br /><br />--It's provisional. But it's enough to help Lily make it through the dark storm of life to use a perfectly horrible metaphor. It's her lighthouse.<br /><br />--Woolf has a reputation as a difficult author to read.<br /><br />--And it's well-deserved. She is a difficult read for the majority of readers, who, let's face it, are awaiting Dan Brown's new novel as if it were a major event in world literary history. What happens in \\""To the Lighthouse,\\"" when anything happens at all, isn't as important as how it affects each character internally. That is to say, Woolf's focus is on the fleeting but all-important impressions that the world leaves on us and that ultimately make us who we are. Her greatest gift is to capture these gossamer-thin states in a language of exquisite accuracy--capturing in words the flavor of fleeting emotions seldom if ever described before, even as they evaporate on the tongue.<br /><br />--You would have to love language, then, to fully appreciate her work.<br /><br />--Indeed. Her sentences don't move the story forward; they move the story deeper. She writes a poetic prose that many contemporary readers might mistake for unnecessarily flowery and overwrought--when, in fact, it is sharp as a surgeon's scalpel and cuts to the heart. And yet for all its surgical accuracy, it is the sensuous prose of a writer for whom language is like a box of brilliant colors is to a painter, for whom sentences are like caresses to a lover, except that in this case what is touched are the most potently orgasmic areas of our brains--needles to say, the ones most difficult areas to reach.<br /><br />--But Virginia Woolf reaches them?<br /><br />--You might say she's a master masseuse.<br /><br />--Ha ha.

I located the tattered copy from my school days and took a deep breath. Here is another phenomenal book by Virginia Woolf. Published in 1927, To the Lighthouse broke new ground and Virginia Woolf emerged as the chief figure of modernism--and perhaps feminism--in England.<br /><br />The book begins as Mrs. Ramsay, mother to eight children, speaks to her youngest child, James, age six, about his wish to go to the Lighthouse on the following day:<br /><br />\\""Yes, of course, if it's fine tomorrow,\\"" said Mrs. Ramsay. \\""But you'll have to be up with the lark\\"", she added.<br />To her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy, as if it were settled, the expedition bound to take place, and the wonder to which he looked forward to, for years and years it seemed, was, after a night's darkness and a day's sail, within touch.<br />~To the Lighthouse, Virginia Woolf<br /><br />However, Mr. Ramsay, as well as Charles Tansley, soon shatter the boy's hopes by saying that it will rain the next day, and that a trip to the Lighthouse is out of the question, which upsets both James and his devoted mother greatly. The setting for the story begins at the summer house at the Isle of the Skye during the summer, where the Ramsays entertain numerous friends in addition to their large family. Mrs. Ramsay tries to soothe the boy by saying that the weather may be fine, because she has a far greater understanding of her sensitive, gifted child than either her husband or his friend. Keenly aware of the beauty and brevity of childhood, she wants her children to be happy and hopeful, to be filled with light, in a world with ample darkness. The novel focuses on the intensity of childhood emotions, and highlights the impermanence of adult relationships and the transient nature of everything. The issue of the trip to the Lighthouse is brought up time and time again in the first section of To the Lighthouse, The Window, in which through repetition and stream-of-consciousness writing (Virginia Woolf's trademark style), the interior monologues of various characters are presented, seizing fleeting moods, feelings, thoughts, and insecurities, and the transient nature of things and relationships, giving permanence to these moments in the book, making them immortal--which seems to have been the author's goal. Like our own thoughts, which are often repetitious (and dare I say dull at times), the characters seem to tire of their own cyclical thoughts. At other times, their disjointed thoughts are featured. Virginia Woolf captures the dual reality of thought in To The Lighthouse, thought which is alternatively repetitive and disconnected. (Think about your own thinking--isn't it also this way?)<br /><br />Just as in the story the painter Lily Briscoe tries to capture beautiful Mrs. Ramsay in a painting (although Lily is scoffed at, and the male belief was that women could neither paint nor write) the book attempts to make the impermanent permanent, and portrays these fleeting moments brilliantly, especially those between husband and wife. This is Virginia's Woolf's most autobiographical novel, and her husband, Leonard Woolf, called it a masterpiece. Virginia Woolf broke from tradition in this three part book, a novel in which there's not much action or dialogue, but instead much thought, about the ordinary as well as about time and the fleeting nature of life. One of the book's main themes is the ubiquity of transience. Is there an antidote for this often disturbing transience? Virginia Woolf suggests to women that while family and human relationships are important (although difficult sometimes), creative work may hold the key--meaningful work that will engage and may even outlive us. In this way, transience may be transcended to some degree.<br /><br />(This review is from my blog about books, Suko's Notebook, suko95.blogspot.com.)through repetition and stream-of-consciousness writing (Virginia Woolf's trademark style), the interior monologues of various characters are presented, seizing fleeting moods, feelings, thoughts, and insecurities, and the transient nature of things and relationships, giving permanence to these moments in the book, making them immortal--which seems to have been the author's goal.

I shall read `To the Lighthouse.'\\""    The thought was not a new one to him, but this time, it had appeared in his mind almost before he realized that it had appeared. He did not know why it had appeared just now, but there it was. And it was a good thought, he decided, one that he would act upon, one he would make a success of.

The time is not right for you to read \\""To the Lighthouse.\\""     As soon as he thought it, the new thought infuriated him and he felt that if he had a knife, or a hatchet, or a blade of some sort, and if the thought had been a person, and not just a random thought, that he would pierce its heart with the blade and kill it. He was that upset about not being able to finish \\""To the Lighthouse\\"" when he had attempted to read it the first time.    He recalled the time he had first tried to read \\""To the Lighthouse.\\"" It was only a month or so ago. He could not recall the exact day, or the time, or even the month, but on one fine fall day, sitting in his office, Scot, sitting on the other side of the cubicle wall, had asked him, as he often asked such questions, if he had ever read Virginia Woolf. No, he had replied, he had not.    He searched his memory, seeking to find a title by Virginia Woolf that he could remember. Almost at once, he realized, after thinking about it for only a moment, that he had not ever read anything by Virginia Woolf, and wondered directly why he had not read anything she had written. In point of fact, he thought to himself, he did not even know the title of a single book by Virginia Woolf. It was strange.    Of course, he had heard of Virginia Woolf, as had anyone of his generation, for he could remember clearly the movie, what was it called, with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Oh, yes. \\""Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\"" That was the title of the movie. But he could recall little about the movie itself, and, because it was so many years ago, he had almost forgotten its title, or even what it was about, except that it was about a college professor and his frustrated wife, and something about an imaginary child. Beyond that, he could remember nothing about the film, and had in fact wondered, even as he had watched it, first in the theater and then several years later on a television rerun, what, indeed the movie had to do with Virginia Woolf. And many years later, now, brooding about the novels of Virginia Woolf and the movie \\""Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf,\\"" he was still perplexed as to what this film had to do with Virginia Woolf, for he could think of nothing, nothing at all, beyond the title, of course. Except that the husband, as played by Richard Burton, was a college English professor.    And as he often did with such thoughts, in this case, the thought that he should read a book by Virginia Woolf, he decided to follow up on it and find out more about Virginia Woolf and acquire one of her books to read. Online, he searched the catalog of the Dallas Public Library, and eventually, after discovering at last how to spell the name correctly, W-O-O-L-F and not W-O-L-F-E or some other such variation, he found the lengthy list of books written by Virginia Woolf, and was startled, for he usually knew such things, when he realized that he did not recognize even one of the titles.    In dismay, he had called back across the cubicle wall to Scot, who was sitting there patiently, doing what Scot does, whatever it is, to pass the time of day at the office. Which book by Virginia Woolf should he read, he had asked, and directly came back the reply, across the cubicle wall: \\""To the Lighthouse.\\"" Scot had said he should read \\""To the Lighthouse.\\""    Upon arriving home from the office that day, he had discovered that he had no other pressing obligations for the evening, and so he had collected his various things to return to the library, books he had finished, records he had played, library things, collected them all together and carried them out to the car, and driven into town, directly to the library. Shortly thereafter, on the third floor of the library, in the fiction section, correctly but not predictably filed under W, for the library had recently been rearranged, and sometimes books were taken off the shelf to be part of a temporary display, or even taken downstairs to entice patrons randomly seeking an interesting book to read, he had found a copy of \\""To the Lighthouse.\\""    Happily he checked it out, and took it home with him, with much anticipation of beginning it in the morning, for he planned to read it on the train while going to work.    Unfortunately, when he started it, sitting in his usual seat on the train the next morning, riding to work, he found the book uninteresting. He simply could not grasp its meaning, or follow the flow of its words, or the complexity of its sentences, or the vague and fleeting thoughts that Virginia Woolf had so carefully crafted for its pages. After all the weak romance novels, and slick mystery novels, and cheap crime thrillers, and clumsy science fiction stories that he had recently been reading, all written in the usual, direct, post-Hemingway style of contemporary American fiction, heavily laced with terse dialogue and carefully constructed plot twists according to standard formulas, the ephemeral beauty of Virginia Woolf's luxurious writing and lush prose and sketchy plot was able to make scarcely a dent in his shallow American consciousness.     So, after a few days of making little headway, even after what he considered to be an heroic effort, he snapped the book shut in confusion and frustration and put it aside. He did not like \\""To the Lighthouse,\\"" he told Scot the next day, and said that he had found it boring, and had put it aside. Reluctantly, of course, he had said, he had put it aside, for it was his usual custom to finish a book he had started, especially if it was a significant one, as in this case, a classic, like \\""To the Lighthouse.\\""    And Scot, rather unperturbed, as was his way, did not say anything much in response to his comment. He just said that he was reading it himself because of a school requirement and was happily deciphering its meaning. That is what Scot said he liked to do, in actual fact, to decipher meaning.    And so it was now weeks later, and there it was, still sitting on the table in his house, the copy of \\""To the Lighthouse\\"" he had not yet returned to the library. He saw it there sometimes, sitting on the table, and he felt that it was reproaching him, chiding him as it were, that he had not been able to finish it, scolding him because he had found it vague and frustrating and meaningless and finally, boring.    And then, just a week or so prior to his Christmas vacation, the new thought had occurred to him, the thought that he should read \\""To the Lighthouse\\"" again. Yes, he decided, he should read it again, and this time he would succeed, he was sure. He would try once again to read \\""To the Lighthouse.\\"" This time, he thought, he would learn how to decipher its intricate text, parse its lush sentences, and find a way to penetrate to the very core of its meaning. But this time, he would not read the book, page by page, depending on his visual faculties, his eyes, to communicate the words to his brain. No. Instead, this time, he would use his ears, his auditory senses, the senses that he, as a trained musician, most favored. He would listen to someone read the text tohim. Suddenly, he knew what he was going to do. He would listen to a recording of the book, read by an accomplished reader, in the car, on the trip he was about to take for his Christmas Holiday.    By a fortunate chance, he found another copy of \\""To the Lighthouse,\\"" an audio book on 7 CD's, eight hours long, narrated by a British actress called Virginia Leishman. And so he acquired it out and carried it with him in the car on his trip.    Time passed.    First, time passed in the car.     And then, the time of the Christmas Holidays passed, as well.    The long trip from Texas to South Carolina had taken two days, two long rainy days of bad restaurants and a cheap hotel room, and driving in the rain in heavy traffic trying to avoid an accident. And the music on the XM Radio he had just bought had managed to divert his attention away from the album of seven CD's carefully packed in the box on the back seat of his car, the audio book recording of \\""To the Lighthouse\\"" that he had obtained with such anticipation to wile away the long hours on a road trip of many days, such as this one.    When he had arrived at his destination, he still had not listened to his recording of \\""To the Lighthouse.\\"" And while on vacation, the busy activities of the Christmas season occupied his time to such an extent that he had little time to read, much less listen to a book on tape for eight hours at a time, or even in one hour segments.    The happy days of the Holidays sped by, those short days and long nights of fun and festivity and family warmth, passing by quickly in a whirlwind of parties and dinners and gatherings and church services, those family moments that are the happy custom of celebration during the Christmas season. Suddenly, almost in a flash, he realized that the holidays were over and the joyful family celebrations and parties and gatherings were finished and it was time for him to return home.    With both a feeling of relief that the hectic holiday schedule was quicklydrawing to a close, and yet with a tinge of regret that he would leave behind him once again the loving arms of his dear mother and the good-will of his family to return to his self sufficient life style, he began to make his plans for the long trek west, the journey of more than one thousand miles that he would make to return home.    On the morning of his departure, as he carefully loaded his belongings back into the car, he saw the audio book recording of \\""To the Lighthouse\\"" carefully packed in the box he had placed on the back seat. This time, on this leg of his journey, he thought, he really was going to read \\""To the Lighthouse.\\"" At last, he was ready to listen attentively. And so he reached behind the seat and into the box to pull out the album that contained the collection of CD's that was the recording of \\""To the Lighthouse.\\"" He carefully placed it on the front seat of the car, within arms reach, and then placed beside it the portable CD player that he had brought along just for that purpose. Yes. Today he would listen to \\""To the Lighthouse,\\"" and began at once to feel a strong sense of anticipation for the reading.    But the driving conditions were poor that morning, with clouds and wind and rain and generally bad weather threatening to make the driving difficult. For that reason, he feared that, if his attention were diverted from the recorded performance by the strain of driving, he would fail in his endeavor to make a success of the reading of \\""To the Lighthouse.\\"" Furthermore, in case he became too involved in the story, he was somewhat frightened at the thought of having his attention averted from the road during a difficult traffic maneuver, thus putting himself in danger of an accident. For this reason, for both of these reasons, for all of these reasons, in fact, he decided to postpone his reading of \\""To the Lighthouse\\"" until after he had passed over the mountains of South and North Carolina and had descended onto the plains of eastern Tennessee, where the road gradually wound down out of the mountains and gently stretched across nearly 400 miles of fertile farmland to the Mississippi River, and beyond. Making one last stop to say farewell to his mother, he carefully guided the car out onto the highway and began the difficult journey through the mountains.    The drive was indeed difficult, and the pavement, wet because of the clouds and the wind and the rain and the generally bad weather, and the heavy traffic, and the condition of the highway, which wound slowly up the steep mountain sides and then plunged down quickly, deep into the valleys, where the road ran alongside rushing rivers swollen with newly fallen rain, impeded his progress and required that he concentrate fully on the road.    On one occasion, he came upon the flashing lights of a police cruiser and an ambulance, and surreptitiously glanced at the accident and its victims as he crept by, his progress hampered by the traffic backup. Someone may have died here, he reflected, and wondered what his own fate would be if he failed to negotiate the mountain roads successfully. But no, he conceded, such a circumstance was unlikely, and he drove on. As he drove, he recalled from time to time the empty seat next to him, the seat empty of a passenger, but in which he had placed his audio book recording of \\""To the Lighthouse,\\"" and anticipated in his mind the time when he would be able to listen to it and give it his full attention.    Finally, after three intense hours of driving through the steep mountains in the rain and the wind and the generally bad weather, he crossed from North Carolina into Tennessee. A short time later, he stopped at the first rest stop which appeared alongside the highway. And after taking a moment to refresh himself, he was able to relax and feel the stress of driving through the mountains in bad weather begin to melt away. In a few moments, he was renewed and invigorated and climbed back into his car to continue his journey.He re-entered the highway and joined the swiftly flowing stream of traffic driving west along the Interstate. Gradually, just as he knew it would, the road left the mountains and descended onto the gently rolling plains of eastern Tennessee. With a sigh of relief, and knowing that the trip would quickly assume a familiar routine, he settled back for the long drive that would take him through Knoxville, and Nashville, and Memphis, and Little Rock, before turning south towards Shreveport, bringing him finally to his destination, Dallas.    Now, he decided. Yes. Now is the time to read \\""To the Lighthouse.\\""    Awkwardly, while keeping his eyes on the road, he reached over to the passenger seat, found the CD player, and clumsily hooked it up. Then, fumbling around again until he found the album that contained the audio book recording of \\""To the Lighthouse,\\"" he opened it and extracted the first CD, which he placed, still somewhat awkwardly, for it is tricky to manage a CD player and drive at the same time, into the player. He punched the button on the machine, adjusted the volume, and the words floated out of the speakers and into the car.    \\""'To the Lighthouse'\\"" by Virginia Woolf. Disk One,\\"" came the announcer's voice. Then the reader, Virginia Leishman, intoned: \\""Prologue. Chapter One.\\""    He began to listen, and he listened for the next 800 miles, and, listening intently, he immersed himself in Virginia Woolf's story of the Ramsay family, their summer vacation on the Isle of Skye, and their son James' much anticipated and long delayed journey to the lighthouse.    \\""Well done,\\"" he thought, two days later, when it was finished. And he was pleased as he congratulated himself in his own private way, because he had listened to \\""To the Lighthouse\\"" in its entirety, and found it enjoyable.    Thus, he put the finishing touch on his trip, the trip that was his Christmas vacation.    ***    A short time afterwards, only a few days, really, he reflected on his experience of reading \\""To the Lighthouse\\"" as an audio book.    The trick to reading Virginia Woolf, he decided, is in knowing where to break the sentences, where to pause, and where to separate the subordinate clauses, so that the sentences parse correctly. If one does this incorrectly, as often happens on first reading of the printed page, the effect can be jarring, when, for example, a noun is unfortunately connected with the wrong verb, causing the sentence to go in the wrong direction, or parts of the sentence are left dangling. If such a thing happens, and it is likely to happen often on a first reading, the only solution for the reader is to re-read the sentence until it parses correctly, and the proper meaning emerges. This makes for slow going at first, when reading printed text, but if one can get the knack of the Woolf style, and if the reader perseveres, and is willing to make the effort to do a second reading whenever necessary, the inherent beauty of the text will soon emerge.    This unfortunate problem is nearly absent when one listens to the story read aloud as an audio book. On the recording, the reader, in this case Virginia Leishman, on the audio book version of \\""To the Lighthouse\\"" published by Recorded Books, Inc., has of necessity, already analyzed the material, and the sentences as they are read have an ebb and flow of natural speech that is eminently satisfying. Also, the text takes on a transparent, poetic quality, as of carefully constructed blank verse, which allows the listener's imagination to free itself from the printed page, visualize in the mind's eye the situations and places described in the story, and immerse itself in the thoughts, emotions and utterances of Virginia Woolf's characters.     Listing to Virginia Woolf's prose, when read aloud and properly delivered, is both soothing and exciting. Her story, with the most sketchy of plots, and carefully constructed out of the most mundane of events of daily life, the painting of a picture, sewing, shopping, a chance encounter on the road, the preparation of a meal, and the chit chat of diners sitting at table, becomes both engaging and exciting to the listener, who feels himself becoming involved as part of the inner being of the various characters as they engage themselves in the shifting scene around them and react to the situations they encounter. Even if the mind occasionally wanders while the reading continues, it does not matter much, for in such cases, the listener's inner voice will merely merge into the texture of the tale, while the subconscious mind will continue listening to the words being read aloud, and quickly pull one back into the story after only a short moment.    The plot of \\""To the Lighthouse\\"" is a simple one.    The story begins in the year 1910. The Ramsay family is on vacation from London and living in a cottage they own in Scotland, on the Isle of Skye. There are eight children in the family. Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay have also invited several guests to join them for the summer.    James, Mrs. Ramsay's youngest son, who is six, asks if they can go to the lighthouse the next day. Mrs. Ramsay agrees, but Mr. Ramsay contradicts his wife and tells his son the weather will be bad. James is very disappointed.    That evening there is a dinner party, and the next morning, the weather is indeed wrong for a boat trip to the lighthouse.    10 years pass. Mrs. Ramsay has died of unknown causes, Andrew, the oldest son, has been killed in World War I, and Prue, the oldest daughter, has died in childbirth after a short marriage. The Ramsay cottage on the Isle of Sky falls into ruin.    The year is now 1920. Mr. Ramsay decides to come back to the cottage for the summer one more time. The cottage is quickly put in order, and Mr. Ramsay arrives with James and his sister Cam and a few guests.     During this stay, Mr. Ramsay decides to take James to the lighthouse. James, who is now 16, guides the boat through the billowing waves, so that the group arrives safely. \\""Well done,\\"" says Mr. Ramsey to James when they arrive safely at the lighthouse, and James is secretly pleased to receive this simple declaration of praise from his demanding father. Finally, James has had his visit to the lighthouse. It is a moment of intense satisfaction for the reader.",2008-01-10

It wasn't meant for me, and it is not one that I'll ever re-visit, but I can acknowledge that it is a minor classic.    Much like the far superior Under the Volcano, this book focuses on how the thing is said, and not the thing itself. The plot is spare and banal, and what little action there is is tangential: what matters to Woolf is the inner psychology, the interpersonal dynamics, the thoughts, perceptions, emotions and feelings.     The book has a calamitous exordium, populated with clunkers such as this:    \\""Then, up behind the great black rock, almost every evening spurted irregularly, so that one had to watch for it and it was a delight when it came, a fountain of white water, and then, while one waited for that, one watched, on the pale semicircular beach, wave after wave shedding again and again smoothly, a film of mother of pearl.\\""    But, gradually, the lyricism and prose pick up, and become almost sublime in many parts.

US,48838075,R3H98WO5QGB9KE,0156907399,762777669,To the Lighthouse,Books,5,5,8,N,N,"Painted lives","An extraordinary book, at once light as air and dense with meaning. From the smallest happenings (a family gathered at a seaside house) seen in two brief glimpses (a long summer afternoon before the first world war, and a single morning ten years later), Virginia Woolf distils a profound meditation on love and loss, hope and disappointment, and human relationships, especially the precarious and limiting balance between men and women. But it is impossible to summarize in a sentence what Woolf achieves in two hundred pages, so let me just pick on three specifics: art, thought, and time.<br /><br />ART. The Harcourt Harvest Book paperback edition has a beautiful cover, apparently a tinted turn-of-the century photograph of a beach with the sea and a lighthouse beyond. It is a perfect evocation of the period and of lazy summers by the sea. Yet the credits say it is adapted from a photo by a much later artist, Herbert List; presumably the period air and the uncanny overtones of Seurat's \\""Grande Jatte\\"" are the work of the designer, Liz Demeter. I mention this partly because a book's cover is like incidental music; it creates the context in which you start reading, and this is perfect. But also because visual art also plays an important part in the book. One of the guests of the owners of the house, the Ramsays, is Lily Briscoe, an unmarried woman in her thirties. We first see her as she is painting in the garden: \\""Lily's picture! Mrs. Ramsay smiled. With her little Chinese eyes and her puckered-up face, she would never marry; one could not take her painting very seriously.\\"" So of course we take her for a mere amateur; and Lily similarly puts herself down, conditioned by a climate which denied creativity to women except as wives and mothers. But when we get to look closer at Lily's picture we see that it is extremely advanced for its time, and her thought processes are as rigorous as anything we hear from the paterfamilias Mr. Ramsay, a once-celebrated philosopher. Indeed in the glorious closing chapters of the book, it is Lily, struggling to express balance and feeling in paint, who comes closest to giving meaning and permanency to the whole family history. One recalls that one of Virginia Woolf's closest friends in the Bloomsbury Group was the art critic Roger Fry, who coined the term post-impressionism. Lily, far from being a minor character, stands as the alter ego of Woolf herself, achieving in touches of paint a very close analogy to what the author manages so marvelously in words.<br /><br />THOUGHT. But fine as Virginia Woolf's visual descriptions are, her main medium is not sight but thought. The two days at the seaside are described entirely through the minds of various individual members of the family and their guests. There is occasional dialogue, but no third-person narrator. A paragraph may start with the thoughts of one person about another, switch smoothly to the mind of that other person, and then return to the first again. And often the thoughts of the first character will change significantly between one moment and the next. Affection can switch suddenly to anger and back again; Woolf knows that most emotions, especially given the complex ties that bind families, can seldom be contained by a single label; through her apparent contradictions, she builds up a truth that is richer than could have been attained by consistency alone. Again, I think of the visual arts and the multiple viewpoints of cubism, but though a modern writer, Woolf is not a modern-ist; her technique is concealed, not flaunted; she is not a \\""difficult\\"" writer in the sense that Joyce or even Faulkner are. As a results, her portraits come through with great warmth, especially that of Mrs. Ramsay, willingly adopting a supporting role to her curmudgeonly husband (or almost willingly -- with Woolf that is important), but blessed with a radiance of personality that illuminates the entire book, even when she is not at the center of it.<br /><br />TIME. Most novels tell a story that unfolds gradually over the course of time; this doesn't. The outer sections of the book take place virtually in real time; the action happens at about the same speed as it takes to read about it. But for all intents and purposes, these sections are static compared to the ten-year duration of the narrative as a whole. Only one thing happens in either of the outer sections that could really be called an event, and that involves two minor characters whose relationship to the Ramsays is never clearly specified. But that does not mean lack of movement. The rapidly shifting juxtapositions and viewpoints build up a dense texture of relationships and feelings that reach a certain stability at the close of the first (and longest) section, but leave you wanting more. In painting terms again, one might call this opening a still life -- except that the various figures in it are now linked by quasi-electrical charges, so that the balance between them is not static but dynamic, presently in equilibrium but capable of further motion. In effect, you could close the book at this moment and write your own narrative. Instead, Virginia Woolf does something quite extraordinary. In the ten short chapters of the twenty-page interlude entitled \\""Time Passes,\\"" she takes on the role of narrator for the first time, and tells what happens in the next few minutes, the remainder of that night, the ensuing nights, the changing seasons, the course of the War, and the passage of years. She writes of impersonal things -- the house, the garden, the wind, the sea -- throwing in small nuggets of personal information almost as afterthoughts. When the Ramsays finally return, much has changed, and the former golden days seem tarnished. But by the end of this marvelous novel, Virginia Woolf has burnished them to a new shine, less brilliant perhaps, but deeper and more lasting.hat unfolds gradually over the course of time; this doesn't.

I think that this type of written review is necessary in order to let other readers know that it will be a difficult read; however, by giving it one star, the reviewer misleads by implying that the book is not worth reading, and this might discourage others from making the effort, and perhaps getting much more out of the novel than its one-star reviewers.    To the Lighthouse is worth the struggle if one is willing to put in the time. My recommendation to serious readers is to go to outside sources - either through Amazon, online resources, or the library - that will help in understanding the book. In this way a profound novel will get its due and readers will have the beautiful experience that only this book can afford.",2006-09-05

Events occur in the outside world, but the real action in the book takes place in interior worlds.  Woolf mostly focuses on two women: Mrs. Ramsay, who finds happiness, of a sort, in marriage and Lily Briscoe, who finds happiness, of a sort, alone. <br /> <br />The action in the first part of the book, \\""The Window,\\"" takes place during part of a day and an evening as the Ramsay family and some of their friends and acquaintances gather for a dinner.   <br /> <br />In the second part of the book, \\""Time Passes,\\"" the last light is turned out, ten years pass, and, parenthetically, the reader learns of some major developments: Mrs. Ramsay and two of her children die and a family friend becomes famous.

Nothing, it seemed, could survive the flood, the profusion of darkness which, creeping in at keyholes and crevices, stole round window blinds, came into bedrooms, swallowed up here a jug and basin, there a bowl of red and yellow dahlias, there the sharp edges and firm bulk of a chest of drawers. ...  But what after all is one night?  A short space, especially when the darkness dims so soon, and so soon a bird sings, a cock crows, or a faint green quickens, like a turning leaf, in the hollow of a wave.  Night, however, succeeds to night.  The winter holds a pack of them in store and deals them equally, evenly, with indefatigable fingers.\\"" <br /> <br />In the last part of the book, \\""The Lighthouse,\\"" a few of the characters introduced in \\""The Window\\"" gather again.

In To the Lighthouse there are brief glimpses of beauty in regards to nature, feelings and experience. Yet, the underlying emotion in this book seems to be a subtle frustration.

Basing the novel's central character of Mrs. Ramsay on her mother and Mr. Ramsay on her father, the well known philosopher Leslie Stephen, Virgnia Woolf strove to recreate artistically the mysteries and vagaries of time. The novel is divided unevenly into two sections, both of them dealing with possible or actual trips to the lighthouse in the vicinity of the Isle of Skye where the Ramsay family has a house that they use on summer holidays. Rarely in English fiction has the inner dynamics of a family been laid so completely bare as in this.<br /><br />One of the most enjoyable things about this book is the way Virginia Woolf so probingly explores the personalities of the individuals, though three stand out above all others, the aforementioned mother and father, and the unmarried amateur painter Lily Briscoe. By the end of the novel, we feel that we know all of these characters on the deepest possible level, and while the two women are sketched more lovingly, it is the father, Mr. Ramsay, who is etched in his essence. Brilliant, but with striking emotional and intellectual limitations, he is both the head of the family and its bane. It isn't that the author dislikes him, but she is acutely aware of his vices and virtues (in her own life, Virginia's father despaired over his wife's early death, creating an atmosphere of gloom over Virginia's teen-aged years). The two women are plumbed less deeply, but we come away from the novel having a sense of their worth.<br /><br />TO THE LIGHTHOUSE was revolutionary when it appeared as one of the first attempts to profit from many of the lessons to be taught English language fiction by the extraordinary work of Marcel Proust. Woolf had a love/hate relationship with Proust, on the one hand recognizing very early on that he was the great literary genius of the century (Joyce, on the other hand, the other titan of the century, she thought less highly of), but finding his work so brilliant as to paralyze her. She famously remarked that after reading Proust she felt incapable of writing anything. But the fact is that TO THE LIGHTHOUSE is in many ways a Proustian work. Like Proust and unlike almost no one prior in English literature (with the notable exception of Butler's THE WAY OF ALL FLESH), Woolf fictionalized her own life (she herself appears in the novel as the girl Cam) and produced a profound analysis of the nature of passed time. Also like Proust, she attempts to break down traditional narrative and present her story impressionistically rather than historically. While she may have felt that Proust kept her from writing, the fact is that she produced the first literary masterpiece following in the footsteps of Proust.<br /><br />But in the end, what makes this most remarkable is the rich detailing, the marvelous nuances, the lush delineations. This is a book to be read slowly and savored, much as one would read a long poem.

The illusion is part due to its layering and weave - dense as poetry, light as air, not a word accidental.  And part due to the structure of the novel, its great invisible solidity fixed under imagery and detail moving over it like transparent veils.  Its parts are elemental: water, air, sunlight, seaweed - frilled strips pinned to the attic walls, or later trailing around Cam's fingers in the water when the sails fill.  Part of the pleasure in reading To the Lighthouse is the revelation of its interlocking structure, how the macro-structure of the novel is reflected everywhere on the micro-scale.  An example: the three sections of the novel and their pace are seen again in the trajectory of the sailboat across the bay in the final section, where the wind takes it, then dies down, then moves again.<br /><br />The passages describing Lily Briscoe at work on her paintings seem to reflect a kind of rapture in which Woolf must have written this novel: \\""...with all her faculties in a trance, frozen over superficially but moving underneath with extreme speed.\\""  \\""It was in that moment's flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to tears...\\""  And \\""She was not inventing; she was only trying to smooth out something she had been given years ago folded up; something she had seen.\\"" But some of them describe the novel itself, which has all the feel of a ghost story: \\""It was to be a thing you could ruffle with your breath; and a thing you could not dislodge with a team of horses.\\""<br /><br />In fact, much of the novel - like the light and dark of the lighthouse beacon, or waves crashing in and back out - works in a balanced opposition: Crowdedness and the lack of privacy juxtaposed against the condition of utter aloneness.  The bond between Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay counterbalanced with their awareness of what they've cost one another.  The collusion of the children, their secretiveness and wildness, but then their docility and vulnerability.  Trapped thoughts that can't be told, but are then understood without saying, as the same reflection - like quantum tunneling - might wind from one point of view to the mind of a different character.<br /><br />In part II the sound of bombs falling in the distance is described as \\""the measured blows of hammers on felt.\\""  There are lines like that, which come in so lightly, but their impact on landing is powerful: the novel itself explodes in your heart like a silent H-bomb.  One example is the last line in paragraph #3 in chapter XII of part 3, which I won't give away.  (And don't sneak ahead: it won't mean anything unless you've arrived there in the right order!)  And this one about James, belonging as he does to the unspecified \\""great clan\\"" mentioned on page one: \\""He was so pleased that he was not going to let anyone share a grain of his pleasure.  His father had praised him.  They must think that he was perfectly indifferent.  But you've got it now, Cam thought.\\""  Many of the details in To the Lighthouse you might not even notice on first read, but when you go back they surprise you.  This is  part of the secret of the novel's geode-like quality, where you never guess what's contained inside it until you've seen the whole thing and it opens for you, then you see it.  Another Amazon reviewer was right in saying this: you have to read it twice.<br /><br />Although a short novel, To the Lighthouse contains so many themes: vision and seeing, nature at odds with human life, time and its nonlinear movement, community and individual isolation.  It's about what Mr. Ramsay knew: how \\""...our brightest hopes are extinguished, our frail barks founder in darkness\\"" and what James knew: \\""That loneliness which for both of them was the truth about things.\\""  It's about things you want, and do or do not get: whether you want to go to the lighthouse, or whether you don't want to go; whether anyone will get to Sorley, the lighthouse keeper, with tobacco and newspapers, or whether he'll remain isolated out there; whether Lily will capture what she sees on her canvas; whether Paul Rayley will find Minta's lost brooch.

I first encountered this style reading James Joyce's \\""A Portrait of and Artist as a Young Man,\\"" and later was amazed to see it perfected by William Faulkner in \\""The Sound and the Fury\\"" I have to admit, this style of writing was starting to grow on me......that is until I read Woolfe's version of stream of conscious in \\""To the Lighthouse\\"" which in my opinion is a failure of epic proportions.  What makes it an even greater failure is the fact that some people consider this one of the greatest books ever written.  To speak the honest truth, I can't remember I time when I have not enjoyed reading a book, as much as I didn't enjoy reading this one.    According to \\""expert\\"" analysis, To the Lighthouse is supposed to use a mixture of symbolism in random thinking to show a portrait of characters that are searching for the meaning of life.  The actual Lighthouse is a different symbol to each individual character.    To the Lighthouse is also supposedly a dead on accurate view of gender roles and differences between men and women, and every character represents a different piece of this gender puzzle.  I have read what the \\""experts\\"" say, but I will let you be the judge.    The novel does have an original way of telling its story.  It drifts from character to character without ever telling us when, and lets us know the thoughts they are thinking.  These vague thoughts tell a story as they are strung along.  I wish I could explain the plot, but there really isn't one.  The story opens at the Ramsey's vacation home where we learn mainly about Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, and their assortment of guests.  Guests like the painter, Lily, and the sexist Charles, and the dignified Mr. Banks.  The first half of the story brings us in and out of their minds.  Your mind will wander more than the writing style as you desperately try to grasp what the hell is goingon, and wondering if anybody really thinks like this in real life.  The thoughts of these characters are borderline absurd, and the most amazing aspect of all is that by the end of the novel I didn't know a single thing more about these characters than I did when it started.  All I know is the nonsense, abstract thoughts they think.  I don't know a thing about their beliefs or character.    The only one I felt I knew a thing about was Mr. Ramsey.

I wish I could tell you more of what it was about, but it really isn't about anything.  I can picture a conversation I might have later in life about this novel and I think it might go something like this:  \\""So, did you ever read that book called To the Lighthouse?\\""  \\""I think so, I can't really recall.\\"" (Myself)  \\""What was it about?\\""  \\""You know, I don't really know, I don't think it was about anything really.\\"" (Myself)  It has been a day, and already these words ring true.

The ending with its multiple perspectives - those on the boat, and those on the shore - is wonderful, and with just the right mix of the visionary. It's almost a ghost story, but nothing like any other ghost story I've read.<br /><br />No matter where I picked the book up, and took up reading again, I was fascinated. I could feel the holiday the characters were experiencing as if I was there at the seaside even though I have only had one short holiday in Britain. But, then, I suspect that family life and the desultory holiday experience was very similar here in Australia. I don't really mean desultory, but the routine holiday venue with its hours of no-work, no-school often had a strange feeling of tedium mixed with the 'excitement' of something different from routine. Unfortunately, reading this book also resurrected the feeling in me - the book too well records the feeling - and I quickly found myself drifting off into my own private world and not regarding the words as well as I should - only to be fascinated again as my attention snapped back.<br /><br />The book is wonderful for its multiple perspectives. Here is an example of a change of view mid-paragraph (this sort of thing often had me re-reading as my attenton drifted).<br /><br />\\""What damned rot they talk, thought Charles Tansley, laying down his spoon precisely in the middle of his plate, which he had swept clean, as if Lily thought (he sat opposite her with his back to the window precisely in the middle of view), he were determined to make sure of his meals.

She liked his eyes: they were blue, deep set, frightening.\\""<br /><br />The stream-of-consciousness writing style used by Woolf as closely as anything I have experienced imitates the greatest attribute of fine music - counterpoint - the ability of the mind to track and appreciate many strands of experience at the one time, to flick back and forth between many voices.

I suspect you could do this with several readings of 'To the Lighthouse' too.

Most authors structure their novels in the traditional rising action, climax, falling action manner.  A linear line of plot is most often the key to their works.  In Woolf's novels, she eschews such straight line plotting in favor of a weirdly blended kaleidoscopic view that makes relentless use of both a stream of consciousness narrator and interior monologues.  In TO THE LIGHTHOUSE, Woolf tells the tale of a married couple, the Ramsays, who lived in England just before the First World War.  The Ramsays are the prototypical Victorian family replete with servants, a summer beach house, eight children, and a keen awareness of the fragility of life.  What happens to them is neither earth shaking nor memorable.  What happens within them is of far greater consequence.  As Woolf focuses on each character, she presents a highly subjective view of the internal thought processes of that character.  Each thought is like a ripple caused by a stone thrown into a still pool.  Woolf allows her character to meander not only spatially (from point to point) but also chronologically.  Events are described as if they were occurring within the literal present, but most often the events are from the past merging into the future.  Thus, the plot ripple pool is constantly crosscutting each other with events removed from each other both in space and in time.  It is no wonder, then, that readers unfamiliar with such an expanding and contracting temporal flux are confused.  Woolf challenges her readers to involve themselves in a manner that requires a dedication to reading not often found in more traditionally structured novels.<BR>     <BR>As one reads from section to section (there are three: The Window, Time Passes, and The Lighthouse), one becomes aware that the novel's primary symbols--the lighthouse, Lily's painting, the sea, and the internalized thought processes of Mrs. Ramsay--functionin a manner that does not become clear until after one has read considerably into this admittedly puzzling work.  The initial clue lies within the title of the book: &quot;To the Lighthouse.&quot;  Thus, the lighthouse is seen both as a starting point in a journey (its radiating beacon of light lies close to the Ramsay's summer home) and a destination in that the youngest of the Ramsays, James, wants to go there, but it takes him ten years to do so.  Lily is Lily Briscoe, a close friend of the Ramsays who seems to have difficulty painting a portrait of Mrs. Ramsay, no great surprise there since that portrait points not so much to Mrs. Ramsay as it does to an abiding life-long interest of Virginia Woolf herself: the desire to impose order and form on a universe that is inherently chaotic.  It is crucial to note that Lily succeeds only at the very end of the novel when Mrs. Ramsay has long been dead, thus emphasizing the ephemeral nature of her task.  Mrs. Ramsay's personality also is a barometer of Woolf's belief that the post Great War society of England would forevermore be seen as formless as Mrs. Ramsay's meandering thoughts.  The first section &quot;The Window&quot; forms the bulk of the book.  It is here that Woolf depicts a rather ordinary family who collectively symbolizes the inability of individuals to leave an abiding footprint on the shifting sands of time.  In the second part &quot;Time Passes,&quot; time does indeed pass, ten years worth.  The home of the Ramsays falls into decay that requires the re-entry of the surviving family members to invigorate it and themselves in the final section &quot;The Lighthouse.&quot; Lily's painting of the now deceased Mrs. Ramsay allows Virginia Woolf to claim even a minor victory in the ultimately losing battle against cultural entropy.<br />I suspect that the major reason that most readers have with this book lies in their immediate recognition that they have to pay a great deal of attention to psychological free associating.  As the characters' thoughts bounce off each other both temporarily and spatially, so must those of the readers, a most imposing task.  But for those with persistence and an eye for the nontraditional in plotting, the effort is usually worth it.",2004-04-16

The story focuses on 2 days in the life of a large middle class family, with a middle interlude where the family's house is the major character. The setting is the family's summer home, filled with house guests. The action, however, is all internal, the chronology hazy and the events--to the extent anything really \\""happens\\"" at all--rather mundane. <br />This all made for tough going until it \\""clicked\\"" around p. 50. What Woolf does is create in real time not \\""real\\"" events but what is going on within--that constant stream of thoughts and emotions that remains hidden from the world. Woolf spends a long time on a simple scene of Mrs. Ramsay reading a story to her 6 year old son. In the space of a few short minutes as she reads aloud Mrs. Ramsay considers whether an engagement she has been encouraging between two of her guests will occur, feels trapped between her son's desire to go to the lighthouse and her husband's cruel squelching of the idea, worries about the bill to repair the greenhouse, and underlying all senses impending doom just beyond the horizon. Another example is Woolf's description of the interior struggle of Lily as she paints in a style that happens not to be in fashion at the time.

However, I was in the mood for &quot;To the Lighthouse,&quot; and I thought it was terrific.<br />I've been much more intrigued by Virginia Woolf after Michael Cunningham's &quot;The Hours,&quot; (and the subsequent film) brought her back into the limelight.  She was fascinated with the degree to which everyday, seemingly trivial details of life can seem to be matters upon which the state of the world hinge in the lives of those experiencing them.  Therefore, in Virginia Woolf's world, the decision as to whether or not a vacationing family will visit a lighthouse on the following day becomes the focus of everyone's thoughts--to a little boy, it seems as if his world will end if he doesn't get to go; to the father, his ability to determine whether or not they will go gives him a sense of power and authority over his wife and children.<br />And at the center of all this non-drama is Mrs. Ramsay, wife and mother, who is the foundation upon which the family is built.  Woolf is expert in communicating the influence Mrs. Ramsay has on those around her.  Everyone is struck by her beauty, her bearing, her very existence.  It's this quality in her that makes so many wives and mothers the center of their respective families, which gives &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; a sort of universality that resonated very strongly with me.<br />There has been a lot of literary study on the psychology of the novel (especially Freudian), which has become somewhat less interesting as Freud has become commonplace.  I would instead appreciate it for the utter mastery of language exhibited by Woolf, and the insights she has into male/female relationships.<br />&quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; is one of those books that left me feeling incredibly sad in a very satisfied way, and I can't even tell you why.  I don't always enjoy such ethereal writing (I don't even enjoy other books by Woolf) but in this case I enjoyed every word.",2003-12-02

The book is not concerned with plot, but more with symbolism and human emotions and truths about life and the role of women in 20th century English society. <BR>  For someone who had never encountered Modernist writing style, I found Woolf's stream of consciousness wrting style extremely refreshing. It switches between characters' thoughts and the story so fluently that although it is occasionally confusing, overall, it makes the book more of a cohesive whole. <BR>  Of course, I can't deny that I used Sparknotes to fully understand the book. But that was because I had to comment on symbolism in my reading log, and some of Woolf's symbolism is hard to understand.  However, you don't need to use Sparknotes to understand this book.  I understood everything without them but still used them because I love this book so much that I wanted to know everything about it! (And I have never felt that way about summer reading before.)<BR>  This book was really fascinating and was an interesting insight into the social heirarchy of the 20th century and the roles of women in that society.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Lily Briscoe and Mrs. Ramsay, and I think that their struggles are those that any woman can relate to. Overall, I would say that To the Lighthouse is a masterpiece and is a must-read for any woman, especially women writers.

I think that anyone who focuses too much on the phallic symbolism of the Lighthouse itself in this work does so to their own detriment.  Why?  Because To the Lighthouse could perhaps be Virginia Woolf's most finely crafted work.  <br />If one were to look too deeply into the symbolism they may miss the beautifully painted character portrait of Mrs. Ramsey as the stolid maternal who really holds the family, household, and social interactions of her husband together while he goes about dreaming and philosophizing, only to have to pick the pieces up later when she dies and he is left alone.<br />To the Lighthouse is filled with wonderful and memorable characters.  Not just Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, but also Lila Briscoe the aritst, and Minta Doyle the carefree young almost self absorbed girl in a woman's body.  Then there is Mr. Carmichael who appears kind of an old wizened sage who remains somewhat aloof but finally finds success as a poet at the end of the novel.  There's Tansley the anti-social atheist intellectual who may still have a softer side somewhere beneath his cold exterior...the list goes on and on...and by now I'm probably rambling, but anyway, To the Lighthouse is Virgina's Woolf best and everyone who reads it should be able to find something they can appreciate about it.",2003-08-19

And time is a critical element in this novel whose beginning paints a very insular setting, the small-scale world according to<BR>Mrs. Ramsay. The season is summer and it is an annual event that she, her husband and eight children, a coterie of Mr. Ramsay's academic-type admirers and a spinster with a love of painting, adjourn to the Ramsay's seaside household. <br />The story's unfolding is mirrored in the manner of Mrs. Ramsay's thinking...all internal: about her husband; her children; their family friends; an anticipated engagement; marriage in general and her own in particular; and her husband's preoccupation with his academic career. Without a doubt, Mrs. Ramsay is the glue that holds this little, private cocoon together.<br />Mr. Ramsay, succinctly put, is self-centered. He's introspective; he's occupied with his achievements; and \\""reaching Z\\"" is an all-absorbing goal! Contemplative walking and pacing seem to be among his favorite pastimes and his amblings provide him more space to contemplate \\""I, I, I\\"" as aptly described by Lily Briscoe, an amateur artist. At times it seems as if being the father of eight, even though his wife shields him from much of the routine of family life... including household expenses...serves as a hindrance to his further achievements. He is a man of logic and will not even tolerate his youngest child's yearnings to go to the lighthouse because the weather on the following day will most assuredly not \\""be fine\\"" as Mrs. Ramsay tries to assure the child it will be.<br />There is an occasional sadness and distance about Mrs. Ramsay that manifests following her husband's frequent petulant scenes. Nonetheless she plays her roles to absolute perfection: mother, wife, and nurturer to all including their guests. She sees their shortcomings but accepts them and fosters each in her own way according to their perceived needs.<br />Women are relegated to minor roles; it is the men who are the intelligent ones. And Mr. Ramsay conjectures that much of what his wife reads she may not understand. Yet the couple loves one another... each person according to his own capacity. Mrs. Ramsay is obviously her husband's fan, the one who bolsters him and protects and nurtures him...and the reader is privy to all her thoughts accordingly. There is a glimmer, too, of her disappointment in him, his self-centeredness and his sole reliance on logic.<br />Age (a mechanism employed to show the passage of time) is also a theme in \\""To the Lighthouse\\"". Mrs. Ramsay was a beauty, is yet considered a beauty despite her age. Her aging husband, however, is still considered handsome and attracts and welcomes female attention...female flattery. This is appropriate for a man; a woman may gain admiration for her skills and her looks but it would be inappropriate to call attention to herself. <br />The world of children, weather, guests and their idiosyncrasies, Mrs. Ramsay's desire that things remain the same thus assuring her children never having to grow up to face life's problems, takes a huge leap and the reader is propelled from the previous protected cocoon into \\""real life\\"".<BR>Mrs. Ramsay dies, son Andrew perishes in World War I, her daughter Prue is escorted down the aisle by her father, and one year later dies giving birth. Yet, the author is ingenious about holding fast to the internal world of the characters, with only an occasional external utterance.<br />Everything has changed. Without the foundational piece, the cement that holds the household and extended household together, the summer place is abandoned, dusty, rotting, decrepit, unattended. No one has vacationed there for 10 years. Subsequently, orders are generated to a former household staff member to re-open the house for a smaller onslaught of visitors.<br />Nothing is the same without Mrs. Ramsay. She is mourned, especially by Lily Briscoe. Only three of the Ramsay children have accompanied their father to thesummer retreat. He is still the bully that he was in their childhood. Their world still operates according to his moods, whims and orders. James and Cam, now 16 and 17, are morose and it always seems as if they are waiting for the \\""other shoe to drop\\"". Nothing must go awry or their aged father will be irritated and critical. <br />Mr. Ramsay's preoccupation is still with himself and it is the guests' duty to pity him, fawn over him and focus their attention on the pain dealt him. Lily Briscoe refuses to do this (she is adamant that marriage, as espoused by Mrs. Ramsey as a must, is not necessarily so). She braces herself to deliberately focus her efforts on her art and its composition. She seeks balance in a painting that just doesn't seem to come together. This could be deemed symbolic of a search for balance in her own life and a challenge to attain some personal resolution to her grief over<BR>Mrs. Ramsay's death.<br />\\""To a Lighthouse\\"" is a masterpiece; it succeeds as a group and character portrait While a difficult \\""read\\"", the story, the plot, the character definition, and the passage of time...largely accomplished through internal dialogue... is ingenious!",2003-08-03

The latter covers just one day in the life of Mrs. Dalloway; in the former, the first 127 pages of 209 pages cover just one day in the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay. A dinner party at the end of the day has an important place in both of the novels as well as in the lives of Mrs. Dalloway and Mrs. Ramsay.  Aside from those similarities, the overwhelming one is the stream of consciousness writing style that Woolf adopted in &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and carried over into &quot;To the Lighthouse.&quot;  I can't remember the applicable quote but the sense of it is &quot;There are certainly a lot of words there.&quot;  Words fall on words as grains of sand in an hourglass fall on to the pile of sand at the bottom of the glass - words, words, words, etc.  Impressions that might well have been only momentary feelings of a character are turned into paragraphs and even pages of words.<br />That isn't all bad.  If you like the sounds that words make (some of the passages really should be read aloud) or if you like the images that can be invoked, there are some enchanting passages in &quot;To the Lighthouse.&quot;  At times, however, there seems to be just endless words - I had to force myself not to resort to skimming in order to get the story being told.  Looking for the story is, to some degree, pointless because Woolf shows no interest in a definite beginning or ending - she ends the work without ending the story.  Perhaps one should say that in this work it really is the journey and not the starting and ending points that is the reason for reading.  At times, Woolf's words have a certain madness about them.  Some say her own madness affected her writing, some say not.  I tend to agree with the former - she herself indicated a certain fondness for the imagery which came to her during her &quot;mad&quot; periods.  Even though she didnot write during those periods, she may well have stored away images to evoke later in her writing just as one can store away vivid images received in dreams.<br />Woolf succeeds in making her characters live in this book, perhaps because Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay are closely modeled on her own parents. One has to remember, though, that they are seen through the eyes of an impressionable daughter and that they died before Woolf developed an adult relationship with them - she was only 13 when her mother died and just 22 when her father died.  Perhaps the ambivalent reactions of the character, Lily, in the story mirror Woolf's own impressions of her parents.  Her characters have no constant viewpoint, just as real people grow cold and warm on different issues and on their relationships with other people in their lives.  They can both detest and love some other person in the course of a day or even in the course of an hour or a minute, having both lovable and irksome, even maddening characteristics.  One of the most interesting &quot;characters&quot; in the story is the house which they rent for each summer.  The house is on a beach and has all the problems and frailties of beach houses of the early 1900's.  The Woolfs were of the British intelligentsia and, although certainly not wealthy, could afford to have a cook and servants.  One might think Woolf would ignore the presence of these menials, as is often the case for such writers, but she doesn't and her treatment of them adds some depth to the story of the house and the times.<br />The most appealing character, to me, is Mrs. Ramsay.  She is a compulsive caretaker who guards her husband's and children's tender feelings from hurt.  Something like a female Don Quixote, she is a guardian of the lonely and shy, even when they don't want a guardian.  Like most of the people who knew her, I came to have an affection for Mrs. Ramsay.<br />If you like history and science writing and have not developed a fondness for writing such as that of Jane Austen, you may not have the patience to enjoy this work.  If you do like Austen and/or if you like poetry, you may very well enjoy reading &quot;To the Lighthouse.&quot;  Even better might be the audio version - just close your eyes and listen to the sound pictures as Woolf flits about the room.",2003-02-20

Here Ms. Woolf becomes particularly poetic in describing the effects of the elements on a house that has been abandoned for ten years.<br />Mrs. Ramsey is a strong woman who is married to a professor who is well grounded in Victorian views about women. Her role is to serve her family, and to praise and feel sympathy for her husband. A physically attractive woman with eight children she still has ways of wielding power over people.

The very slight plot focuses on a vacationing British family and their guests and there's a constant interior monologue about every little thing.<br />The first part, entitled &quot;The Window&quot; is by far the largest section of the book and the reader has to plow though a complex web of the author's thoughts as she focuses on one detail after another using all her senses.

While Woolf's influence is seen everywhere in works of literature that would follow, one must keep in mind that the literary technique employed for most of the novel, stream of consciousness, was still very radical and experimental at the time it was written. Woolf's portrait of the thoughts that pass through the minds of family members and their houseguests at the seaside and her harnessing and transformation of the essence of time and into words is nothing short of awe-inspiring. That she also manages to tell a story and develop rich characters that the reader cares about while painting these portraits of thought and time is utterly amazing.

It was as if Woolf wanted to create a work that would touch as many people as possible, while Joyce had developed a private code that only a select few could crack. While (trying) to read Ulysses I felt intimidated, left behind; while immersed in To the Lighthouse, I felt invited and included. For a taste of modernist literature at it's most inviting and poetic, I recommend To the Lighthouse!",2002-06-08

I wish I could say more about the plot, but frankly, not much happens.  Oh, sorry, they keep talking about sailing out to the Lighthouse (and eventually they do, even).  But this book is not about plot.  It is about the emotional and philosophical ruminations of Woolf's characters, none of whom is particularly sympathetic or engrossing.  Woolf juxtaposes the rational, abrasive Mr. Ramsay with the pleasant, introspective Mrs. Ramsay in an attempt to make profound statements about the differences between men and women.  Woven into this central issue are the themes of love and art.  Perhaps this book was revolutionary when it was first written, but can it appropriately be considered timeless?

Published in 1927 it deals with very large issues but in a very intimate setting. The Ramsay vacation home is visited every summer and every summer change and time itself makes its presence felt in varying ways on each of the consciousnesses that occuppy the house. The center consciousness is Mrs. Ramsay's whose quiet devotion to her family is compared to a freer kind of existence in the form of a female painter.  Mrs. Ramsay is a kind of beacon to her family, she provides the safety and comfort that comes with order and ritual. Her husband is the head of the family and the one more connected to worldly awareness and concerns but her less obvious and less defineable role is really the one that allows all to function. But things happen that cannot be controlled. The war breaks the routine that had been established over the years and after the war things are no longer as they were, there is a desolate feel as post war life resumes because things that were once there no longer are. The interior monologues that capture each character in their moments of being support an overall view being that most of life is lived alone and to oneself and forces we cannot control really determine the demeanor of our days,  our own decisions are important but in relation to the larger forces shaping them very small things.

I found myself re-reading passages over and over again, just to get the meaning that Woolf was trying to convey. I thought that the author was trying to express a stoic look at the snobbishness of the Victorian era. While Mrs. Ramsay is the guiding light in the entire book,  I thought that she was also the one that really made it difficult to understand. I also thought that Mrs. Ramsay was the one that referred to the lighthouse the most. I recognized the lighthouse as a symbol for the goals that everyone that was vacationing there had, but also for everyone that was visiting the Ramsays.  Also, reflective of the era, is the way that Mrs. Ramsay looked at love. She liked the concept of being in love, but she didnt nessacarily love who she was married to. Or rather, she did, but she chose to question it. I am still not sure what the whole deal is with the Ramsay adults.  The Ramsay children, however, are the idealistic symbols for the future--they symbolize the promise of what is possible to come for the family and the rest of the world.They thought taht the lighthouse was the answer to all of their problems--and in reality, it was the creator of most of them. And, of course, while the Ramsays were a huge part of the story, Lily Briscoe and Charles Tansley were the two characters that epitomized the entire theme of the novel.

By that, I mean Woolf's writing has a dreamlike, impressionistic quality that uses little dialogue.  The novel is about several English people who spend their summers in the Hebrides, islands northwest of Scotland.  The lighthouse mentioned in the title is located on one of the islands and symbolizes a goal or an ideal to which several of the characters aspire in one way or another.<br />The most prominent characters are the Ramsay family, whose internal conflicts form the basis for their existence, much like any other nuclear family.  Mr. Ramsay is a philosophy professor, an imperious man who dreams of being remembered for his work and enjoys laying down the law with his children.  Mrs. Ramsay's love for her husband has dwindled to the point of her not being sure why she ever fell in love with him in the first place, but she is enamored with the *idea* of being in love, always looking forward to her single friends getting married. <br />The central character, however, is a woman named Lily Briscoe who paints canvases of an apparently abstract nature.  Her conflict appears in the form of a character named Charles Tansley, an unsociable chauvinist who admonishes her that &quot;women can't paint, women can't write.&quot;  Lily Briscoe's efforts to paint represent the difficult, introspective process of artistic creation.  <br />In combining the themes represented by Lily and the Ramsays, Woolf portrays the problems of being a woman artist in a society that discouraged women to be artistic or creative (the discouragement represented by the voice of Tansley) and therefore having to deal with the disappointment and frustration of conflicting with social mores (illustrated by Mrs. Ramsay's discontent in her marriage).

What must be determined over the course of reading the novel and reflecting on it, is the function of the lighthouse.  Are its probing, distant lights supposed to be a beacon of hope as its characters move from the repressive age of Victoria into the liberating age of technology?  Does the lighthouse echo the arch of experience which Tennyson's Ulysses claims 'fades forever and forever when I move' toward it?  Or is the lighthouse just a lighthouse?<br />Mrs. Ramsay, the novel's main character and guiding principle, is herself a lighthouse, built on a foundation of tradition and stock 19th century notions of how people should interact in society and towards each other.  Her matchmaking schemes are ever fainter echoes of the Victorian novel's marriage plots.  Woolf undermines and qualifies Mrs. Ramsay's intentions by exploding the conventions of the 19th century novel - plot structure becomes amorphous, protean formlessness; narrative voice is shared between characters as narration becomes thought and smoothly passes from character to character, anticipating the stream of consciousness style.  <br />Woolf also questions Mrs. Ramsay's social priorities - is marriage really a vital or necessary condition for women?  Through close examination of Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay's marriage, Lily Briscoe's determination to remain single, and the novel's myriad other relationships, Woolf severely problematizes any comfortable ideas about knowing other people.  Another important issue is the social value of art - Frequent conversations involving the philosopher Mr. Ramsay, the doctoral student Charles Tansley, the poet Augustus Carmichael, and the painter Lily Briscoe, along with Woolf's own speculations on the permanence of human design in Part II ask us to consider the role of art in regard to humanity.  <br />In a novel where the boundaries of time and space are consistently challenged, and the family unit is exposed, one must also focus on the erotics of storytelling.  Love, hatred, admiration, and disgust permeate &quot;To The Lighthouse.&quot;  Our attempt as readers to understand the drive of the novel compels us to seek a reason for reading it among these four potential narrative scenarios.  Does love, hate, or some combination of the two commit the characters to reveal their thoughts, and why do these thoughts involve us so that we feel a need to read to the end?<br />&quot;To The Lighthouse&quot; is a fascinating book - coming on the heels of such anti-Victorian masterpieces as Edith Wharton's &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; and Samuel Butler's &quot;The Way of All Flesh,&quot;  Woolf's novel through form and content seeks to put the 19th century to rest, while simultaneously dealing with the terrors of post-World War I existence.

No matter how loudly the literary lemmings scream, that will always be so. Woolf opens &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; with a very uninteresting sentence and a &quot;So what&quot; bit of exposition; both come to nothing, promising us little and failing to deliver even that. The story was rambling, incoherent and boring in the extreme. Woolf jumped from head to head, thought to thought, as if each threatened to bite off her foot as she landed.  The &quot;story&quot; (and calling &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; a story is a huge generosity) is painfully slow. So slow, in fact, that you come to &quot;The End&quot; and still nothing has developed. <br /> The book is filled with poorly written exposition that not only stops the story dead, but takes us completely away from it time and again. Each sentence starts with a jerk, wanders around, twists back upon itself, spirals away from us, then trips its way back to the starting point. Woolf seemed to have no idea about what it was that she really wanted to say and no ability to state any of it succinctly or coherently.  Continuing  in this trend, Woolf keeps the dialogue brief in the extreme and does it for no other reason than for her to run on and on and on and . . . with her exposition, using those miles long sentences that the reader is PRAYING will end, but that just keep muddling along, belaboring point after senseless point. The poor woman had no talent at all when it came to simply telling a straightforward tale and making it interesting to anyone but herself.<br /> Little  of the book has anything to do with the lighthouse, or with going there. It's more about the inner workings and complexities of a small group of people. Kind of like taking a series of snapshots of the group, then going one by one and telling what is in each of their heads. As we go through the various bits of these snapshots, now and then Woolf tosses out the seeds of something interesting, then immediately stamps the life out of them before they can sprout into something greater.  Included in these are some tantalizing crumbs of internal monologue, but Woolf can't even stay focused on that. She wonders through each character's personal musings just the same way that she wonders through the main story, never allowing one thought to fully form before rambling away from it. This is the story's real tragedy, because she turns some marvelous phrases, but loses them in the tale's incoherence.<br /> The shrieking chant of &quot;but it's EXPERIMENTAL fiction!&quot; cannot excuse the many and severe shortcomings.

To the Lighthouse was published in 1927 and its structure is unique, although it does contain elements of the Victorian.  Woolf wrote this novel in only one year and did very little rewriting.  Both subtle and sharp, the ease with which the book was written is apparent in the flow of both its narrative and its prose.  The novel was written during one of the brief peaceful and happy times in Woolf's life.  (In 1895, after her mother's death, Woolf became almost continuously depressed and suffered a series of nervous breakdowns, culminating in her suicide by drowning in 1941.)<br />To the Lighthouse, like Woolf's previous novel, Jacob's Room, is a somewhat disjointed story, possessing numerous characters, points-of-view and conflicts.  The overlapping and separation of the characters and their stories seems to result from both intention and oversight and is a product of what Woolf referred to as &quot;all characters boiled down,&quot; and the &quot;break of unity in my design.&quot;<br />The story centers around the summer vacation to the Isle of Skye of the Ramsey family, a family Woolf admitted was very much like her own.  In fact, Woolf said that writing To the Lighthouse helped her &quot;rub out&quot; the obsessive memory of her own mother.  Mrs. Ramsey, like Woolf's own mother, is a woman of decidedly Victorian ideals, choosing to focus on her home, her marriage and her family.<br />Interacting with Mrs. Ramsey is the character most representative of Woolf, herself, Lily Briscoe, a young girl who is staying in the same beachouse as the Ramseys.  Unmarried, Lily draws both disapproval and sympathy from Mrs. Ramsey who firmly believes that &quot;an unmarried woman has missed the best of life.&quot;<br />Mrs. Ramsey and Lily represent the conflict between the Victorian and the Edwardian eras, the age of the woman in the home and the advent of the woman in the workplace.  An intelligent young woman, as well as a sensitive and talented artist, Lily is very aware of Mrs. Ramsey's disapproval.<br />The role of art in the novel deals primarily with Post-Impressionism and the attempt to freeze reality, not on paper or on canvas, but in the mind, and then to paint the very equivalent of this reality.  In many ways, To the Lighthouse resembles a painting because of its three distinct images of reality:  the summer, the return and the seven years in between.<br />Woolf was not the only writer to &quot;paint&quot; her novels.  In Place in Fiction, Eudora Welty writes of &quot;painting and writing, always the closest two of the 'sister arts.'&quot;  Throughout the novel, Lily works on one painting and cannot seem to &quot;connect the mass on the right hand with that on the left...But the danger was that by doing that the unity of the whole might be broken.&quot;  The need for connection in the painting is much like the need for connection in the narrative.  And Lily and Mrs. Ramsey both serve to fulfill the role as unifier.<br />One of the most startling moments of unification occurs as Mrs. Ramsey is staring at a bowl of fruit she has placed in the middle of the table during a dinner party.  Because of her extreme attention to detail, Mrs. Ramsey focuses on the bowl throughout the dinner.  She particularly notices the perfection of the arrangement while also fearing its imminent destruction as she catches another guest looking at the fruit, no doubt desirous of it.  Mrs. Ramsey thinks, &quot;That was his way of looking, different from her.  But looking together united them.&quot;<br />Even when not physically present in the story, Mrs. Ramsey continues to exert a strong influence.  At the end of the novel, Mr. Ramsey finally takes his two youngest children, James and Cam, to the lighthouse.  Both children have changed considerably from the time of their first vacation; Mrs. Ramsey's absence has required that they develop a new independence, yet she was their only tie to their father, the typically restrained and uninvolved Victorian husband.<br />The children must, however, incorporate the influence of both of their parents on their journey to the lighthouse, a journey that is both literal and figurative.  From shore, Lily watches them as she paints their journey, recalling Mrs. Ramsey with both annoyance and love.  Lily, like Woolf, herself, has finally come to terms with the connection of all things, the completion of a painting as well as the completion of a journey.<br />To the Lighthouse is a quiet, reflective and meditative novel and one of the first to display Woolf's unique Impressionistic stream-of-consciousness style.",2000-10-11

Although some under-the-surface insights into their  psyches were excellent,  they were no more earth-shattering than other 20th  century literature that I have read.  These solid character-defining  excerpts that I enjoyed so much were also few and far between, and I felt  annoyed that I had to wade through the &quot;filler&quot; to get to the  real thing.

Today our society is very self aware  and we are able to articulate what we are thinking and feeling so much more  than we did in the 20's.  This book was written before Freud and Oprah were   household names,  and before we had access to TV and other forms of mass  media.  Perhaps the lack of clarity of the characters was symptomatic of  the lack of self-understanding that people (or Virginia Woolf) experienced  at that time.

Fortunately our selection  this month was &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;. This is the anti &quot;YA  YA&quot; book.  It is very spiritual and existential.  The symbolism is  beautiful.  I will never think of lighthouses the same again.  I am just  sorry that I waited until I was 40 years old to read this book.  At least I  found it!  I will read it over and over.  True there is no real plot, but  Virginia Woolf is a genuis in her commentary on life.  The whole novel is  told from the inside out.  Everything is told from someone's thoughts.  I  could not put the book down and was struck with a sense of Awe the entire  time.  To me this is a true work of art. I also admire her treatment of the  theme of masculine and feminine in our society.  It is a sad commentary on  our society that there are over 300 comments under the book about the Ya  Ya's and just a couple of comments on &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;.",1999-03-14
