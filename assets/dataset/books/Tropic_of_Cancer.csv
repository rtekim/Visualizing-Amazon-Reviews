Sorry ladies.<br /><br />I was that very youthful 16 shortly after the \\""unexpurgated\\"" Grove Press version of this work was first published. \\""Underage\\"" in those days of yore was a fussier concept, and so I mustered courage and walked into the bookstore of a large department store in downtown Pittsburgh, and nervously carried this book to the cash register. The cashier must have been all of 19. I probably misread her glance, and blurted out the prepared line: \\""It's for a school assignment.\\"" She was decent enough not to chuckle too much, and rang up the sale.<br /><br />So this became one of the first \\""adult\\"" books that I read, in both senses of the word. And small portions of it I have remembered over lo' these many years, like the flashlight routine and the calendar, what you should not do in a bidet (which, at the time, I had never heard of), and that virtually mandatory name by which all women should be referred to: a hard guttural sound, with four letters, which refers to the only \\""useful\\"" part of their anatomy. And, of yes, there was a lot of venereal disease, and a rather casual attitude towards it. Even at 16, on the threshold of making some independent choices of my own, I did have to wonder if this is how the \\""real adult world\\"" worked.<br /><br />And so, on the re-read I found that I had walked on many of the streets of Paris that he so liberally sprinkles his text with. And I knew all the authors (and had read many of them), including his oblique reference to Marcel Proust. I found his conduct appalling and his description of it more so. But the most baffling part is why authors such as Lawrence Durrell and George Orwell, as well as Frank Shapiro, who in the introduction entitled \\""The Greatest Living Author\\"" felt he had something useful to say.<br /><br />Miller arrives in Paris, fleeing the corporate world of America (fair enough) in the late 1920's, virtually penniless. And then he proceeds to make the worst misconduct of the corporate world look highly ethical by comparison to his own conduct. Every acquaintance (he has no friends) becomes a \\""mark\\"" from whom he will cadge a free meal. He even brags about doing it systematically, writing letters to the acquaintances asking for one free meal a week, and then, just as systematically, dropping the \\""poor performers\\"" as he gets better offers. He makes frequent trips to the American Express office, hoping that his wife, who is still in America, has sent him a check. Many of his fleeting relationships with women feature the verb \\""to ream,\\"" and involve a financial transaction. In one such, he offers, and pays her 100 franc. While she is tending her sick mother, he swipes the 100 franc back, out of her purse, before leaving. He attempts to wrap such behavior in a brave anti-establishment rhetoric.<br /><br />As for his very discursive writing, it is filled with pontifications such as the following: \\""In the four hundred years since the last devouring soul appeared, the last man to know the meaning of ecstasy, there has been a constant and steady decline of man in art, in thought, in action. The world is pooped out: there is not a dry far* left.\\"" There is no character development of the many individuals who skim across his life. And each paragraph seems to have at least ten \\""I's.\\"" I had to smile at Shapiro's concession, which recommended Miller's work on Rimbaud as \\""the greatest\\"", that it is mainly about Miller. And there are the endless lists of the foods he eats, and the alcohol that he drinks.<br /><br />On the first page of the novel Miller proclaims himself as: \\""I am the happiest man alive\\"" yet there is virtually no joy or happiness in this novel. Shapiro says: \\""Morally, I regard Miller as a holy man, as most adherents do - a Gandhi with a penis.\\"" What!!<br /><br />My best guess is that someone who can be ingratiating enough to cadge a lot of free meals can do the same to obtain some very unwarranted literary praise from people who should have known better.<br /><br />Miller's one remark, concerning Paris, is what saved this book from 1-star oblivion: \\""...It is here that one reads again the books of his youth and the enigmas take on new meanings, one for every white hair.\\""  Indeed, and on the re-read they are far less enigmatic. 2-stars.y unwarranted literary praise from people who should have known better.<br /><br />Miller's one remark, concerning Paris, is what saved this book from 1-star oblivion: \\""...It is here that one reads again the books of his youth and the enigmas take on new meanings, one for every white hair.\\""  Indeed, and on the re-read they are far less enigmatic. 2-stars.",2015-03-16

Perhaps it is I who does not get it...  Years ago I set out to read the greatest novels ever written.  I found there are various lists with little true consensus.  This book is on at least one of the lists.  Having read it I was shocked.  Shocked, not by its utter crudeness, but that it seems little more than trash.  It is a story of an American living in Paris between the two world wars.  He is a struggling writer.  I use that term &quot;writer&quot; most loosely.<br /><br />There are other novels like this.  Hemingway's, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and W. Somerset Maugham's &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; come to mind among others.  To pretend that this novel is in the same league with those novels is what shocks me.  Just one example is as follows.  The author repeatedly uses the &quot;c word&quot; to refer to female genitalia.  It is not clear to me he knows if females have any other purpose or value.  Utter nihilism is about the only thing resembling a theme that I can discern.  But it is poorly written nihilism.<br /><br />The book supposedly helped create true &quot;free speech&quot;.  In a manner of speaking, I believe there is an argument to be made for that.  But so what?  Is that all that is required to make a 'best novel&quot; list?  The same be said for &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce.  I am not a big James Joyce fan, but Tropic of Cancer is crude and almost juvenile compared to Ulysses.  I truly felt this book could have just as well been written in the bathroom at some junior high school.<br /><br />Recently I had read an excellent biography of Eudora Welty authored by Suzanne Marrs.  In that excellent biography, there is a brief episode about Henry Miller coming to the residence of Eudora Welty and her mother.  Supposedly, Henry Miller wanted Eudora Welty to write some pornograhic literature, page 72.  God knows why.  In any event, on page 231 of that book, Eudora Welty's mother had not allowed Henry Miller in her house.  I completely get that.  Thank You...r house.  I completely get that.

A laudable aspect of _Tropic of Cancer_ is that it's a healthy celebration of individualism, but the main good thing about it is what made it so scandalous back in its day: the frank, uninhibited depiction of sexuality. I appreciated the unobfuscated obscene vocabulary used by Miller as a matter of course, especially when depicting sexual goings-on. He will not call sexual organs \\""sexual organs\\"", but will call them what they are, in regular folks' delivery. In this, Miller was \\""filling a void\\"", so to say: because literature up until his time -- and to a degree even until the present day -- tends to be squeamish and hypocritical when dealing with the sexual in our lives. As Miller says explicitly:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; There is only one thing which interests me vitally now, and that is the recording of all that which is omitted in books. Nobody, so far as I can see, is making use of those elements in the air which gives [sic!] direction and motivation to our lives. >><br /><br />However, even this benefit of the book has its limits: because the characters populating _Tropic of Cancer_ appear to be so shallow, so then is the depiction of their sexual lives, by necessity, shallow as well. It is as if Miller was *reducing* the thing that \\""gives direction and motivation to our lives\\"", primarily to sex, or in fact sex and the flesh *alone*. To use Miller's own phrase,<br /><br />&lt;&lt; the demands of the flesh had become too vehement >><br /><br />This is a despicable aspect of _Tropic of Cancer_, because it makes it seem as if the \\""demands of the flesh\\"" were too vehement *most*, if not *all* of the time of our lives, or at least the lives of the characters populating the book. Isn't the real human, \\""noble\\"" struggle the *fight* against those urges, though, instead of spectacularly succumbing to them, one and all, as copiously illustrated by _Tropic of Cancer_ over hundreds of pages of text? There is hardly any \\""fight against urges\\"" in Miller's book -- but there is constant *submission* to (animalistic) urges, and this makes the book a \\""celebration\\"" of that habitual \\""failure\\"", from a human point of view.<br /><br />Speaking of \\""human\\"", that appears to be a \\""dirty word\\"" for Miller:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; Today I am proud to say that I am inhuman >><br /><br />And that is not the only uncomfortable statement contained in the text, especially from today's perspective. Consider this:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; Let us have more oceans, more upheavals, more wars, more holocausts. >><br /><br />Oops! Yes, this was written back in 1934, but is that really an excuse? Did not, or do not, attitudes like this *pave the way* for whatever horrible was (or still is) to follow? As an aside, the book is also ridiculously sexist from today's point of view; it's almost funny, but Henry Miller appears to be using the c-word as a legitimate synonym of the word \\""woman\\"", even in \\""ordinary\\"" sentences of non-sexual nature.<br /><br />The above statement is not the only one with Hitleresque overtones. Here comes another:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; Away with lamentation! Away with elegies and dirges! Away with biographies and histories, and libraries and museums! Let the dead eat the dead. >><br /><br />Reading this, one is uncomfortably reminded of the Nazi book burnings which, in fact, occurred in 1933, only a year before _Tropic of Cancer_ was first published.<br /><br />The above quote also shows a hypocritical aspect of _Tropic of Cancer_: it purports to abhor \\""lamentation\\"", yet much of the text comes across as \\""whining\\"" (which is particularly ironic coming from a \\""macho\\"" writer). It appears that _Tropic of Cancer_ *exults* in \\""lamenting\\"", if truth be told; isn't the quotation above itself a good example of \\""whining\\""? It laments that the culture of earlier times is supposedly \\""no good\\""; when, in reality, it is likely the lack of *understanding* on the part of the lamenter and complainer, that isat fault.<br /><br />Here is one explanation of what makes _Tropic of Cancer_ so shallow: great literature deals with *eternal* things, *eternal* truths. Yet by his own admission, Miller is interested in the exact *opposite* of \\""eternal\\"":<br /><br />&lt;&lt; I love everything that flows, everything that has time in it and becoming >><br /><br />Well, if you're primarily interested in everything that's *temporal* -- the result will be bad art. The most disappointing thing about _Tropic of Cancer_ is, in fact, how *shallow* it is. Consider this admission by Miller early on in the book:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; I have made a silent compact with myself not to change a line of what I write. I am not interested in perfecting my thoughts, nor my actions. >><br /><br />Indeed! That is very apparent as you read through _Tropic of Cancer_. Not surprisingly, however, the result is some trashy literature of extremely low quality. Especially awful and annoying are the endless, trite \\""stream-of-consciousness\\"" passages interwoven throughout the book; I found them very unremarkable, and their chief motif seemed to be Miller wanting to wallow in the ugliness of this world as much as possible. Yes, Miller depicts beauty as well (very hesitantly and as if despite himself) -- but he decidedly prefers to revel in, and (perversely) even *celebrate*, everything that is ugly. Take this statement:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; I love the words of hysterics and the sentences that flow on like dysentery and mirror all the sick images of the soul >><br /><br />Given this, one might accuse _Tropic of Cancer_ of \\""reverse shallowness\\"". By this I mean that bad art is such that only shows the *beauty* of the world; but showing only the *ugliness* of the world is equally bad. *Good* art is such that displays a relative *balance* of both the beautiful and the ugly; while *great* art shows beauty hiding, dormant *in* ugliness, thus resolving the *seeming* contradiction between the two. I was vainly searching for such transcendence in _Tropic of Cancer_; it just isn't there, or only in weak suggestions; the main impression you get, is the writer's fascination with almost exclusively the *ugliness* of the world.<br /><br />A particularly annoying aspect of _Tropic of Cancer_ is that, Miller having worked (among many other occupations) as a proofreader during his time in Paris, he came to know an exceedingly large amount of *foreign/technical words* and expressions. Now, he prefers to constantly slap the readers of _Tropic of Cancer_ around with this exotic, high-flown, flashy, essentially snobbish \\""proof-reader's vocabulary\\"", pretty much throughout the book, as if Miller was trying hard to impress his readers all of the time -- which would indicate a lack of confidence in his writing abilities; it could well be a sign of a writer's inferiority complex, despite the bombastic declarations of confidence in one's own writing skills. Artificially using such flashy vocabulary is very frustrating for the reader, and amounts to no more than \\""showing off\\"": \\""See how many foreign and technical words and expressions I'm familiar with?\\"" Just like some people, for the sake of showing off, seem fond of \\""name-dropping\\"", Miller seems captivated by \\""word-dropping\\"".<br /><br />Miller suffers from a lot of hubris despite trying hard to appear self-deprecating. In actual fact (and this reinforces the impression of shallowness of _Tropic of Cancer_), he speaks dismissively about other famous writers, even entire generations of writers preceding him:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; A year ago, six months ago, I thought that I was an artist. I no longer think about it, I am. Everything that was literature has fallen from me. There are no more books to be written, thank God. >><br /><br />&lt;&lt; And inevitably there always crept into our discussions the figure of Whitman, that one lone figure which America has produced in the course of her brief life. >><br /><br />Oh really, the \\""lone figure\\""? How offensive andconceited of Miller to say that. Miller is also similarly dismissive about entire generations of classic writers writing in languages other than English (such as the French classics). It is particularly ironic because for the 1961 first American edition of _Tropic of Cancer_, Miller chose a motto from Emerson for the front page. Erm... if Whitman is \\""the lone figure\\"" worth taking note of in literary America, why quote Emerson at all?<br /><br />On the other hand, an endearing aspect of _Tropic of Cancer_, and a genuine sign of humility, or modesty on the narrator's part, is that Miller shines the spotlight on the people *around* the narrator, rather than on himself; in reproducing dialogues, the focus is typically on reporting what *other* people do, or what they say to the narrator, while the narrator's own statements are usually omitted, not reported at all. This produces a pleasant effect on the reader: one feels as if one were more of a *passive observer* of the crazy going-on in the Paris of the 1920s and 1930s, rather than an active participant; which is just as well, given the salacious nature of it all. One of the characters explicitly praises the narrator:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; You're a good listener. >><br /><br />And he is. A fundamental deficiency of _Tropic of Cancer_, however, is that it is, essentially, no novel -- but it appears to be merely a collection of excerpts from Henry Miller's diaries. The structure is episodic and loose, or perhaps there is no structure at all. One is, then, reminded of the statement by the German literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki, to the effect that \\""diaries are always junk, from a literary point of view\\"".<br /><br />Indeed, the quality of writing in _Tropic of Cancer_, especially in the endless, execrable, \\""stream-of-consciousness\\"" passages, is frequently trashy. The bulk of those passages could safely have been deleted from the book, with no detriment; it appears that no hand of a professional editor ever passed over them (as explicitly indicated by Miller, see the quote above).<br /><br />Whenever Miller depicts people's actions or words, factual (and especially sexual) proceedings (such as in the first half of the Dijon chapter), then _Tropic of Cancer_ manages to be mildly entertaining and self-deprecatingly humorous, so that one may smile here and there. But whenever it comes to would-be \\""reflective\\"" passages, reading _Tropic of Cancer_ becomes a huge pain, and excruciatingly boring. You get awful, foreign-word-overladen metaphors, and \\""chaotic\\"" and \\""jumbled-up\\"", as if intentionally \\""ugly\\"" passages full of \\""ugly\\"" imagery (see the latter half of the Dijon chapter) -- and you wish for the book to be over soon.sn't there, or only in weak suggestions; the main impression you get, is the writer's fascination with almost exclusively the *ugliness* of the world.<br /><br />A particularly annoying aspect of _Tropic of Cancer_ is that, Miller having worked (among many other occupations) as a proofreader during his time in Paris, he came to know an exceedingly large amount of *foreign/technical words* and expressions.

This produces a pleasant effect on the reader: one feels as if one were more of a *passive observer* of the crazy going-on in the Paris of the 1920s and 1930s, rather than an active participant; which is just as well, given the salacious nature of it all. One of the characters explicitly praises the narrator:<br /><br /><< You're a good listener. >><br /><br />And he is. A fundamental deficiency of _Tropic of Cancer_, however, is that it is, essentially, no novel -- but it appears to be merely a collection of excerpts from Henry Miller's diaries. The structure is episodic and loose, or perhaps there is no structure at all. One is, then, reminded of the statement by the German literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki, to the effect that \\""diaries are always junk, from a literary point of view\\"".<br /><br />Indeed, the quality of writing in _Tropic of Cancer_, especially in the endless, execrable, \\""stream-of-consciousness\\"" passages, is frequently trashy. The bulk of those passages could safely have been deleted from the book, with no detriment; it appears that no hand of a professional editor ever passed over them (as explicitly indicated by Miller, see the quote above).<br /><br />Whenever Miller depicts people's actions or words, factual (and especially sexual) proceedings (such as in the first half of the Dijon chapter), then _Tropic of Cancer_ manages to be mildly entertaining and self-deprecatingly humorous, so that one may smile here and there. But whenever it comes to would-be \\""reflective\\"" passages, reading _Tropic of Cancer_ becomes a huge pain, and excruciatingly boring. You get awful, foreign-word-overladen metaphors, and \\""chaotic\\"" and \\""jumbled-up\\"", as if intentionally \\""ugly\\"" passages full of \\""ugly\\"" imagery (see the latter half of the Dijon chapter) -- and you wish for the book to be over soon.",2013-06-17

There is not a crumb of dirt anywhere, nor a chair misplaced.  We are all alone here and we are dead.\\""  These opening lines encapsulate the atmosphere of the work -- the emptiness of the characters, their personally unclean lifestyles (Miller, and others, are obsessed with prostitutes; Boris, we learn in the next line, is \\""lousy\\"" -- with lice, that is.)  In this post Great War, post-Hemingway Paris, in impoverished circumstances, the writers and artists who populate Miller's world are more disillusioned, more beaten, with not even a crumb of dirt to eat without hustling a friend, or a hooker, for a bite.  Miller -- like the narrators in Hemingway's Paris novels -- must have had a charisma, a bristling energy, which accompanied his brilliance and disillusion.  For the characters who populate his world gravitate toward him, pontificate with him, drink with him, flop with him, and share their meager resources, their jobs, their women, their world.  There is something almost (but not) monotonous about this; the ennui, the purposelessness of it, is almost (but not) palpable.<br /><br />What makes this more than a self pitying rant are several things.  First of all, the writing is inventive, gorgeous, at times lyrical, at times philosophical.  For all his low living, Miller clearly is a man of high learning, high thoughts, and he embraces life entirely.  Second, he is more than what I've just described him to be.  He's full of heartbreak, not yet recovered from a failed relationship with a woman he loves; and, of most importance here, he's on as much of a quest, and as quixotic a one, as Cervantes' Don Quixote.  Third, in Paris, he sets out to write a great American Novel.  He hearkens back to the writing of Walt Whitman, the America of Sandburg, and wrestles with the idea of his own country -- his love for it, his need for distance from it in order to discover it -- while he's far from home.  Fourth and finally, what he's out to do -- and this is what makes his work really gleam so bright -- is to reinvent the novel, not only by writing about life in its purest, highest, and lowest forms, but by immersing the reader in this world in every way within Miller's means and by writing about the very process of writing and of its concomitant discovery.<br /><br />As little as I know about literature, I can see it has a place in the firmament.  He's writing after Hemingway, and setting his book, as Hemingway sometimes did, in Paris among the disaffected Americans. At times the simplicity of his prose, the tenor of his characters, remind me of that. At others -- his hallucinatory moments, his brilliant and glorious rants, I see the future as well -- the influence I am guessing he had on a writer like William Burroughs, for example (whose Naked Lunch, to me, was another brilliant but really difficult read).<br /><br />On top of that, there's also the sexually explicit writing, which I accepted as part of the world he's depicting, but which others might find offensive.  There's also an unnerving undertone at times of anti-Semitism.  He has Jewish friends, sometimes he likes The Jews, but there is always an awareness of them, as Other.  I'm not sure what to make of this.  Was he echoing the reality around him, or expressing his own sentiments?  And, a book like this, which cycles through repetitive cycles, often word-drunk, dense with ideas and with prose, is not easy as I said.  But, I am so glad that I stuck it out this time.

The Jamesian central intelligence is an expatriate writer/bum/leech/opportunist referred to by the name of `Henry Miller' only once, who frequents the portions of Paris no Jamesian hero would have ever dreamed of entering.<br />The book is a novel, if one uses an elastic definition of the form to apply to it, albeit one in which author and main character merge into one entity and many, though probably not all, of the events really happened to Henry Miller during his initial time struggling in Paris, an ocean away from his wife in America. It is loose and baggy, with a wandering, picaresque shape to it. There's no coherent plot as such, simply the flow of Henry's experiences, like the river he says in the final paragraph that flows through him.<br />Much of the novel feels as if he took a creative emetic and spewed the contents of his soul onto the page in one `barbaric yawp' to use his hero Walt Whitman's phrase. But what a huge, wild, inspired `yawp' it is! There are passages in this book that possess such beauty, such a perfection of word matched to meaning, that one is convinced the man took his soul and wrung it dry of all of its creative juice like a wash rag, then transmuted it into almost intelligible language. Just as Henry Miller drew inspiration from heroes Whitman and Dostoevsky, so he in turn influenced the Kerouac of On the Road and some of the roving persona even infiltrates the Bob Dylan of \\""Subterranean Homesick Blues\\"" or \\""Maggie's Farm.\\""<br />Unlike his friend Fillmore, who is so traumatized by the upheaval caused by his relationship with the young opportunist Ginette that he must get back to his native United States to hear English spoken again, Henry seems to have come to terms with Paris, or at least the Parisians with whom he comes into contact. Only when he leaves Paris for brief sojourns in Le Havre or Dijon does he feel unsettled and out of his element. He has certainly made peace with its poverty, whores, filth and syphilis and at the conclusion he forms an almost mystical union with the Seine flowing beneath him.lationship with the young opportunist Ginette that he must get back to his native United States to hear English spoken again, Henry seems to have come to terms with Paris, or at least the Parisians with whom he comes into contact.

Miller's impact on later writers may be likened to the impact of WWI on WWII. The influence is a fact but it does not follow that it is necessarily a good thing.<br /><br />Kerouac's writing worked because he was exceptionally bright, had a good command of the English language, was a perceptive and sensitive observer of the human condition and was concerned with things other than himself and his bodily functions. Miler is far less talented, significantly less aware of the world around him, a poor observer of others, obsessed about his own physical needs and completely unconcerned with others. Thus while reading Kerouac can be a delight, reading Miller is a bore. Miller's alleged literary skill is rarely on display in his works and largely absent from this book. He is simply inept at writing dialogue and any attempt to put Miller in the same class as writers such as Hemingway is a bad joke. Miller's writing was not formed by exceptional talent but by shortcuts needed as a result of his inadequacies as a writer. You will find the occasional good turn of phrase but you will more often find poorly conceived attempts such as the following:<br /><br />\\""That was enough for me. I turned at once to Marcelle and began to flatter the ass off her. we stood at the corner of the bar, pretending to dance, and mauled each other voraciously. Jimmie gave me a big horse-wink and nodded his head approvingly. She was a lascivious bitch, this Marcelle and pleasant at the same time.\\""<br /><br />This is good writing? No, it is not. If Miller were alive today he would likely be writing Penthouse letters, with the same or less skill as others. If you took excerpts of Miler's writing and submitted them as your own for criticism they would be rightly blasted, yet when Miller's authorship is attributed to them they become gems? No, they do not. Literary snobbery is as responsible for Miller's reputation as anything else. He became popular in the literary world because he tried some new things (to cover his poor writing skills), because of his sexual meanderings, and because he was banned. Had he never been banned, he likely would have descended to his correct role in the literary world.<br /><br />Miller possessed an impoverished vocabulary of dirty words. The B word, C word and F word are used incessantly, repetitively and rarely to good purpose. His knowledge of sex was amateurish, his writing about sex was juvenile. He was not a sexual man, just a horny man. If you want good erotic writing from someone who was a sexual person, read Nin. Miller's much noted sexual passages are uninteresting, superficial and quite simply boring. Yes, I understand he blazed a trail and without Miller we might not have had the far superior writings of Nin, but it is nonetheless no reason to read Miller, unless you are an academic who is studying literary history. If not, read Nin. Read Kerouac.<br /><br />Was Tropic of Cancer important in the literary world? Yes. Was it good? No. For some reason literary critics seem incapable of distinguishing between these two concepts.<br /><br />I and many others also do not care for Miller's writing in large because we have no interest in or respect for him as a man, and his writing is, if nothing else, about himself. I cannot imagine going to dinner with him. His world revolved around himself to the exclusion of any concern about others. His politics were immature, poorly formed and almost childish, much as were his attitudes toward women.<br /><br />Miler did at least exhibit some honesty and show some self awareness when he wrote \\""Life, said Emerson, consists in what a man is thinking all day.

I've never been as impressed with Henry Miller and Henry Miller is impressed with Henry Miller, but I do appreciate his staggering (specifically chosen word) literary talent, his abrupt/curt one-liners, and some of his intoxicated poetic rantings/ramblings.<br /><br />I first read Tropic of Cancer in a teen reading club. One boy in our group insisted that it is \\""an awesome read\\"" if you are falling down drunk. One girl said she got a sexually transmitted disease from reading it---and she announced that she was going to stop engaging in one night stands, even with cute guys. One girl reviewed the book with her own curt one-liner, saying that \\""Tropic of Cancer was confetti of seediness\\"" in her opinion. Three of us became even more determined to become \\""real\\"" writers.<br /><br />Jerry Seinfeld had a successful TV show about nothing. Maybe Jerry got his \\""nothing\\"" idea from Miller. In a Seinfeld episode Jerry is accused of not returning Tropic of Cancer to the library after checking it out when he was in high school.<br /><br />I admit, I'm no Miller scholar, but I think I can say anything I damn well please about this novel---Henry Miller couldn't care less.",2009-06-21

Works that were revolutionary and important in their day often fare better as cultural artifacts under the scrutiny of later generations, when the novelty is gone and the art must stand or fall on its own merits. Henry Miller's \\""Tropic of Cancer\\"" is such a work. It distilled the intellectual fashions of its time. Revolutionary in both style and substance when it was published in 1934, this stream-of-consciousness, semi-autobiographical account of an impoverished, over-sexed expatriate writer in Paris of the 1930s is tedious and self-indulgent today. Only its humor stands the test of time -if you don't mind the profanity.<br /><br />\\""Tropic of Cancer\\"" is written in a first-person voice that one might use in keeping a journal. The author rambles on about himself, his lovers, his friends , and their lovers. Between that he talks about his string of jobs, his periodic starvation and lack of lodgings, and complains of the decline of Western civilization -while he cheerfully wallows in decay. We get a filthy but romantic impression of Paris as a lecherous, squalid place that nonetheless has plenty of room for indolent artists of all kinds. Those are Miller's friends, and his accounts of them vacillate from pitiful to hilarious. They are either despairing about something or oblivious to everything. Stories of their sexual exploits are truly funny, though. Not sexy, but debauched, absurd, and comical.<br /><br />It's all pretty meaningless, and that's what Miller intended. Tossing stylistic conventions out the window and talking incessantly about \\""¢unt\\"" was daring at the time. Writing 300 pages about nothing much probably was too. But doing these things for their own sake doesn't have lasting value. If it accomplishes what it aims to, it quickly loses its potency. One can debate whether art should strive to be revolutionary or to be good, but the work of the Marquis de Sade was banned for using sex to illustrate the intellectual fashions of its time 150 years before \\""Tropic of Cancer\\"" met a similar fate.

This has not happened yet, but I agree that it must.\\"" Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay, and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them, either.<br /><br />Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller's experience as an American expatriate in Paris and expounding his personal philosophy, often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical. Miller's stories about his friends are tedious, pointless, and catty; like Miller, they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers, as though believing is being. Miller writes, \\""A year ago, six months ago, I thought I was an artist. I no longer think about it, I am\\""--which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances.<br /><br />When they are not creating, or talking about philosophy or creating, Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women (and disease). They rarely use a neutral term such as \\""woman\\"" when there are so many obscene, demeaning words with which to objectify the gender. The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid, drunken, irrational, loose, sly, deceptive, and good primarily for one function, which Miller turns into a squalid, cold, joyless act. In spite of all the vice and the \\""living,\\"" no one seems to be having fun, and some characters, notably Fillmore, find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life.<br /><br />Miller expresses contempt for the machine, the industrial age, and money--although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore's mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket. Often hungry, Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him. When he describes his Indian friend Kepi as \\"". . . a scrounger, a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot,\\"" he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are stingy with money, accommodations, food, and wine.<br /><br />Miller's logic about the working world is facile; he writes, \\""If you want bread, you've got to get in harness, get in lockstep.\\"" On the surface, this is true, but it never seems to occur to him that, if you want bread, someone must cultivate, raise, and harvest the wheat and produce the other components; someone must transform these components into bread; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes. In other words, if most people weren't in \\""lock step,\\"" Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread, joining the world in harness. He makes his choice clear, then whines about it. He may despise those who support him, whether they are friends or workers, but that is perhaps because he, a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself, needs the very people he denigrates (including \\""the grocer, the baker, the shoemaker, the butcher, etc.--all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers\\""), a reliance which he resents. He hates the machine and the machine mind, but offers no alternatives.<br /><br />Seemingly incapable of sincere feeling, Miller finds human emotion amusing.

Yet what distinguishes Miller's accomplishment from that of an older generation of \\""Underground\\"" writers, is that he succeeded in creating a fusion of eroticism and art both lightly comic and deeply poetic, somber and crudely entertaining. Far less intense or disturbing than either Rimbaud, Lautreamont, or De Sade, all enjoyment of \\""Tropic of Cancer\\"" requires is an open mind and an abandonment of puritanical self-righteousness, attesting to the fact that, behind the seemingly hideous mask of curse words and sleazy sex, there is a world of sad, angry poetry to be found.<br /><br />\\""A few feet away, removed by incalculable eons of time, lies the prone and mummy-swathed world of Baudelaire, of a whole world that will belch no more...even as the world falls apart the Paris that belongs to Matisse shudders with bright, gasping orgasms, the air itself is steady with a stagnant sperm, the trees tangled like hair.

The reader gets an increasingly dull repetition of a topic that ceases to be of interest after the first few pages. This specific style used only one blunt, crass method to get the point across. \\""That sweet Danish ass\\"" is an almost gentlemanly remark when compared to some others.

Rather unfortunate, since this book should have stayed banned.  Few books make the world a worse place just by being written and this is one of them.<br /><br />There is no real plot.  The novel is a fictionalized autobiography of Miller's life.  It basically describes his abstract thoughts about things, events, ideas, and philosophy as we take an unwanted journey through the whorehouses of Paris with him and his friends.  We hear of their sexual escapades, food they eat, people they encounter; all the while Miller puts in his own opinion and random thoughts that are so scattered about they are barely comprehensible.  Even Miller says in the opening of this novel that it is not a story but rather a complaint.  A 300 page complaint I might add that runs around in tireless circles and never finds anywhere to go.<br /><br />I hated this book, hated it, hated it, hated it.  I hated every stupid thing about it.  Now, that does not sound like very constructive criticism, I know, so I'll give some reasons.<br /><br />If you want to be shocked then this will do it.  Not that I have a problem with shocking books, but this one is fit to be in your local XXX porn shop next to the usual assortment of bottom feeding trash.  The book's sole function seems to be to get to one sex scene to another, with Millers rambling incoherent thoughts filling the void between.  It was like Miller took a big tablet of LSD and began writing.  Art or trash?  How about trashy art?<br /><br />The biggest problem of the novel lies not within the shocking content of the novel, but rather the narrator who tells it.  Miller is racist, sexist, egotistical, crude, obnoxious, mean spirited, and degrading.  Do you really want to sit and read 300 pages of something like that?

Some experts claim the writing style is unique and original.  I guess even trash can be original and unique.  Perhaps there is no middle road here.  I can't imagine anyone being in between here.

Miller is the man we all know we want to be, but can't.  He is so intoxicated by the beauty of being alive that even the scuzziest, most puerile alleyways in the Parisian slums will receive his wonderful poetic musings that stretch on for pages and combine a profound philosophical depth with striking imagery.  Miller ruminates on sex, on Matisse and Cezanne, on feces, on literature, on prostitutes, on America, on his own destitution and poverty, and most compellingly on the very sad human condition.  But the human condition is not only ruminated upon, it is laughed at and derided, and confronted with its own foolishness.  Surely this has been as much a source of annoyance for censors as the persistent use of a certain c-word.  Henry Miller brilliantly makes his case for the uninhibited man who is able to expel neuroses, anxiety and depression through the simple act of being himself and accepting his imperfections.<br /><br />  Reading Henry Miller is disorienting at first.  He writes like noone else, and initially there seems to be no rhyme, reason or discipline to anything that is going on.  A passage will veer off into an extended musing about something seemingly insignificant before it has even been established what is supposed to be happening.  But we become comfortable with this style when we begin to understand its message; that it is a pure expression of joy and self-liberation in a written form, that the natural impulse of the human being to explore everything from every angle is a tragically suppressed one.  Many will accuse this of being a dangerously irresponsible novel, but I see nothing dangerous about it.  Miller's philosophy is a means of survival like any other, except that it allows the individual to live and feel in a genuine sense.  His boisterous, boastful presentation of his sexual exploits has had many seething with \\""indignation,\\"" but I can see envy underneath it.  Read this classic and be changed.derneath it.

Tropic of Cancer is his semi-autobiographical account of the time he spent there, penniless apart from the money sent by his wife or borrowed from his acquaintances (whom he describes critically, astutely, and at length), walking the streets, drinking, visiting brothels, philosophizing, and writing it all down. Early in the book Miller states \\""I have made a silent compact with myself not to change a line of what I write\\"", and he doesn't. The novel is rambling, often incoherent, pornographic, mysogynistic, antisemitic, obscene, and altogether offensive (in fact, though Henry Miller was American, Tropic of Cancer was not published in the United States for 30 years after it was written; in 1961, after a long court battle resulting in major changes in censorship laws, publishing was finally permitted). Sexual escapades are interspersed with nonsensical hallucinations and philosophical meanderings, the world and society are observed and commented upon at length, memories are recounted. One gets the sense that Miller would sit down at his typewriter and write something without even thinking, which perhaps would remind him of something else, about which he would then go into detail, until he became distracted and left, only to start again later on a completely different note. The way Miller rambles on reminds one in some way of Proust: sensory images follow one another in a largely undivided flow that lacks a real \\""point\\"" when taken as a whole, yet also has moments of stunning beauty and scathing social commentary. The language of the narrative is quite rough and sometimes innovative - Miller floods the reader with everything going through his head, leaving nothing unsaid, and softening nothing.

It is easy to despise Miller for his dissipated way of life and for his uncaring treatment of his fellow man (and woman; anyone with feminist views should be warned before she reads this book), but he does not ask the reader to love him, take him seriously, or to like or agree with what he says, nor does he care; he writes for himself, not for the audience.

Like a squinty eyed gunslinger who is impressive until you realize that he's an just an extra in a Clint Eastwood movie with a gun full of blanks, Miller is full of his own bluster and bravado that after a short while seems little more than a pose. Tropic of Cancer is a tedious exercise in misanthropy in which women are all c**ts and a mans' worth is judged by the size of his johnson and his bank account, ie how much the main character can sponge. The novel is a fictionalized autobiography about an American expat writer living in Paris. It's rambling, occasionally brilliant, swaggering, mysogonistic, anti semitic and ultimately dull, dull, dull.  Not much happens.  The novel is more concerned with character observation and commentary on humanity, female genitalia and the bohemian expat lifestyle which on the face of it, might sound interesting.  But the main character is a loveless (except for himself), misanthropic, self absorbed sexist jerk who about whom I couldn't give a damn.  He's a typical modernist anti-hero who flaunts social convensions and norms and \\""suffers\\"" for his art.  Of course he hangs out with a bohemian crowd, screws a lot of prostitutes all the while making fun of the \\""friends\\"" from whom he mooches meals, and his wife who sends him money from America.  The great number of incredibly unerotic (unappealing and mechanical) sex scenes just made me numb.  Miller makes sex into something that's more like trophy hunting than anything actually enjoyable.  Perhaps at the time this dissipated lifestyle may have been the heighth of hip, now it seems a pathetic and irresponsible macho pose.  Ultimately the main character is a slumming parasite, an annoying dillitente:  his lifestyle is almost pointless.  The prose is sometimes brilliant, but Tropic of Cancer is the type of book that is more fun to talk about than actually read, the kind of book that would increase your coolness factor with certain literary types.

And though his experiences vary from bouts of drunkenness to nights spent chasing after sex to the occasional insight into life in general, his prose veers from the mundane to the poetic, with almost nothing in between. As the Amazon.com editorial review suggests, it truly is a remarkable literary work of self-confession, and Miller's mercurial prose remains amazing to read all the way 'til the end.<br /><br />As I found this a mostly fascinating read, I won't go so far as to call this \\""overrated,\\"" like a lot of people my age (18) are tempted to do with a lot of much-acclaimed literary classics. I would be lying, though, if I didn't admit that I occasionally found its plotlessness rather wearying, and that I found Miller's lapses into floridity in his prose slightly irritating. Sometimes the prose, when he is feeling more poetically expansive, simply descends into unintelligibility---what is he talking about through all those fancy metaphors anyway? (The first few pages of the book suffer in this respect.) As for its lack of a real dramatic structure...well, it is obvious that that was hardly a concern for Miller, who I think is aiming for something different from the usual beginning, middle, and end here. TROPIC OF CANCER is, above all, about Miller's openness to different experiences, and I think it is that theme that binds together all the anecdotes Miller writes. By using this stream-of-consciousness style, he similarly opens the reader up to his own experiences, his own thoughts and feelings. It gives his prose an immensely compelling \\""live\\"" feel to it: the reader feels as if he is experiencing Miller's nocturnal adventures and thought processes at the same time he himself does, so masterful he is in his prose in creating an authentic sense of place.

Although he travelled across the Atlantic, he really didn't explore Europe the way Kerouac explored the US.

He observes how the higher activities - love, sex, creation, fidelity, art - have lost their divinity, dignity, poetry.  Sex seems to him dry and painful; work is absurd; death is meaningless, and literature is dead.  The only sort of goodness we are now capable of is to blow ourselves to bits.  But somehow Miller, despite his rage and pollution, seems innocent.  His book seems a lament.  His potency is founded in showing the cruelty and filth, but these would have no affect on him or us unless we also feel its opposites - kindness and purity.  Whenever he records the ugliness of his surroundings, he has discharged them and their effects from his soul, as in a sort of exorcism.  And this is why he appears an innocent soul.  Because innocent souls have an unreasoned but keen taste for suffering, and nothing seduces them so easily as does the view of a martyr.  In this instance, nature is the martyr; all of her processes polluted and corrupted by humans.<br />Miller's language is incisive, clear, potent, fresh...and new, a new sort of language, a language of the underworld translated into English.  His fast-paced, absurdly wild and filthy existence is beautifully documented; there is something in the surrounding which reminds one of the film Casablanca, perhaps the charm of desperation.<br />He is prone to philosophies, and some readers will prefer the adventure to the contemplation.  Also, his treatment of women is acutely unorthodox but should be further examined before being criticized.<br />Quotation:  `I have no money, no resources, no hopes.  I am the happiest man alive.

Miller will twist your guts until you want to scream at the depravity of the actions, thoughts, and outlook presented in short, sharp sentences that cut into your belly.  And then the prose will sing on the page and make it so you want to weep with the beauty of it.<br />As Miller writes into these conflicting thoughts it divides the brain; no, it causes the sides of your brain to smash into each other so hard that it hurts. Contrasting the beautiful with the ugly and the ugly with the beautiful, we are left feeling schizophrenic and scared out of our minds that this might actually be how the world is, how humanity is: eternally struggling with das tier darin und die seele.*<br />This conflict continues throughout the book up until the final page.  Miller seems convinced that this is the world we live in. One so sharply divided that not a single person can over come the beast all of the time.  Eventually we all succumb again to those animal needs of the genitals and the stomach. They can be waylaid with art and literature, but eventually the beast will rear its ugly head again, even with the smallest mention of a friends woman or the sight of food on a childs plate.<br />But while wallowing through the filth and obscenity, we must not ignore the moments of ambrosia in Miller's writing.  Millers philosophic passages point to a insightful, if not tortured, soul. One that looks into the world and can write on it beautifully. Miller reminds us that while the beast can get in our face, exploding out of our stomachs and genitalia, that we do have a side capable of beauty and wonder.<br />For Miller, like many modern writers, the world is a fractured place; split in two between the beauty and ugliness of man.  His expression of that in his writings reflects that very nature of humanity.  Miller is writing obscenities and poetry to keep us grounded.

But it's worth it just for the section of Van Norden's wanting to write something completely original, and Henry's missing of his wife. These sections are profound and true and wonderful and beautifully rendered. There's other good stuff, too, here and there.<br />Now, the dangerous part. Henry Miller made it fashionable to think you can be a bum/borderline sociopath, make fun of friends off of whom you live for your daily bread, avoid responsibilities and duties, and then publish self-indulgent ridicule about your dissolute lifestyle and derision of others and call it art. Fortunately, Henry was honest and talented enough at times to pull it off. And at times his writing raises to the levels of greatness.  But he kicked off a school of writing that has been the destruction of more than one good writer.<br />Another novel written at the same time, and covering much of the same material (indulgent, pleasure-seeking expatriate meeting up with all levels of a society in crisis), is Christopher Isherwood's Good-bye to Berlin. (It's like, hey, Henry, did you even notice that at the time you were muttering about blowing up the world, the country next door was electing a madman who would try to do just that.) The difference is Isherwood is a masterful writer and artist, and manages to artfully play off his self-absorption so that the reader isn't immersed in it, like in Henry Miller.

However, you will not fail to be impressed by the beauty of the prose and the sheer forcefulness and clarity of Miller's writing. Although he writes here about the darkest, grittiest, most painfully honest, down-to-earth every day subjects, he does it with a passion and exuberance, and a sheer joy for life. Although Miller was not a man in the best of circumstances when he was living the life the he describes in this book - a life that most of us, surely, would not wish to replicate - he was not a man despondent or dejected; indeed, he was positively brimming over with his joy in his circumstances. Though Miller writes candidly and very honestly about things that most every other book fails to mention - dirt, bugs, feces, sexually transmitted diseases - as long as he had food (and perhaps the occasional lay), he was happy. One may well call him a hedonist, but rarely do we see one embrace life so fully, its warts and all, as did Miller. We are lucky to have the chronicle of his experiences. Immediately famous and immediately banned as obscene upon its release in 1934, one sees, upon reading this book in the present day light, just what a major impact it has had on modern day literature. Aside from opening up a whole new school of literature and a new spector of art with this autobiographical novel, it also became the central point in the famous court decision that changed U.S. censorship laws forever. And yet, aside from its mere historical importance, the book remains vibrant, fresh, and exciting even today. Essential reading for anyone who craves their great literature off the beaten path.",2002-07-28

Thus, \\""Tropic of Cancer\\"" is significant as a historical artifact in addition to being a literary work of art. The book tells the story of an American writer named Henry Miller who lives in Paris. Henry definitely lives in the seedy underbelly of the city; the book follows him to the bars, cafes, and whorehouses and details his encounters with a number of colorful characters.<br />\\""Tropic of Cancer\\"" opens on a grungy note as the narrator discusses the lice infestation of his friend's armpits. Early on the narrator promises that this will not be a polite book: \\""This is libel, slander, defamation of character [...] a prolonged insult, a gob of spit in the face of Art.\\"" Miller largely succeeds to deliver on this promise. The book is full of profanity, and there are frank discussions of sex, sexually transmitted diseases, and other such topics.<br />The book has a crude charm and energy throughout, even though at times the prose seems wildly self-indulgent. Miller depicts Paris as a magical place, a pilgrimage site for artists and wanderers. The narrator often reflects on writing and literature in general, and on his own artistic goals and theories in particular. There is also reflection on America and American identity. Miller's prose sometimes attains a Whitmanesque revelatory quality.<br />To me the main question about this book is thus: Is it merely an important historic artifact, or does it still sing as a work of living literature? My own reply to this question: the book does still sing, delivering (to quote the book itself) \\""bloated pages of ecstasy slimed with excrement.\\"" If you like it, also check out the writing of Charles Bukowski.",2002-07-16

Its pacing is restless and energetic, which is all the more amazing considering that it has no plot.  I don't know how much of it is fiction, but it is obviously autobiographical and reads like a memoir, detailing its author's experiences living as an American expatriate in Paris in the 1920's.<br />Henry Miller is a bum (it must be admitted) living among the idle intellectuals in the seedier neighborhoods of Paris (might he have bumped into Hemingway?).  He's not always unemployed; he takes temporary jobs like a proofreader at a newspaper and an English instructor at a Lycee in Dijon, and he always has a place to live, albeit filthy.  Most of the time he's cavorting with friends, making new ephemeral acquaintances, visiting brothels, and engaging in the kind of promiscuity of which such a life avails itself, despite the fact that he has a wife back in America.  He doesn't shy away from any of the disgusting details of living and loving -- in the novel's opening scene, he is shaving his roommate's armpit hair for lice, and believe me, it only gets worse -- but Miller thrives in the squalor and wouldn't have it any other way.  Compared to his native New York, which he considers impersonal, cold, and hollow, Paris is warm and intimate, brimming with life and beauty.<br />&quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; is very similar to two popular books that followed it by a quarter of a century: Jack Kerouac's &quot;On the Road&quot; in content (run-on anecdotes about outrageous activities with his friends, pulsating with waves of existentialist rambling, the main difference being that Miller is a much better writer than Kerouac), and William S. Burroughs's &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; in style (stream-of-consciousness narration using striking imagery in random juxtaposition).  Miller possessed the spirit, if not the seed, of the Beat Generation -- his existence can be summarized in his self-description as &quot;spiritually dead, physically alive, morally free.&quot;<br />This is also perhaps the book's greatest fault -- its influence outstrips its literary quality.

I suppose that Tropic got its reputation for being the first of its kind and the thing that stood out in most peoples minds was the sex.  Reading it in todays overly-saturated-with-sex culture, the things that stands out the most to me are the bedbugs, lice, feces, etc.<br />Miller is trying to do something radically different in this book  to create a new art form.  It isnt even a book, according to him; it is a prolonged insult, a gob of spit in the face of Art  It is ultimately a song, he says.  There is no plot, no linear storythere arent even chapters  just anecdotes and opinions of Millers life in Paris ejaculated all over the pages.  He wants to give priority to all the things that other novels pretend dont exist: sex, going to the bathroom, uncleanness  watching a whore use a bidet before sex.  To Miller, these carnal aspects of life are the realities and should be the subject of art  not love, romance, or war.  He tries to give an accurate portrait of what it was like to be a peasant in Paris in the early 20th century  the cold reality of the fantasy of Moulin Rouge!<br />In the end, Millers works are a triumph of style over substance.

I think this is because there is nothing for academics to do with his books. Henry says what Henry means, there really is no need to interpret his meaning. So don't be scared off just because your instructors never mention this book. It's meant to be enjoyed outside the confines of institutions such as college anyway. Henry's point of view is the man in the street. Sometimes(most of the time) he is dealing with very basic issues like food(mostly where the next meals coming from) and sex which he likes to have often. Henry is a man perhaps limited to a few appetites but that is why he is fun to hang out with. He enthuses you with his own enthusiasms. He can be funny, depressing, and surprisingly poetic in his visions which may have been brought on by hunger or drink or just desperation to have a vision.

Both tell pretty straightforward tales about themselves trying to live the way they want. They should be read for no other reason than for the pure enjoyment they give.

It semi-autobiographically describes Miller's vagabond life in 1930s Paris, blasting off from mundane conversations and cold sexual encounters into flying, flowing strands of poetic imagery and useful, if not always agreeable, wisdom glorifying the individual over any semblence of community.<br />Miller writes of dead-end jobs at a newspaper and boarding school (his entry about his proofreading job should be required reading for would-be newspapermen), fleeting, fleecing relationships with friends and acquaintances (Miller's betrayal at book's end, not only of his friend but of his disdain to material wealth, is revelatory) and the rooms, city, and country he lived in (his descriptions of dark Paris streets and bordellos,  their residents and patrons read sensual and grotesque, but hold humanity better than their scribe. His descriptions of New York skyscrapers are intriguing and surreal). His frank conversations among bedmates, liberal use of offensive words for women and minorities would easily fit on an Enimem rap album in 2000; imagine what audiences emerging from the Victorian era must have thought. Miller's sexual descriptions are even today too raw, mean-spirited and selfish to stand even as pornography.<br />But amid Miller's poetic, not narrative, wordflow (a vivid, hilarious description of a bar fight notwithstanding), &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; seems most to rankle vision and values Americans hold as close as their beloved eagle and flag symbols. (No accident that Miller gets evicted from job and living quarters on America's religious holiday, July 4). 40 years before punk's Sex Pistols mocked their countrymen by singing &quot;No future for you!&quot;, Miller joyously lived without having or wanting one. His world in &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; is without savings, family, hope, history, reverence, or respect. All this in years of the American and world's Great Depression; Miller's famous opening lines &quot;I have no money, no resources, no hopes.

One review even suggested that pretentious intellectuals are reduced to schoolboys when reading Miller's novel; clearly, this reviewer believes all intellectuals are male.<br />While Miller's novel is exciting and wild as it tells of a life that transgresses social codes, I cannot imagine wanting to know the narrator or anyone like him. He is a leech who requires others to follow the social codes so that he may feed off of them. The narrator refuses to examine his own assumptions and the way these shape his behavior and attitudes.<br />I think this book may only be redemptive if the author is distanced from the narrator to a degree. I wonder if the point of the novel is to question how far removed the narrator actually is from social norms. I don't think it's very far, and I think this is where the greatness of the book potentially lies. Instead of being a commentary on the way we ought to live freely, the novel seems to be a description of how bounded we are by cultural constructions that shape our perceptions and our behavior--no matter how we try to escape. The narrator's outrageous behavior and attitudes, then, are intensified images of societal norms rather than examples of living outside a social code.<br />I do believe that social codes often need to be challenged.

Henry Miller, an open-minded American intellectual went to Paris  in the pursuit of - - life - - wanting to feel alive, and to tell the whole  world about it.  He ended up in the gutter of that very alive city,  occasionally coming up to breathe in what was upper class or only  bourgeois. At the same time he found comfort in the books of authors like  Dostoevsky, Strindberg and Hamsun, whom he compared to Mozart, and about  &quot;Mysteries&quot; he later said: &quot;No book stands closer to me. It  prevented me from killing myself.&quot; (He read it a dozen times.)  Parallels can be drawn between classics like &quot;Mysteries&quot; -  &quot;Ulysses&quot; - &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; - even to &quot;Catcher  in the Rye&quot;. Displays of genuine feelings, dry wit, rage and  disillusionment and then sudden lyrical beauty. &quot;Tropic of  Cancer&quot;  portrays dirt and lowlife, primitive lust and diseases, the  diseases of the individual and of mankind, but at the same time Miller  never totally loses a sense of beauty. This is a book packed with  incredible descriptions of his life in the 1930s Paris, and even when  delirium turns into surrealistic joyrides he is still nothing less than  brilliant.  This is quite a different Paris from that of Fitzgerald's and  Hemingway's. They might also have had their struggles, but their  experiences were still different from that of Henry Miller's lice, bedbugs,  cockroaches and tapeworms. And still Henry Miller could find comfort in the  struggling idols before him. One place in the book he describes how he went  to see where and how Strindberg lived during his time in the same city,  just to show himself that it was possible to sink even deeper...

It wasn't quite  as innovative as a lot of people have claimed, though.  It strongly  resembles &quot;Hunger&quot; by Norwegian novelist Knut Hamsun (one of  Miller's favorite writers and an acknowledged influence on his work), with  the difference, of course, that Miller makes absolutely no concessions to  public decorum.<br />Miller doesn't have the remarkable ability to describe  psychological states that distinguished early Hamsun, or his nicely limpid  style.  Instead, he's fond of unleashing lots and lots of baroque  philosophical bombast upon the page, which sometimes gets tiresome.  &quot;To fathom the new reality it is first necessary to dismantle the  drains, to lay open the gangrened ducts which compose the genito-urinary  system that supplies the excreta of art.&quot;  Uh, whatever you say,  Henry....

In it, he mentions “whores” 40 times.  He uses the “C” word at least 92 times. But this is just to tease the reader, to distract us from his genius.<br /><br />With this brilliant masterpiece, Miller has created a work of art as important to literature as any book ever written.  Miller elevated what could be accomplished with the novel so far above all prior writing that this work of greatness stands alone.<br /><br />Miller dispensed with a traditional narrative, and instead blended autobiography, philosophy, biting social commentary, hallucinogenic passages and crude comedy to achieve the ultimate aim of great literature- to find truth.  Miller avers that life and art are inextricably connected and the only real art is able to find truth in the base misery of the general human existence.  In a wonderfully meta- way, the central truth of his novel is the artist as a separate class of being who is in search of truth- and experiences the ecstasy of that process.<br />The novel is a series of vignettes, separate brushstrokes, as Miller paints with words.  His palette is considerable.  He distracts us with his crude sexual language, using misdirection to trick us into missing his genius.  There is a lot here!<br /><br />When Miller wants to, he writes lyrical, poetic prose.  He does it sparingly, perhaps to keep the pacing fast, but sometimes he is just showing off, like a musician in a self-indulgent solo, when he writes beautiful passages like this one:<br /><br />“Twilight hour.  Indian blue, water of glass, trees glistening and liquescent.”<br /><br />He loves to play around with words sometimes, like Nabakov:<br /><br />“The wine is splashing between my legs, the sun is splashing through the bay window, and inside my veins there is a bubble and splash of a thousand crazy things that commence to gush out of me now pell-mell.”<br /><br />One of the central “characters” of the book is the City of Lights.  His descriptions of Paris are incandescent and gritty:<br /><br />“The day begins gloriously: a bright sky, a fresh wind, the houses newly washed.”<br /><br />Throughout, Miller always comes back to art, beauty, truth, and the aim of the artist:<br /><br />“On the threshold of that big hall whose walls are now ablaze, I pause a moment to recover from the shock which one experiences when the habitual gray of the world is rent asunder and the color of life splashes forth in song and poem.  I find myself in a world so natural, so complete, that I am lost.  I have the sensation of being immersed in the very plexus of life, focal from whatever place, position or attitude I take my stance.”<br /><br />But he believes life must be lived before it can be written:<br /><br />“Ideas have to be wedded to action; if there is no sex, no vitality in them, there is no action.  Ideas cannot exist alone in the vacuum of the mind.  Ideas are related to living…”<br /><br />Then, near end of the book, he reaches his climax, the central truth with a capital “T” that he is writing for:<br /><br />“Everything is packed into a second which is either consummated or not consummated. The earth is not an arid plateau of health and comfort, but a great sprawling female with velvet torso that swells and heaves with ocean billows; she squirms beneath a diadem of sweat and anguish.  Naked and sexed she rolls among the clouds in the violet light of the stars.  All of her, from her generous breasts to her gleaming thighs, blazes with furious ardor.”<br /><br />He continues, explaining what true art is:<br /><br />“I reflect that the task which the artist implicitly sets himself is to overthrow existing values, to make of the chaos about him an order which is his own, to sow strife and ferment so that by the emotional release those who are dead may be restored to life, then it is that I run with joy to the greatand imperfect ones, their confusion nourishes me, their stuttering is like divine music to my ears.”<br /><br />Then finally, his exultation, the truth, the message:<br /><br />“Do anything, but let it produce joy.  Do anything, but let it yield ecstasy.”and imperfect ones, their confusion nourishes me, their stuttering is like divine music to my ears.”<br /><br />Then finally, his exultation, the truth, the message:<br /><br />“Do anything, but let it produce joy.
