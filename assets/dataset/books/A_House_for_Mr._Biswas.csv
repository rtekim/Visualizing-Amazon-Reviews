Naipaul's A House for Mr. Biswas provides a reader with a wonderfully realized Indian immigrant world set in Trinidad, where Naipaul grew up. Cultural mores brought over from the home country continue to influence the characters but are also under pressure from new influences not just from the natives of the island but also the colonial British and, eventually, the Americans who come to Trinidad as part of the World War II war effort.<br /><br />The novel tells the life story of Mr. Biswas (he's called that even as a child by the narrator), though his last years and death are given early on so there is no suspense about whether he will be a success or live a long life. In a way, it's like how Orson Welles approached the life of Charles Foster Kane in Citizen Kane, which begins with a synopsis of Kane's life and death before starting his life story.<br /><br />Mr. Biswas, son of a poor family who marries almost accidentally into the somewhat prosperous Tulsi clan, spends most of his life trying to make it on his own (the house of the title is the pre-eminent symbol of this ambition). This is all retailed in a wonderfully distinctive prose style that is comic, colorful and eloquent. I especially enjoyed the many descriptions of life in the Tulsi household, a madhouse of kids, wives and distant relative hangers-on with its own rigid social structure that somehow works.<br /><br />Naipaul was one of the first non-white writers from the British colonial empire to find international success writing in English and this was the book that put him on the map.

I don't remember the specific book that my professor recommended, but I remember him saying that V.S. Naipaul was Trinidadian. Immediately, I went researching. I never heard of Naipaul, somehow, though I was born in Trinidad myself (Chagaunas Trinidad too, same place Naipaul was born in) and immigrated to America in the mid 1990s. Immediately, I discovered that \\""V.S. Naipaul\\"" is an acclaimed writer - a Nobel Laureate. His best work, I heard many people say, is \\""House for Mr. Biswas\\"" (1961), so I started with this one with high expectations.<br /><br />Naipaul's biggest strength is his prose. The sentences are very concise, evocative, and fluid. I appreciated getting such a colorful picture of post-colonial Trinidad, my native country. Reading it, I could visualize the run-down houses, the Indo and Afro conflicts, and the sugarcane plantations. I never got to see this Trinidad, being born about two generations after, but I can imagine my grandparents living in this setting. Naipaul's writing is on par with Charles Dickens, Herman Melville, Jane Austen, and other legends. He's that good.<br /><br />Some of the references also made me nostalgic: \\""Hanuman House,\\"" \\""Milo,\\"" \\""Ovaltine,\\"" \\""Mayoro,\\"" and \\""Port of Spain\\"" are some words that I had not heard in a long time. I used to drink Milo and Ovaltine each morning before going to Chaguanas Government School as a child. It was almost surreal to see these words in an actual English novel.<br /><br />Now, that aside, the book didn't give me much else, unfortunately.<br /><br />The book is long, 564 pages in the Vintage International Edition, and I couldn't stand it. I have no problem with long books; I study English Literature. I've read works like Bleak House, Middlemarch, Pamela, and Moby Dick, which were all longer than this one. The problem is that this book couldn't maintain my interest enough to keep me chugging along enthusiastically until the very end (Ultimately, I did manage to finish by forcing myself to keep going).<br /><br />The pace is slow. There is no conflict. There is no drama. There is no suspense.  The plot is, in condensed form, the story of a man (a \\""loser\\"") who experiences a variety of disappointments until buying a house and living a life of autonomy.  Given the theme (An average man's quest for independence), I'm sure Naipaul intended for the plot to be tedious. After all, Mr. Biswas isn't some macho warrior or some grandiose emperor; nothing exciting happens to the guy, and the plot reflects this.<br /><br />Still, as a writer Naipaul should have known to make the book shorter. You can't have slow moving plot and a long novel. It doesn't mix; you're asking too much of your reader. By the time I got to page 364, I was ready for this book to wrap itself up, but I still had 200 more pages to plow through.<br /><br />Please know what you're getting into if you decide to read this book. This is not a fun book to read. If you want a more enjoyable experience, try skimming the descriptions of Mr. Biswas' in-laws, the Tulis.

Born into a roughly middle class family and a highly structured and ritualized Hindu lifestyle, Mr. Biswas (and this is how he is referred to, even as a newborn) unwittingly marries into a large, relatively prosperous, multi-generational Indian family (The Tulsis).  These in-laws provide insurance against his frequent failures; however never fail to rankle him with their condescension and sarcasm as he attempts \\""to paddle his own boat.\\""  Virtually the entire book chronicles his struggle to escape the Tulsi orbit, symbolized by his yearning for and pursuit of his own dwelling.<br /><br />The novel is instructive in its depiction of life on the Caribbean island during the period surrounding the two World Wars of the early twentieth century.  The interaction between the ethnic Indians, the natives of the island and the mixed race inhabitants is also of some interest.  All in all, however, the story fails to capture the reader's interest and becomes little more than a recitation of chronological events, many of whom seem to repeat themselves ad infinitum.<br /><br />While the title character's struggles are sometimes inspiring (but almost universally unsuccessful), it is difficult to become emotionally invested in his endeavors for the simple reason that he is not an exceptionally pleasant or \\""good\\"" person.  In fact, he is a miserable human being; an awful husband, a terrible father, an ungrateful, whining, complaining, lazy, two faced, hypocritical liar and spendthrift.  His many failures are almost pre-destined and fail to engender any kind of sympathy (except for his long suffering wife and children, who were it not for Mr. Biswas's in-laws would have likely starved to death).<br /><br />The story is not without its interesting vignettes, but they are far fewer than one would hope for in a novel of this repute.",2012-02-01

Naipaul","Naipaul's most well-known novel is about Mohun Biswas, a permanently unsatisfied man with marginal writing talent who lives with his wife and children in Trinidad. He has a thankless existence; he constantly fights with his colorful set of in-laws, never really connects with his kids, doesn't seem to love his wife, and bounces from job to job. His main goal in life is to own a home of his own, away from everyone else in the world where he could be free and as miserable as he wants. The ending, bittersweet and just right, subtly explores modern man's futile pursuit of happiness and the encumbrances he faces in attaining it throughout life.    Naipaul expertly balances Biswas' deeper, darker pursuits in life with a comedic, larger-than-life backdrop. The book is never laugh-out-loud funny, but derives its dry humor through the reader's pity of the character. Nuanced scenes follow one after another, each adding depth to the character's motivations and the novel's underlying themes. It may appear slow going at first, but makes more sense once you get attuned to the pace of the book. My only issue with the book is the style in which it is written. The tone throughout is very reserved, with little concern for rhythm or music, and it is difficult to get completely in-sync with it. Because of this I always felt at a distance from the story, just like poor Mr Biswas with everyone else in his life, so who knows if it was intentional.

Such novels need to be big, both in their time frame and in number of pages. Don't expect them to cater to your cultural values or desires for diversion.<br /><br />Mr Biswas, however, is very entertaining, one of the funniest novels I've ever read, and the last in which V.S. Naipaul allowed full freedom for his exuberant sense of humor and the picturesque. If you are too upright to find the poor and alienated a proper subject for satire, you might well find old Biswas more frustrating than touching. If so, I pity you. In this book and in his earlier Trinidadian novels, Naipaul wrote from the inside out, and it was chiefly himself than he was mocking. His later novels, great as some of them are, view their subjects from the outside, from Olympus as it were. Frankly, I think A House for Mr. Biswas is naipaul's greatest achievement.<br /><br />What other novels are there that expand almost to be congruent with their whole cultural setting? If I name some, you'll see how highly I value Biswas:<br /><br />Don Quixote, for Spain in its Golden Age<br />Simplicius Simplicissimus, for 17th C Germany<br />Tom Jones, for 18th C England<br />Dombey and Sons, for 19th C England<br />The Makioka Sisters, for pre-Americanization Japan<br />Buddenbrooks, for pre-WW1 Germany<br /><br />That's enough.

It's true that A House for Mr Biswas is often funny and always biting, but as a novel this is tragic and grindingly dark stuff. Even the happy ending (given away at the beginning of the book; I'm not spoiling anything for you here), only is a happy end of sorts. Perhaps it is the inexhaustible undercurrent of cheerfulness amid the squalor that makes this so readable, and on the surface a `comic' work.    The novel describes the life of Mohun Biswas, the son of poor peasants of Indian descent in Trinidad, and his long trajectory from the sugarcane worker's hut to a still precarious position as dispatch writer for one of the capital's newspapers. Most of it is concerned with his struggle to escape from his very closed, self-obsessed community, still ridden with the caste prejudices and rituals of a Mother India its members have never seen, and from the tentacles of the Tulsi clan, a monster wringing dry the weak for the benefit of the leaders, into which he was tricked into marrying. Biswas wastes his life among the fields in various backwaters. He is swindled to ruin as a shopkeeper. He is threatened with knifing and arson. But mostly he can't be alone; he can't obtain the privacy, the minimum self-sufficiency without which there can be no dignity and for which the all-encompassing desire to own his own house comes to stand.    Probably largely autobiographical - Biswas appears loosely modelled on Naipaul's father - A House for Mr Biswas has the strength of novels written from experience. It is richly precise and vivid in its portrayal of places, of people and situations, and in recording the passage of time in the small island of Trinidad. It transports the reader to a doubly foreign, faraway world, to great effect. In fact, the strangeness adds to the disorientation one shares with Biswas, making the story even more realistic. And this block of a novel is ceaselessly imaginative and never boring.

Naipaul's answer to \\""David Copperfield,\\"" a novel that uses his real-life experiences as showcase for his art and his darkly complex view of humanity.<br /><br />Mohun Biswas didn't get many breaks in his life. Born into a miserable family made destitute by the freakish death of his father, he lost his vocation to be a holy man when forced to eat too many bananas, then took to sign painting, which landed him into a loveless marriage, not to mention a set of in-laws who browbeat him mercilessly.<br /><br />All this is by means of saying \\""A House For Mr. Biswas\\"" is a comedy that depends on your frame of reference. If you get worked up about butchered puppies, conniving solicitor's clerks, communist brothers-in-law who slap children for mishandling hands of cards, etc., you may find this book a long, difficult read. But if you approach it as a work of fiction, you may enjoy it for the rich gumbo it offers.<br /><br />\\""She talked with pride of the beatings she had received from her short-lived husband,\\"" is Naipaul's description of one minor character, one of Biswas' in-laws. \\""She regarded them as a necessary part of her training and often attributed the decay of Hindu society in Trinidad to the rise of the timorous, weak, non-beating class of husband.\\""<br /><br />Few characters come off well, including Biswas, a drip who whines about the in-laws even as he eats their food. His one hope for redemption, it seems, is to find a house to call his own, but each effort to do this brings only greater grief and ruin, financial and otherwise.<br /><br />I can see why people find this a tough slog, but of course Naipaul isn't writing to schmooze his readers with ideas of what a humanitarian he is. He may be the most dyspeptic Nobel laureate in history, though his uncompromising vision is also the source of much of his power. That's not to say \\""A House For Mr. Biswas\\"" is without grace, just lacking sentimentality as it roots through the various passages of Mr. Biswas's life with pinpoint precision and pinprick candor. By the end, you feel much like you lived his life with him minute-by-minute, which may be Naipaul's most impressive feat in this very impressive book.<br /><br />The absence of a central plot as well as the length makes this a harder read than other Naipaul tomes, and those wanting more of a story and less of a character piece may want to start with something like \\""A Bend In The River,\\"" which has other things going for it, too.<br /><br />Sure, I found this heavy-going, but I was glad to read it, and read it again.

He was born at the wrong time of day and the midwife claimed that he would &quot;eat up his own mother and father.&quot; From his birth Mohan struggled with the midwife's prophesy while trying to get his life on the correct track, gain independence, and most importantly, to purchase a house for his family away from his meddling in-laws that would give him some peace and quiet. At the surface this novel appears to tell a simple tale of one man's life, but as the story progresses it becomes evident that there is much more to this story than what first meets the eye. <br />V.S. Naipaul spins a delightful tale of rural Indian populations in the Caribbean island of Trinidad. The reader gains a perspective on the multi-cultural history of this island nation while assimilating new beliefs and customs. This novel creates an atmosphere full of poverty, dirt, and apathy but in the midst the main protagonist is determined to make it one his own terms and conditions. Amongst it all there is a clear sense of hope.<br />There is little doubt that the character of Mohan is certainly not an overall likeable man. He has a tendency to be selfish and rude to those who have helped him. But at other times I felt pity and compassion as some of his dearest altruistic actions failed miserably. Mohan is a wonderful yet flawed character.<br />One of the aspects of this novel that I loved most was the humor that often made me laugh out loud! Mohan's interactions with his wife's extended family are often hilarious and riotous. He can certainly make a fool of himself if left to his devices. But I have to admit that the best part were the stories that he wrote while working as journalism in Port of Spain. I continue to laugh just thinking about them!<br />Overall, THE HOUSE OF MR. BISWAS was a wonderful and rewarding reading experience for me that drew on virtually all emotions.

Now, I consider myself an intelligent person and an avid reader but I fail to see what's so great about this novel. For the first time in my life, I stopped reading a book after 400 pages into it. It was, with the only word I can think of, unbearable.    Why would you like a novel? The least sophisticated reason might be the story being interesting, or entertaining. If your idea of an interesting story is one of a lifetime loser who keeps changing jobs, constantly complaining about his rich in-laws but after every failure goes back to them to live with 50 other people in the same house, sleeping on the floor; endless family quarrels; ignorant people who speak broken English etc, this book might be for you, because from the beginning to the end, that's what you get. There is nothing that gives you a curious, exciting feeling of \\""what's going to happen next?\\""; from his birth to his death you read the uninteresting life story of a loser with uninteresting details. You don't feel badly about him, you don't sympathize with him, you don't hope him to \\""make it this time\\"", but you read and read and read and nothing changes. As such, I wouldn't be exaggerating much if I say that there isn't really a plot. If you listen to your grandfather's life story one night and write it the next few days, you can do just as well as the author of this novel, if not better, because at least there is a good chance that anybody's grandfather had a more interesting life than the completely uninteresting life of the protagonist, Mr. Biswas. As for humor like the other reviewers found, that's also a complete mystery to me. There is no humor.    I read other novels with stories that doesn't interest me but the way the story was told was so beautiful that I couldn't stop reading. Immediately, \\""Old Man and the Sea\\"" of Hemingway comes to my mind. Fishing, personally, is not interesting for me; as such if a fishing lover friend starts telling me how he tried to catch a fish in details, I would quickly find a way to change the subject. But \\""Old Man and the Sea\\"" happens to be one of my favorite novels because the language, the prose is just beautiful. Naipaul, however, is not Hemingway. It was further amazing for me to read that a lot of reviewers praised Naipaul's prose. In my opinion, his prose is better than an average high school student, but that's as good as it gets. There is no \\""art\\"", no elegance in his prose. He just writes Mr. Biswas' life in historical order. It's like a chronology without the dates.    If I should force myself to say anything good about the book, maybe it exposes you to a foreign culture little bit. But just little bit and not in a thought provoking way.    I realize I feel and think so much opposite to the majority.  When so many people like and praise this book and my position is the exact opposite, maybe the problem is me. Maybe I fail to see what they see. Logically, it is quite possible that I am just wrong. But as a well-read person, it is hard for me to put aside my confidence and accept that. So another possibility I can think of is as follows: Giving literary awards is not an easy task. Literature is not mathematics, literary taste is in some degree, subjective. Sometimes there might even be other influences, political or otherwise. One way or another, once a work gets awarded Nobel prize however, it becomes difficult for people to open mindedly criticize it. They try to force themselves to like it, and if they can't like it they don't express it for fear of sounding unsophisticated, unintelligent, or downright stupid. So usually you only see positive criticisms.     If you are still curious about the book, read it. I leave it up to you to decide between the to possibilities.",2004-04-04

Naipaul to be one of our very greatest living writers.  Without a doubt (in my opinion anyway) A House for Mr. Biswas is his masterpiece, and perhaps one of the most beautiful books ever written.<br />I don't say this because Biswas contains pages of flowery prose or some sort of cheesy feel-good plot.  In fact, it is one of Naipaul's greatest strengths that he needs no gimicks in his writing whatsoever.  What you see is what you get.  Its like listening to Brahms, but different in that Naipaul is a completely modern writer.  Modern, but without anything uncomfortably experimental or trendy.<br />The beauty of Naipaul's writing is deep, and always somewhere just beneath the surface.  First of all it is in his structure.  The over-arching themes of the novel are integrated seamlessly into the a plot-line that reads more like an actual life than your conventional exposition, climax, etc.  The comedy and the tragedy of Biswas are to be found side-by-side, and every page bears the imprint of a master stylist.

In this novel, V.S. Naipaul vividly and picturesquely describes Trinidad as a thriving but generally poor island populated by a strong Hindu community with a waning observance of the caste system and where, even well into the twentieth century, the most common mode of transportation is the bicycle.<br />Naipaul's titular protagonist, Mohun Biswas, was born a bad omen, declared by a pundit (Hindu scholar) to be the eventual downfall of his parents; the prophecy is seemingly fulfilled when his father accidentally dies because of his mischief.  After some brief schooling, Mr. Biswas (as he is called throughout the novel, even as a young boy) embarks on a series of odd jobs:  After an unsuccessful apprenticeship to a pundit, he is sent to work in a relative's rumshop and later becomes a sign-painter.  It is on this job that he meets a pretty girl named Shama, whose family, named Tulsi, owns many properties and businesses in Trinidad.  A marriage is arranged between Biswas and Shama, and he soon finds himself a prisoner of the Tulsi family in a way, a situation which becomes the basis for his lifelong struggle for independence.  <br />The Tulsis' house, called the Hanuman House, is crowded with members of Shama's extended family, including her mother, her uncle Seth, who manages much of the family's businesses, brothers, sisters, and innumerable and indistinguishable nieces and nephews -- living conditions which lead to irritation and violent arguments with in-laws.  The Tulsis give him a shop to run and a sugarcane field to oversee, but he lets deadbeats and workers take advantage of him.  His attempt to build his own house and move away from the Tulsis for good, with the help of an incompetent carpenter, ends in disaster.  <br />On his own initiative, he becomes a reporter for a Trinidad newspaper, the Sentinel, writing sensational and often embellished stories, interviewing &quot;Deserving Destitutes,&quot; and learning a new kind of creativity which grants him true vocational freedom from the Tulsis.  Meanwhile, Shama bears him four children, among whom there is only one son, Anand, whose fragile relationship with his father instills the novel with touching moments of realism.  <br />It's easy to empathize with Mr. Biswas, for he is a character of the most universal sort -- everyone can relate to his desire for autonomy, freedom, and independence.  He could be a symbol of the emancipation of a controlled people -- specifically, Indian independence from the British empire -- but the novel also succeeds on its surface level.  We know from the prologue that Mr. Biswas eventually does escape the Tulsis and obtain a house, a decrepit, boxlike affair that hardly seems like a personal triumph.

Though I have never been to Trinidad, I now feel like I've spent significant time there.  Using very few words, Naipaul paints a portrait of what poverty in Trinidad looked like, emotionally, economically and socially.  He also takes a protagonist who seems very harsh and abrasive at first, and makes him into a sympathetic character.  We grow as he does.  I've seldom read books that have made me able to so fully climb into the skin of a character, but this one does it.  You feel his anguish, and understand his few joys.  All of this is done with a very economical use of words.  This is truly one of the best books I've ever read.  I can't reccommend it enough.",2002-03-09

Naipaul, reads like an epic and is clearly the work of an accomplished writer.  Naipaul's depiction of one man's life, beginning with his birth in rural Trinidad at which time he is labeled as \\""cursed\\"" by the local holy man, is an extraordinary account of an ordinary man and his struggle to provide for his family.  So why does this book, filled with beautiful prose, memorable characters, and heart-wrenching events, feel like it is about 200 pages too long?<br /><br />Mohun Biswas, an ethnic-Indian born in Trinidad in the early 1900s, abruptly marries into the Tulsi family, and his life is from that point on dominated by his controlling mother-in-law, Mrs. Tulsi, and Seth, her brother and head of the Tulsi household.  The Tulsi family provides him with housing and various jobs, ranging from managing their dry goods store to supervising their farm, but they also provide him with constant harassment and grief.  Mr. Biswas longs for the day that he can own his own home, and his pursuit of this goal is the novel's persistent theme which gives it its epic quality.<br />A House For Mr. Biswas is, ultimately, a finely crafted novel.  Naipaul's powerful, moving prose beautifully depicts the struggle, pain, and sorrow of one man's life; at the same time he paints a calm and full portrait of the ethnic-Indian experience in rural Trinidad.  In many ways, this book does for rural Trinidad what John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath does for Salinas, California.  It's only flaw, perhaps, is that the book's length feels somewhat forced, as if Naipaul believed that a 600-page novel would more powerfully depict his character's tragic nature than, say, a 400-page novel.  The truth is that Naipaul's prose is so robust, and his characters so genuinely human, that A House For Mr. Biswas achieved the status of epic long before its final page.",2002-01-26

Naipaul is unerringly accurate when describing the extended Indian family: the competition between parents over the successes of each other's children; the power of money and elder authority; the elevation of boys over girls in terms of future possibilities and education.<br />Mr. Biswas is a heartbreaking and frustrating character. His mistakes, his ignorance, flares of tempers, and his valiant attempts at tryng to become independent from his mother's family turn him into a three dimensional character - one that you can both love and hate. His family is also well developed and complex - from his wife Shama to his young son, Anand, struggling under the weight of familial expectations. <br />This book didn't receive a four star review because it doesn't always capture your full attention. This is not the type of novel you spend all weekend reading. It is the type of novel that you read for a half hour to twenty minutes before going to bed, it's good but it's not enough to keep you up all night unable to put it down. <br />The second criticism I have of the book is its rushed ending. The novel itself has an interesting structure, in that we learn the future of Mr. Biswas, backtrack and then follow the course of his life up until his death. However, those few pages at the beginning of the novel are the same as what you receive at the end - a rushed and incomplete rendering of Mr. Biswas's dream - a house of his own. Also, the reader after several hundred pages is expected to remember the details from the beginning that Naipaul neglects to reiterate at the end. Considering the tremendous detail that accompanies the rest of the book one has to wonder if this was a planned theme: the realization of a dream isn't all that fulfilling; or was it simply laziness on the part of the author? That dilemma is for you to resolve.",2002-01-17

( Naipaul, that is)!!","A House for Mr. Biswas is all of the following -- complex, psychologically perceptive, emotionally difficult, rewarding, moving, depressing, tragi-comic, deeply ironic, metaphoric, nightmarishly surreal, utterly believable, honest, exasperating, claustrophobic, prudish in some ways (no sex, for instance), deeply human, liberating, brilliant, frustrating, beautifully written  and much more. It is a book which very well may tempt you, as it tempted me, to just say the hell with it about halfway through, as Mr. Biswas struggles, but never seems able to achieve, autonomy, self respect, happiness, freedom (especially from the suffocating, sprawling Tulsi family  the ultimate in-laws from hell!!), let alone the house referred to in the title. But dont give in to temptation! A House for Mr. Biswas is a book that richly rewards those who stick with it, who persevere, just as Mr. Biswas does, although at times you may feel like you cant take it anymore (one step forwards, two steps back, argggghhh!). Perhaps a helpful attitude in reading this book, which I strongly recommend you consider, is to think of yourself as a reader and learner (to use V.S. Naipauls term for the Tulsi schoolchildren) at the feet of a superb writer with something to say and a great deal of wisdom to impart.<br />In sum, A House for Mr. Biswas is a deeply satisfying (as opposed to entertaining or superficially enjoyable) book, NOT easy summer beach reading, but a book which confirms the psychological cliché that its the HARD STUFF which is potentially the most rewarding emotionally. So, dont let the fact A House for Mr. Biswas is not easy scare you off, because this is truly a brilliant book, and one which richly deserves its ranking as one of the best books of the century (#72 on the Modern Librarys best fiction list, for instance). Oh, and by the way, why hasnt V.S. Naipaul won the Nobel prize for literature yet?  (Earth to Nobel Prize committee, come in please!)

Without giving too much away, this book follows the simple struggle of Mr. Biswas's life.  It presents a fascinating view of Trinidad and Indian families within.

The reader also gets to follow the life of this man as he struggles in his marriage, his career, with sanity, and the search for his house.  Throughout his life, he lives in crowded and squalid residences, and wishes to live independently from it all.  Thus the name of the book.<br />The one flaw of this book is the monotony.  Mr. Biswas did not live an exciting life, and Naipul forces the reader to look into his most mundane activities.
