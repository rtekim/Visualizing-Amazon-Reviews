In this novel, income is derived from pornography and related arts, and expenses are predominantly liquor, women and other debauching habits.<br /><br />This tragic narrative can be said to be predominantly written in gray - as the main narrating character, John Self, jumps into great drinking bouts most nights and awakens in a hangover stupor most mornings. Self is a collage of many of fiction's other well known sad sacks: Harry Angstrom of [[ASIN:0449911659 Rabbit, Run]]; Julian English of [[ASIN:0375719202 Appointment in Samarra]]; Frank Bascombe of [[ASIN:0679735186 Independence Day]]; or Macon Leary of [[ASIN:0345452003 The Accidental Tourist]].

I've heard the complaint often enough about my own work, which isn't to say that my prose is sparkling and overflowing with brilliance as much as it is to say that my prose is pretty good whereas my story is lacking. The same could be said about Money.    I had to put this book down a few times within the first 60 pages, and I tried to finish it a couple times over the course of the past nine or ten months before finally just plowing through the first sixth just to see if it'd end up being worth finishing. As it turned out, it was very worth it, as Amis continues with glorious descriptive prose throughout the whole novel (and I guess I have to give myself some credit for becoming familiar with the style by that point) as well as forming some really good characters and one really great anti-hero.    The anti-hero (the 21st-century-addict and ridiculously named John Self) is too much like too many peoples' little quirks to hate, though he is such an exploded version of those quirks that he takes the need for an occasional drink, cheeseburger, f***, or violence to the level of being an alcoholic, fast food junkie, pervert, and misogynist. Self is a fine creation, and I found myself cheering for him when he tries to turn his life around and never feeling sorry for him when he f***ed up (again and again). He's not a friend, and oddly enough, the reader has the same relationship with Self that the character of Martin Amis does.    Which leads me to the self-indulgence that the book drips with. Putting yourself into one of your own novels? Interesting enough, as the character of Amis serves a few purposes in the way of plot (rewriting the Doris Arthur script, explaining the whole thing at the end, serving as a counterpoint to Self's overblown lifestyle), but I feel that Amis put himself into his book just to break down the fourth wall a bit and say \\""Hey, this John Self guy, he isn't me. I'm me. And here I am!\\"" It just came off as cheap, as did the numerous times where something is said to Self the night before and he doesn't remember because he's too drunk. He meets the elusive Frank the Phone one night in a bar and doesn't remember any of it. That doesn't stop him from telling us he doesn't remember when someone tells him he should. Even more offensive is him just flat out refusing to tell us certain things that Doris and Selina said to him and still telling us that they've told him unbelievably terrible things that he can't comprehend or refuses to think about. We should be propelled forward by the plot and the writing, not bad cliffhangers that distract us from the text.    The writing is there to propel us, for sure. Self is an interesting character with his descriptions of things, and it all comes out with a great vocabulary (I had to look up three words within the first two pages) plastered all over the backbone of money. He can see the beauty of things, even describe them as being beautiful, but it doesn't mean anything to him at all. It's something beautifully frustrating about Self himself (ugh). There isn't much in the way of plot here, and even at the end of the book, I wasn't exactly sure what I was supposed to care about. Somewhere around the middle I ended up deciding to care about the movie Self was trying to make, and the information about his personal life become sort of secondary. The problem is, I could see it going either way with anyone, with readers becoming attached to Self's issues with Selina and Martina as opposed to set problems and money problems surrounding the actors and script of the movie (Good Money or, as it was changed to later on, Bad Money).    Despite all the problems I have with this novel, it has great characters and is very dense and insanely well-written. He takes the concept of writing like Dickens and modernizes it and makes it possible to be read without being bored out of your mind. Amis manages to shoot all of his straws up in the air towards the beginning and watch them all fall down into place at the end not unlike Great Expectations, where we meet a person here and there over the course of the first 50 pages and then they pop in and out of the story, each having their own important effect on the story.    Perhaps dropping the plot out completely was a good idea for this novel, and a traditional storyline like a coming-of-age styled story with Self as a grown up and trying to grow up Pip-like character would have bogged the story down. Amis leaves it up to his the situation that he puts his characters in and his dynamic characters themselves: the sexy, sex-fiend, money-driven Selina, the cool, rich, eccentric Fielding Goodney, the rich, yet pure and smart, Martina, and the moneyman himself, the money obsessed John Self, who brings everything back to a dollar amount and nothing more.",2008-12-27

This meta-fictional post modern styled novel not only subverts conventional novel structures but is also able at the same time to present social messages which were relevant to its initial 1980's audience and can still find relevance in the society of  readers today.<br /><br />Broadly, Amis's novel satirizes the boom of consumerism and excess experienced in the 1980's.  The central protagonist would-be-film maker John Self, rolls between London and New York, binging on cigarettes, alcohol, pornography, women, drugs and anything else that money can buy.  John Self's complete lack of self control or restraint can be seen as reflective of the political policies of Thatcher (and to an extent Regan) which were being implemented in England and America at this time, policies which assigned a fiscal value to everything and turned virtually anything into a saleable commodity, promoting capitalist values en masse with very little attention to the development of accompanying policies of social responsibility.<br /><br />Without revealing too much of the plot, Self eventually reaps the consequences of his lifestyle however it is not a social or moral lesson, Self does not develop, grow or undergo any kind of mental or emotional transformation, in moral essentials he leaves the novel, much as he entered it.  This lack of moral justice inflicted upon Self is arguably one of the major centres of dislike pitted against this novel.  Amis does not provide a social or (using the words of his father, realist author Kinglsey Amis) \\""human lesson.\\""  It presents the seamy, grimy underside of the epicentres of western (and capitalist) society but presents no exoneration or punishment for John Self or the societies which he populates.  The frustration of the reader in not seeing the protagonist regretful or even adequately reflective of his lifestyle seems to deny a perceived need of the novel to distribute and/or advocate for some kind of social justice or responsibility.<br /><br />Some critics (and even authors) of contemporary British literature suffer the belief that the 'hey-day' of English literature is passed, that nothing written in the present can possibly match that which was written in the past.  One reason attached to this negative opinion of current British literature is that it is unable to produce a 'state of the nation' style novel, that is a book which encompasses what DH Lawrence in 1956 described as \\""the whole man alive.\\""<br /><br />This is ultimately a flawed ideal though, as modern society is a highly complex beast- arguably much more so than the 1950's world in which Lawrence wrote his comment.  The expectation of a modern novel to be able to swallow the moral, ethical and social dilemmas faced each day by the modern citizen seems implausible and runs the risk of producing fiction which critic Nick Rennison describes as \\""dead on the page.\\""<br /><br />In Money, Amis seems to have disregarded these nostalgic, backward looking critics and instead of aiming for an all encompassing view of society he has set his satirical sights on a few principle social issues which were pertinent to his time.  The fact that his comments on the dangers of excessive consumerism, capitalism and the potential banality and emptiness of modern life are as relevant in 2007 as they were in 1984 is testament to the sharpness of his political and social awareness.<br /><br />Although the book centres around a self proclaimed 'yob' protagonist, the text is not lacking in sophistication, Martin's lush and innovative prose style and structure prove as much.  His constant references to highbrow literature seem to reinforce this idea.  For instance there is an underlying allegory to Shakespeare's Othello which underlies a great majority of the novel and Amis peppers the texts with the names of great writers, such as the pub named the Shakespeare, the characters Martina Twain and Fielding Goodney, as well as references to literary places such as Room 101 (from Orwell's 1984) which is also ironically, Self's hotel room.<br /><br />This novel is a high speed ride through modern life as seen through the eyes of perhaps one of its worst inhabitants.

One who is more of a tradtional reader, who is interested in a unique insight, an engaging story, and affecting characters will be left shrugging their shoulders.  I am the latter.      The plot follows film producer John Self on his travels between NY and London; and we get to watch all of the room service, hangovers, women, and money that make up those travels.  Like all tales of 80's greed; money, alcohol, drugs, and sex are unfulfilling; but it is those things that the charcters continue to turn to.  Self narrates the novel and it is he that reflects on this lifestyle.  Thus, the novel is quite literally filled with \\""Self\\"" loathing.  Self says, \\""Money, I must put money round me, more money, soon.  I must be safe.\\""   But the strip clubs and hangovers are more boring than seedy (the shortcoming about which I was most surprised), and Self is more pathetic than anything.         I don't think that there is any pretence of this being a plot driven novel, so I won't waste any criticism here.  The novel relies on Amis' pen, but it can be surprisingly dull.  Even the passages I enjoyed, and there were many, were more clever than insightful.  But his cleverness is overextendedand thus, he has moments where he is reduced to describing Self's moral make-up in a way that a teen-angst rock band might.  \\""I am made of - junk, I'm just junk\\"" would fit nicely into any Korn song.       By the end of the novel, his moral weakness has not been overcome.  Rather, Self is exhausted.  He predictable ruins an opportunity of having a real relationship and settles for another with no enthusiasm.  An so, too, the novel ends with no energy, despite a few bits of ecstatic prose.    Maybe the this book is a victim of a theme that has been exploited and exhausted in a number of books and films; namely, the excess of the 1980s.  But if this was a great book, it would stand apart from the others, it would sound unique.  It does not, and I will forget it.

He has written a brilliant, entertaining, risky novel, telling a funny and implausible story that ultimately makes perfect sense. Bravo!",2003-06-25

John Self, the novel's narrator,lives a life of sheer, unadulterated decadence, jetting back and forth between New York and London (although the two cities merge over the course of the novel into a single depraved whole), attempting to put a film together, dealing with highly strung movie star charicatures, and all the while feeding his insatiable desire for junk food, alchohol, pornography and drugs.<br />What makes this novel work isn't the convoluted and sprawling story: it is the portrait drawn of nineteen eighties culture, the numerous and delightfully subtle jokes (Self drives an Italian car called a 'Fiasco', radically misinterprets Othello and various other incidents) and the worldview of Self himself who seems to serve as apair of eyes through which to satirize the decade and its attendent lifestlye trappings, never realizing that he himself epitomises all that is decadent and extraneous to the culture he inhabits.<br />Apart from Self, the other characters are less memorable, though no less humorous. Amis even incorporates a version of himself in the novel, symbolically taking a hand in the development (or not)of Self's movie project, and manipulating Self for his own ends in a similar fashion to most characters he meets. Perhaps the funniest thing about this novel is the way amis subjects Selfto so much humiliation and indignity: almosty as if  amis attacks Eighties culture via satirising and bringing low Self.<br />This is a memorable and rewarding piece of work. Both as a comedy and as a aocial document it succeeds: although explicit scenes of sex and violence may put some off: be warned.<br />On the whole though a fantastic read for the thoughful and open minded reader.",2003-06-23

John Self, the protagonist, is a caricature of a senseless, ignorant, materialistic, depraved, pseudo, arrogant,oportunistic man of the yuppie &quot;rat-race&quot; early 80's. Ruthless, narcisistic, naive egotist, out to get the money for himself. He is also the narrator of this novel, taking the reader on a rough ride along him, in London and N.Y., and also within his chaotic, fragmentary and unruly mind and existence. <br />From what I've read in the previous reviews there seems to be a dichotomy of opinion: some people praise Amis work as genius and others consider it, to put it mildly, a waste of paper.<br />My view, for this novel in particular, lies somewhere in the middle. This novel has indeed no substance, and it is completely pointless. (The allusions to Othello are by the way ludicrous or at least to far fetched, and even if this was one of the books aims it seems very pretentious an aim to me.) You 'll find no worthy social commentary in here, except for the obvious and thin satire of materialist culture and early 80's excesses. Moreover you should be warned that the protagonist, as made clear from what i've written above, is in no way likeable and does not evolve any feelings of empathy from the reader's part, you might pity him or laugh at him at certain parts of the book, and I would wager this the way the author views his character as well. Now, some have said that soaking the reader up in depravity and ignorance is Amis's way of creating the opposite effect and demonstrating the emptyness of the whole early 80's yuppie scene. I 'd have to disagree on that. It is like saying that if i disapprove of something i would sit down and write a 500 page payan, a litany of it. Not so.  <br />That said it's just one the funniest novels i've ever read, and if you do not expect much out of it then you can sit back and enjoy the mock humour, the parody, and the hyperboly of the whole construct, reading it in snippets of a few pages since neither the thoughts of John Self nor the structure of the book have any sort of coherency. You can also laugh at the author of the novel for choosing to cast himself in two roles in his story, as himself Martin Amis in London, and on the other side as the would-be-saviour of Self's life Martina Twain (or could this be Marc Twain transvestite?), to add a postmodern (or something) edge to the whole ensemble, or for whatever other reason.<br />So, two stars for making me laugh. All style, no substance as usual with Amis books, but I believe this one is the best he ever wrote, or wil write. Give it a go, and if you put it down because of the racism and misogyny and Self-loathing then you won't be in for the laugh.",2001-12-12

How can a book be readable when its protagonist is such a louse? Other readers have complained that Self`s excesses, including his attempted rape of his girlfriend, detract from the humor.  They don`t get it: Amis has made a compelling novel about a character that has zero redeeming value; he has dragged the reader through 400 some pages of the thoughts and repetitive excessess of a character he/she hates.  This is truly extraordinary.<br />As if this wasn`t enough, Amis injects himself into the narrative, offering literary theory which acts as the authors elbow jab to the chops.

There seems to be little middle ground with  regard to Amis, and after reading this dense, maddening, brilliant,  depressing little book, I can see why.<br />The writing is breathtaking,  simply breathtaking.  Over and over I was brought up sharp by incredible  descriptions, especially the startling juxtapositions that can only be  described as poetry.  Consider: &quot;I strode through the meat eating  genies of subway breath....I felt all the contention, the democracy, all  the italics, in the air.&quot;  Ah, this is New York.<br />The prose is snappy  and tough, the dialogue crisp and true, like Chandler rippling through  self-deprecating angst by way of John Coover.  And Amis's observations of  the morally demented side of human nature are hysterical, wry, biting, and  too damn close for comfort.<br />By placing you inside the weak, repugnant,  rapacious mind of John Self as the whining narrator, Amis manages to bury  you in Self's self-pity while you try to recoil and distance yourself from  his debauchment.  You have to identify with Self if only because he is the  narrator, but you hate the sound of Self in yourself.<br />The book is more  literary than it appears at first blush--note the more and more obvious  allusions and references to Othello, although Self is no where near as  noble in spirit as the betrayed Moor.  No one sets up John Self but John  Self--there is no Iago, other than his own greed, callowness, and inability  to take charge of his own humanity.<br />If I have any gripe with the story,  it is that there are some things that are not well explored or fleshed out.   There is a hint of unresolved sexual identity at the end--is Georgina  really just a large woman, or a transsexual?  Did Self give in to some  nascent homosexual urges sprinkled throughout the story?  Does Self exist  at the end, or is this all merely a figment of Martin Amis's  imagination--the Martin Amis who appears as a character in the novel, and  who actually becomes a major player in this drama near the end.  Amis  teases us, especially with the frontpiece, but does not give enough to  really go on.  And he sets up Self as such a weak character with no insight  that it is almost unfair.<br />All in all, a tour de force of writing in  service of a thoroughly depressing and disturbing story of moral and  psychological dissolution.  There is no character in this book to like, no  one to identify with, and if you need to have a positive resolution or a  character to make you feel good, avoid this like the plague.

The raw ironic humour of his writing and the depiction of the main character John Self is an apt snapshot of part of  modern urban life. Self is a self obsessed, sex-addict alchoholic not  having the ability to truley care for someone (including himself)in any  wholesome way due to obsession with success in the form of 'Money'. Even  though he is in the movie buisness he doesn't really care for it as long as  he gets the big contract. For me this tends to reflect Self as being  analogous to our urban working society as it becomes more important to  people to have objects of desire rather than the human basics of affection,  comfort and wellbeing. He seems to suggest a belief that man has not  evolved but in recent times has begun to devolve in character and  spirit.<br />In general it is gripping, shockingly hilarious at times and a  story which should make those who encounter it reflect on their lives and  ask the question 'Do I need this pair of Armani underpants or should i have  a quiet night in with my shhweetheart instead'..........I go for the night  in every time.<br />Also, who ever said you need to watch stand-up comedy to  hear great one-liners.

Martin Amis plumbs the depths of a society that elevates shallowness to an art form, with equal measures of ferocity & wit, whilst always keeping true to the voice of the thoroughly unlikeable narrator, who nevertheless seduces the reader with autobiographical honesty & human weakness that the braggadocio never quite hides.  A extraordinary piece of writing that tells a sad tale of our capitalist uncaring excess & where that has led us.  By the way, Amis inserts himself into the plot as a writer Self convinces to rewrite a movie script - it is another layer in this book of many manipulations, threaded with dark, deep humour.",2013-05-10

Seemed to be just another tome about the drug-fuelled 1980's. Did portray an accurate picture though of alcoholism and how it affects not only the addict but all those around. Nice little trick making one of the characters Martin Amis....sort of gave an impression of how author sees himself. In the end that is what put me off the book....the gross ego centricity but then how does one live up to a father who wrote 'Lucky Jim'...a classic if I ever read one.",2013-04-13

Allowed the reader to experience the author's view of himself. The depiction of an alcoholic was right on including the lack of responsibility brought on by the addiction to alcohol and subsequent sabatoging of potentially advantageous relationships.<br />However, half way through I became bored with the ongoing attempts to philosophise and the egocentricity and found myself skipping pages, not through lack of understanding but lack of interest. There were moments of tongue-in-cheek humour but overall nothing like Pappa's writing but then I suppose it is inevitable that this author would be compared to his father and the brilliant 'Lucky Jim'.",2013-03-03
