Please head there for more in-depth reviews by me, which appear on a timely schedule.<br /><br />Tod loves Faye, a woman of questionable talents and questionable motives. In a romance gone wrong, Tod fights over her, but never seems to progress on anything - except perhaps his wonderful painting that describes everything that is wrong with American society.<br /><br />This is another American literature novel for me. It starts out quite slowly, but interestingly, but does not build to the expected climax. Of the whole book, I would have said that the ending left me most underwhelmed - but that that was the point, because the themes of the book are unfulfilled sexual gratification and unfulfilled dreams.<br /><br />This novels quite a gritty one, and I wouldn't have said I really enjoyed it. It's going to be a fun one to write about in the exam though, because there is just so much there to comment on. The narrator really made the story for me with his forknowledge and snarky remarks about the characters. I really didn't feel any sympathy for the characters, even poor Homer.<br /><br />Apparently this novel has multiple references to pop culture - or that pop culture references it. Homer is as of &#34;The Simpsons&#34; in humour, and additionally apparently there is a similar scene in Seinfeld. See, I had to even google that to spell it correctly!<br /><br />Overwhelmingly this novel dreams of blood and violence. Tod often fantasises about raping Faye, and sometimes you even feel as if that would be justified, she's so annoying and teasing. I actually really liked the Mexican with the chicken, and felt that in an odd way, of course it was he that got Faye in the end.<br /><br />Not the finest example of American literature I've read so far, but not the worst. I wouldn't personally recommend reading it, but if it was on your bookshelf and you felt like some violence and unfulfilment go for it!",2015-03-02

The reason I bring this up is that THE DAY OF THE LOCUST was the final book in the class, a book I’d always been keen to read. Well, I didn’t read it 1990 and then forgot about, as the book does not come up that often in conversation, but picked it up at The Strand in NYC a couple of years ago with the best intentions. It wasn’t until I read William J. Mann’s TINSELTOWN that I had the jones to dive into West’s 1939 tale of the “locusts” that massed on Los Angeles during the early part of the 20th century. Mann talked about these locusts, meaning people that were drawn to the bright lights, fresh air and endless possibilities of the West Coast mecca, but whose dreams were dashed, or, more often than not, unfulfilled, who end up going through the motions, fame an elusive dream never obtained. West’s prose – and tone – seems to owe much to the Southern Gothic tradition of writing, and his characters, a sparse, loose knit group of characters, has more in common with the grotesques of Welty and O’Connor than the more contemporary Steinbeck. The idea of these locusts is fascinated and explored graphically, as in the visit to Mrs. Jennings and the garage cockfight, as well as intimately, with Homer Simpson (sic) and his attraction to Faye. Also interested in Faye, the protagonist, who is told that he is not datable because he is too poor and unattractive, two things she needs in a man.

US,52825207,R6Q8D5BPMWYRR,1604443561,283617845,"The Day of the Locust",Books,5,1,1,N,N,"An Assessment of the Human Condition","Nathaniel West's novel The Day of the Locust is extraordinarily powerful, a deeply troubling depiction of life in the United States and perhaps much of the world.  Initially, I found it difficult to decide if West's uncomplicated but blinding insights pertained just to the U.S. in the late 1930's, or if they were better interpreted as a commentary on the human condition.  However, whatever the book's degree of universality at the time it was first published, as the decades have passed and globalization has proceeded, The Day of the Locust seems more and more applicable to an abundance of people who live in America and far beyond our borders.<br /><br />West's prose style is neither complex nor otherwise difficult.  He writes in a direct, straightforward way and does so brilliantly.  His ability to enable us to see the people, places, and events he addressed is unsurpassed in my experience.  As I read his brief novel, I began to realize that West permits us to do more than follow a narrative and understand a story, but to visualize it as well.  Thanks to West's skill with the written word, I am confident that I know what Faye Greener looks like at her most sultry and her most pathetic.  I can see her father as his health fails and he dies.  Tod, Homer, Earle, Miguel, and the others are palpably real people, distinctive, living configurations in my mind's eye.<br /><br />Someone less skillful than West could easily convince us of the ugly brutality of cockfighting as it occurred in a make-shift fighting pit arranged in an unexceptional lower-middle class garage.  But only a rare and remarkably gifted writer could present it in a way that forced the violence of the fight on the reader in an almost viscerally painful way.  Only a rare and remarkably gifted writer could enable us to see the badly over-matched red bird as its dead head flopped loosely and pathetically to one side while its opponent picked at the eye that was still intact.<br /><br />Using Hollywood as a metaphor for the rest of the U.S. and perhaps the world, enabled West to use a place of fantasy, fraud, and cultural propaganda to vividly display the fact that confused, troubled, and unfulfilled lives, for most of us, are the norm.  To search for more by responding to the phony promises of California, or working harder, or being a paragon of virtue, or otherwise exerting one's self to attain a modicum of happiness will almost certainly bring disappointment.<br /><br />Tod's attempt to locate Faye, the effort that leads him through cardboard Parthenon's and contingents of soldiers wearing armor fashioned with construction paper very effectively illustrates the lack of substance in the world of glamour and excitement that we sometime seek.  The fact that Tod, a studio artist, had designed some of these special effects is especially telling.  To a greater or lesser degree, with greater or lesser effectiveness, we are all complicit in the cheap and tawdry process of deluding ourselves, striving for the conviction that whole, substantial, and fulfilling lives can be ours.  But how could it be otherwise.  We're all born into a world of worthless mystifications and sterile bromides, taught to think using self-deceiving catch-phrases and meaningless cliches.  The only cognitive tools we have to make sense of the world are already part and parcel of its delusional ambience.<br /><br />One might imagine that this treacherous and painful set of circumstances could give rise to an organized revolutionary effort to take back the promise of a decent life.  But we don't have the intellectual and affective equipment, and besides, it would be treasonous.  We see the lack of self-fulfilling wherewithal and the inability to fend off damaging social arrangements and cruel cultural artifacts with heart-rending, but also pathetically annoying clarity in Homer.  His hopeless loneliness, profoundly injurious vulnerability, and complete lack of effectiveness present in brutally concentrated form the shared human condition as West understood it.  This is not the stuff of which revolutions are made.  Instead, it eventually gives rise to noxious well-springs of bitterness and resentment, better suited to creating a lynch mob than an organized cell of subversives.<br /><br />The Day of the Locust is the sort of book that takes a toll on the reader.  Whether or not we see ourselves in its pages, the disappointment, desolation, and despair in which it finds it characters is awful to behold.

He would die about a year and a half after its publication in a car crash that also claimed the life of his wife. Too bad, because Locust was his best piece of work to that point. West, never a prolific writer, had produced three previous works that could generously be called \\""novelettes,\\"" all like Locust consumable at one sitting for the dedicated reader. They are all weird tales of disaffected, damaged souls.<br /><br />Locust was the first to be set in Los Angeles, where West had migrated, drawn like many other by the promise of work in the movie industry. It is that industry that forms the locus of Locust, though the characters are only in movies at the most tangential level. If I can compare Locust to anything, it is probably Mulholland Drive era David Lynch with its gallery of eccentrics and dreamers and vaguely phantasmagoric plot line. This is supported by some superb writing. I especially liked West's vivid description of a cockfight that in its pathos and brutality is as good or better than any description of a bullfight by Hemingway in Death in the Afternoon or The Sun Also Rises.

It is based in the 1930s and centers around Tod Hackett, a man that had just moved from Yale to Hollywood to take a job as a designer. This book is thoroughly enjoyable to read. It explores themes such as materialism and obsession, making it easy to relate to and therefore much more fun to read.

Tod Hackett is really the only character that develops throughout the book, though not necessarily for the better. However, even with stereotypical, flat characters, \\""The Day of the Locust\\"" never gets boring.<br /><br />Tod Hackett moves to Hollywood and is immediately disgusted by the type of people there. However, the longer he stayed in Hollywood, the more he conformed to them. He is swept up by Faye Greener, an aspiring actor. He develops a deep obsession for her, one that she does not share. However, Faye is an actor through and through and never has true, genuine feelings. At first, Tod does not realize this whatsoever and continues to try to get with her. Nothing he does ever works, though. He does not understand why until, after living in Hollywood for a while and beginning to understand the type of people that live there, he sees that Faye is just acting when she seems to flirt with him.

The real twist is that the tale resonates today. West's keen and prescient evaluation of the dark side of L.A. stands up to contemporary times.

Tod's experiences with various characters in Hollywood could itself make a movie (and, indeed, has): the capricious survivor Faye Greener and her worn-out father Harry; contentious dwarf Abe Kusich, drugstore cowboy Earle Shoop, and perhaps the most complex and troubled character, Homer Simpson, a Midwest emigrant to the \\""promised land\\"" who also is briefly a narrator. Throughout various scenarios ranging from religious revivals, movie openings, the business of a bordello, and the everyday ephemera known as life, West creates a memorable portrait of a man who is seeking something that perhaps can never be found. Tod is overwhelmed with nihilism but seeks to temper it with a dual objectification and repulsion towards Faye Greener.<br /><br />Perhaps what West creates most movingly is a portrait of L.A.- the excitement, the grunge, the messiness, the beauty of it all juxtaposed with the fairy tale meeting cold reality.

It's a quick read, friends, and a tightly assembled script, and I don't really want to mute the excitement of reading it by blabbing too much of the action.<br /><br />As a depiction of Southern California as it was in the 1930s, it's worth a thousand books of sociology, rich with sketches of \\""...the cultists of all sorts, economic as well as religious, the wave, airplane, funeral and preview watchers - all those poor devils who can only be stirred by the promise of miracles and then only to violence... marching behind his banner in a great unified front of screwballs and screwboxes to purify the land.\\"" Not even Raymond Chandler ever captured the tawdry menace and lurid intoxication of Los Angeles as well as West.  Hollywood was truly the Potemkin Village of desires, where everyone was his own leading lady and the next person's 'extra'.<br /><br />And it's bigger and better-dressed today - Los Angeles, I mean - with the Getty Museum and the Disney Center for the Arts, but anyone who has lived or worked there will know that 'The Day of the Locust' is still a true picture of its permanent impermanence and impending transience.dressed today - Los Angeles, I mean - with the Getty Museum and the Disney Center for the Arts, but anyone who has lived or worked there will know that 'The Day of the Locust' is still a true picture of its permanent impermanence and impending transience.",2009-07-20

West draws perfectly the despair and rootless emptiness underlying the pretty smiles, watered landscapes, imported plants and wonderful lifestyles.  Reading this book reminded me of how I found the sight of a palm tree disturbing for years after I moved away.      West also insightfully points out that the absurd culture has been produced by the transients, not the long time natives.  I remember putting down Southern California in front of a native one time - she became upset and said \\""You people made it like this.\\""",2008-06-20

The book is not badly written, nor does it lack plot or characterization; Locust is passable in all these respects.  Rather, the problem with The Day of the Locust is that it does not exceed expectations in these areas.  Instead of becoming a standout work, The Day of the Locust remains merely mediocre. <br /> <br />To most readers of American literature, the theme of The Day of the Locust is a familiar one: the collapse of the fabled \\""American dream.\\""  In Locust, this dream is represented by the promise of fame and fortune in 1930's Hollywood.  The Day of the Locust traces its characters' pursuit of this goal toward their ultimate destruction. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this motif has already been explored in such notable works as, for example, F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.  Gatsby is often considered to be one of the greatest American novels of all time; therefore, West faces very high standards with The Day of the Locust, and his work is not strong enough to meet them.  For instance, in Locust, one character reflects, \\""It is hard to laugh at the need for beauty and romance, no matter how tasteless, how horrible, the results of that need are.\\""  This idea is one that has already been successfully expressed in Gatsby and elsewhere.  West's words add no insight that cannot be found in other novels on the same theme as Locust. <br /> <br />Nathanael West's The Day of the Locust needs to reach new and dazzling literary heights to make itself stand out from novels similar to it.  Unfortunately, Locust manages no such accomplishments, establishing itself only as an average work on a theme better covered by others. <br />",2005-11-06
