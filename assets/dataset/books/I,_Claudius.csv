US	38829228	REMH4XOMSA5WG	B000H85PYQ	111847135	I, Claudius	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Authority + literary power =	This undeniably brilliant book may leave one or two small things to be desired as a story.<br /><br />My first exposure to the writing of Robert Graves was indirect, via the BBC TV adaptation of I, Claudius, written by Jack Pulman, in the late 1970s. I had also seen imposing copies of The White Goddess on the nonfiction shelves of bookstores, and wondered what it could possibly be about. But I never actually read Graves until I got myself a copy of the of the 2-volume Penguin set of The Greek Myths in April 1985. I read them cover to cover, impressed—nay, amazed. For not only was his thinking bold and original, and his erudition vast; he was also a superb stylist of English prose. In July that same year I bought myself a yellow-bound paperback of The White Goddess and read it, and in January 1986 I picked up a Penguin copy of I, Claudius and read that.<br /><br />I was delighted, riveted. Here was a historical novel that truly felt like it was written by someone from the period—in this case, early imperial Rome in the 1st century BC. I knew from reading The Greek Myths that Graves was conversant in both ancient Latin and Greek, and had seemingly read every surviving text written in those languages, indeed had also translated some of them. His authority with the period was as great as could be.<br /><br />But Graves was not even an academic, in the sense of being a university researcher and lecturer. Apart from a single year spent as a professor of English literature at Cairo University in 1926, his career was only in writing; his primary vocation was as a poet. This meant that his writing chops were extraordinarily strong. In all, it would be difficult to conceive of anyone better placed to write the fictional memoir of the emperor Claudius.<br /><br />And he did a fantastic job. The conceit of the book (and its sequel, Claudius the God) is that it is an expose of the machinations of the royal family of Rome from the reign of Augustus to the reign of the author, Claudius. The action in the first book takes place between 41 BC and AD 41, but focuses mainly on the late years of Augustus’s reign, and the complete reigns of Tiberius and Caligula. In the opening chapter Claudius, who was in fact a professional historian, confides that he wants to tell all, and that his intended audience is not his contemporaries, but posterity. Indeed, a prophetess has informed him that his book will not see the light of day again for 1,900 years. . . .<br /><br />Claudius is born into the royal family in 10 BC (Augustus is his great uncle and Livia, Augustus’s third wife, is his grandmother). Handicapped with a limp, a stammer, and facial tics, Claudius is written off as an idiot by almost everyone, and is left mostly to his own devices. In the decadent and murderous environment of court life, these liabilities will prove to be his greatest assets. For Claudius is no fool, but a perceptive, intelligent, and independent-thinking young man. He is also a decent person—and a republican. He is one of the shrinking number of romantics who would like to see the monarchy abolished (again—Rome had already done it once, and had long been proud of the fact) and power returned to the people. From this point of view, his life takes the path of maximum irony.<br /><br />The novel reads very like an actual memoir. The narrator, writing in his late 50s as emperor, has the worldly, knowledgeable, matter-of-fact tone that goes with his position. He expresses judgments of people and events with the settled conviction of an experienced and powerful man of the world. But throughout his life he has been humble—he could hardly be otherwise, growing up vilified, neglected, and abused—and never ambitious, except perhaps to distinguish himself as a scholar of history.<br /><br />And as a historian, he could not resist taking pen in hand again, having come into possession of all the secret documents and records of his predecessors. In addition, he has otherspecial sources, such as the deathbed confessions of his grandmother Livia, who, according to Claudius, was in most ways the true power behind the throne of Augustus, and remained a force even through the reign of her decadent son Tiberius. It turns out that in order to steer a powerful state on a peaceful and true course, many people have to be liquidated, including close relatives, and usually secretly via poison and other contrived accidents.<br /><br />The story is filled with incident and is rich with colorful period detail (Claudius justifies his explanation of Roman ways by the fact that he expects his book to be read so far in the future, when Rome may be long gone). I have every reason to think that most of the events described are historically accurate, or at least are well-informed conjectures. To a far greater extent than with most historical novels, this is a history book.<br /><br />And for me, on this my 3rd reading of the novel, I found the latter fact to be a slight liability. In a certain way I found the story to be too lifelike, in the sense that it seemed to be a stream of events that lacked a tight dramatic structure, which is what I really appreciate in a work of fiction. In some ways it is more a chronicle than a story. There are certainly subplots within it, and plenty of action and intrigue. But sometimes I felt I was just reading one event after another.<br /><br />The result was that despite all the action, despite the treacherous, mad, and horrific acts of many of the characters, especially the emperors Tiberius and Caligula, the dramatic effect was muted. Part of the reason for this is Claudius’s own attitude, which, while still sane and basically ethical, has long since become desensitized to atrocities, over and above his Roman acceptance of much cruelty and suffering that we in our era would find shocking. He’s casual about the torture of slaves and the slaughter of prisoners in the arena.<br /><br />In sum: I still enjoyed this novel, but now that the “tour de force” effects are wearing off on me, I find myself wishing for a more dramatic, emotionally charged story. So I’ve downgraded it from 5 stars to 4. Probably it’s at 4.4 stars for me.

US	23372752	R2Z3M1MPM2BMUH	B001PMZHKU	111847135	I, Claudius	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Roman history	This was my first novel by Robert Graves that I read and I'm pleased that I did.  I am reading through the Modern Library list of the best 100 novels written in the twentieth century as chosen by the reviewers and I must say that this was one of the more enjoyable of the first fifteen.<br />Graves style flows quite freely and is easy to read.  He makes the reader feel like he has taken him into his confidence and is telling him stories that are not well known by others.  He is very level-headed and balanced in an age of extremes and atrocities.  One cannot help but ally himself with the protagonist.  Each chapter is a self-contained tale which builds on the previous ones.  One can see why this novel lent itself to a popular tv series.<br />At one time I thought I would read all of Graves books until I found out he had written over 150 of them!  So much for that idea!	2014-02-17

Julius is dead by the time Claudius is born, but our hero is intimately acquainted with Augustus and his wife Livia, Tiberius, and finally Caligula. Claudius plays the fool and manages to survive these turbulent years of Rome's history, filled with poisonings, treachery, and the deaths of many honest men and women. Especially during Caligula's reign, Claudius lives on a knife's edge, fearful everyday for his life, playing along with the mad emperor and trying to prevent him from doing Rome irreversible damage. <br />Stunted from birth, Claudius is a sickly, stuttering child and young man. Ironically, this is the only thing that saves him. Most of his family believes he is an imbecile too unimportant to kill. Ignored by Augustus and Tiberius, tormented by his mother and by Livia, Claudius managed his last hurdle by entertaining Caligula with pert quotes from Homer and flattery. Claudius is a scholar-the only pastime he can manage in his crippled body. His knowledge of history serves him well during this period, providing him with examples from the past to guide his actions during a frightening childhood and youth. <br />The book follows him up to the point of Caligula's death when Claudius finds himself suddenly the only surviving Caesar, hurled into the office by a dangerous mob of soldiers. He makes his peace with the senate and begins his long reign. <br />Robert Graves tells the story in first person and provides the necessary guesswork details of Claudius's thoughts and feelings. However, the story is historical in its facts and details. This is a wonderful interdiction to the early history of the Roman empire.	2003-08-08

(Super Positive Quick Review)	Robert Graves's fictionalized autobiography of Claudius, the fourth Emperor of Rome, is so phenomenally fascinating that any review I write can hardly do it justice.  Claudius writes that he was born prematurely and afflicted with many physical infirmities that make his life difficult and uncomfortable.  Most of his relatives consider him an idiot due to his stammering and twitching and treat him with derision and condescension.  However, he was a bright, studious boy who used his time to better his mind in the subjects of history and politics, and he becomes a dedicated historian and accomplished writer.  <br />As a member of the Imperial family, Claudius has an insider's perspective of Roman politics at the beginning of the Empire and the Pax Romana.  The novel begins with an account of the end of the Republic around 40 B.C., how Claudius's wickedly scheming grandmother Livia masterminded much of the politics which led to the formation of the Empire, and how her husband and Claudius's great-uncle Augustus Caesar became the first Emperor.  The reigns of Claudius's depraved uncle Tiberius and insane nephew Caligula follow, and Claudius finally becomes Emperor, somewhat reluctantly, upon Caligula's death in 41 A.D.<br />What I found extremely interesting about the book is that it explains the complications of maintaining, defending, and expanding an empire.  The detailed descriptions of the military campaigns show how the frontiers of the Empire (especially Germany) were in constant danger of disruption by barbarians and mutinous, undisciplined soldiers.  Back home in the Senate and within the Imperial family, petty squabbles and indignities were often resolved with scandalously drastic measures.  <br />This book could have been a dry recounting of history, but Claudius tells his story in a conversational, often humorous, tone.  (What he writes about Caligula, in particular, is unbelievable but highly entertaining.)  Another thing that strikes me as the mark of a great book: Even though Livia is a thoroughly despicable human being, I actually felt a little sad when she died.  Not too many writers can achieve that kind of dichotomy in their characters.	2000-10-04

It covers almost 100 years of tyranny by Ceaser Augustus and his predecessors.<br />Claudius, grandson of Mark Antony and adopted son of Augustus, narates. Deformed by birth,  Claudius is treated as a non-person by both his Grandmother and Mother.  Claudius tells of the trials and tribulatrions of the Roman empire as it is  ruled by three tyrants: Lydia, Claudius' grandmother and wife of Augustus,  who rules unofficially; Tiberius, brother of Claudius' father, who is both  paranoid and a sexual predator; and Caligula, son of Caudius' brother, who  is deranged.  All three will stop at nothing to amass and retain their  wealth and power. <br />Most of Claudius' family are evil and their treachery  leads to the demise of all the good ones like Claudius' father and brother.  Almost all of thefemale charcters are evil. Claudius,partially through his  wits and intelligence but mostly beacuse other family members view him as  slow and unimportant, survives everyone.<br />You will both laugh and cry at  the absurdities and tragedies of a power mad ruling class. Graves implies,  without going into graphic detail, incestuous activities that must have  created the genetic mental deformities that lead to the insanity and sexual  perversion that seem to grow with each generation.  <br />I recommend anyone  who enjoys a fast paced and historical novel to read 'I Claudius'. Keep a  scorecard on whom is related to whom and how they are related beacuse it is  very confusing.	2000-06-21
