Honestly, what other book has a young character that echoes the ideas of Nietzche? While this is not my favorite style, I think that this book is a great example of postmodernism style, and it is interesting just on that level. The book is organized into three sections, In the first part, we are introduced to Jack Gladney, a professor at local college attempting to keep his blended family together. In the next section, the Gladney family reacts to an Airborne Toxic Event, which is a huge chemical spill. Finally, Jack deals with the aftermath of finding out that his wife share his same overwhelming fear of death. Stylistically, the first half can be somewhat difficult to go through, and ultimately, it ends with a bleak outlook. However, this work really makes you think. Is it a speaking about the overall human condition or a critique of electronic modern America?",2015-08-19

Also, this dark cloud symbolizes other things – death, meaningless existence, family incoherence – the “hero” is Jack Gladney who is on his fourth marriage.<br /><br />This novel is part of the “postmodern” movement in American arts and sophisticated life. It’s occupied with popular culture against the background of existentialism. That produces random events through which characters try to find solid conclusions. But that seldom happens. Like the characters I am bewildered by all the noise, and like many readers I'm not in tune with what this novel means. I feel a sense of hopelessness.

There is the obvious blur of small town, modern family life, w/ its constant, mundane buzz of routine. There's also the constant chatter from the omnipresent media, represented through snippets of blithering TV, radio, and tabloid headlines and commercials. This is surrounded by another, more subtle level of  &#34;noise&#34;, which is nothing less than our greatest fear, underlying everything else in our lives. At first glance, Jack Gladney and his family seem fairly well-adjusted to this. Jack is quite successful in his work at the local college. His wife, Babette, appears to take everything in stride. Their children, from various marriages, are smart, though anything but typical kids. They have odd habits and preoccupations w/ subjects that &#34;normal&#34; children would probably never even think about. Especially Jack's oldest son, Heinrich, who provides some of the best dialogue in the book, when debating w/ his astonished father (there are, of course, other dialogues and monologues in WN that approach the brilliance of Heller or Vonnegut). The real trouble begins when the toxic cloud arrives over their sleepy town. Still, though this is a disaster, it's during the aftermath when the situation becomes progressively bizarre. This is when the WHITE NOISE becomes increasingly maddening, and the atmosphere is filled w/ paranoia and dread. We are left to ponder whether this is due to chemical fallout, mental breakdown, or just plain social entropy. In the end, Delillo has delivered a masterful satire of our ultimate terror, and the ways in which we seek to escape, delay, or simply ignore it.

For example, in 1962 John Steinbeck won the award and his philosophy as a writer was criticized for being simple and superficial. When Steinbeck himself was asked if he should have won, he said something like, “Probably not.” Don Delillo is not a complicated novelist in White Noise.  It’s refreshing to see his use of ordinary characters in white-collar circumstances. The daughters and step-daughters and sons were all interestingly crafted, mostly due to their emotional calmness in contrast to their intellectual curiosity. These were all smart characters, such as Denise, Heinrich, and Steffie, although sometimes I could not tell the girls apart. Then there is Murray the eccentric, and the other minor cast of college professors, part of the book only for roundtable dialogue about free association thinking.<br /> The “Airborne Toxic Event” fits the plot because it doesn’t fit at the family dinner table. When it happens it consumes the book; nothing else matters. When it’s over, the only lingering effect to keep it from being episodic is the fear of death “Dylar” drug. But then the factoid nature of all the family conversations, never emotional as they normally would be, are replaced by a man on his third of fourth wife placidly discovering and confronting his wife’s affair with an experimental drug peddler. With the title and the many references to television, which the book never resolved as a motif, I thought maybe the bad passions had been drained from us by overexposure to facts, to television. Delillo doesn’t follow through: the “chairman of the department of Hitler studies at the College-on-the-Hill” does want to shoot his wife’s enabler and exploiter three times in the abdomen and get away with it. It does matter; there was just no yelling in the process.<br /> What becomes of a story about death when all of the conversations are eventually about death? Murray and Babette and the children that jump from subplot to subplot, such as the boy who wants to live over two months with snakes for a world record, are unwittingly white noise. Delillo is a family author. The activities teetering on meaninglessness and dangerous progress don’t mean to be “white noise,” or junk. He crafted these characters based on their abilities, and then he just left the children and the wife, with whom it is not possible to sympathize, out of the end of the book. What is happening to them? There was no reason to make step-parents come and go if they are all over themselves any way. All of the stories became incidental, but at least they happened in nice neighborhoods.<br /> Heinrich took the words right out of my mouth on page 147. He lectures people about our advancement. “What is electricity? What is light?” He talks about our technology being ready for our use, but he recognizes that almost none of us could go back in time and create what has been created for us. I’m trying to decide if this is a highlight of Delillo’s premises. Our scientific advances leave us further behind what we should know.",2015-01-15

Most of the time, my notes are post-modern musings on the subjects and themes broached by the content of the work, but sometimes they're merely musings inspired by the shape of the writing. With this book, in particular, I jotted down a thought somewhere in the first hundred pages: &#34;Is a novel, or any work of writing, really, anything more than a shaped collection of language meant to provoke thought and emotion in varying degrees?&#34;<br /><br />This hails to the reduction of the human condition to a series of adjacent, firing and misfiring chemicals, but I didn't mean it to be reductionary. What I think I want to say about this book, in its existence as a masterwork of composition and contemplation, is that I didn't feel, until the very end, that I was actually reading a novel. DeLillo's writing is a vast, amorphous assemblage of thought and emotion, meant to wade through like a meditative soup. This book came to me as a series of paratactical prose poems, rife with post-modernism and meta-textual trappings. I kept being reminded of Coupland's Generation X, as the similarities between the two narratives are vast. Their place in the chronology of human affairs, the fixation with the apocalypse. The way the sun, in its benevolence, is through an alternate lense, some malicious force of awe and human insignificance, submersing the sky in fire to remind us that we are a species in a universe entirely beyond our means, squalling in little pockets of history that we deem as indicative of our role in earth's existence.<br /><br />In short, this book was fantastic. It's my new mark of a worthwhile read that I never feel compelled to check the page count, and this book passed that test. The pages themselves were dense. DeLillo's tendency to overdescribe never grated, though I can picture a first-year fiction workshop where his ramblings and stream-of-consciousness metaphysical pontifications were beaten out of him. The dialogue of almost all the characters is completely unnatural, and does not vary much, even from child to adult. This bothered me initially, less so as the book went on, but it is a concrete failing regardless of my affection for the rest of the material. Coupland pulled this off much better in his initial works, abandoned any pretense of relatability in Girlfriend in a Coma, and then slowly regained it as his works went on.<br /><br />I loved this novel. DeLillo's prose is now near and dear to my heart, after only a fleeting glimpse at it. I'd recommend this dissertation on human existence to everyone. Timeless messages wrapped in a veneer of a generational fixation that's bled into the water of our consciousness.re his ramblings and stream-of-consciousness metaphysical pontifications were beaten out of him.

The introduction to the edition I read of White Noise, Penguin Classics 2009 was written by Richard Powers and goes on for ten pages.  Obviously I skipped over it as I always do, sometimes I read it when I have finished the book to see if I have missed anything, or to see if the person who wrote the introduction agrees with my assessment of the book.  I have to tell you, this introduction can be missed entirely.  If I had read it to begin with I would probably never have started the book, Richard Powers style of writing is easily summed up in one word BORING and completely different from Don Delillo's.<br /><br />Jack Gladney the protagonist in White Noise is a married, middle aged college professor. I lost count of how many times he has been married, I think it might be four.  He teaches Hitler studies and uses the props of an academic gown and dark glasses to hide behind in class.  He is a gentle soul throughout the book good naturedly putting up with all slings and arrows of daily life, being a decent father to his two children by previous marriages and the two children of his current wife's previous marriages.<br /><br />White Noise is an excellent title for this book, white noise is exactly what this book is about mostly, the things one hardly notices during the daily grind, like a radio on all the time, the conversation between children, the conversations between husband and wife with hardly any meaning or reason.  Like the senseless banter between Jack and his wife about whether it was raining or not.<br /><br />\\""It's going to rain tonight.\\""<br />\\""It's raining now,\\"" I said.<br />\\""The radio said tonight.\\""<br />\\""Look at the windshield,\\"" I said. \\""Is that rain or isn't it?\\""<br />\\""I'm only telling youwhat they said.\\""<br />\\""Just because it's on the radio doesn't mean we have to suspend belief in the evidence of our senses.\\""<br />\\""Our senses?

You can see the similarities.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, it is a good read despite the fact that the theme throughout is about the fear of death, which sounds a morbid subject, and is.  Don Delillo however, who wrote this book 28 years ago (and is still alive) makes it an almost humorous subject, it's just part of everyday white noise, we all know it's there, we just have to get used to it and ignore it. There are several laughs in the book.<br /><br />I liked the way the book started with Delillo writing very short chapters, unlike Henry James for instance, who never knew when to end a chapter. it kind of builds you up to the story that way.  It also gives you a good reason to put it down easily if you have other things to do.<br /><br />For the sake of entertainment I suppose, Don Delillo makes all the characters speak with the same voice, except the toddler Wilder, who doesn't seem to speak at all.  They are all super intelligent spouting quick repartee. One wishes life were like that in reality. How much more fun we would have with a daily quick witted conversation at the checkout, instead of the banal \\""You doin OK?\\""  \\""Find everything you want?\\"" \\""Paper or plastic?\\""  \\"" Want help to carry out?\\""<br /><br />I gave it four stars because of the introduction which should have been 8 pages shorter and at the back of the book as an afterword.",2013-03-22

What's more, the deconstruction of communication and its wholesale production and consumerism of words and phrases are over consumed - as if they are sold at a big box Costco or BJs, thrown in a gigantic shopping cart, and paid for with a credit card.  In hindsight, on the outside, we ask, \\""why?

This book reminds me a great deal of the work of Thomas Pynchon, Tom Stoppard, and thematically Kurt Vonnegut (without the humor that is Vonnegut's trademark), but more than those authors, tends to be accessible to a general audience in terms of the writing.  The meaning of what DeLillo has created is where the most confounding nature of this work exists.  There is not a word wasted to transport us, but the words have a subtext that also manages to remain a white noise humming in our ears.  We are presented with a world not unlike our own, and our fears are allegorically justified through the events and perpetually disillusioned cast that present this haunting story that sincerely uncovers the horrifying nature of modern middle-class better-living-with-chemicals life.<br /><br />This novel is a fantastic dream that faces down the isolated, apocalyptic, uncertain world that we share with the characters in the text.  If I were to sum up what this book thematically means, it is to look around and wonder \\""Why?  What does this mean?

I should have been warned by the fact that, in the edition I bought, the novel took 325 pages and the remaining 200 pages were devoted to critical essays explaining the novel--never a good sign if you are just looking for a book to enjoy.<br /><br />The plot, as such, is easy to summarize. The first third is composed of short chapters detailing the daily lives of Jack Gladney, a Professor of Hitler Studies at a small college, his wife Babette, and five of their children from various previous marriages. They watch television (seemingly constantly), shop at the supermarket and the mall, and the children spout facts (often humorously erroneous) that they have gleaned from TV. This part resembles a family sit-com more than anything.<br /><br />The next section tells of an \\""airborne toxic event\\"" which forces the town to evacuate temporarily, exposing Jack to toxins which may or may not lead to his death in 15 or more years. Jack becomes obsessed with a fear of death, only to discover that his wife has long been similarly obsessed, and has taken an experimental drug to help her cope with the fear. Though the drug did not work for her, Jack becomes convinced that he needs to try it.<br /><br />The third section concerns Jack's rising fears about death and his search to find the man who gave the drugs to Babette (she won't tell; she promised). The eventual confrontation solves nothing, and the ending is enigmatic and non-conclusive.<br /><br />So I read some (not all) of the critical essays, mainly discussions of this as a \\""post-modern\\"" novel. That means that the author provides a minimum of linear plot; employs irony and satire to reveal the perils of living in today's world; utilizes a restructuring of various literary genres. And so it goes.<br /><br />While this book was often very humorous, I found it shallow and non-engaging. It is funny, but not particularlyclever, and there is a difference.

It took me some time to adjust to the writing style and to what the author was trying to accomplish with White Noise. But once I entered the pace and got what the author was trying to do, I loved it. It is surprisingly funny -- laugh out loud funny and made me think about topics such as dying and fear.<br /><br />White Noise begins as an examination of a \\""modern\\"" family. The members' relationship with each other, technology and their fear of death and aging. White Noise was written in the mid-1980s, but it still has resonance. The characters philosophize and make interesting observations but at a certain point in the novel the town that is the setting of the book faces an environmental disaster that could be deadly for all of its inhabitants. White Noise follows the family, observes their reactions and ultimately makes a comment on how we live our life.<br /><br />American society has a deep fear of death and aging. We seem to imbue the elderly and those that age with some blame for getting old. But when faced with dangers to ourselves, we often adopt apathy and fail to react. Perhaps because it seems hopeless or we feel helpless or it is bigger than us. An example I think of is BPA, I know it is a danger, I know it is out there but I have stopped trying to figure out all the ways it may harm me and my family because it is exhausting to keep on top of it and this quote captures so well my personal exhaustion on trying to protect/detect all the ways chemicals could affect my family:<br /><br />\\""The smoke alarm went off in the hallway upstairs, either to let us know the battery had just died or because the house was on fire. WE finished our lunch in silence.\\""<br /><br />and,<br /><br />\\""They want us to evacuate,\\"" he said. Babette said, \\""Did you get the impression they were only making a suggestion or was it a little more mandatory, do you think?\\"" \\""It was a fire captain's car with a loudspeaker and it was going pretty fast.\\""<br /><br />White Noise has a brilliant side critique of academic life and its perhaps irrelevance with respect to daily life of human beings. The main character in a quest to establish himself as unique has created a \\""Hitler Studies\\"" department at the college where he teaches. Yet he cannot speak or read German. His colleague is hoping to create similar staying power by creating an Elvis Presley Studies and has been invited to teach a course on the cinematography of car crashes.<br /><br />What do our relationships mean with other people? Are we involved with them because we love them? Or because they do something for us? The main character of White Noise is ridiculously self-involved, after all it is a satire. When his wife faces an emotional, marital and physical dilemma the main character is focused on how she is no longer satisfying what he needs her to satisfy -- he will say I need Babette (his wife) to be full of life, to be happy, you are no longer the Babette I married. \\""I depend on you to be the healthy outgoing former Babette. I need this as badly as you do, if not more.\\"" Similarly, both his wife and himself are focused on how their youngest son makes them feel, brings them joy yet he is stunted emotionally and intellectually. They refuse to recognize this because the point of their son's existence is not to be an individual.<br /><br />The main focus of the book are the characters obsessive fear of dying. And the absurdity of trying to stop the slow descent. Babette, the main characters wife, bizarrely enough teaches a class on proper posture to elderly people at a local church. As if they have just forgotten how to stand properly. As if this class will allow them to suddenly stand straight up and no longer remind us of what we will all become.<br /><br />\\""There's something I promised myself I wouldn't tell you.\\"" \\""Can it wait until morning?\\"" she said. \\""I'm tentatively scheduled to die. It won't happen tomorrow or the next day. But itis in the works.\\"" I said.<br /><br />How does a person accept dying? That is the core of White Noise. \\""How does a person say good-bye to himself. It's a juicy existential dilemma.\\""",2013-01-21

Gladney has established a stable family life with his new wife Babette and an array of children from their previous marriages. His colleagues consist of other academics who have found their own postmodern niches studying cultural minutiae; a new arrival wants to create for Elvis the field of study that Jack has made for Hitler.<br /><br />A depiction of 1980s family and academic life forms the first part of the novel, everyone unwittingly fulfilling stock roles as if characters in one of the sitcoms on their televisions. In the second part, a train derails and leaks toxic chemicals, forcing the whole town to evacuate and the realistically portrayed event is itself farce. In the third and final part, Gladney discovers that his wife has been secretly taking a newly developed pharmaceutical, and eventually the plot is focused towards a definite and rather surprising end.<br /><br />The dialogue and narration of WHITE NOISE often consists of small arguments over the smallest things, reminiscent of the plays of Harold Pinter and looking ahead to the television \\""show about nothing\\"" SEINFELD.

I consider it to be one of the most interesting novels I have read, thanks to DeLillo's powerful style, eerily brilliant depiction of modernity, and lively (if satirical) characters.<br /><br /> White Noise is written as a stream-of-conscious of the narrator, Jack Gladney. However, lines of thought and dialogue are frequently interrupted by snippets of the noise which surrounds him, with even the most serious topics interspersed with seemingly inane commercial sound-bytes. This random noise is injected with such assurance and sudden force (and without any attempt at excuse or explanation) that it can initially feel disorienting. However, the effect can be poetic, even hypnotic, as when DeLillo finishes a paragraph about Jack contemplating his wife's adultery by stating: \\""Panasonic.\\"" Similarly, the phrase \\""Toyota Celica\\"", when uttered by Jack's daughter, takes on a mystic quality which reinforces the novel's theme of spiritually charged meaning beneath society's noise.<br /><br /> DeLillo's depiction of the information rush present in modern society is masterful, and something to which we can all relate. As one of the characters amusingly brags, America \\""leads the world in stimuli.\\"" The question the novel asks is how to deal with it all--how to find order and meaning amidst life's chaos. Unfortunately, Jack is completely unequipped to handle the chaos, and seems at the mercy of the \\""hostile facts\\"" which surround and buffet him. For example, upon going to the bank and finding the teller machine's figures match his own, Jack feels \\""support and approval [from] the system,\\"" but when a computer taps into his personal history and indicates that he is scheduled to die, Jack feels oppressed and becomes increasingly preoccupied with death.<br /><br />  DeLillo himself seems more ambivalent about whether technology and information is a force of oppression, providing several secondary characters who revel in the noise.  Murray absorbs and analyzes everything, even smelling objects to glean yet more information from the mess.

White Noise is a perfect example of chaos theory. When the author takes to the role of the mad scientist and the readers are the test subjects. The novel can be described as a maze where you think you're making progress as to what is truly taking place, yet as you progress through the novel you realize that you've started over several times. Throughout this wonderland thriller you may find yourself with more questions than answers. Yet as you make your way through this wild journey down the rabbit hole and back you would be pleasantly surprise at the outcome of it all.  Don Delillo's White Noise to most considered to be a work of postmodernism, simply because the acts of the characters within can be said to be their own. Yet when you look deeper into the novel you will see that its inner workings describe the very society in which we live in. This picture is painted vividly as the story progresses.<br /> The story is surrounded by the life and times of the narrator Jack Gladney. Jack is employed as a professor at the local college. Jack is married to Babette Gladney, a teacher of adult education classes, which also happens to be his fourth wife. This couple has children which they brought separately to the marriage. Together they share four children in total, Wilder and Denise who both came from the previous marriages of Babette and Heinrich and Steffie who belong to Jack from other relationships. This typical family exists in the small college town of Blacksmith.<br /> Jack Gladney is the chairman of Hitler studies at the College-on-the-Hill. Jack invented this field of study in 1968. His goal was to exemplify the historical significance of Adolf Hitler. This internationally popular topic has brought much in regards to prominence and an air of dignity to Gladney. Every move Jack makes within his career is surrounded by the central goal of adding to his reputation. Heeven makes a name change to make it seem like he is a distinguished individual. But to everyone's surprise and yet no one's surprise it is brought to the reader's attention that Mr. Gladney can't speak German. This in itself is weird because his field of study is about a notorious German Dictator. So he spends quite some secretly trying to learn German before he has to host a Hitler Conference that was scheduled to be at the College-on-the-Hill.<br /> Jack is friends with Murray Jay Siskind, who is also a professor at the College that Jack works at. Murray works in the American environment department of the school which is connected to Jack section of the school. Murray has a unique outlook on life, feeling that the minutest events that happen every day have a large amount of psychic data.<br /> Throughout the majority of the story the main focus is surrounding the airborne toxic outbreak that engulfs the town. This event opens people's eyes to how they value life. Even when Jack thinks he has inhaled some of the toxic fumes, his goal is to find a way to extend his life. In a strange turn of events, Jack wife Babette might have had the answer all along. Through many conniving and treacherous activities, Jack has the medicine he thinks he need in order to prolong his existence. Yet come find out his very limited supply is due to his daughters worry about experimental drugs. With everyone's intense fear of death, it hard for anyone to grasp the true me<br />aning of life, so they can only question it.<br /> White Noise can be categorized as one of those books that would be a classic for a long time to come. This book is mentally draining but in the best of ways. It reminds you of the life you may live or at least someone you know. Everyone has a profession in which that want to succeed in. Parents have children with their own individual quarks. No one can say that they don't have a best friend that is a little crazy in one way or another. Many people in today's society have questions about death and the purpose of life and try their hardest to prolong the life their given. Someday we may have to face an airborne toxin that threatens to take the lives of everyone, we don't know. The constant murmuring about what is to come is only noise. This very book helps to bring this book across. Yet the best part of this entire book is not in the message of life or death. The most interesting part of the book is the question \\""Is it raining outside?\\""",2012-11-19

While the message is clear and captivating, it repeatedly bludgeons the reader over the head. The characters are neither independent nor interesting. Rather than being human beings eliciting some kind of emotional reaction from the reader, they're used more like cheap conduits for the themes of the novel. The dialogue is often wooden and unnatural, and though it often touches on philosophical musings that would make the reader pause and think, the effectiveness of the message is compromised by how ludicrous it sounds coming out the mouths of these characters. Delillo uses satire well, and the bits of absurd humour do lighten an otherwise heavy load. The last thirty pages are a surrealistic romp that conveys the mood of the story far better than the rest of the novel preceding them.

Those who note that they don't much care about the characters have a perfectly valid point, and it's true, these are not characters you'll get to know intimately and think about years later--there's no Holden Caulfield or Heathcliff.

Alienation, irony, consumerism, anxiety, absurdity, the surreal--White Noise very skillfully presents an experience of life permeated by these.  If you don't see much irony in your daily existence, or find nothing remarkable about the complete saturation of American culture by marketing, you may wonder what DeLillo is talking about.

And an obsession with supermarkets.<br />  Jack teaches Hitler studies in a small college town on the edge of Iron City. He's married to his wife, Babette, and they live with their four children from various marriages. Babette reads tabloid papers to an old blind man and teaches classes in sitting, standing, and walking at the community center. 15 year old Heinrich is skeptical of everything (including whether it is currently raining or not) and is the sort of person who will constantly refresh Google news for the updated death toll in the latest disaster. 12 year old Denise is a miniature adult worried about the medication her mother may or may not be taking. 9 year old Steffie is Denise-lite. Lastly, young Wilder, who I could have sworn was 2 from the way he acts but online sources says is 6, never speaks and, to be quite blunt, comes across as retarded. The story is told from the 1st person POV of Jack who, other than being kind of nebbish, has no personality. Ready to read 326 pages about these people?<br />  Jack goes about his daily existence until a tanker carrying the dangerous Nyodene D crashes near their town releasing a toxic cloud of chemicals. An evacuation is called for but during the escape Jack is forced to stop for gas, exposing himself for two minutes. (This was a point of difficulty for me because the way the event is described they're outside the radius of the cloud.) He's told that this exposure could prove to be a fatal problem at some point in the next thirty years. Then life goes back to normal.<br />  The rest of the book is more of the first part of the book, except there's more anxiety about death. (This was in the pre-cloud part too. Jack and Babette like to argue about who would rather die first. The foreshadowing is less shadowing and more penciling in.) Jack discovers Babette has been keeping a secret from him and she manages to belittle his place in her life while loading her confession with an incredible amount of bathos. In the end Jack tries, in his ineffectual and bumbling way, to reassert control over his life, Wilder nearly gets himself flattened by rush hour traffic, and the whole thing fades off into the produce section.<br />Throughout, brand names are thrown around like invocations, dating the text even more. While looking at clouds at sunset we suddenly get the line, \\""Clorets, Velamints, Freedent.\\"" Thank goodness for Wikipedia, purveyor of random information. While sleeping, one of Jack's daughters breathes the words, \\""Toyota Celica.\\"" I've never heard of that particular model but I'm sure their commercials were awesome. Random lines from the ever present TV and radio litter the text until they're actually coming out of the mouth of a passerby, culminating in a torrent of nonsensical information from a drug-fried character at the end. Rather than being intrusive I liked how these lines remind the reader of the constant barrage of information and advertising that floods our lives. The naming of products out of context was less subtle and kind of silly.<br />  On the whole, this was a well written book. Events progressed nicely, plots points were wrapped up, and the descriptive passages were very good. His imagery of the toxic event, with the ever expanding cloud lit by helicopters and the refugees trudging along under the falling snow, was very evocative. The prose was generally readable and with only a few stutters flowed well.<br />  One final complaint: the dialogue was horrible. With few exceptions all characters had the same unrealistic speech patterns. Even a German accented woman eventually started monologing the same way as everyone else. It was like Don Delillo's voice was coming out of multiple mouths, eventually giving me the creepy sensation that there were no individual characters at all but rather some sort of hive mind parroting the author's internalthoughts.

Jack Gladney is founding Professor of Hitler Studies at a prestigious private college. His best friend, Murray Jay Siskind, a Visiting Professor of Living Icons, is trying to establish a similar power base in Elvis Studies. He understands Jack's preoccupation with Hitler: \\""Some people are larger than life. Hitler is larger than death. You thought he would protect you. I understand completely.\\"" And there is a lot to be protected against. The central section of the book, the keystone of its arch, is a fifty-page chapter in which the town is evacuated to escape a cloud of poisonous material released by an accident in the marshaling yards, an Airborne Toxic Event. The result, after the immediate scare is over, is to actualize the fear of death from a generalized Angst into something whose statistical probability can be calculated by computers, whose incipient symptoms can be measured by medical tests, whose effects can be palliated by experimental drugs.<br /><br />Death or no death, the novel is very funny; though absurd, it is also very real.

As an American Literature major, I feel that American culture more than deserves to be criticized and satirized, but that doesn't mean the text doing so should be poorly-crafted. Unfortunately, Don DeLillo doesn't seem to have had much of a plot in mind when he originally sought to explore this particular subject-matter, i.e. the oversaturation of American culture, society, and identity with popular culture, mass-marketing, media, and consumption. The plot points he does include, namely the \\""Airborne Toxic Event\\"" and the two-dimensional drama surrounding the fictional drug Dylar, are undeniably forced. The former is hardly anything more than a poor excuse for a plot catalyst that really has no effect on any of the characters in the text, not even Jack Gladney (who is supposedly fatally-exposed to the event's toxin). The third and final portion of the novel, appropriately titled \\""Dylarama\\"" is a painfully-convoluted chronicle of Jack's delving into research involving the drug. What is arguably the \\""climax\\"" of this episode - Jack's interaction with the drug's creator Mink - is completely unsatisfying. It ends with the unexpected appearance of atheist nuns who have undertaken the role of perpetuating people's need to believe that someone else out there believes in religious occurrences, beings, forces, etc. White Noise has many themes throughout, but nothing remotely religious appears until the penultimate chapter, which is jarring to say the least. And although I can appreciate what the final chapter tries to do in terms of addressing the concept of facing death instead of trying to overanalyze or repress it, it left me feeling underwhelmed.    What I have to applaud is DeLillo's inclusion of all the consumer products throughout the narrative that seemingly \\""interrupt\\"" the normal flow. Although at times particular instances carry more significance than others in terms of how they relate to the \\""plot\\"" directly preceding and proceeding said cultural references, the references as an amalgamated whole expertly function as a manifestation of the consumer white noise that DeLillo is attempting to satirize in the first place. Thus, natural activities like sleeping and human interaction cannot function free from intrusion. What bothers me about most of the other reviews for this book is that people are criticizing White Noise as not presenting anything novel (please take a moment to consider fully the pun). Written in 1985, DeLillo was offering dramatically progressive views on the largely-overlooked negative impacts of a growing consumer culture. Regardless of how heavy-handed his satire may be at times - and I have to agree that it is - he deserves respect.    With that said, I personally enjoy the (obvious) symbolism and extended metaphor of the supermarket, especially in terms of the effects it has on the elderly Treadwells and on the Gladneys. For the former, the supermarket functions as an overwhelming corporate entity that tries to bully them into adapting to the shifting consumer culture. For the latter, it functions as a depressingly-superficial outlet for self-expression, emulation, and self-creation.    Had DeLillo focused more on the dynamics he created within the first portion of the text, \\""Waves and Radiation,\\"" he could have crafted an overall better novel. Alas, we are left with the disjointed result at hand.    In any other context, his characters could undeniably be written off as poorly-characterized and flat, but I feel like their coldness, their detached natures, their general abjectness, and the lack of inspiration they generate are all more than apropos for creating a realistic and believable portrait of a middle-class American family struggling to reposition themselves in a culture and a society that is becoming more commodity-based, death-obsessed, and technologically-driven. DeLillo's lack of fine-tuned characterization is a fitting way to represent his characters' lack of their own identities. Just like the pseudo-philosophical debates about description/qualification that permeate the text, you cannot define what is either not there at all or not a constant. Again, this parallels the change the supermarket undergoes at the end of the novel: the solace it provides cannot be definitely qualifies because it depends on the caprice of the shifting corporate and consumer markets.    As a final note, despite the praise I feel White Noise more than deserves in some regards, I cannot help but feel that Don DeLillo reads like a not-so-distant predecessor for hack modern novelists like Chuck Palahniuk - a man that relies too much on pretentious witticisms, shock factor, sarcasm, pessimism, &c. I would not recommend reading Kurt Vonnegut in lieu of Don DeLillo because Vonnegut's satire is just as heavy-handed and ultimately ineffective and uninspiring. Thomas Pynchon is another author that falls into this category. His Crying of Lot 49 shares striking similarities to White Noise in that it catalogues the protagonist's obsessive search for meaning in every little thing around her just to achieve her own ends.     All in all, I'd recommend not dismissing White Noise as a dull and force-fed satire (or as a BRILLIANT reviewer described, \\""a lack of respect for capitalism\\"") with an overly-simplified message. Relatedly, don't assume you're smarter than the text itself: if you were, you'd have written it first and better. Additionally, be willing to give credit where credit is due: White Noise is a decent example of an author trying to diagnose the \\""modern\\"" American state.",2010-12-31

The characters converse in some sort of robotic cadence, often times so mechanical that you may question whether they are, in fact, human at all. I know; I get the idea that that is the \\""point\\"" the author makes about society's detachedness, but still it makes for rather bland reading.      The novel makes a point to hit you over the head while satirizing consumerism, commercialism, slices of Americana, and the meandering superficial society we create. Often the things that aren't reality are often treated as if they are a reality. Consider the \\""most photographed barn\\"", where people are so absorbed with an idea that they fail to take notice that what they see isn't really happening, that the barn isn't really there. However, this seems to translate to the format of the novel; the author seems to sporadically throw out ideas without fully exploring them. This occurs in random words of products, and even in its characters. Take Jack Gladney, the main character. He's a \\""hallow shell\\"" of what he seems to really be. His obsession with death, which progresses more and more throughout the book, is unfounded because he has as much chance of dying as anyone else. He's given knowledge that he has been exposed to the toxins created by The Airborne Toxic Event, but the only definite is that he \\""could\\"" die in up to thirty years. He's also more of a symbol than anything else; he teaches Hitler studies, and is supposed to be a success, but we never really learn about this study, what goes on at the university, etc. This is never explored, and he appears to be a fraud. He doesn't even know German, has to go to classes to try to learn for an upcoming Hitler seminar; in the end, he's just a title, a shell. While this may be part of the author's point, he doesn't present it in a way that makes one care one way or another; this book is really without a pulse at times, dead as its title indicates. There is nothing to draw you in; it is mostly just flat lines.     I'm divided in some respects, however. While reading DeLillo's novel, some of the various loony, strange situations were reminiscent of what one would find in a Vonnegut novel (The Cat's Cradle comes to mind). While Vonnegut might not be as \\""deep\\"" as Delillo, he certainly is more enjoyable in my estimation. And, yet, there are a few funny situations and passages in White Noise. The chapter where Jack is certain that a figure sitting outside his porch is Death, only to find out it is Babette's father, is one of the most comical/entertaining. Her father, perhaps feeling as though Jack is not a \\""man's\\"" man, gives Jack a gun for protection. Jack, whose Death obsession has taken hold of his psyche, seems to take this gun as a message from fate. Jack's self-described insecurities he feels when her father is around were amusing also. However, humorous moments are juxtaposed with stilted dialogue and narrative style that runs out of steam after awhile. It's so obsessed with own importance, and yet so alienating to readers, that it is a book hard to like.     While the book does have some merit, in the end the \\""idea\\"" of the book is better than the actual read. The aspects of society are satirized, but in a very detached way. There are a few funny moments, but these are seldom, and the book's philosophical monologues by various characters (Murray, Jack, Jack's son) come to be overbearing and annoying by book's end.

The symbolism, repeated phrases and scenerios and borrowed philosophic concepts in this book are tired and overly obvious, mainly revolving around the theme that postmodern America is brainwashed by a bombardment of advertisements and the media, creating some sort of collective consciousness that causes the characters of the novel to constantly mimic what they hear and see on TV. At points in the book, Delillo will randomly start listing brands - \\""Mastercard, American Express, Discover\\"" - in the most obnoxious, self-satisfied way, as if sneering at Americans for being controlled by our money.  American life is depicted as depthless and empty, a culture whose avant-garde consists of radio slogans, consumerism, capitalism, mindlessness and the emotions dictated to them by the television.<br /><br />While not entirely accurate, this isn't the main reason why this book sucks. Delillo is so pretentious with this book, acting as if he is making some poignant, brilliant connection between postmodern capitalism and how it effects society - as if no one has made these connections before. This book was written in 1985, and I must give it credit for making these connections between the media, technology and our culture prior to the point where our information-overloaded society began to reach it'ss peak, but it is such a common theme in literature now and has lost a lot of its ingenuity and interest. In fact, I doubt that this book will be considered a classic for long for this very same reason - Delillo's story has been told and retold so many times and in better ways that there is no point in reading this book.<br /><br />Instead, read Jean Baudrilliard's \\""Simulacrum and Simulation,\\"" a philisophic treatise that is the basis of this entire novel. Delillo pretty much borrows every concept for his book from Baudrilliard. If you want all the concepts and theories without the unlikable characters and boring plot line, then read Baudrilliard's essay and save yourself 200 pages of nonsense.<br /><br />I'd have to say that the worst aspect of this book isn't the boring plot line, the pretentiousness or the borrowed concepts from Baudrilliard. The worst aspect of this book is the annoying characters. Another theme of this book is fear of death, a fear the main character Jack is obsessed by, and how this primal instinct has become separated from our lives by a mindset that technology and man can control nature.<br /><br /> The characters of Jack and Babette, a married couple, are pathetic - they are cowards who have no reason to feel unsafe in any sense of the word, who are nonetheless engulfed by an ilogical and self-obsessed fear of death. Babette is so pathetic in her cowardice that she sells her body to an old scientist who is working on a (bogus) medicine that will ward off the fear of death.<br /><br />Jack, an intellectual fraud who founded the ridiculous \\""Hitler Studies\\"" department of his college, hides behind the modern icon Hitler as a means to cope with his fear of death. Jack has no interest in Hitler in a historical or political sense - he speaks no German, which is ridiculous for someone who starts a department called Hitler Studies - and would rather examine Hitler as a celebrity icon, whom he compares to Elvis.<br /><br />I'd like to liken Jack's academic dishonesty to Delillo's borrowed concepts cast in a badly narrated plotline - nothing \\""classic\\"" or new in this novel, just a lot of hogwash philosophical concepts hidden behind a terribly written story.",2010-05-01

Comical exaggerated character responses to hypothetical events contrasted with relaxed responses to situations that actually occur.

I enjoyed the general sense of chaos in the plot.  My frustration with this book was the lack of dedicated voice for any of the characters.  Everyone spoke like a scientist/philosopher, even the children.

Let the seasons drift. Do not advance the action according to a plan.”<br /><br />TVs and radios interrupt Jack's thoughts with the strangest, incongruous observations.<br /><br />The characters go grocery shopping a lot, and the supermarket is the stage for many important conversations and observations, like this haunting description of the white noise itself: “I realized the place was awash in noise. The toneless systems, the jangle and skid of carts, the loudspeaker and coffee-making machines, the cries of children. And over it all, or under it all, a dull and unlocatable roar, as of some form of swarming life just outside the range of human apprehension.”<br /><br />Murray is one of the most interesting characters, a Visiting Lecturer who teaches classes on Elvis and car crash scenes in American movies. He is constantly expounding on the ordinary things around him and finding unexpected meaning. Often his ideas seem completely insane, but at other times he is acutely insightful which forces us to give his crazier ideas a chance. He sees car crashes in movies as celebratory, “a yearning for naivete. We want to be artless again. We want to reverse the flow of experience, of worldliness and its responsibilities.”<br /><br />In the end, the book seems to be saying that white noise is all around us. It is made up of tabloid headlines, bright food packaging, our excessive consumerism, our obsession with tragic stories in the news, the speed and “hurtling consciousness of the highway.” The white noise helps cover up our fear of dying. And maybe this isn't so bad because it frees us from an incapacitating anxiety, and lets us live more comfortably.<br /><br />That's one argument the book puts forward and then largely subverts. The final answer seems to be that fear of death is unavoidable and painful but also necessary. “Doesn’t it give a precious texture to life, a sense of definition? You have to ask yourself whether anything you do in this life would have beauty and meaning without the knowledge you carry of a final line, a border or limit.”bad because it frees us from an incapacitating anxiety, and lets us live more comfortably.<br /><br />That's one argument the book puts forward and then largely subverts.

This novel took me a few tries to get into, but it was certainly worth it.

The protagonist and antagonist of White Noise exist in the character Jack Gladney.  Gladney is a professor of Hitler studies, and is currently married to his 4th wife Babette.  The first half of the novel focuses on his daily life and the mundane things that take up such key portions. The mid point of the novel is a chemical incident, known as the airborne toxic event, that changes the lifestyle of everyone in the town. People begin to worry over radiation levels, future events of similar nature, and the meaning of their lives.

I remembered enjoying it so when it was the pick for book club this month I was excited to re-read it. I didn't remember the story (it has been about 13 years since I last read it) so it was pretty much like reading it for the first time. Thankfully I still loved it all these years later.<br /><br />White Noise is absolutely ridiculous, but not all at the same time. I was reading it with this stupid smile on my face as it was just so funny to me. It is just so fun, but at the same time not really that crazy. Maybe back when it was written it was, and if it would have been written now I can just imagine how much crazier it would have been with all the advancements in technology.<br /><br />Jack is a teacher of Hitler studies. He made up the course at the college he works at and he doesn't even speak German! It is just ridiculous! He has always been afraid of death and dying, but not in an out of control way. After he is exposed to the toxic airborne event he now has a timeline on his life. He now knows he is going to die, though the toxins will live in him for thirty years (so until he is eighty), but he has a time limit. It is just so well written that you see how crazy it is. I mean sure he now knows he will die at some point, but so will everyone. The whole second half of the book is this fear of death and how you can stop it or change it or try and do something about it.<br /><br />Babette, Jack's wife, also has an extreme fear of death. She has been taking drugs which are supposed to help with her fear, but they haven't been working. It really was just really well done. Yes, most people are afraid of death, but as the one character says you either suppress that or you turn to religion. The ending, how crazy Jack gets and how everything kind of turns around for him, was just hilarious. The whole book is easy to read, easy to pick up and put down if you only have a few moments, but just so well written. I loved the style, the voice, the way everything was. The conversations with the kids and their normal daily lives that make up the first half of the book were just perfect. I loved reading this.

It's rather disconcerting, to say the least.<br /><br />Am I a fan?  No.<br /><br />Will I ever be a fan?  No.<br /><br />'Postmodern' has all the look of literature ... written by very smart kids.  But I could no more become a fan of postmodern literature than I am, presently, of YA Fiction.  Neither category interests me.  Perhaps because I'm too old - or at least old enough to know better.<br /><br />Postmodern literature seems to me to be one very long exercise in snarkiness.  I like snark as much as the next guy, but I like it in small doses - and not for the length of a novel.  That Don Delillo was born 14 years before I was and has chosen this category - or genre, or whatever it's called - remains to me a mystery.<br /><br />I could cite thousands of examples.  But perhaps one will suffice from this SIMULAC (simulated evacuation emergency) on p. 206:  \\""All you rescue personnel, remember this is not a blast simulation.  Your victims are overcome but not traumatized.  Save your tender loving care for the nuclear fireball in June.  We're at four minutes and counting.  Victims, go limp.  And remember you're not here to scream or thrash about.  We like a low-profile victim.  This isn't New York or L. A.  Soft moans will suffice.\\""<br /><br />Smart?  Yes.  Amusing?  Yes.  Titillating?  Certainly.  But also soulless.<br /><br />Because I have a soul, I can't very well take points (or stars) away from a work that is (1) flawlessly executed; but (2) not to my taste.  If post-modernist is your taste, go for it.  I'd be very surprised to learn that anyone can do it better.

The story of Jack Gladney, professor of Hitler studies at a school only known as College-on-the-Hill, White Noise is a book filled with existential angst, terror of death, worries about the future, and a constant awareness of how we increasingly distance ourselves from the realities of the world through technology, unreality, and consumer goods. In other words, it's the kind of book that you'll either respond to or find insufferably pretentious; as an English major, I tend toward the former, although I wouldn't truly fight with anyone who felt the latter to be the case. DeLillo is a gifted prose stylist, and his writing is always sharp, with a satirical undercurrent that's hard to pin down, although it shows through occasionally (my favorite section: a disaster simulation team that uses a real disaster as training for their simulations, but frequently complain that the real disaster isn't measuring up to their standards). Beyond that, though, there's barely a plot to speak of in White Noise; there's a toxic cloud, a drug that relieves the user of the fear of death, and an infidelity that lingers on, but all of that feels perfunctory at best, an afterthought at worst. Rather, White Noise is about the insanity of academia and the feeling that we're wasting our lives with the ephemera that we think is important. As such, it's a book that has a lot to say, and says it well; at the same time, it almost defies you to enjoy it on any conventional level, instead luxuriating in long monologues, descriptive passages, and aimless dread and angst. For me, it's a complex, rich novel that addresses so much in its short length that it's almost dizzying, and yet I don't find myself loving it the way I do so many other \\""literary\\"" works of that type. Nonetheless, it's a remarkable achievement in many ways, and an \\""important\\"" book, for whatever that somewhat meaningless distinction is worth.distinction is worth.",2012-03-01

If you like to hear professors droning on about their obsession with death, without being particularly witty or profound, read this. Delillo tries so hard to be deeply insightful about the nature of human obsession with death, that his characters just end up sounding stilted, pompous, and frankly, ridiculous. Sure there are some great moments and characters- like Heinrich, or Denise, but none of them gets enough screen time. The Airborne toxic event is squashed into a few rushed chapters, and even though the book isn't trying to be a disaster thriller, there was so much potential in the moments in the barracks, all wasted.",2010-09-26
