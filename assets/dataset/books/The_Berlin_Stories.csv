The sections were originally published as separate stories later in the '30's. They were combined into &#34;The Berlin Stories&#34; and published in the collection that we know and love today in 1945. Because homosexuality was still illegal in the UK (until 1967!), Isherwood was forced to veil the relationships in his stories and to create straight-ish characters and plots, but it's pretty easy to peek between the boarding house curtains and see what's really happening during Berlin at this time. To get the real story, read &#34;Christopher and His Kind,&#34; which was published in 1976, where Isherwood dishes the real dirt on Berlin and we get to read about the actual characters behind the stories.<br /><br />The first story, &#34;Mr Norris Changes Trains&#34; describes how Mr. Arthur Norris thoroughly seduced William/Christopher by taking advantage of William/Christopher's loneliness in a new place and his ambition to have a gay friend as well as a real character that he can write about. Even on second reading, &#34;Mr. Norris...&#34; remains an opaque shaggy dog story, while the characters remain sharp although not always likeable.<br /><br />Most of us found the second story, &#34;Goodbye to Berlin,&#34; to be more interesting. But when we happen on the &#34;Sally Bowles&#34; story, which is just one of six sections, the movie &#34;Cabaret&#34; is so thoroughly entrenched in our unconscious that it's impossible to read Sally's responses without unconsciously recalling Liza's interpretation. (Perhaps a future generation of gay children can be protected from ever seeing the movie so that another interpretation can emerge, but it seems unlikely.) Other sections include the homoerotic &#34;On Ruegen Island,&#34; stories of the poor and ill in &#34;The Nowaks,&#34; stories about the wealthy and neurotic in &#34;The Landauers,&#34; and memories about Christopher's final days in Berlin in &#34;A Berlin Diary (Winter 1932-3).&#34;<br /><br />Something interesting also happens in the second multi-faceted &#34;Goodbye to Berlin&#34; section. Characters that appeared in &#34;Mr Norris...&#34; re-appear and have more of their backgrounds exposed and more of their stories revealed.  And then some of the &#34;Goodbye to Berlin&#34; characters appear again in various stories with a little more characterization and information. It's like leafing through an old photo album where, if you look carefully, people appear multiple times in different settings and different groups. But in &#34;Goodbye to Berlin,&#34; the effect is cumulative and the overlapping and disappearing (and re-appearing) characters give a larger feel for the place and the events.<br /><br />It's a huge compliment that the cumulative effect of the collection is far greater than any of the parts. Entertaining throughout, it's ultimately chilling when we consider how it all ends.Island,&#34; stories of the poor and ill in &#34;The Nowaks,&#34; stories about the wealthy and neurotic in &#34;The Landauers,&#34; and memories about Christopher's final days in Berlin in &#34;A Berlin Diary (Winter 1932-3).&#34;<br /><br />Something interesting also happens in the second multi-faceted &#34;Goodbye to Berlin&#34; section.

And when we're through, we have some inkling of what formed the basis of what created Nazi Germany in the first place. We see the true meaning of decadence.

After a while one can almost smell the damp air, aroma of sauerkraut, and the mustiness of these houses where Isherwood slept, lived in and recorded that nihilistic licentiousness of Berlin before the catastrophe of Hitler.

First, it is an introduction to Isherwood as a youth--a man who is charming, pursuasive, discrete, wonderfully able to describe events around him--and what events they are. The book describes, from the ground level, from the mouths of Isherwoods varied friends and their antics, events just prior to World War II. Not political in style, the book instead describes the loveable or not so loveable eccentrics and inhabitants of the Berlin demi-monde and their sometimes comical political attachments. The attachments are mostly of style and expedience rather than of doctrine. The book provides a wonderful depiction of the aesthetic mind--the narrator, Isherwood himself, makes no judgements of those around him, and puts personal loyalties in front of politics. One can see in this style of mind the early predecessor of his later more Buddhist thoughts. And to boot, the story is entertaining. His characters live in the mind years after the reading. The prose is funny, exact, gifted, with a tone remindful of Fitzgerald--a chronicler of another place and time. But mostly, thebook succeeds as a window into a fine and developed literary mind--the externalization of a finely tuned, perceptive, likeable youth who accepts those around him, has a natural grace, sees objectively and without opinion the world around him, and records the tumultuous and sordid years before the Nazi takeover.

This is unforgivable in the 21st Century.<br /><br />That said, Isherwood, of course was a first-rate wordsmith and a total master of the English (British in this case) language. But 400 pages of Isherwood is a lot to absorb! It took me quite a few days to work my way through this book.<br /><br />If these stories are at least in part - if not wholly - autobiographical, then we learn more about Isherwood than we do Germany of the time, but far less of him than of his bizarre and fascinating friends and colleagues. The characters in these stories (Isherwood aside) are beautifully and fully drawn, leaving very few details to wish more of. Isherwood himself, as self-portrayed, is mostly an observer and chronicler of the odd behavior of his friends and acquaintances. He's almost too neutral to like, yet (ego considerations aside) people seem drawn to him as moths to a flame.<br /><br />Make no mistake, however, if you think or imagine that you'll read about tons of scandalous sexual exploits, you'll be 100% disappointed. All \\""that\\"" is left to your imagination, with only vague hints at actual dalliances, let alone specific contacts. But, truth be known, Isherwood does not shy away from his own (and others') sexuality; he merely stops short of giving you any details, especially of he himself.<br /><br />Some of his characters (Frl. Schroeder, for instance) become almost \\""too much, too weird, and too German\\"" to stomach for 400 pages. I, for one, got often bored with and less and less entertained by these characters as the stories wore on.<br /><br />Isherwood is a 20th Century master of dialogue. An aspiring writer would read him solely for lessons in how to write dialogue. Thus, these stories tell you more about how people in the early 1930s in Berlin talked with each other than about their actual lives. He is very good, also, however, at soaring, perfect description. You really get the flavor of the moment - not the life, mind you, but the moment in which the characters live.<br /><br />During these times Germany's fate balanced precariously between fascism and communism, in part as a reaction to the horrors of the Treaty of Versailles. Mr. Norris, the main character in the primary story here, lives and breathes and works behind the turbulent political scenes - always mysteriously - and on the fringe. Norris wasn't very good at the spying thing, and eventually paid the price for incompetence. Of course, the Nazis won out, and the terrible era of Hitler ensued.<br /><br />One thing missing almost entirely in these stories is humor. Yes, there are funny moments, a cute line or two here and there, and little humorous episodes now and then, but, perhaps on purpose to show the ominous period it really was, these characters and these stories are not at all funny or charming.

This book fictionalizes his diaries. He calls himself William Bradshaw, which seem to be his middle names, and in the other half of the book he is Isherwood, or Mr. Issyvoo or Chris or Darling. He says in his 1954 foreword that he had planned to write a Balzaquian novel, but found himself not up to it. What he did instead has been published as The Berlin Stories. The result is charming and mostly satisfactory. I just wish this edition were on par with CI's writing: it abounds with printing errors (worst being the repetition of two pages instead of the new pages that should be there), and it provides no list of contents, which is annoying.<br />Here I give you a list of contents, without page numbers:<br />Half of the book is called: The Last of Mr.Norris. This part has 16 chapters and could be seen as a separate novel.<br />The other half is called: Goodbye to Berlin. This consists of the following parts:<br />A Berlin Diary (1930)<br />Sally Bowles<br />On Ruegen Island<br />The Nowaks<br />The Landauers<br />A Berlin Diary (1932-33)<br /><br />Friends of the film Cabaret will recognize the story `Sally Bowles' as the core of the Broadway play, which became a musical and the basis for the film (which is lovable). (Or was it a musical from the start? Not sure.) The initial stage Sally was, by the way, Julie Harris. Isherwood gives her highest praise in the foreword. (How could you stay the same, Sally, when I aged 20 years? Which, come to think of it, is not all that much of a compliment for Julie Harris, considering the description of Sally that we get in the book.)<br />Don't think that the book Sally is Liza Minelli. She is much less of an accomplished performer than in the film.<br />If you watched the movie before reading the book, you will find that characters and themes have been re-combined, and that the story has been changed quite a lot. I think it has been improved.<br /><br />This edition has an introduction which claims that the book is something like a landmark for gay writing. That may be so, but it would be wrong to expect a political manifest for gay rights. Berlin was and is a center of all kinds of things. Many gays did and do move there, like Isherwood did. His allusions to his gayness are not exactly hidden, but also not written large. Several times he mentions the presence of `boys', leaving little doubt, but explaining nothing. He ridicules a `fairy', the baron, but is mum about his own tendencies. Fair enough. He is much more explicit about the SM habits of eccentric Mr. Norris, probably because that is a) ridiculous, and b) not his own problem.<br /><br />As for the structure of the combined book, I would have kept the Norris part much shorter. The man is a curious freak, but his domination of half of the book gives him more weight than he deserves.<br />CI's main theme is people on the fringe: freaks and eccentrics from various subcultures, or outsiders in another sense, like the wealthy Jewish family. He is politically aware, and describes the troubles times, with poverty and street fighting between communists and Nazis, though they don't seem to concern him personally. Norris, essentially a con man, has some opportunistic involvements with communists, which are narrated like all the other exotic events: observations from outer space. That makes much sense, as Isherwood/Bradshaw is from England.<br /><br />There is one communist event in 1931 where Norris turns up as a speaker about British imperialism in East Asia, while most of the other speakers are addressing Japanese atrocities in China. As far as I know, those started only in the mid 30s, not earlier, so we have an anachronism of the kind that annoys me. Unless something happened in 1930 that I am not aware of, possibly related to the former German colony in Qingdao, now Shandong province, which the Versailles Contract, in the smartness of the allied victors, awardedto Japan rather than returning it to China.<br /><br />All in all I liked the film better. At 400 pages in total, the book has some lengths that the film never has. The explicitly bi-sexual orientation of the Michael York character is more convincing than the strangely neutral narrator Bradshaw/Issyvoo.<br />I would give 3.5 stars, deducting for the flaws in the edition and the weaknesses of the book itself.etter.

It's the size of a single sheet of paper slighly larger than the book and will be loosely inserted somewhere in the text.

You've read this is the basis of Cabaret and Sally Bowles does appear but the connection is not strong.<br /><br />Mr.Norris is an entertaining, rather light novel that centers around a character Isherwood(here called Bradshaw) meets on a train  to Berlin in the 1930's.They become friends and associates in Berlin.Why, I never did understand.Norris is a very creepy man who strikes me as having no redeeming features and is around 30 years older than Bradshaw.He sounds like he'd be somewhat amusing when not boring and a lot more trouble than he's worth.Of course, why Bradshaw is in Berlin isn't real clear either.Norris  commits to the Communist Party and Bradshaw flirts with it.Nazis hover about and spread occasional mayhem.We know they are not a good thing.Bradshaw gets to observe lots of strange stuff and Norris eventually gets into a lot of trouble.Both leave Berlin.<br /><br />Goodbye Berlin is set in the same time and place except this time Isherwood , still the narrator , is called, Isherwood .There is a little more depth here.However Isherwood is still a man of mystery giving English lessons to rich Germans and occasionally hanging out in seedy bars.Communists and Nazis fight it out and the Bourgeois order is collapsing.He hangs around with Sally Bowles, an actress singer wannabe.He hangs around with a rich Jewish girl.He hangs around with her cousin.Why?No , I don't mean it's boring.It's rather interesting but remote and concealed.What's going on ?Isherwood isn't saying.The most revealing story here is set on a German resort island.Isherwood,strapping young Otto from the Berlin slums and Paul -an extremely weird young Englishman are all living together.Well I think even in the '30s people must have been able to figure this one out.<br /><br/>Unless you're a professional homophobe, you can't help but feel sympathy for Isherwood.Homosexuality is mentioned in the book.In Norris ,Bradshaw is used as a lure for another man.Most of the characters are almost certainly gay.Yet, it can't be said.The character Isherwood,has no sex life and what he's up to is never acknowledged.The effect is somewhat bizarre.You'd have to be dense to not realize that something very important is being left out or avoided.You can't blame Isherwood.I don't think he especially relished persecution and prosecution.To those nostalgic for the days of the closet , Berlin Stories should stand as a bit of a refutation .The book would be much better if it were more open.This is partially autobiographical writing , where the writer is understandably coy.It's aesthetically damaging.It's also historically damaging.I don't read fiction primarily to gain insight in historical milieus but I have a strong history background and from that standpoint , I have to admit, I wish Isherwood had felt free to be more open.",2015-05-06

I wasn't at all familiar with Christopher Isherwood, so I had no idea what to expect.<br /><br />I'm a bit of a pre-WWII German history nerd so I knew a fair amount about the politics of the period, but knew nothing about the cabaret culture and the people who inhabited that world.  I was immediately drawn in, and didn't want to put the book down when it ended.  The characters are well-drawn, and even the not-so-likeable were portrayed as multifaceted, complex human beings -- real people -- living in an amoral, hedonistic culture where pretty much everything was permissible.  Most chose not to see what was going on outside their own little part of Berlin, and were indifferent to it if they did see.  And why not?  They moved in a time and place that were somehow outside reality.  Few of them were rich, but many were capable of living as if they were, simply by telling a few lies and acting the part.  One could get money, one way or another.  Pleasure was the goal, and if one stayed in the right circle, life was a party.<br /><br />There was, as there always is, another side of the story.  In this case, it was the poor who lived outside the charmed circle, scraping by any way they could.  Their existence was day-to-day, with hunger, disease, miserable living conditions and winter cold or oppressive summer heat as their constant companions.  Isherwood drew these characters, too, as complex humans, motivated not by the pursuit of pleasure but by the desire to survive.<br /><br />After reading &#34;The Berlin Stories&#34; I spent quite a bit of time online, finding out more not only about the cabaret culture, but about Berlin in they months preceding the Nazi takeover of the German government.  What a time it was.  And to think I discovered it because I'm in a play and simply wanted to find some stuff to help me develop my character.",2013-12-29

This is a book that I keep handy, because I use it for reference often.  Having it on Kindle means that it will be with me always :)<br /><br />The social situations that Christopher Isherwood describes in pre-WWII Berlin are pertinent today.  It is almost spooky.  Isherwood wrote this in the years between WW-I and WW-II, before Hitler came to power.  He wrote eloquently about how the hyper-nationalism rose as racial discrimination took over what was becoming Hitler's Berlin.  Oddly, I was reading that several years ago when the Tea Party was having their first convention in Nashville.  The comparison was so stark that it was frightening to see Sarah Palin on television inciting the crowd to a riotous pitch while talking about the Muslims ... Mexicans ... Gays ...  I never realized that the literary basis for Cabaret was such an incredible reflection of the constant aspects of humanity.",2013-12-16
