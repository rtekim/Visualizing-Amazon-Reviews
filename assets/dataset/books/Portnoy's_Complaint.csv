My first read was 'Ghost Writer' for a Holocaust literature course. After a recommendation from my professor for a book to utilize for my Master's thesis (the depiction of psychiatric care in 20th century American literature), I can safely say that my professor knows a good book when he reads one.<br /><br />Alexander Portnoy is, at times, completely annoying, yet there is something in his complaint that evokes a degree of sympathy and, for some, empathy. Sure, he's got more than enough to make even Freud's head spin, but he isn't wholly detestable. Roth writes this character so convincingly that I imagine the Doctor's reactions as he is sitting there listening to Portnoy ramble on. The issues involved in growing up Jewish dominate the novel, but there are multiple fascinating themes co-occurring as Portnoy's story develops.<br /><br />If you don't mind reading about penises and vaginas on every page and can tolerate an often abundant usage of Caps to emphasize Portnoy's mental duress, you should consider picking up this witty and thought-evoking read.",2015-07-24

Like that hit that has redefined the taste of the masses as &#34;much worse than we originally suspected&#34;, it features a sexually explicit storyline featuring a person with substantial control freak tendencies, mundane taste in women and a really exotic taste for meat in ways that the butcher never anticipated.  Unlike that future classic, however, it's funny where it's actually meant to be.  It's the novel where Philip Roth basically makes his transformation into PHILIP ROTH, literary superstar, the fellow we know and love and are sometimes frustrated by, and the sheer notoriety of the novel would follow him for years until even he had to make fun of it via sort of stand-in Nathan Zuckerman and his delightful literary book about doing it, &#34;Carnovsky&#34;.  Questions of &#34;how much of this did he make up&#34; would dog him for years, as if people couldn't comprehend that a guy whose job it is to make up things for a living wouldn't be able to figure out that certain things are universally funny, and are even funnier when you add a slab of liver to it.<br /><br />This is the kind of novel you're either going to be thoroughly engrossed and amused by, or are going to find it meanderingly obsessive and with so many personal details that even a reality TV star would be like &#34;Whoa, pal, TMI.&#34;  It basically concerns one thing, and one thing only, and that is Alexander Portnoy, and his constant quest for sexual gratification, one that seems to touch every single aspect of his life, from his relationship with his family to women to Israel and the Jewish experience in America, one that seeks to touch it all over the place, touch it gently and touch it hard, sometimes even touching itself in the process.  It's told as one long stream of consciousness rant, ostensibly Portnoy telling all his worries to an extremely patient psychiatrist, who probably never thought that a simple question of &#34;Tell me what's troubling you&#34; would lead to a breaking dam of woes, spilling out one after the other and hardly in a linear fashion.  Portnoy details his life, growing up with his pleasant but overbearing parents, discovering that his sexual flowering is more like an algae bloom, sudden, rapid and before you know it, all over the place.  He tells us about the various girls he meets in the process as he wanders about searching for love and satisfaction, not necessarily in that order.<br /><br />Most of the subject matter here will seem familiar to anyone who has read even a little bit of Roth in his prime, especially if you're like me and bouncing around his career at random.  For the most part a lot of the things that become tropes in later novels start out there, so the shock of the new that greeted readers on its publications may not quite be there.  Still, there's a hilarious focus to this that the other novels seem to lack and the very thing that may turn off some readers (namely, Portnoy's constant complaining) is what gives the novel the edge.  Stripped of the winking smirks toward portions of his life and the almost reflexive need to go meta exactly when the book doesn't need it, this book comes across as exactly what it should be, one guy adrift in a sea of troubles of his own creation and not completely understanding how that happened, even as the recollections of bizarre events pile on top of each other like madly breeding pancakes.  Even with the familiarity of some of its concept, a lot of it comes off as new and fresh because of the sheer singlemindedness of the affair.<br /><br />And it helps that it's funny.  Roth would rarely be this funny again and a large part of that is how well he captures Portnoy's speaking voice as he monologues seemingly in one long sentence, this great rush of words that only gets more and more hilarious as you imagine him getting increasingly hysterical asrecounting his life story only winds him up further, until you can almost hear the veins popping out of his neck as he strains to convey the sheer tortures that follow him around every day.  He pleads, he cajoles, he rails and rants and pities himself to such an absurd degree that it goes past narcissism into something far greater, like he becomes nothing but pure ego.  And when sex really enters the picture the book takes off completely into another stratosphere, featuring prose explicit enough to make a dominatrix blush, especially when his sexuality blossoms and he discovers the manly joys of self-gratification, proceeding to reenact the song &#34;Orgasm Addict&#34; to an insane degree, his narrative voice nearly rising to a screech as he attempts to express just how far he's willing to go, even to the realm that is nowadays probably relegated to weird fetish sites in dark corners of the Internet.<br /><br />The prose (and by definition, Portnoy's voice) is more than strong enough to carry it and it helps that Roth hardly pauses for breath when he gets going, allowing our narrator room to argue with himself, adore himself, berate himself, all the while presumably while his poor psychologist sits there and wonders if he should be doing something professional to stop this.  But he's as amused as the rest of us are.  Portnoy seems to possess some self-awareness of how obsessed he is but is unable to stop himself to any sane degree and given a captive audience, he spills everything in the same way he spills his seed, holding nothing back and not really caring what it stains in the process.  A novel for both the literary sophisticated thirty-five year old in me and the thirteen year old in me, he proves that James Joyce didn't steal all the good dirty jokes.  A lot of what transpires here will crop up again (and again and again) in other Roth novels in various configurations but this is where it all starts and probably the only time you'll ever see all the components assembled at once in an unstoppable force.  It's a kind of synergy that's hard to replicate, the kind that comes with a &#34;here goes nothing&#34; attitude and while he would go on to write novels that were considered better or more important, he never would write anything quite like that this.

Regardless, Roth's book feels like the best, most authentic version of said schtick that I've read or watched anywhere.<br /><br />In case you don't already know what the book is about and haven't read the description, it's basically the narrator rambling to his psychiatrist (the psychiatrist has one line in the entire book) about his sexual desires, repressions, motivations, etc., many of which are influenced by his Jewish upbringing and the presence of his overbearing mother.<br /><br />I thought most of the book was very, very funny. I laughed sympathetically at the characters that the narrator was complaining about, while often laughing simultaneously AT the narrator for getting so worked up about things.<br /><br />I've seen/heard people complain about gratuitous depictions of sex and masturbation. One of the book's main themes is the narrator's simultaneous sexual obsession, guilt, and self-repression, so yeah, there are some sex scenes and some masturbation scenes. A couple of the sex scenes do get a little adventurous, but it's probably nothing you've never heard of before. In fact, if you've A) masturbated and B) had sex (these should both be prerequisites to reading &#34;Portnoy's Complaint&#34;), you're probably not too prudish for anything in here. It's a bit of a shame that the book has a reputation for sexual outrageousness, because it contains some of the most genuine descriptions of sexual desires and motivations.<br /><br />The only weak point of the book for me was the ending, which seemed a bit rushed and not all that strongly connected to the rest of the book. However, given that the book is basically comic ramblings about a horny kid growing up and trying to deal with his stereotypically shrewish Jewish mother, the plot was never a focus and the end was always going to feel a little abrupt. All in all, it's well worth reading for the humor, the depiction of growing up Jewish in 20th century Newark, and the honest exploration of sexual motivations.",2014-07-18

The misogynistic thumb wrestling of the protagonist's mental stability and his sexual prowess with manipulable females is extensive.<br />  If you are the type of reader who enjoys bathing in sexual taboo and moral dine and ditching, this is the book for you.

He is well respected, and even famous to a degree.  He ought to be able to be happy and have a nice secure relationship.  His parents aggressively wonder why he hasn't settled down with a nice girl and started a nice family.  He does, after all, have the responsibility of carrying on the family name.<br /><br />Alex sometimes wonders this himself.  Thus this book, which is a stream-of-consciousness monologue of Alex's life.  He knows that there is something very wrong in his relationships with women.  He can't seem to make himself stay with one; he is constantly thinking that there is a better one right around the corner and he doesn't want to miss out.  Also, when in a relationship, he has very little respect for the woman he's with.  He always manages to find some fault in her personality or her education.  Maybe it's his parents' fault?<br /><br />This book takes us all the way back to the beginning, when Alex was a tiny child, smothered by his Jewish mother, trapped in a family in which he is the golden boy and his tantrums and whims are largely tolerated.  He is fawned over, given the best of everything, and he can't seem to escape the constant attention and focus of his mother and father.  Perhaps this is what led to his obsession with his own body and, eventually, with sex.  Alex talks us through his life, including much attention to how often and where he masturbated as an adolescent, and eventually to his sexual flings as he ventured out into the world and out of his parents' control.  Nothing satisfies him, and even talking through it as he does over the course of this book seems to do no good in solving the mystery of why he can't settle down.<br /><br />At times this book was exceptionally funny and clever.  I liked reading the dryly cynical way Alex's idyllic childhood was turned into an object of scorn and ridicule; it reminded me of the way almost allteenagers treat their families as if they are ruining their lives.  There was something very adolescent and angsty about how Alex described his life with his parents.  Parts of this book were very sad, though, and all of Alex's relationships were so dysfunctional, it was easy for me to believe that he would be baffled by what what was consistently going wrong.  By the end of the story I was getting a bit tired of hearing the same thing over and over again.

Philip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint meets (and in ways exceeds) its reputation as one of the best and most provocative books of the 20th century.<br /><br />I bought Portnoy's Complaint for one reason: I heard that Philip Roth was a great author.  I had no idea what I was getting into.  There's not much plot to speak of here, but the book is largely a monologue, delivered via stream-of-conscious writing, from one neurotic suburban Jewish man to his therapist.  This book captures the frame of mind a sexually deviant, hyper neurotic man during the 1950's.<br /><br />Upon this book's release, it received a lot of attention for being profane, obscene, crude, and vulgar.  This book, released at the end of the 1960's, was definitely provocative for its time.  What I think is amazing is, unlike Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, this book still feels like it's pushing boundaries in regards to how vulgar it is.  There are some pretty unspeakable acts and thoughts that flow through this book, even by today's standards.  I'm not a prude, but there were plenty of times that my mouth dropped open, incredulous to the things I just read.<br /><br />Now, you may be thinking: Okay, so this is just smut, right?  I think that, in the hands of any other author, this material would come across as pornographic, sadistic, or misogynistic.  Instead, the titular Portnoy feels like a genuine character -- not some silly caricature designed to offend the audience.  The neuroses that the audience is allowed to see feels somewhat honest -- there are clear reasons why Portnoy behaves the way he does, and we can see it, trace it back to these cognitions/actions.  Is Alexander Portnoy despicable?  Yes.  Is he a terrible human being?  Certainly.  However, there's a certain kernel of logic and reason that he carries around with him.<br /><br />I've read some reviews that lamented that this book was thin on plot.  While, I may agree, I would suggest that, while you read the book, ask yourself \\""why is this character here, spilling his guts?\\""  This fact only truly becomes clear within the final few pages, and it makes the previous 250 pages all fall into place and make sense.  It's a relatively short book, and its conversational nature makes it flow by incredibly quickly.  Oh, and I almost forgot to mention -- this book is absolutely hilarious!  There are some crude jokes, yes, but often the humor comes from a very \\""Jewish\\"" sensibility.  If you enjoy the humor of Larry David or Woody Allen, it's hard not to see some influence this book/humor has had on their work.d that this book was thin on plot.

Finishing it, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it.  Yes, it was about a neurotic Jewish man, and nearly every page touches upon some aspect of sexuality with a candor and vulgarity that few novelists would dare even forty years later.  But was it a great novel?  My feelings in that regard were mixed.<br /><br />I couldn't help looking over the other Amazon reviews, especially the handful of negative ones.  I saw many of my own feelings reflected there: the story was just TOO crass and over-the-top; Alexander Portnoy is a thoroughly disagreeable character; at times the novel struggles under the weight of its own psychoanalytic self-importance.  Although this novel seems to have attracted more than the average number of intelligent, literate reviewers, when I read the negative reviews I couldn't help thinking that many of them had missed the point - and by extension, so had I.  It's not that there was anything wrong with my observations.  What I hadn't realized right away was that what I was feeling was exactly what the author had intended me to feel.<br /><br />\\""Portnoy's Complaint\\"" isn't meant to be an accurate representation of reality.  It's a comic representation of one man's neurotic worldview.  As a writer myself, I appreciate the challenge of telling a story via an unreliable narrator - and I have to admire how brilliantly Philip Roth has pulled it off here.  Everything we know about Portnoy, about his family, his lovers, his formative years, we learn from Portnoy himself.  Portnoy's world is full of obnoxious stereotypes and grotesque caricatures because those are the terms in which he thinks.  What matters is not so much whether young Alex's mother was really so overbearing, his father so pathetic, as he makes them out to be; what matters is that he believes that they were.  Was his upbringing the root of his neurosis, or is he simply looking for a place to lay the blame?  We may never know.<br /><br />After I finished this novel (nearly all of it in the last 24 hours, including a 120-page chapter with an unprintable name which I read in one sitting), I felt as if I had wallowed in filth - but not because it was a \\""dirty book.\\""  \\""Portnoy's Complaint\\"" may be famous for its frankness and crudity, but there's nothing titillating or erotic about the sex in this book.  Like Portnoy himself, we are wallowing in this debauchery without any real savor.  Portnoy's experiences are often very funny, but also painful.  (The chapter \\""Whacking Off\\"" left me indescribably grateful to have been born female.)  Ultimately, sex in this novel is not about interpersonal connection or even selfish physical pleasure; instead, it's the way that Alexander Portnoy lives out his own self-loathing, and it is Portnoy's self-loathing, rather than his sexual escapades, that left me feeling unclean when I set down the book.<br /><br />This caustically funny, yet ultimately unsettling novel ultimately succeeds because, although Portnoy as a character is impossible to like, he's also impossible not to relate to.  Portnoy's 300-page monologue is self-important, vulgar, sentimental, pusillanimous, offensive, whiny, hypocritical, full of bigotry and hyperbole and trumped-up self-pitying self-justification - but do we not all carry these things within us, our own worse selves, pieces of our minds we hate to examine too closely for fear that we might not actually be the patient, generous, tolerant folks we believe ourselves to be?<br /><br />\\""Portnoy's Complaint\\"" is an intense and stunning piece of work.

We see his development from an emic point of view from the age of about four until his current maturity.  First his domineering and demanding family, then his adolescent relationships with his schoolmates and girls of varying degrees of accessibility and virture, then his adventures with three grown-up women.  It ends with the ululation of a psychologicall fragile and mortally wounded antelope.<br /><br />We'll never know exactly how much of this character study is autobiographical.  Certainly its more accidental features -- growing up in Newark, swimming in Olympic Park, masturbation.  (I take masturbation among adolescents to be pretty much universal; at least I hope it is.)  But certainly not ALL of it.<br /><br />The three shikses, or Gentile women, that Portnoy involves himself with are surely chosen for their emblematic qualities.  \\""The Monkey\\"" is a sexually voracious redneck model from Appalachia who, at 29, wants to settle down and get married.  She represents the uneducated, the gorgeous, the bourgois.  \\""The Pumpkin\\"" is plump and comes from a Wasp Middle West family in a clean house with shutters and an elm tree, where everyone asks, \\""How are you?\\"" and says, \\""Slept like a LOG.\\""  She's educated, though, a student at Antioch, just too bland for the sophisticated Portnoy.  \\""The Pilgrim\\"" is a member of the New England elite, an ex-preppy who knows how to ride horses on the vast acres of her family's Connecticut estate.

His interactions with Mary Jane Reed, a.k.a. \\""The Monkey,\\"" both excite and repulse him. She's everything he ever dreamed about. He can't stand her because she's uneducated and crude. She's beautiful. He's afraid to take her to a gala event because of what he thinks she would say to the Mayor of New York.    All in all, PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT is a wild ride. It is rude, crude, hysterical, sad, hilarious, shocking ...and more. I can't believe that it took me 42 years to get around to reading the book, but to be fair, it really isn't age-appropriate reading for a six-year-old anyway... not that I would have understood ANY of it had I read it when it was first released!

You are like a baby.\\""    This assessment is given to the title character near the end of the story, after the reader has spent hundreds of pages within his mind, being privy to the darkest and most perverted images likely to be found in a modern novel. Though short and to-the-point, it is also accurate; Alexander Portnoy goes throughout his life with a fascinating mixture of narcissism and self-loathing, and directs his venom at all the major forces in his life. The brunt of this is given to his Oedipal mother, his hapless father, his own anti-semetic feelings about his Jewishness, and any unfortunate woman who gets in his path. Everything combines in a fresh yet easily understood stream-of-consciousness style to form a portrait of a stunningly neurotic man, who is as revolting as he is (dare I say?) likeable. Roth is at his peak here- the book is compulsively readable, hilarious, yet given to moments of creepiness and an overall thread of barely-contained (until the end) hysteria. It's a difficult book to critique, but a major work of one of America's masters. A must-read for all but the sheepish.",2009-09-17

It is cast in the form of an endless monologue that Alex Portnoy is inflicting on his doctor or psychotherapist.  Who or what Dr Spielvogel may be is never made clear.  And is this a real monologue or only imagined?  In the course of Alex's complaints to a supposed Dr Spielvogel a great deal comes out about his life and loves, and hates, but no plot or story line emerges.  Also a great deal of what comes out seems to be confabulation, fable, and outright falsehood, and much of it is, of course, exaggeration.  Alex is a master of exaggeration.      Why would anybody be interested in Alex's exaggerations and confabulations and constant self-absorbed kvetching?  I don't know.  I can't explain it, but this book is absolutely fascinating, hilarious, gripping, disgusting, very very sad, and even, yes, edifying.  Roth is a genius no doubt about that.  How he can make some jerk's endless kvetching so enthralling is a mystery to me.  It's not the sexy stuff of which there is much.  That was wretched and fulsome, and I believe intended to be.  It's not the humor which is deep and throaty; that helps relieve the depressingness.  There is something about the utter humanity of Alex that gripped me by some vulnerable part of my mental anatomy and wouldn't let go.  I didn't particularly like Alex, I wouldn't want to be his friend--oh that would be tiresome--and I didn't identify with or sympathize with him.  Like Macbeth (or Lear, speaking of kvetching), he's endlessly fascinating.    I haven't finished Bill Bryson's The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid but I suspect that would be a fascinating comparison to Portnoy's Complaintas another completely different kind of story of growing up in American in the mid-20th century.  Bryson is just the sort of mid-American wholesome Iowa goy that Alex envies, dreads, and excoriates through much of his diatribe.  I suspect that Bryson is the perfect \\""other\\"" to Roth's Portnoy.    As a small coda I would like to mention that one of the most delightful and touching aspects of Alex's monologue is his portrayal of his relationship with his older sister Hannah.  When he is young she is in the background, almost a nonentity, but as he develops and develops his neuroses and hang ups she emerges as a kind and comforting soul.  She is the only person portrayed with any sympathy in the book.  Although she is not fore-fronted, Hannah is the human heart of Roth's \\""novel.\\""",2009-08-29

Porntoy's complaint is a character study in the form of a monologue made by Alexander Portnoy, a successfull Jew.  However, Alex suffers from an inner conflict  that is dividing and tormenting him.  On one hand he loves his family, and he serves his community dutifully.  On the other hand he is tormented by his childhood and his overbearing mother.  He's also a bit of a sexual deviant, and feels guilty for indulging in a number of sexual fetishes.      The book is incredibly funny.  You'll laugh out loud at the Alex's recollection of his childhood, masterbating in the bathroom while his mom calls into him, \\""Don't flush Alex!  I want to see what's in your stool!\\""    The book is also highly influential.  Philip Roth has invented the \\""Self Loathing Jew\\"".  If you're at all a fan of Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm, then you simply MUST read this book.  It's obvious that David got many of his comic ideas about Jewishness from directly from Roth.      If there's a complaint I have about the book it would be that the novel feels incomplete.  I found myself hoping throughout that we'd get to hear Alex engage in some dialoge with his shrink.  Instead the whole book is a monologue made by Alex, directed at his shrink.  Sometimes this approaches on overwhellming, but the length of the novel and it's pacing and the variety and quality of the antecdotes from his past keep the reader intrueged.    What exactly does Alex tell his Shrink?  Well, he spends most of the time talking about his overbearing Mother.  He tells about his high school addiction to masterbation.  He talks about his on again off again relationship with his girlfriend 'The Monkey'.  As well as previous relationships he had durring college.

Looking back from the 21st Century, the life of Alexander Portnoy seems almost like \\""Seinfeld\\"" if network censors had allowed you to see what went on in the bedroom in all its grisly detail.  And like \\""Seinfeld,\\"" Portnoy's neurotic struggle against the opposite sex and his meddling parents is terribly funny.<br /><br />To do the obligatory plot summary of \\""Portnoy's Complaint\\"" is difficult because instead of following a traditional plot arc, the story is told in a more stream-of-consciousness way as Portnoy describes his issues to the psychologist we never see or hear.  To put the story in a chronological order, Alex Portnoy grew up as the youngest child of Jewish parents in Newark, New Jersey.  His father was an insurance salesmen in poor neighborhoods, working 12 hours a day to sell insurance and then coming home to work equally hard to move his bowels.  His mother was lord of the manor, overseeing the running of the house while smothering Alex throughout his childhood to the point that he confused his teacher for his mother all through kindergarten.  This gives Alex a bit of an Oedipal complex, compounded by a guilt complex from the way his parents use guilt to manipulate him all through high school.  Alex seeks refuge in sex--first with himself and then with a variety of women.  In 1967 this might have made him seem like a sexual deviant, but now days it's not so shocking--make of that what you will.  An affair with an underwear model he labels \\""The Monkey\\"" for her love of bananas and a disastrous trip to the new state of Israel lead Alex into therapy.  The story ends before we know whether the therapy was successful or not.<br /><br />The way the story is written, it's hard not to laugh even as Alex talks about cultural angst, guilt, and prejudice.  Even as he talks about his bedroom escapades, it's still hard not to laugh and that keeps the reader from turning on Alex.

At first I thought the problem was that the book was dated, but then I remembered Nabokov and Vonnegut and Salinger and thought, wow, this writing is just simply not that great.  Humor is relative, but for me there were only a couple of brief funny moments (the Thanksgiving visit with the Pumpkin's parents was one).  Overall, I thought the humor was quite bland.  This book is like many others in that it is a man's-eye fantasy view of life and women, told by a narcissist (is supposedly brilliant and funny, gets beautiful girl/women, partakes in endless exciting sex, is self-deprecating, etc.).  As a woman, I actually love these books, and there are some great ones, obviously:  Lolita, Money by Martin Amis, Tomcat in Love by Tim O'Brien, and many others by great writers and relative unknowns.  But Portnoy's Complaint is flat--without depth or great wit or an interesting story. In Amis's Money, there is also a scene where the protagonist attempts a rape, but in that book it works and fits the character and is palatable even as it is repulsive.  In Roth's book it is just an ill-fitting humorless scene drawn out to an awkward length with it's \\""symbolism\\"" hammered into the reader's head by the overly blunt writer in his attempt at being raw, or post-modern. Also, the character Alex Portnoy was not believable enough to be funny.  His parents were vivid (although, of course, cliched) but it was really hard to put together his job (he helps black people who are oppressed!) and his brilliance (he has an IQ of 158!) with the personality of the character who likes to sleep (or attempt to rape!) the-dumber-and-more-beautiful-the-better women (like his illiterate hillbilly nymphomaniac super-model!) .  It is one thing for an author to create a protagonist with a warped sense of self--that is what is so fascinating about Humbert Humbert or the other great protagonists in these humorous/dark novels--but another for the author to really believe that his character is simultaneously a cad and a super-stud-genius, which is what you come away with in Roth's book. There is simply not enough dimension to this character to make a person find him interesting in his patheticness or unlikeable-ness.

Along the way, we learn about his over-bearing mother, his whipped constipatory, but well-meaning father, and his strange incompatable girlfriend Monkey, often accompanied by a detailed description of a peculiar form of masturbation or some other perverse act of a sexual nature.

Fear the Christians, fear getting injured, fear living your life.  Feel guilty about almost anything that isn't proper in Sophie's mind.

As both, Alexander Portnoy is unable to reconcile his desire for the American dream with his desire for compliant shikses.<br /><br />Portnoy is at war with his parents, his Jewish heritage, goy society, women, and, of course, himself. He claims to despise his parents' flair for the dramatic, yet his entire monologue is an exercise in self-centered comic hyperbole. As an atheist, he has no use for the Jewish faith, but he aspires to the camaraderie and sense of community experienced by the neighborhood Jewish men who play baseball on Sundays. The goyish middle class around him fascinates him with what he perceives to be the perfection of life that goes on behind their curtains and repels him with their religion and its imagery.<br /><br />Portnoy refers to his girlfriends by nicknames such as The Monkey and The Pilgrim, which focus on what they represent to him rather than on who they are. When they are problematic, as The Monkey often is, they become individuals with greater mental issues than his own. When they are nearly perfect-upper middle-class shikses with centuries-long pedigrees, like The Pilgrim-they fail to satisfy Portnoy's cravings for all that is not the sexual equivalent of white bread. He finally encounters a Jewish woman-in Israel-but he is not up to the challenge on any level. Mostly, Portnoy claims to want one thing while actively seeking its opposite. He is not so different from anyone else.<br /><br />Part of Portnoy's bemusement lies in how the world actually works. While he, a model student and citizen, lives a secret life that would indeed cause the headlines he fears if it were made public, he learns that two of his former schoolmates, unfettered by the type of parental attention that he finds so suffocating and free to pursue the degenerate lifestyle he desires, end up, not behind bars, but behind the curtained windows of American middle-class success, enjoying all that comes with it-including marriage. Portnoy is disturbed to discover that there is no guaranteed cause and effect. Anyone can achieve the American dream if they wish. His failure is another opportunity to blame his parents.<br /><br />According to Roth, Portnoy has \\""strongly-felt ethical and altruistic impulses,\\"" but there is not much in Portnoy's character that is either ethical or altruistic. While his father sells life insurance to New Jersey's poor blacks and his mother furtively disinfects the dishes and silverware used by the black housekeeper, Portnoy is on his way to becoming the assistant commissioner of human opportunity for New York City. In this position, he shows little genuine compassion or empathy for the poor minorities who seek his support. He has no more interest in the people he represents, other than as symbols of his liberal socialism, than he has in Rosh Hashanah or the other defining aspects of Jewish heritage and experience. His only interest in his lover's threats of suicide are in the potential headlines-the possibility that his real persona will be exposed.<br /><br />In a symbolic way, Portnoy resembles a man from his childhood whom he despised for his pretentious piety-Rabbi Warshaw, he of the \\""Pall Mall breath.\\"" With his position as protector of the minority underclass and his apparent social liberalism, Portnoy is pious, or at least self-righteous, on the outside, but perhaps inside he, like the rabbi and his foul breath, is not so sweet or idealistic as he appears.<br /><br />Despite the 289 pages of uninterrupted monologue, the reader never really knows Portnoy. The pages and pages of hyperbole make him an unreliable narrator. Because it is a monologue, he chooses what he tells-and doesn't tell-the mysteriously silent and patient psychiatrist. The reader cannot know how much of this fiction is \\""true\\"" within its contextand how much is Portnoy putting into practice the flair for drama that so exasperates him in his parents-his father, whose bowels never move, and his mother, who believes that she nearly died from once tasting a prohibited delicacy and who can never let anyone forget it. Portnoy's Complaint reads like a long, drawn-out wet dream; a long, drawn-out comic monologue; or an odd combination of both. I can envision an abbreviated version of this novel as a one-man stage show.<br /><br />While not for the prudish or the conventional (Portnoy seems to say out loud the types of things most people prefer to repress, even to themselves), Portnoy's Complaint is a funny, evocative, tactless look at the American experience. You do not have to be Jewish to appreciate Portnoy or his trials, trivial as they are. I suspect most male readers will recognize Alexander Portnoy in themselves, together with his confused and confusing desires for middle-class respectability and his need to push the bounds of sexual expression-although I cannot imagine that very many would admit it.the flair for drama that so exasperates him in his parents-his father, whose bowels never move, and his mother, who believes that she nearly died from once tasting a prohibited delicacy and who can never let anyone forget it.

I had heard that it is Roth's best novel, and having seen only the movie based on \\""The Human Stain\\"" (I liked it) I had high expectations. Too high, apparently. The unending monologue of Alex Portnoy, a Jew from New Jersey, on the couch at his psychoanalyst's, has its funny moments, but (I will not be original here, it seems to be a common opinion) it is too long and maybe two-thirds into the book it becomes quite boring and predictable. The Jewish background with all the difficulties and privileges, the problems stemming from Alex's upbringing, his obsession with his mother (eventually, I feel that Alex is equally pathetic as his parents, whom he desperately tries to picture as such), together with his promiscuity and forcibly obscene details from his sexual life are nothing new. It is an example of a well written book, which aged unexpectedly fast. It was perfect for the end of the 1960's, when it was created, I imagine it fit snugly into the atmosphere of hippies, emerging popularity of psychoanalysis, open discussions of sex (Woody Allen comes to mind, of course), but nowadays it is no revelation. Somehow I think the author wanted to make if funny in a sarcastic way so much, that it cost him the price of making the characters believable (The Monkey, for example - I may be naïve, but I cannot believe in a person who cannot spell to such a degree).  And the end, the trip to Israel, is completely out of line and does not fit with the rest. Technically, it is a good, erudite novel, but flawed by being probably too marked by its time.

He gets involved with women to try and save them, but finds himself instead destroying them through  a deadly combination of disrespect and disregard.<br /><br />Some may find themselves thrown off by Portnoy's relentless self-absorbtion.

It is an important book historically because it was one of the first novels to deal in depth with Jewish identity and with an explicitly Jewish family.  If one looks for American Jewish novels before the work of Roth and Bellow, one will be rather stunned at how few books there were.  Most writers of Jewish descent before Roth and Bellow wrote as assimilated authors, partly because of a deep suspicion in American society as a whole against Jews.  Today it is often forgotten that even in the 1940s many young Jewish intellectuals changed their last names in efforts to escape the \\""Jew quotas\\"" maintained by many American universities.  Hollywood, though most studio heads were Jewish, invariably erased all Jewish identity in films.  Alexander Portnoy's rants about his astonishing Jewish family may seem familiar today, but at the time it was very nearly without precedent.<br /><br />Then there is the aesthetic dimension.  Roth's writing about growing up Jewish in a goyishe world would have meant little if he hadn't also done it so well.  This truly is one of the funniest novels that I have ever read.  I would rank it slightly behind CATCH-22, but equal to such other comic novels as John Barth's THE SOT-WEED FACTOR and Stanislaw Lem's THE FUTUROLOGICAL CONGRESS.  Absolutely no one has ever written about sex with so much wit and humor.  And no one has created such a phenomenally awful yet funny family as Roth has in inventing the Portnoy family.  The sister may be nondescript, but absolutely no one reading the book will ever be able to forget Portnoy's mother, with her endless and all pervasive obsessions, or his father, with his lifelong striving to achieve intestinal health through consistent bowel movements.<br /><br />The novel is also important for being one of the first American novels to deal frankly with the central character's sex life.  The two unavoidable facts of Portnoy's life are that he is 1) Jewish and 2) absolutely obsessed with sex.  These two facts overwhelm anything else that can be said about him, even his own moral convictions that lead him to a life of public service.  There is the implication that the particular nature of his Jewish upbringing--as a kosher Jew in a Christian culture--has played a crucial role in the molding of his sexuality, for while his sexual obsession hasn't been created by society, the particular ways that it is expressed has.  Portnoy has no interest in Jewish girls, but only in non-Jewish women who he imagines (or perhaps they imagine) he can save, but whom he in fact exploits and abuses.  The apex of the novel is his mistreatment and exploitation of a beautiful model whom he dubs The Monkey.  His inability to treat his sexual conquests with respect and humanity is connected with his inability to escape his outsider status as a Jew in a Christian culture.  But he is also a man without a country, as seen in the end of the novel where he attempts unsuccessfully to rape a young Israeli woman he meets in Israel.<br /><br />So, in the end, PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT functions as a seminal Jewish novel, a highly successful comic novel, a sexual confession, and a moral novel.  He doesn't offer any solutions to Portnoy's dilemma; he doesn't show how he can begin to relate to women with any degree of respect.  He doesn't solve any problems; he merely shows that these moral dilemmas exist.

It's a very funny, insightful and original look at a man struggling with his identity. Although the (anti?) hero, Alexander Portnoy, is Jewish, and extremely conscious and self-conscious about this, the novel is expansive enough in scope to reach issues of universal importance. Philip Roth has written some other very good books (the only other that I've read, and with which I was equally impressed, is American Pastoral) and he seems to have a knack for expressing the psychology of a particular type of American Jewish male. What is fascinating about the Portnoy character is that Roth makes no effort to make him especially likable or sympathetic. I can imagine that women in particular will not have much patience with Portnoy's sexual compulsion. Yet this makes him an unusually well-rounded character whose flaws are openly exposed for all the world to see. The novel takes the form of a confession on the part of Portnoy to a silent (till the very last sentence) psychoanalyst. The narrative takes place while he is in his thirties, but he jumps around in time from his early childhood to recent events. It is surprising how engrossing this is, considering the absence of a linear plot or the usual coherence of time passing. Even books that use the technique of flashbacks usually follow a sequential order of events; Portnoy's Complaint is a seemingly arbitrary stream of consciousness, yet it remains compelling (and frequently hilarious) throughout.<br /><br />  Portnoy's central conflict is his inability to reconcile his desire for freedom, especially sexual freedom, on the one hand, and his strong moral upbringing at the hands of very religious and overprotective parents on the other. He laments that he is the butt of every joke about a boy oppressed by Jewish parents. Portnoy's family is as ambiguous as he is; they love and care about him at the same time as they smother him and try their best to keep him in a state of perpetual guilt. Portnoy has also been raised to distrust goys (non-Jews). He has extremely complex and ambivalent feelings about this, as he simultaneously resents and yearns for the acceptance of the goy world. This is most notably expressed in his relationships with \\""shiksas\\"" (non-Jewish women), who, he confesses, he has a desire to win over as a way to feel equal to goys. Yet he has just as much trouble committing to relationships with Jewish women.<br /><br />  Portnoy is, in may ways, an obnoxious narrator. He is extremely narcissistic, dramatizing minute details of his life into matters of supreme importance. Yet this is also one of the book's strengths, as it gives the reader full access to Portnoy's personality and inner self. The reader can easily see through Portnoy's attempts to glamorize and exaggerate, and at the same time come away with a grudging admiration for his attempt to be honest about himself.

But from what I had read about this book people seemed to be a little uncomfortable with its thematic.<br /><br />No sooner did I read some twenty pages than I realized that in truth this one of the most misunderstood books of American Literature -- more or less a cousin of Vladimir Nabokov's \\""Lolita\\"". Readers are usually too concerned with the sexual thematic that they forget or simply miss about the other subjects.<br /><br />Most of the readers are very focused on the sexual content. It may play a fair part in the development of \\""Portnoy's Complaint\\""'s narrative, but it is not the only subject. At it is root, the novel is an unusual Bildungsroman -- than kind of novel that follows the moral and physical bring up of a young man. This time we are talking about Alexander Portnoy --the man behind the myth. As the book explain there is a disorder named after him.<br /><br />For almost 300 pages, we follow the Portnoy family complicated dynamics with a control freak mother, a weak father, a nice daughter and a teenager son fueled with testosterone. The son's, Alex, stories are amazingly funny and critical. When first you laugh for what he said, in the next page you're taken aback for his critical view of family, religion and society.<br /><br />Roth is a master of portraying the young Jew's angst. Not only his main character, Portnoy, has the same problems every young man has, but he also has a Jewish mother. Part of the time the son-mother relationship is the dorsal spine of the novel. But the writer's words do beyond it.<br /><br />Since \\""Portnoy's Complaint\\"" hasn't received so much kudos as \\""Lolita\\"", people feel easy to say all kind of nasty and incoherent things about this novel. Many readers approach to Roth's novel already prepared to face a sexual journey of a young man -- painted with the dirties paints. They couldn't be more wrong.

I thought I'd love it.  For a while, I did love it - I was on the verge of recommending it to friends.  Then, about a hundred pages in, it got tedious.  I realized that this is a one-note novel.  Alexander Portnoy keeps saying different versions of the same thing over and over again.  His rant (this book is simply one long rant) ceases to be insightful or illuminating or even funny - he just becomes ANNOYING.  Hundreds of pages of kvetch, kvetch, kvetch.  Not for nothing, ALL parents mess their children up.  To have this guy in his thirties still blaming his poor parents for everything that is wrong in his life - and with such gravity - simply makes him a loser.  <br />That is the book's critical flaw - Alex Portnoy is not a likeable character.  I hated spending time with him - he's obnoxious.  He goes on and on about how noble he is, how liberal, how enlightened, how smart, how educated, how moral, yadda, yadda, yadda.  This does not stop him from spouting countless racial, anti-religious, and homophobic stereotypes.<br />I can't understand why this book is as well-respected as it is.

Well let me clarify that, Charles Dickens was fairly dead before this book was written and had he been alive, he may or may not had the desire to pick Roth's \\""Portnoy's Complaint\\"", so let me qualify.  Hearing the glowing reviews and seeing the listmania lists placing Roth's \\""Complaint\\"" as a must read had me fairly in a frenzy to read this one.  Does it stand out as a truly unique must-read from all the more than mediocre literature out there?  I don't think so.  That's not to say it has achieved mediocrity, it is somewhat above that.<br />What a reader gets from \\""Portnoy's Complaint,\\"" is a window inside the psyche of a Jewish American boy come boy-man smothered by a truly overbearing mother and plagues throughout life by a sexual obsession that keeps him from being committed to a human relationship.  His commitments seem to be centered around desires emanating somewhere about his mid-region and early on seem to be mostly of the self-satisfactory kind.  This translates into adulthood to a dogged pursuit of shallow relationships with WASP-ish women.  So, there is plenty of Freud infused throughout.  And interestingly enough it transmogrifies into Jung, with Alexander Portnoy grasping the collective unconscious of his Jewish ethnicity getting back at the established American gentility through sex.  If any of this makes you squeamish, you may want to steer clear.<br />It was a book that definitely pushed the boundaries of the time in the 1960's but then again there was a whole cultural movement all about pushing the boundaries back then.  However, like most boundary pushers of the times, we seemed to have lowered our tolerance for the racy and compared to literature today of the same ilk, Portnoy is fairly tame.<br />Do you have to be Jewish to really \\""get\\"" this book?  Well, I'm not and there was probably 10% of the book that went right over or around my head.  Yiddish references were completely lost on me, but through repeat word usage most readers can probably get the gist.  Portnoy's is kind of like a mix of Woody Allen and Henry Miller.  It's short and written with an inner voice of a psychotherapy recipient spewing forth from the coach of self-analysis.  It's a good piece of literature, but I'm not so sure about a great one.

Alexander Portnoy is brilliant, driven, troubled, conflicted about his faith, shamelessly chauvinistic (sometimes downright misogynistic), and self-indulgent. His nearly 300 pages of narrative from a psychiatrist's couch brings us from his youth in the Jewish working-class of Newark to his \\""present\\"" as a Great Society reformer and back again innumerable times. It ultimately doesn't lead anywhere that I was able to discern, but the vignettes of growing up in the 1940s and experiencing the changes of the following decades are wonderfully vivid, and the looks inside his own psyche through the years are often all too believable. (Much as I hate to admit it, teenage Portnoy's struggle to reconcile his left-wing politics with his longing for a wife who looks like she stepped out of a Laura Ashley catalog in her angora sweater and tartan skirt is painfully familiar to me!) <br />On the other hand, his memories of his parents' obsessive concern with bodily functions (or the lack thereof) and his recollections down to the most absurd details of his stormy sex life (sometimes with women who were just as neurotic as him, more often with various inanimate objects) often left me hoping the good doctor would just tell him to grow up already. I can see why Roth's frank sex and masturbation scenes were considered so innovative in 1967, but in a more liberated age they often come across as overwrought, sexist and, well, bad. Still, for all that, his retrospective look into adolescent sexuality and familial relationships from an adult perspective is second to none. So is his evocation of the paradox of a successful young adult still torn between craving parents' approval and bristling against their rules and expectations, something you don't have to be Jewish or male to appreciate.

In rebellion against both his parents and the Christian society around him, he seeks out destructive sexual relationships with gentile women.

The novel, his &quot;complaint,&quot; is written in the form of an address to his psychiatrist, Dr. Spielvogel.  Portnoy is trying desperately to understand how his relationship with his parents has influenced his dysfunctional relationships with women.  <br />Portnoy's parents have always been worried about him in ways that seem ridiculous to him.  His mother tells him never to eat lobster because it might make him sick like it once did to her.  When he feigns diarrhea so he can lock himself in the bathroom to masturbate, his mother chides him for purposely sabotaging his digestion by eating french fries after school.  (A large portion of this book is devoted to hilarious tales of his uncontrollable onanistic urges and discharges -- into the toilet bowl, onto the light bulbs, onto the medicine chest mirror, on the bus, into the liver his mother is going to cook for dinner, once even accidentally into his own eye.)  When he goes to college, they make him promise them he won't ride in a convertible.  When he plans to go on a month-long vacation to Europe, his aged father lays a guilt trip on him about what he would do if he came home to find his father dead.<br />It isn't good enough for Portnoy's parents that their son has become a prominent lawyer and civil libertarian; they want him to get married and have children.  Rebelling against his parents, he starts a string of sexually adventurous but loveless affairs with shikses (non-Jewish girls) whom he gives unflattering pet names.  In college, there was &quot;The Pumpkin,&quot; a bright, wholesome, conscientious girl; then there was &quot;The Pilgrim,&quot; a WASPy debutante; and most recently, there was &quot;The Monkey,&quot; a beautiful ex-model but a practically illiterate hayseed.  Visiting Israel after abandoning The Monkey on vacation in Greece, his sexual problems come full circle when hemeets a Jewish girl who reminds him of his mother.<br />This book is not for everybody.  It is often very funny, but some may feel its tone is too paranoid, bitter, cynical, and confused.  The narration frequently degenerates into empty invective (a lot of personal self-loathing, Jewish self-loathing, mocking of Catholic and WASP stereotypes), but at least it doesn't euphemize or sugarcoat its delivery.

The book, long considered a classic if for nothing more than its amazingly effective stream-of consciousness technique, is a Roth tour-de-force of macabre emotions, painful truth, and biting sarcasm.  The story as such concerns a middle-aged Jewish man, Alex Portnoy ranting to his analyst about the struggles of growing up Jewish in a world populated by goyim. The book is framed as one big monologue in which Alex tells us about everything from his mother's fanatical devotion to the rules of eating kosher to his relationships with women. What's so striking about the book is the sheer strength of will on which it floats. The book plows ahead with its ugly, hilarious, painful, unbearable, engaging, sick narrator with nary a break in between. In attempting to find a cure for why Alex is so sex-obsessed, he at first seems to believe his mother's doting on him is the primary cause. Gradually, however, the reader (as well as Alex) becomes aware that Alex also suffers from a more subtle but affecting problem. The man is a classic text-book narcissist. He masturbates nearly every waking moment as a teenager not as a way of finding sexual gratification from the nature of his relationship with his mother, but because he is so self-absorbed that the act itself is a form of lust (for the self). This haunting narcissism is ultimately what causes him to never be able to commit to a woman seriously, and why he scars The Monkey so terribly (and memorably in a Rome hotel room), demeans the Italian hooker, and nearly rapes a woman in the Holy Land. He feels that by gaining control over these women, he will somehow become more potent himself. Thus, he gets his sexual gratification by inflicting pain on women. Mistakenly, this book is labelled as misogynistic because of alex's terrible crimes. But there's a clear distinction between the narrator's persona and what Roth is really trying to impart to the reader. The characters in the book are all sharply drawn. The memorable moments abound (try not to stand with mouth wide open as Alex describes defiling the family's dinner) or try refraining from expressing disgust at the inhumane way he treats the Monkey. This book is full of emotional honesty and pain. It is about not just Alex's obsession, but about the struggle that everyone experiences to escape the narrowness of our own lives. In that way, despite his reprehensible behavior, Alex represents a kind of hero. An unlikely one, perhaps, but a hero nonetheless. It is this aspect of the book that is most satisfying. Mr. Roth also vividly recreates Alex's childhood in Newark and Jersey City including priceless characterizations of Sophie and Jack, his parents. However, the book skimps on the other characters, especially Alex's sister, Hannah. Also, there are many minor characters mentioned that pop in and out of the book with no real explanation. Aunt Clara, for example, appears early in the book, and then is mentioned in a single sentence more than a hundred pages later. These inconsistencies lower the star rating slightly. The other, more important flaw in the book is the nature of alex's &quot;Complaint&quot;. As I mentioned earlier, the reader gradually realizes the real symptom of the illness, but the book seems to keep believing that it is Mrs. Portnoy who causes Alex to be so sexually inept and voracious. It's almost as if Roth wants to convery the more subtle problem and keeps the bits with mom in them for shock value and laughs. This aspect is somewhat disappointing. Roth seems to want to have it both ways. Also, the fact that narcissism is the real disease becomes quite clear, and still Roth never delves into the triger for this behavior. For a book that is so specifically about Portnoy's sexual idiosyncracies and inability to be satisfied, there is never a clear link as to why Portnoy channels his insecurity in this manner. This is Roth's (almost) fatal error. He vividly describes the symptoms, but not the cause. Ultimately, the novel is redeemed on the strength of its characters and emotional pain. Although readers may never know precisely why Alex is the way he is, the hilarious, shocking, and at times unbearably sad portrayal of his life is what remains indelible about this book. It's also, I think, why it's reputation is still so high. Overall, i recommend the book with those reservations. Perhaps a bit overrated by the Modern Library, but a landmark book nonetheless.

Portnoy's problem (possibly endemic in our time, at least among males) is that he cannot identify anyone outside himself as having human feelings.  One of Roth's more obvious narrative strengths is his ability to capture the rhythms of his characters' speech (see especially Zuckerman Unbound and Operation Shylock).  And while Alex here gives us very vivid impressions of his mother and to a lesser extent his father, we get almost nothing of his sister and even less of the girlfriends who precede the Monkey.  And not much of the two Sabras.  Why is that?  Because these people exist in Alex' mind (possibly also in Roth's, but that is another question) only as cardboard cutouts.  Contrary to Spielvogel, I think it is clear that Alex does experience sexual gratification (a lot), and though it is usually tied up with his sense of the forbidden, this probably increases his gratification, and the only guilt he experiences is a nagging sense that he is abusing and discarding people.  Which he is, because he is afraid to connect.  I do not think the structure of the novel (by which I do not mean the extended rant, which is rather well done, but the arc of the themes of the overbearing mother, the ineffectual father, the adolescent rebellion, the sexual adventurism) gives us much insight into why exactly Alex is so disconnected emotionally from other people.  This has more to do with a sort of clinical narcissism than with repression and guilt, but the source is largely unexplored.  Which then leads to the question, does Roth understand this himself?<br />Anyway, to answer the person who wondered whether the rather tiresome afterword that Roth wrote for the 25th anniversary edition is factual: are you kidding?",2001-02-20

He's unmarried at thirty-three  in part because of all the neuroses his parents have bestowed in him--so  why doesn't he get married and have children already?  Alex lets us know in  pornographic detail why.  Speaking of pornographic detail, Alex spends  plenty of time on his ultimately doomed affairs with (mostly Protestant)  women.  Most of his anger at growing up Jewish in a Christian-dominated  society he takes out on these &quot;shikses&quot;--variously called  Pumpkin, the Pilgrim and the Monkey--this is not a politically correct book  from the feminist perspective.

It never  occurred to me how religiously narrow our Educational system is---I don't  think I've ever been assigned a Jewish book for any class I've taken.   Okay, maybe Anne Frank's diary, but that wasn't something I could really  relate to.  A teacher's idea of expanding the classes minority awareness  was to make them read some terribly boring piece of Native American  literature--with spirits and totem poles and teepees.  What about menorahs  and dreidels and yamulkes?  <br />I wish &quot;Portnoy's Complaint&quot;  wasn't so perverse.  Because it just happens to be one of the most perverse  books I've ever read.  Ever.  If you read this book without knowing when it  was written, you would never guess, in a million years, that it was written  in 1967.  On the cover, Newsweek calls Philip Roth, &quot;The bravest  writer in the United States.&quot;  I agree.  For him to have written the  things he wrote when he wrote it, he had to be brave.  And the book is so  unabashed in discussing sex in all its lewdness and crudeness, that it  serves as a source of comfort, granting you the ability to say, &quot;Wow,  I thought I was sick, but I guess I'm tame compared to that guy.&quot;   <br />Particularly notable is the section on masturbation called  &quot;Whacking Off.&quot;  I've never read a novel where the issue of  masturbation is discussed so prominently and so openly.  Had I read this a  few years ago, I would have felt a lot better about myself.  At this point,  the damageis done.  Not that I damaged myself, but you get what I'm  saying.<br />This book is not a perfect book.  I have some issues with it  regarding the concept of &quot;form follows function.&quot; But I won't go  there unless you want to discuss it with me after you read it.  But  basically, it's a good read.  It's like a perverse Jewish version of  &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; that spans a larger period of time and is  much funnier.  And there are no Indians to be found, either.",1999-08-28

In fact, that's the entire point.<br />I certainly enjoy this book  every time I pick it up. In fact, the reference that sparked my curiousity  came from a wonderful Woody Allen short story whose title escapes me.  Roth's ascerbic prose is at peak form here, and considering the direction  he took (which is fine, in my opinion), *PC* is his most readable work  prior to 1996's *American Pastoral.* His characters are vivid and unique,  as usual, and while *PC* does feature Roth's signature abrupt ending, for  once, it fits rather well.<br />What I've found most fascinating about this  work is that the history and complaints of Alexander Portnoy are extremely  similar to those I've heard expressed by Asian-Americans who were raised in  the US between 1970 through the present. The level of familial pressure and  guilt laid upon Roth's narrator are quite equal to countless stories I've  heard of like upbringings in households of first-generation immigrants.  While obviously not everything parallels (no strict dietary laws unless one  is patently Buddhist), the vast majority of it fits, sometimes almost  frighteningly so.<br />I leave with a warning and a recommendation. If one is  easily offended by sex matters and graphic language, one should avoid this  volume.

This champion of the working class ,looks at non-Jewish blue collar types with a disdain that is comical.As for their beliefs , especially religious beliefs, what could be more stupid? As for women, they are not even human beings really, merely toys or oppressors .Portnoy  is a superficially nice man who on some level is a complete rotter and a consummate hypocrite.It all comes to a kind of head near the end of the book when Portnoy is in Israel.Both his conduct and his thoughts reek of an intelligent mans idiocy. Portnoy thrills to being in a place that's goyim free.He fantasizes that he's in his element.He's not.God knows what his element is.This is a very interesting section of the book.It depicts an Israel that was still a progressive dream land(with Palestinians no where to be seen).Things have changed ! Even in this progressive fantasy Jewish Utopia - Portnoy acts screwed up.It's inevitable.This is someone who can't be at home anywhere in part , not because of his mother , but because he can't look anything in the eye(if you will).Portnoy just dishes out crap and doesn't even know it.He's smart but he grasps nothing.
