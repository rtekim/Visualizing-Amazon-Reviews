Yes, it was a sad story overall, dealing with loneliness and the devastation of one family. Ruthie is the narrator, a young girl who is dropped off to her elderly grandmother along with her sister. Her mother dropped them off, then either by accident or design, drowned in the lake. The girls are everything to each other, but Ruthie's older sister begins to pull away, and realize there are other people and other things to aspire to out in the world.<br />I couldn't even begin to pick my favorite passage, the narration is absolutely devastatingly gorgeous. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great novel about coming of age, and family connections.<br />I'm looking forward to reading more novels by this author.",2014-07-23

It's impossible not to like both leads and feel good about their slow-burn romance. As stories go this is on the far end of low-key for me, as in almost too low-conflict. It's relaxing and realistic, since most couples I've known in my life managed to come together without attempted kidnappings, destined mate instincts, or life-n-death hijinks. But combined with the almost total absence of on-page sex, that relaxation risks slipping over into a contented doze. Still, it's the middle of summer now and the book was the perfect pastime for a mild, sunny day. Moreover, Fielding is to be admired for her fearless resistance of cheap thrills and gratuitous angst-fests in bringing together two sweet, lovable guys.",2014-08-11

Housekeeping is the story of, Nicky, a man who lost everything in one day. His job, his home, and his lover. Afterwards, he accidentally becomes a house sitter and from there becomes a housekeeper for one of his clients, Spencer.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. It's a sweet, low angst, feel good story. It's also friends to lovers. Hmm, I'm not so sure I'd classify this one as a &#34;romance&#34; book though. I more considered it a slice of life story. This book is about Nicky getting back on his feet and figuring out his life, but finds love along the way. It's also about friendships and loyalty. My only complaint is that I wish it'd been longer.

Then he walks into work only to catch his boyfriend cheating on him with  a co-worker and in that moment loses everything.  Now out of a job, a home and a lover, Nick scrambles from friend to friend, sleeping on their couches while looking for jobs.  Finally Nick lands a job housesitting for a wealthy couple and discovers he can make a living doing the one thing he loves to do – cleaning.<br /><br />Computer consultant Spencer Cartwright is a messy person and has a cluttered, garbage strewn house to prove it.  When Spencer needs to go out of town on  business, friends recommend Nicky to house sit and clean, changing Spencer and Nicky’s lives forever. But Spencer is coming off a divorce and Nicky is wary of romance and a relationship so soon after being dumped.  Can these men sweep their past failures away and find love in a spotless home together?<br /><br />Housekeeping by Kim Fielding is a charming little romance, a happy quick read that is perfect to way to spend some free time over the holidays.  Nicky Hauser and Spencer Cartwright are two quirky and complementary characters, each totally endearing in their own way.  Nicky is somewhat recognizable as that person who has never quite found their way in life.  Not quite emotionally a grownup, too old in years to be a teen, he has managed to go through life without making any real decisions over his future whether it be a profession or even something to be passionate about.  Fielding has made him totally believable, letting us connect with someone lacking direction in life and uncertain how to proceed.  He’s just too nice and gentle, and lacking in ambition.<br /><br />Kim Fielding has crafted Spencer Cartwright  with a different set of issues.  Spencer’s been married, to a woman, before finally admitting his homosexuality.  He’s colorblind, constantly busy, and a total slob.  Clearly his life needs cleaning up and Nicky is just the person to handle the job.  And happily for us, Fields lets her characters turn from employer/employee to friends and finally to lovers, letting us watch as their relationship builds over trips to Ikea and a mixing of friends and relatives.<br /><br />Don’t look for any angst, there isn’t any.  No real highs or lows to be found in this story, just a group of funny, lovely friends and two men looking for love and finding it where they least expected it, at home amongst cleaning supplies.  It’s charming and smile worthy.  I love Kim Fielding’s stories, she rarely lets me down and didn’t with Housekeeping. Consider this definitely recommended.<br /><br />Cover art by Paul Richmond is really very funny, his m/m version of American Gothic.  I loved it.king in ambition.<br /><br />Kim Fielding has crafted Spencer Cartwright  with a different set of issues.  Spencer’s been married, to a woman, before finally admitting his homosexuality.

Just loved the subtle introductions of  the few erotic scenes. Kim Fielding had the right recipe for a sweet romance novella.<br />The story is easy on the emotions and one feels connected with the main characters.<br />Nicky finds himself in a relationship of betrayal and had enough spunk to face the reality of creating partial archs to Tom's infidelity. When he caught Tom doing his thing with Simon, he seems to dissociate from what he has walked in on and as if in a trance went to work (in Tom' s restaurant) dealing with a bunch of crappy customers and feeling off-kilter. His clients' miserable behaviour led to an accident, and he finally left the restaurant to go to the home he shared with Tom. It finally dawned on him that Tom was not the faithful and honest type, packed his bags and embarked on a stay with friends. Feeling that at 29 he has no direction in life and could never decide on what career to enter, his friends Bavir and Evan got him a house sitting gig that got him honing into his cleaning skills. Whilst in a coffee shop with Evan and Bavir,he saw this gorgeous man so focussed on his laptop frowning ever so often. His concentration led to an accident with coffee spilling everywhere staining his shirt. The accident was rather unwelcome as he was preparing for a meeting. Nicky came to the rescue and noticed the guy was wearing unmatched socks. The guy admitted to being colour blind any Nicky ends up giving him advice.To cut a long story short, Destiny could not but extend an olive branch to the now homeless Nicky...",2013-12-28

He is at an all-time-low when his boyfriend cheats on him and he loses his job and house. He gets back on his feet with house sitting. Much later in the story, when Nicky has built a reputation among rich house owners as a house sitter, he gets together with Spencer. However, he is still too jaded because of his previous boyfriend, Tom, to try for a new relationship with Spencer.<br /><br />Tom actually plays a big part in the story. However, the character is not fully developed. We don't know his side of the story regarding his past relationship with Nicky. The character himself is not really important but his role as the ex is critical and so he's mentioned a lot. I feel that if a character gets referenced a lot in the story, it's worthwhile to make the character three-dimensional with his own back-story.<br /><br />I love that these are very ordinary characters with ordinary lives. Nicky is a very realistic character that many people can relate to. He struggles to find a direction in life and a career path. He has simple interests but none of them are extraordinary talents. Spencer doesn't stand out either. He's an all-around nice guy, but the story doesn't give a lot of his background info. There's not a lot of heavy feelings or drama in the book even though there could have been. It's a slow, romantic build up of Spencer and Nicky's relationship, which makes this story a cute fluffy read.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sweet, romantic, short story that's a bit out of the norm with little character development but is still wonderful to read on a slow day.<br /><br />*review copy received in exchange for an honest review*",2013-12-01
