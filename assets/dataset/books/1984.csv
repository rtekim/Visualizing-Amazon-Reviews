There's a guy, Winston, who's beginning to question the new order.  English socialism (IngSoc) has become the wool over the public's eyes so they may not see the truth about the ruling class and the constant state of &#34;war&#34;.  Language is being dismantled and replaced by NewSpeak, which is the ultimate imposition of the totalitarian ruling class.  Conversation becomes relegated to terms such as &#34;ungood&#34;, or doubleplusgood (excellent), sexcrime, goodest or gooder, etc.  The point is to remove thoughtfulness and meaning and to further implicate individuality as a subversive attempt against the ruling class.  Citizens are provided meager resources, such as stale rations of cigarettes or liberty vodka, tokens of the overarching govt that go nicely with the in house monitors through which Big Brother watches, at all times, even in the morning during mandatory mass calisthenics.  People are allowed anger once a week during the 2 minutes hate in which the enemy of the state is broadcast, as though he has stolen the airwaves and wishes to impart hope to an otherwise hopeless populace.  Winston meets a girl, goes with her places the upper class is not allowed, and bad things happen.  He mingles with the idiotic proles who are nothing if not helpless products of the new order, relegated to poverty and a war torn infrastructure.  Winston works in what could only be called the department of news, where he takes old newspaper articles and changes them to reflect the whims of the govt.  In effect, he changes the past, so that it reconciles with the new present that has been made up on an whim.<br /><br />This kind of story is all too familiar and often times it seems as though it is playing out right before our very eyes if in the most subtle ways.

Winston, the protagonist, lives his habitually boring life in the hopes he will find a person whom shares his belief towards society.<br /> The society Winston lives in is run by the Party and ultimately “Big Brother”. The citizens are constantly monitored and taught to destroy individual thought. The details used by Orwell in describing the tactics of the Party to control society is not only knowledgeable, but also interesting. Orwell’s details create an altogether cohesive society with the main goal of total control.<br /> Winston’s role in society is a worker in the Party’s Ministry of Truth. This section of society deals with the history of society, which is constantly altered. Most citizens seem to be oblivious; however, Winston questions the validity of society’s historical truths. Orwell’s character development of Winston as analytical and doubtful, drive me to question the honorability of the society which I live in today.<br /> Later in the novel, Winston is faced with difficult decisions based on trust and intuition. These choices will either help or hurt him in his fight to change the corrupt society he lives in. Winston must trust his instincts in order to begin change in the society.

Our guide to this world is Winston Smith, a member of The Party who works at the Ministry of Truth making sure that all documents conform to The Party line.  And in this socialist vision of the world, The Party, as embodied by Big Brother, is all powerful.<br /><br />However, Winston is old enough to have vague memories of life before The Party took over England.  While he outwardly tows the line, he is hoping that at some point The Party can be overthrown.  As he starts a forbidden affair with Julia, it looks like his hopes might come to be.  Do they have hope of overthrowing the government?  Or is Big Brother really all powerful?<br /><br />I know I read this book back in high school, but that was a few years ago, so I decided it was time to read it again.

My review is for the unabridged audio CD, skillfully read by Simon Prebble. Orwell describes a dystopian society in the country of Oceania, in which war is permanent, government surveillance is widespread, individualism and all forms of self expression are suppressed, and &#34;big brother&#34; is watching. Though this novel has been on every &#34;Top 100&#34; reading list as well as high school and college curriculums for decades, somehow I had put off reading it until now. I was quite surprised at how relevant it still is, ensuring that it will remain on required reading lists for many decades to come.<br /><br />The main character, Winston Smith, works at the Ministry of Truth, as part of a team that is constantly rewriting history to suit the purposes of the current party line. No one is sure who &#34;big brother&#34; really is, or even if such a person exists. Citizens are constantly programmed with &#34;double think&#34; phrases such as &#34;Ignorance is strength&#34;, &#34;war is peace&#34;, and &#34;freedom is slavery&#34;. They fear the thought police who will punish them severely for not adhering to party teachings, even in their thoughts. Society is plagued by constant shortages, scarcity and hardships, primarily due to constant wars. The Machine believes in constant warfare to get rid of materials that might make the masses comfortable and complacent. The Party's main purpose is to mold the consciousness of the masses, and was described at one point as a &#34;boot stamping on a human face.&#34;<br /><br />The themes of nationalism, censorship and surveillance are just as relevant today as they were over 60 years ago, ensuring that this novel will remain in the forefront of literature for a long time to come.

Therefore, when choosing the year for his dystopian future, he flipped the final two numbers to create 1984. There are so many interesting science fiction ideas developed by Orwell (the Thought Police and Telescreens, just to name a couple).<br /><br />One warning for readers, though. This book isn’t immediately accessible. You need to stick with it, and plow through some of the parts that seem to be dragging on.

Winston works in The Ministry of Truth as a person who alters the history of the world. But one day, Winston meets up with a lady named Julia and they commit their lives to the Brotherhood, an anti-government group. It goes well for Winston and Julia, until they become outlaws wanted by the Party.<br /><br />1984 is an excellent book. The author of Animal Farm and this novel,George Orwell created a thrilling and intense story. He creates a feeling to the reader that something is wrong with this \\""government\\"". The government in Winston's society doesn't want people to know about the past.If they do, they may rebel. So, in response, they alter the present so Winston's government can look to them as superior. In effect, citizens of \\""Oceania\\"", where Winston lives, are completely oblivious to what really has happened in the past. Moreover, the government wants people to know what they're doing so that they don't rebel. For example, there are laws against \\""thoughtcrime\\"". \\""Thoughtcrime\\"" is a crime committed in your thoughts like having hatred for the Party, but in secret. Another example of this is the government sets up cameras and microphones everywhere so they can bust people for \\""thoughtcrime\\"". One of the goals of Winston's government is to take over the world and enforce their law around the world. The man at the top of all of this is Big Brother. He's the supreme ruler of Oceania. He's the one in charge of everything; the Party, the agencies and his people. While living in this world, Winston learns of the Brotherhood, an anti-Party agency. he decides to join this agency because he feels that something is wrong about his government and he wants to change it and give everybody their freedoms back.<br /><br />When 1984 was first published in 1949, it generally got excellent reviews. Some of these reviews came from V.S. Pritchett, P.H. Newby, and Bertrand Russell. But a negative review ofthe book came from Edward Shanks, a book reviewer for the Sunday Times. Shanks claimed that 1984 \\""Breaks all records for gloomy vaccination\\"". I do not agree with Shanks's review of 1984. I think it's a great book with a lot of adventure, suspense, and action. So all in all, it's a great book and I encourage everybody to read it.",2015-01-11

TV  screens also allow the government officials spy on the  residents  around the clock. The government vaporizes people of their choosing for the reasons of their own by executing them and erasing any records indicating they once had existed. Also all the records including newspapers or TV broadcast scripts are rewritten in accordance with the reality of the present.

I had always been curious about cults, mind control, etc. So awhile back I picked up a book entitled \\""Raven\\"" about Jim Jones. As I was reading, I found myself stupefied with my mouth hanging open like a idiot. How is this possible? What strange psychological techniques are involved? I subsequently bought and read every psychological book on mind control I could find. Now, with my own informal education, I think I have a good grasp of the phenomenon.<br /><br />#2. The recent exposure of the activities of the IRS in targeting conservative groups. I thought, this is an obvious totalitarian tactic: \\""Silence the Opposition.\\"" But why has this not resulted in outrage (unlike Watergate)? How can we accept, with complacency, a brazen attempt at domination? Have we all forgotten the essential principals America was founded on? I subsequently bought and read every major book on totalitarian states I could find, in an attempt to understand how the IRS affair was largely ignored by the populace.<br /><br />Since a vast majority of these books refer to Orwell's 1984, I figured a fictional, fantasy account would add to my understanding of both these strange phenomenon. My supposition was correct. What many of my formal, technical books do not do (rightly so), is express the human experience with emotional impact...love, tragedy, denial, anger, etc.<br /><br />The genius of this book is how it expresses the individual human experience of living is a totalitarian world.<br />The frightening part of this book is that it could easily come true. The methods of control described are very real. Obviously used in Nazi Germany and the USSR. In fact, the whole story of 1984 may be taking place right now, IN THE REAL WORLD of North Korea!<br /><br />The cult/mind control aspect showed me the methods, the IRS affair showed me how easily a totalitarian state can begin, and 1984 put it all togetherin a humanistic, thought provoking story. If this book doesn't turn you into a libertarian, or at least get you thinking about it.....nothing will.<br /><br />Update: After reading this one, I highly recommend \\""We The Living\\"" by Ayn Rand for a more realistic and equally thought-provoking read.",2013-12-29

He presses home, paragraph after paragraph, page after page, with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, the future we would face were we to permit Big Brother to become a reality. I have not checked school curricullums lately, to see if this book is on the required reading list - but if not, that is a fatal error because 1984 is a manual, a text book for the anti-Christ of freedom - and required education for anyone living in a society which is edging towards ultra-surveillance, such as our own.

His Homage to Catalonia (1938) sounded an early warning about the nature of the Soviet Communists in its depiction of how they attempted to subvert the Spanish Republican government even at the cost of helping the fascists in the short term. Animal Farm (1945) was a dissection of how the idealistic Russian revolution was co-opted by Stalinist totalitarians. Then came 1984, Orwell's culminating work, published just before his death of tuberculosis in early 1950.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I also think that his impending death impelled Orwell to run off the rails a bit in his dystopian vision. While the first part of the book is brilliant in its depiction of a society controlled and manipulated by an all-powerful state—read The Gulag Archipelago to see just how closely Orwell's fictional Oceania tracks the real-world Soviet state under Stalin—the second part following Winston Smith's arrest goes way overboard as Orwell seek to make a philosophical point about the subjection of the total man and also gross out readers as much as possible about just how horrible a world he can create. But to achieve this, Orwell has to sacrifice the integrity of his story.<br /><br />The whole premise of the first part was to give readers a disturbingly plausible vision of how a populace can be made to submit and acquiesce to its servitude to the state. The perpetual surveillance through the two-way video screens (creepily analogous to GPS trackers in today's electronic gadgets), the never-ending happy-talk propaganda, the bread-and-circuses mollification of the &#34;proles&#34; (what we today call &#34;low information voters&#34; in a delicious bit of real-life newspeak) and the realization that the best way to control a population is to keep them hopped up on a crusade in which &#34;we're all in it together&#34; (which is why governments today are eternally declaring &#34;war&#34; on everything from drugs to iliteracy)—all brilliant and brilliantly depicted.<br /><br />But then Winston Smith gets arrested and the verisimilitude vanishes. First of all, the whole idea that a police state would bother to make sexual indiscretion a capital crime is ridiculous (unless it has a theological basis such as in Medieval Christianity or modern Iran). Yes, I get it that it highlights Orwell's argument that a totalitarian state seeks to destroy everything human or individual in its subjects, but I think Aldous Huxley was on a much sounder ground in Brave New World where promiscuity was not only legal but encouraged. If you want to devastate the individual/spiritual integrity of a populace, it's better to turn them into beasts thant monks.<br /><br />But my biggest criticism is how the narrative runs aground during O'Brien's ongoing interrogation and torture of Smith. For this to be plausible, we have to believe that this high muckety-muck in the Oceania hierarchy would have spent the last seven years minutely tracking the activities of a mid-level worker drone, and then spent considerable state resources to capture and torture this individual over an extended period. And for what? So that he can destroy &#34;the last man&#34; as Smith is unconvincingly termed? The conclusion to be drawn seems to be that once the last independent thinker is snuffed out, there won't be any more of them. If only, says ever tyrant in history. Frankly, O'Brian comes off as an obsessive loon and if I were Big Brother, I would seriously consider getting him off the payroll for pursuing a private agenda with state resources. Who knows what he'll fixate on next.<br /><br />Yes, I understand that Orwell's point was to show as brutally as possible the stamping out of individualism, but he could have saved the tedious lectures O'Brien (and Emanuel Goldstein through the extended excerpts from his book) foists on poor Smith (and the reader) and simply continued to show life in Oceania. That to me was by far the most compelling part ofthis book.",2013-12-02

He lives in a city that is surrounded by a green wall and in a society where people have no names, just numbers, and follow a strict schedule for work, sleep, leisure activities, and even sex. The journal explains who he is, his daily schedule, and eventually gives a detailed account of his inner thoughts as he wrestles with the idea that all is not as it appears with the world. All this begins when he meets I-303 for the first time. (That is all I will say - no spoilers here.)<br /><br />\\""1984\\"" centers around one character, Winston.  Winston is living in the UK which is under the control of BIG BROTHER.  In this society, one must do, think, say, and appear as if they believe and follow what BIG BROTHER wants.

Fellow citizens look for small changes in your face or activities that might be evidence of \\""thought crimes.\\""  In this society, one must only think it to be convicted of the crime.  As Winston lives his life, he hides a secret from everyone hoping one day to find others who do not agree with the doings of the \\""Party.\\""  He meets a woman, and they embark on a journey to find the underground resistance that is against BIG BROTHER.

But at what price?  It was a good plot, though at times it moved a bit slow, and in many parts it was told in lecture as opposed to character discovery or dialogue.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - Winston is the nervous lead, gingerly stepping into more and more truth and danger.  Julia is the rambunctious female interest who boldly yanks him forward.  The two leads were good vehicles to push the plot, but neither was particularly memorable.<br /><br />3) Theme (5 stars) - This is the classic exploration of life under a modern police state, of what happens when people's fears cause them to give up their freedoms, and how those in power will continue to manipulate those fears to retain power.  It successfully predicted Eastern Europe under the Soviet empire, Mao's Cultural Revolution, and modern day North Korea.  Some like to also hold it up as an example of where the US is heading, but I find that connection a bit more tenuous.  Certainly the technology now exists to create much of the surveillance and data manipulation apparatus described in the book, but in Western countries like the US that same technology has been democratized, spread into the hands of the many, a counterbalancing phenomenon that was not prognosticated nor explored in the book.<br /><br />4) Voice (3 stars) - The prose was fine, but I didn't mark any sentences as particularly poetic, beautiful, or insightful.  Also, I found certain sections to be a bit \\""lecturey.\\""<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - Orwell successfully transported me into the mood of this dystopia--the greyness, the shuffling hunchback people nervously checking over their shoulders, the hopelessness of being trapped under the thumb of Big Brother.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - I'd recommend 1984 for the exploration of the dangers of the police state and the darkfeeling of dystopia, though I wished there was more to the plot and characters.",2013-08-25

As my friend Ben said recently about Animal farm, \\""The book is good in what it is about but those damn pigs made me so mad.\\"" Yup, ditto Ben. I felt 1984 had some interesting ideas and although for something like that to really happen is extreme, sometimes making something extreme brings out a point. Left unchecked the Government could easily absorb more responsibilities and when the Government starts fearing its own people, maybe there is some cause for concern. I feel this book is even more relevant with recent events coming to light about the NSA and Government spying, not just on its own inhabitants but the world as well. So how do we fight government take over and maintaining our individuality? The answer is simple, by reading books and having sex.

By the year 1989, Orwell's novel had been translated into 65 different languages, more than any other English-language novel at that time.  Throughout it's entire publication history it has been either banned or legally challenged somewhere in the world.  In 2005, Time magazine listed it in its \\""100 best English-language novels from 1923-2005.\\""  It was also listed at number 6 in the \\""Modern Library 100 Best Novels.\\""<br /><br />1984 follows the life of Winston Smith as he struggles to conform.  We get a first-hand look at the fear and distrust that rules his every thought and action.  Reading 1984 will definitely help you to appreciate your own situation, no matter how bad it may seem.  And if you're unclear on just exactly what a dystopian novel is, this is it.  This is the book that defines the genre.<br /><br />Frank Muller is one of my very favorite audiobook narrators, and a perfect fit for 1984.  His grit and solemnity serve to augment the funerary feel of the audiobook.  Muller has been a stage and television actor, but is most famous for his audiobook narration having narrated hundreds of novels.  He died in 2008 after many years of complications from a motorcycle accident in 2001.<br /><br />I think everyone should read 1984 at least once, and that time you were forced to read it in school doesn't count.

What shocked me was the accuracy with which Orwell predicted government intrusion into daily life....in 1948!!!  Orwell imagines people sitting in front of screens every day that monitor their daily activity.  He sees the ability to track and listen-in on people on the move as another tool in the pocket of the government.  Through our smartphones and computers, the government today has intruded into almost every aspect of our lives.<br /><br />There are some further parallels can be drawn as well.  Orwell saw one factor in the political decline as the loss of \\""external reality,\\"" namely that reality is objective and observable.  Such a concrete philosophical notion of reality has been replaced by the current postmodern subjective reality where 2+2 *can* equal 5, if that's what I think it equals.  In today's society where there is no sin or goodness but in what you determine to be such, there is but one small step towards an Orwellian society.  If the locus of what determines reality shifts from the person to the state.  And perhaps much of this has already happened behind our backs.  Because most of us have lost our notions of objective external reality through the public education system of our nation.<br /><br />And then there's the issue of history.  In an age where we're moving more and more towards reliance on cloud-based electronic mediums, erasure of history is truly only a keystroke away.  Oral traditions and histories have been exchanged for written ones.  Written ones have been exchanged for electronic ones.  And the end result is that most in our society knows less about history than ever.  Contrary to Emerson and other writers and thinkers who have seen history (and living in light of history) as weak or sub-human, Orwell sees history in its rightful primacy.  If we don't understand the past, we can't possibly understand the present.  The richness of history leads us to the greatness of religion, the beauty of art, and the heights of science.  Ignoring history leads only to self-destruction, enslavement, and loss of beauty.<br /><br />I would suggest pairing this read with Huxley's equally dystopian \\""A Brave New World\\"" for maximum effect.  Readers should be advised that there are several depictions of sex and torture in some sections of this book.  The literary and historical significance of the work, however, makes it worth reading for the discerning adult.<br /><br />Let me close this review by saying that this book doesn't leave me as doom and gloom as I suppose it has left many other readers.  While I believe that man is capable of great evil like that portrayed in the book, I believe that things are not meant to be the way they are.  In spite of our notions of a subjective reality, the effects of self-serving politicians, poverty, famine, war, greed and so on strike us all as wrong because they really are fundamentally wrong.  We long for wrongs to be made right and for an objective, external reality that we can hang on to.  And nothing can take that feeling out of us.  Even if someone could use our deepest fears against us, we still cannot repress that testimony.  And it is because I know that the world is broken (as Orwell warns), I know it can be fixed.The richness of history leads us to the greatness of religion, the beauty of art, and the heights of science.

This is a very depressing book and I might even add that if your personal life is not going that great at the moment, please refrain from reading this book altogether! That is not a joke. 1984 is as dark as it can get and I have personally never read anything quite like it. However, I promise you that this book will get you thinking a lot not only about our present times but also what could happen in the far away future. This gem of a story is truly frightening in a way that I have never felt before either for a book read or movie watched. If you are tired of the usual horror flicks that employ the same scare tactics over and over again in hopes of making you jump out of your seat, then I dare you to read 1984 to experience a different kind of horror that affects a deeper part of your mind! I promise you that 1984 will leave a big impression in your lives well after you having finished with it.<br /><br />In 1984, we step into the shoes of Winston Smith. Winston is like any other person living in a country where  the Party is constantly watching your every move through telescreens and microphones. To survive in this new era, total submission to the Party's ways is an absolute must. Think and act any differently and you'll find yourself vaporized without any hint at all that you actually did existed. The problem with George is that his memory keeps him from being a total submissive person in this totalitarian government. As a reader, you're bound to have questions such as how did this government come to be? Were things always this way? Is life better now than it was decades ago? Well, please step inside the mind of Winston where even thinking of these questions are bound to get you vaporized if you aren't careful in controlling your emotions. If you've heard of the phrase that Big Brother is Watching You! at some point or another pointing to conspiracies about the government monitoring your every move be it cell phone conversations or Internet access, then be glad that you picked up 1984 because that is where the idea most likely originated from!<br /><br />1984 starts off very slow and the author repeats many things throughout but once you start hitting that halfway point, get ready for a literal mind takeover from the author. I kept saying earlier that this book is horrifying in a special kind of way and if you actually picture yourself in Winston's position and picture in your head the things that he sees and witnesses, I'm sure you'll be scared as well. Better yet, picture your own self in Winston's place. Imagine having to live in a government similar to that of 1984. The beauty of portraying Winston to the readers is that we can all relate to him in one way or another. We like to sometimes think to ourselves that we are somehow \\""special\\"". In 1984 however, you're no different than anyone else because the government tells you so. At first, you'll likely have a lot of questions and wonder how other humans cope with the whole situation. This is where things get interesting as you learn about the Party and its purpose.<br /><br />It's definitely fascinating to learn that George Orwell published 1984 in 1949. Mr. Orwell is definitely who you would consider \\""ahead of his time\\"" and 1984 proves that. For his story to still have some impact in today's society is amazing, especially to conspiracists.

No one has access to privacy in any shape or form.<br />After September 11th, created by the mainstream media through the use of fake actors, it got easier for the mainstream media to convince people that the world is much less safe than it is, and therefore not the U.S. Federal Government.<br />Both Orwell and Huxley are believed to have been Fabian Society members and the story goes that is where they got their ideas from.

Yet you're conditioned to believe that the people who orchestrated 1984, the Orwellian State and 9 - 11 are Federal Government Officials, when it appears to me to be the case, they're fake actors posing as feds. The idea was to condition people to believe that they were not powerful enough to resist against this. But as vast numbers of people kept resisting, the more the curtains behind what they called the NWO in the old days, kept collapsing and have since continued to collapse. The Surveillance State, or the Orwellian State, is there, and the people who are responsible for it's creation, got forced to confront the reality that, if they want to go to a war on terror, all they've got to confront to find the terrorists, is a mirror. In light of this, it is not surprising that people are becoming increasingly convinced that the Republic and Democrat Parties and the Tea Party might face overwhelming collapse in the near future. People want a different reality, and different world to experience and I agree with them. They have got every right to stop having to relieve 1984 every day.

Orwell was an egalitarian socialist who believed there was room for individualism, while warning about the Stalinist form of socialism. He hated central planning and oligarchical privilege. He recognized that collectivism compounds bondage and government power. He found hope in the proletariat, rather than the bourgeoisie..<br /><br />Unlike the allegorical 'Animal Farm' there is no humor in this very serious parody of what the author saw in English centered world politics in 1948. He saw atomic weapons, developments in the USSR and UK socialism spreading to America. He saw continued rationing after war's end as government control of living standards. Today it's controlled inflation that serves the same purpose.<br /><br />Orwell hated suppression of individualism, central planning and the collective oligarchy of either business or politics. His protagonist, Winston Smith, named after Churchill, has doubts and pangs of conscience and memory as he struggles to retrieve aspects of individualism and love in the dystopian world order of rule of the Party. It's an unusual character analysis as Winston's changes in outlook are not willful, being motivated by his subconscious or by coercion. Doubts intrude into Winston's suppressed memory in the forms of a surviving dairy of past memories and a photograph of a past forgotten event. His dreams and his bathroom are the only agendas immune from Party scrutiny. In the 1984 world order all capitalists (bourgeoisie) are gone. Their place as the middle class has been taken by Winston's small class of outer party functionaries.<br /><br />As a psychologist and linguist, Orwell cleverly incorporates concepts of double think and Newspeak into the novel. History can be changed. Reality is what the Party says it is.<br />Today we can substitute Amsoc for Ingsoc. It's likely that one partyrule is here to stay. England went socialist in 1945. The USA followed 20 years later. Minor reversions in each local appear to have failed. World divisions are tending toward Orwell's concept of 3 groupings with parts of Africa as a no-man's land. So far the groupings are economic more than political. George Washington preceded Orwell in predicting a 'United States of Europe.'<br />The current world order is very similar to Orwell's idea in spite of the Soviet breakup.<br />Instead of war being used as a means of holding down living standards, our present government uses economic means including fiscal and tax policy with currency degradation and controlled inflation to maintain a death grip on our economy. Did Orwell hope that we would heed his warning? The possibility is growing more and more remote.<br /><br />Today we see Orwellian doublethink in the “balanced” approach to debt reduction, in “bipartisanship” and especially in the claim of a “centralist” political position. Other examples of doublethink abound. Social security is savings. Control is regulation. Pork is infrastructure.<br />Education is investment. Credit and debt as money is an especially virulent doublethink.<br />We have triplethink (global warming will lead to another ice age, taxation of health care benefits is a choice) and circlethink (we owe it to ourselves).<br /><br />Individual memory is suspect as psychologists and lawyers lose no opportunity to tell us.<br />Hate is necessary to focus popular opinion in the proper directions. Oceanans hate Eurasia, or Eastasia, and the long gone Emanuel Goldstein, capitalists and kings. The heavy note of pessimism predicts the inevitable triumph of the collective oligarchy. Individual freedom is doomed. Only doublethink saves individual freedom. History has been changed. The federalism of our founders has morphed into love of big government. Our Bill of Rights is now a mandate for federal protection. Thoughtless politically motivated hate is rampant. Today we hate the rich, obese kids, imagined monopolists, tea party obstructionists, the electoral college, British Petroleum and warming deniers. We hate Iran, deflation, hedge funds, short sellers, and even Wall Street, that symbol of wicked capitalism.<br /><br />To qualify as literature the work is chock full of symbolism culminating in the smashing of the coral paperweight signifying final loss of hope. Nursery rhymes in song predict betrayal so that Winston and his love Julia eventually betray each other under State sponsored therapy administered at the Ministry of Truth. Big Brother parodies Stalin and Emanuel Goldstein parodies Trotsky, dead since 1940, but still an object of hate in 1948. The Golden Country of Winston's dreams signifies sexual freedom and freedom from observation. Chocolates signify a survival instinct in Winston's past with luxury for party members only. Rats involve psychology in place of torture. Music is used for control of the prole's emotions, as a war economy is used to suppress living standards. A single strong looking woman symbolizes Orwell's hopes for a proletarian future.<br /><br />This is the world's last intelligent socialist writing about the world's last individualist.  (Harry Hopkins died in 1946.)  It's all very familiar and very real with regulation by the ministries of Truth, Love, Peace and Plenty, although we have many more today. There is great derogation of individualism in favor of collectivist patriotism. We see Party perks from retirement pensions and health care to free checking accounts. Pushing out of the middle class is accelerating along with animus against capitalists. Government has been substituted for country making for doublethink in the difficulty of loving one's country while hating our government. What formerly was patriotism is fast becoming the new way of saying “I Love Big Brother.”<br /><br />Animal Farm by George Orwell<br /><br />Like '1984', 'Animal Farm' depicts the perversions of a centralized economy. Orwell was that rare socialist who sees things the way they are. I see Orwell along with Harry Hopkins as the last smart socialists (read communists). Allegorical details of the book have been well depicted elsewhere so that the interesting exercise is to draw parallels to apply Orwell's lessons to present day politics. I find the book more like 'Wizard of Oz' than any other allegory although 'Gulliver's Travels' could serve as a model. Old Major could represent W.J. Bryon, whose financial ideals, a failure in their day, we hold firmly in thrall or J.M. Keynes whose economic ideals liberals pretend to follow. This extremely clever beautifully written political allegorical is called a fairy story rather than a fable because it lacks as pithy a moral as those provided by Aesop.<br /><br />The details show impressive familiarity with Soviet history. There's every historical event from the Kronstat revolt to Stalin's purges to foreign agreements on trade and war. There are the Windmill attempts to rebuild the soviet economy with 5 year plans. Despite the extensive history lesson a lot is missing, including the Russo-Japanese War, the revolutions of 1905 and February 1917, Kerensky and the Provisional Government, Menshevik opposition, the murder of royal family at Ekaterinburg, extensive forced land redistribution, the Spanish civil war and the Hitler pact. We can only speculate on whether the omissions would have made for too complex a fairy story or whether Orwell had a deeper motive. 'A People's Tragedy' Orlando Figes's great history of the Russian Revolution takes over 800 pages and that one runs only to the death of Lenin in 1924.<br /><br />Perhaps unintentionally, 'Animal Farm' illustrates other problems with socialism, lack of initiative and motivation, mentality of dependency, a modern version entitlement mentality. Today there is dependency on government for planning everything from environment to meals. It's clear that the barbs are directed at socialists, particularly in Russia, not socialism in general. The polemics of egalitarian central planning has now become synonymous with socialism. It's not clear whether Orwell recognizes that central planning is indistinguishable from totalitarianism. Although AF was written too early for Orwell to have seen failures in Russia, India, South America, Cuba, Africa and most of all the USA, Orwell was well aware that the Nazi rise to power was a reaction to the failure of Weimar socialism in Germany.<br /><br />The black raven, Moses, emblematic of religion and bureaucracy, does no useful work as the pigs take all the economic surplus. While I'm familiar with the now stale metaphor of 'opium of the masses,' it's the first time I've seen it described in the sense of government coercion. Shades of the 'under God' clause in the 'Pledge of Allegiance.'<br /><br />Besides his talent for allegory and political analysis, a major attribute of 'Animal Farm' is Orwell's precise use of language. It's difficult to analyze because the main charm is in what Orwell doesn't write. He eschews use of idiom, jargon or metaphors. He's entirely original. For example an amateur reviewer like myself might be tempted to say (pun intended) that the pigs lived high off the hog. Although such cutesy language appears to be very popular in modern best sellers. if that had been Orwell's style he would be long forgotten. Today's newspaper contains the inane simile “literally a ticking time bomb.” I have Orwell to thank for sensitivity to this style of vague popularism. Read his fine essay 'Politics and the English Language.' Ironically, Orwellian terms like “big brother” have found their way into the English language. He wouldn't use his own idioms.<br /><br />Since the allegory and fable has been extensively reviewed in the last 65 years, I'll content myself with a bit of speculation on what Orwell might have thought about current US socialism. 'Animal Farm' depicts a gullible public believing political media generated spin war and peace even to denial when proven false. The distortions still resonate. Pravda spinner Squealer is typified by political mouthpieces. I'll refrain from naming them. Orwell allocates equal blame to Whymper for buying and Napoleon for selling. Our media blames corporations for buying influence attaching no responsibility to the government bureaucracy for influence being for sale. Deception of the populace and scapegoating is developed with the purported goal of equality, albeit without totalitarianism. The book ends with pigs indistinguishable from repressive humans.<br /><br />Even though violent totalitarianism is lacking, the reader can draw many parallels to today's government. Much of the value of reading Orwell lies in reader's ability to draw parallels with the present time. After all part of his purpose was to warn that it could happen here. Orwell would certainly approve of President Obama, who implements socialism without violence in contravention to Lenin who said it couldn't be done. I've taken the liberty of drawing a few parallels between 'Animal Farm' and our present administration.

The story is told from Winston’s perspective as he falls in love with Julia, which is forbidden as all devotion must be reserved to the Party.  He also has an unusually warm relationship with an Inner Party member by the name of O’Brien who turns out to be Winston’s ultimate antagonist as he represents the Party in his every action.  The reason that this book is such a timely piece of literature for today is that the world around us is going through dramatic changes in its structure.  None of us could know where this cycle will lead, but Orwell provides us with a nightmare of where the tide of history and government could come to rest and how an average man may live and feel under such conditions.<br />While this does not naturally appear as a love story, it does actually take an important look at a dark side of love and devotion.  The Party demands more than absolute obedience; it demands the love of every subject.  Even to the degree that no other love interest can be maintained.  It is a very religious theme, similar to what you might hear during a Sunday morning sermon or straight from the Bible, “Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me [Jesus] is not worthy of Me” (Matthew 10:37, New International Version).  Winston’s love for Julia is ultimately the reason that Winston is tortured mercilessly and his love for her is what is used to finally break his will at the climax of his incarceration in the Ministry of Love.<br />Winston also maintains a curious relationship with the stories antagonist, O’Brien, throughout the story.  Early in the story, the two of them share a glance which indicates to Winston that they have similar interests regarding the overthrow of the current system. As it turns out, O’Brien has been working throughout the book to entrap him and presumably anyone else who might be caught up in ideas of overthrow.  He is ultimately Winston’s interrogator, torturer and re-educator.  However, even as he is being horribly tortured, Winston continues to hold a very high regard for O’Brien as he notes, “The peculiar reverence for O’Brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy, flooded Winston’s hear again” (Orwell, 1949, p. 225).  Winston would go on to betray Julia, but would never lose his admiration for O’Brien.<br />Orwell’s story takes the idea of “big government” to its most extreme conclusion.  The story is particularly timely in a day when our own nation has clearly voted in recent months for a larger, more intrusive federal government.  America has shifted over the years from larger to smaller, less regulated government and back again throughout our history.  However, it is interesting that Orwell gives an idea of how one party was able to stop the pendulum from swinging by ensuring that average people were stopped from obtaining wealth.  Orwell (1949) uses the following passage to describe the process used to obtain total control of the society: “It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste…In the long run, a hierarchal society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance” (p. 156).<br />In the end, Winston is a beaten man who has failed to stand up to the power of Big Brother in any way.  His character represents the limitations of the individual against an all powerful government.  His mind is coerced and his love confused.  The Party has done with him as it has with all others and will continue to do.  And the story concludes with no hope for a positive resolution.  This is a story which should be read by everyone to ensure an understanding of the evil capable of a powerful government.<br /><br />REFERENCE:<br /><br />Orwell, G.

With that in mind I recently re-read this classic and was shocked and appalled how much of George Orwells dark and dreary vision has become a reality in our lives since my high school days.<br /><br />Winston the protagonist in this book is a low level party grunt working at the Ministry of Truth in a fictional London dedicated to scrub history books and records of inconvenient facts, such as who we are at war with and why to streamline history into lockstep with the ever changing party line. Orwell foresees technology that for his day was in its infancy and describes how this technology can be used to oppress people and that whoever controls the past will control the future (and present).<br /><br />Orwell Imagines a world in which every home has a two way 'television', that is used inbound to disseminate propaganda while at the same time allowing the thought police to check up on its citizens. Virtually every inch of his imaginary world is covered in listening and spying devices and even small deviations from the norm carry the death penalty. Winston's crime is to keep a journal to record his own version of history, this will ultimately bring down the thought police on him, who (SPOILER) captures, tortures and kills him, but not before breaking his spirit and making him love big brother and his henchman.<br /><br />The most striking thing about this book is that we can see almost all of Orwells more imaginative concepts come to life in our modern day society, not necessarily exactly the way the author envisioned them, but in a more subtle but no less disturbing way. One can't help to draw parallels between Orwells concept of thought crime and the political correctness movement that is doing its best - and succeeding in - making certain words unspeakable and by extension certain thoughts unthinkable. It's chilling to read a news article on how interest groups trying to change Mark Twains classic to strike a specific word from the book for school versions where it is appropriate in both the text as the context of the time it was written. The ministry of truth resides not as a specific location it rather resides with special interest groups fighting to revise history.<br /><br />The Internet - obviously unimaginable at the time - serves as a close and even more powerful parallel to the ever present surveillance in Orwells world, but instead of a government forcing us to be available (and surveillable) we willingly surrender our deepest emotions, private thoughts and actions to social media sites like Facebook and twitter where they are for sale to the highest bidder including our government.<br /><br />9/11 as global watershed moment has served as justification for more and more snooping and warrant less searches while our airports serve as testing ground on how much more privacy intrusion we are willing to take at one point. In the name of 'homeland security' we are living in fear of the boogie man, not Goldstein, but Osama Bin Laden and his band of Islamic terrorist serving as the external threat on which more and more intrusions on our personal freedoms are being justified with.<br /><br />If you ever wonder how a prequel to 1984 would look or how Orwells world got to where it is, turn on your TV and browse the Internet and you will find that you are living it.

Privacy is a major concern now when in the 1980s it was hardly given any mention or great concern. 1984 is about a government worker (Winston) who enjoys his job but starts to have suspicions about what is really going on in the world. The government severely restricts individual freedom, religion, choice of partner (procreation is not particularly encouraged), choice at all, movement and occupation. Winston starts to slip up and slip into the dark side. He knows he will get caught but cannot help himself. Yet Winston dreams the proletariats will rise up to defeat Big Brother. Is there some force in us which cannot be defeated? It is a powerful work that everyone can relate to. George Orwell has been blatantly copied by scores of book and film writers for over 50 years.

Never have I ever read a book so powerful and meaningful. 1984 is a book that transcends time because 1984 will always be pertinent. Orwell created a timeless tale about power, freedom, and social classes. No review I could ever write could do 1984 justice but I shall try.<br /><br />1984 is a dystopian novel complete with action, romance, and politics. I'll be honest here. Normally I don't read serious literature and I hate politics. Reading 1984 was me metaphorically \\""putting on my big boy pants\\"" , it showed how my reading taste matured. Enough about me, this is a review not the Scott show!<br /><br />The plot moves at such a brisk pace and you'll be glued to your seat. Even if you hate politics like my teenage self you will love 1984. Orwell creates political situations that will allure even the most unwilling readers. There are few dull moments in 1984, the majority of whom take place in \\""the book\\"".<br /><br />No 1984 review could ever be complete without mentioning Oceania. Oceania is the totalitarian society in which 1984 takes place and I know where I'm not going on vacation. Oceania makes Panem look like a walk in the park and it is far more horrible than I expected. No sane person could go live there without going insane because it's a living hell. Orwell really created the perfect hell-hole for his masterpiece and it's mindblowing.<br /><br />I really loved how Orwell created his own language \\""Newspeak\\"" for 1984. Newspeak added an interesting feel to the novel because it further the novel's themes and motifs. I really wonder if aficionados of 1984 speak Newspeak like trekkies speak Klingon and LOTR fans speak Elvish. Orwell definitely spent a lot of time coming up with Newspeak and I do appreciate his efforts.<br /><br />1984 is a haunting novel that once you read it, it will stay with you forever. I won't ever be able to forget the horrifying Part III because how powerful and moving it was. 1984 is a novel that will make you question yourself and society. The best kind of books make you think even after you finish and such is the case with Orwell's masterpiece. The 3rd person narration instead of hindering the pacing, it enhances it by adding more emotional depth to the book.<br /><br />1984 is a novel that will give you new perspectives on people, society, and law. Is Ignorance really bliss? Is lying okay if it's for the greater good? Is the needs of the many more important than the needs of the few? I can tell why 1984 is considered classic literature and I hope it continues to be read for it's important messages. Even if 1984 doesn't seem like your thing, I'd still recommend giving it a shot. 1984 has given me a reason to pick up Animal Farm and I hope I enjoy it as much as I enjoyed 1984.be able to forget the horrifying Part III because how powerful and moving it was. 1984 is a novel that will make you question yourself and society.

Take his \\""telescreen\\"" for instance, which closely mirrors our giant-screen TVs today and soon-to-be two-way viewing technology that we enjoy with our computers. The little helicopters buzzing around spying on everyone could just as easily be drones and satellites today.<br />And take the ever-changing alliances between the United States, Russia and China -- which could easily be called Eurasia, Eastasia and Oceania. There's always a war somewhere and when you turn on what passes for news today and it's all double-talk spin -- not so much concrete reality than it is flip-flop opinion. The world has yet to degenerate to thought control or \\""thoughtcrime\\"", but the increasing constraints of political correctness has us edging that way.

What sends shivers down our spines is not the various tortures O'Brien performed, but after these tortures, Winston's total capitulationmind, body, and soulto Big Brother. When the mind kowtows to external authority and ceases to reflect and question, then the individual had successfully metamorphosed into a machine.<br /><br />Winston, by editing previous documents to conform to Oceana's present position, such as whether Eurasia is friend or foe, had helped the regime's guardians, who like O'Brien believed \\""who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past,\\"" mold the citizens' minds. But Oceana, like other totalitarian regimes, also turned to the indispensable tool, fear, to chisel its citizens' minds and hearts to its agenda's shape and form. To stimulate fear and rouse its citizens to a common cause, it would when necessary create fathom enemies, either Eurasia or Eastasia, even though these totalitarian regimes also had similar ideologies, or rather, like Oceana, no ideologies.<br /><br />Under 1984's dystopian sky, Winston must bow, not only because of Big Brother's overwhelming power and presence, but also because of Winston's inability to form any ideologies.

Although much of what the world turned into within this story didn't occur, for the most part, I fear what Orwell would say about the advacement in electronic surveillance and reduction in privacy today. I very much enjoyed this story and can easily relate much of the allusions of this book to today's society and it's possible future. However, I don't find the politics and geography of this story very realistic; the same for its primary ideologies. Yes, it's a work of fiction written over 60 years ago but for example it's unlikely Europe (minus England for some reason) would ever side with Russia to make Eurasia any more than South America and South Africa would side with North America to make Oceania. Geographically it sort of makes sense but politically it does not. The whole \\""Equatorial Region\\"" discussion didn't make much sense either. The land area on/near the Equator is probably the least populated with the fewest resources in the world; though I'm not positive about that. I also felt that the chapter containing sections of \\""The Book\\"" was much longer than it needed to be. That one chapter probably took up about a quater of the whole book, and it wasn't even real. The main character was tricked into thinking it was and even he claimed to not learn much from it. Granted this is the chapter that pretty much details Orwell's political ideologies for the world of 1984 but the same points could've been in a more succinct manner which wouldn't sacrifice a thing.

Sadly, Winston loses his will and thus his capacity for emotions after being tortured for a prolonged period of time. As I read this part I found myself getting more and more angry with his captors. They methods were unjust, and they not only dehumanized Winston and the others, but also themselves. They became like animals. Reminded me of Dostoevsky \\""If God is dead all things are permissible.\\"" The Party wins in the end, and turns Winston into their slave. But on the positive side, the Party had to expend an enormous amount of energy and time to convert just one person. I kept asking myself why the didn't kill him and just be done with it? Why all the effort. The best answer I came up with was that Winston was no use to them dead, and that if he died as a heretic they would have lost. They would not have had total power, hence the need to break him in the last frontier: His mind, his will and his emotions. This reminded me of the Christian martyrs in the first century AD, who refused to bow to Caesar and went to the deaths bowing to God alone. The Party would never have tolerated that of course.<br /><br />The book is depressing but an absolute must read.

The Guardian by Nicholas Sparks is a book about love and suspense. This novel involves a young woman named Julie who is a widow because her husband Jim had recently died; he had left her a dog named Singer who acted like her guardian angel and was there to protect her. All Julie wanted to do was be in love again, so when she began dating again, she began falling for the perfect guy named Richard. Richard was truly perfect for her, but his constant demands and his bipolar attitude made Julie realize that he wasn't the one for her. So, Julie broke up with Richard and began falling for her best friend named Mike. Little did Julie know that this deeply angered Richard which made him do some things that he's not really proud of. As Julie and Mike had to get through all of the things Richard did to retaliate, they both stuck through it and made their love stronger. This book was immensely suspenseful because Richard's actions are unpredictable and keeps one on their toes.<br /><br />The author's viewpoint and main idea is to educate readers and young teens about the art of love and obsession.<br /><br /> The author uses a technique of allowing there to be two different perspectives in the book: thoughts of Julie's and thoughts of Richard's. He showed evidence of the book by interpreting Richard's thoughts and the plans of attack he plotted in his head to make Julie's life miserable, which made the book that much more interesting. He also lets the reader to understand how and why Richard does the things he did to Julie. Also, Sparks uses evidence for the love between Mike and Julie by showing them sticking together and getting through all these rough plots that Richard has set up to get them to break up, but they have stuck through them all clearly showing their love for one another until the very end. The stress Richard put upon their relationship was enough stress to break them apart, but their true love for one another outgrew the threats thrown at them.<br /><br />The author's argument is convincing because he clearly shows and provides evidence on concluding his argument which is that love truly does conquer all. When Richard was angry at Julie for so long and did many things that I can't say or else id ruin it for you, Mike had stuck with her even when Richard sabotaged them in order to break them up, but their love conquered all and they found a way to stick with each other through it all.<br /><br />This book isn't like other novels written because of its suspenseful and twisted plot. Most love novels are about two people who fall in love, break up, and then get back together and live happily ever after; this is no typical love story. However, this book is different in that it provided insight on how strong their love was because of the twisted plot Sparks created. This love story also included horror, deaths, obsessions, and made the reader's heart pound intensely, not only because of the love scenes but also for the scenes in which Richard plotted his plans to make Julie miserable and showed he did what he did.<br /><br />I feel as if this book would be interesting to people who love Nicholas Sparks' books about love and love sorties. However, this book would also appeal to any type of aged person who wants to find a book about not only love but also suspense. Most people don't like love stories because they believe in the stereotypes said about them, but this book gives a mixture of many different genres that would appeal to any average aged person. However, this book appeals more strongly to girls and women than guys and men. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a thrilling book.",2012-06-08

The main character Winston tells of his life living and rebelling in himself of this authoritarian government. The country of Oceania is trapped in a never ending state of war though in reality no battles are ever fought. The book deals with Winston trying to learn about a past realizing the past he has learned from the party never really existed. Winston himself has helped the party change the past. The party looks for unique ways to steal away freedoms by using things such as doublethink (the act of forgetting a past reality once it immediately changes) which lead them to get their population to believe in things such as 2+2=4. Winston also seeks an escape from the party forming a secret love affair with a girl named Julia. Together they try to escape the party.

In this country, miniscule amounts of freedom are given to citizens and the government encourages conformity and submission.  Winston Smith, the main character, edits documents which may contradict thoughts and beliefs of the current government.  In addition, he writes articles for a newspaper called The Times, written entirely in Newspeak.  Newspeak is the official language of Oceania and was invented to limit the individuality of humans by stripping language of variety.  This limited language is one of the many ways in which the government manipulates its citizens into being thoughtless human beings.  After living a structured and dull life for as long as he could remember, Winston reassesses his life and decides to put a stop to the immense amount of control and power that the government has.  The decision that he made would alter his life forever and force him to revaluate his life.<br /><br />  This book deals with key topics about humanity and the desire for power.  Orwell seemingly predicts the effects of communism and the ugly truth about politics, war, and society.  The nature of this society makes readers think about the value of individuality, education, passion, and much more.  The Thought Police constitutes another form of control over citizens.  Humans are required not to think unacceptable thoughts, dream of anything corrupt, appear abnormal, or behave in a chaotic way.  Although the society declares that no rules have been defined, the punishments for disobeying orders are so severe that people stay away from doing anything suspicious or something which would draw attention towards oneself.  The plot portrays a message about the purpose of life and the positives of differences and inequality.  The stupendous writing and impeccable vocabulary makes this read exiting and intriguing.  From the first page, you'll be rooting for the successful overthrow of the government and will remain hopeful that Winston can make a positive change to this society - compelling read!",2012-06-01

I will say, without spoiler, that this book could have been amazing. I gave it two stars because the writing was very detailed. I could see it. I knew what the hall looked like, the house, the coral. I KNEW what he was seeing. But two stars is all I'm giving for that, and here's why... I followed this book, I felt the build up and the suspense, I loved it four stars worth... &lt;spoiler> until he started reading Goldstein's book. That's when the story began to fall apart, when I realized that there wasn't going to really be a story at all.<br />At this point, it really felt like Orwell wrote everything up until then just so he could give a long drawn out speech about a society that could have been and if it had been, it would suck. And I think I may have still clung on to liking the book, I would have overlooked the lecture part, if at the end, there was something to walk away with, some point to the story other than 'if this happens, it will be bad'. Yeah, it would. But this is a book, give me more than a lecture. There were just so many parts that I could not get on board with.<br />Let's start with his meeting with O'Brien. O'Brien told him that there would be no group meetings, there was not an organization. Winston would take his orders from O'Brien, himself, or maybe one or two other people. Though Winston held high suspicions of everything and everyone throughout the book, why not even a slight apprehensiveness here? Why not question why he might have to throw acid into a child's face or spread a venereal disease? If you are questioning everything about your society and world, why blindly grasp on to this line of reasoning without even asking about it? I understand that you are raised with a different set of standards and understandings, but you are telling me that you are suspicious of EVERYTHING else, but that this line of talk seems acceptable to you, and that you should blindly accept it? No questions? No sneaking worry that perhaps something is not right?<br />And Julia in all of this? In earlier conversations, she had stated quite clearly that she had no desire to rebel like this. She wanted to rebel mentally and sexually, but that was all. And yet, he denounced everything for her, he said that she would also throw acid in baby's faces. She only spoke up when it came to them separating. Why? She was a strong woman earlier, very strong in her stance on only being a rebel from the waist down. She knew that his form of rebellion is suicide. But now, in the presence of O'Brien, she was mousy. She apparently wanted this too and had not a word to say otherwise. Why? Why, Julia, did you abandon EVERYTHING you had previously said, wanted, felt... and done it blindly without discussion?<br />Then came the book of boredom. I kept waiting to read something to the effect of \\""so the government using mind control by lacing the Victory gin and using subliminal messaging in the Tele's\\"" but no. Just Socia-Political garble again.<br />Okay, so then they were caught. And it was O'Brien that was the Thought Police. Saw that coming after the meeting. And they start torturing Winston, okay... but why? O'Brien says to make you back to a good little follower so we can kill you then, as a believer... You know, because that's how we do it. We go through all this time and effort for no real end effect, just to kill you after you re-convert.<br />Oh, and somehow, we can actually read your mind. Huh?<br />And in the end, what was that? He was a good little lazy boy? What was the point of the whole thing? Of him knowing society and the government was wrong? Of him loving Julia? Of any of it? Why tell me a story like that? If not one single thing came of it, what was the point? There was nothing to hold on to, in the end. If, let's say, he was that shell of a man, but had constant dreams of Julia, his perfect love, though he could not recall whoshe was... only the feeling of that perfect happy... I could hold on to that. If, he died with her name on his lips, I could hold on to that. If she turned out to be the bad guy, or O'Brien turned out to be the jackass he is but was ALSO Goldstein, or Goldstein was actually Big Brother, or anything that was actually a twist, a plot, or somehow monumental or even pretty big, I could hold on to that.

He then makes a friend from work who he thinks hates the government too. He promises to do mean things to get back at the government if his friend asks him to. But what?

Then, he doesn't like his girlfriend anymore and he gets to drink gin all the time and the government doesn't change at all, and the girlfriend doesn't really like him anymore either. The end.'

Nothing is kept private, and emotions are almost nonexistent. If you are considered different, you are killed.

The story takes place in what is assumed to be future America, and the story is told by a character named Winston Smith.

He secretly despises \\""Big Brother\\"", the government figure that controls the world he knows. He dare not say anything of his feelings towards this subject, for if he shows any emotion, the Thought Police will erase his existence forever, making it seem like Winston Smith never existed.

Orwell builds up some interest by strongly suggesting an ulterior motive to her purported love interest, but turns out that she really just wanted sex (how exciting!/sarcasm).<br /><br />- Passing a note with \\""I love you\\"" scribbled on it to a total stranger. Really? What is she, 5 years old?<br /><br />- All the 'truths' about the world that the protagonist lives in are revealed via the long and detailed THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM. But later, O'Brien claims that the manifesto is false, written by himself. So the reader consumes those pages and pages of detail, formulating an elaborate mental picture of the novel's world...only to be told later that it is totally false. What was the point of all that detail then?<br /><br />- OMG! Can Winston really trust O'Brien...considering that he's, you know, a member of party whose prime modus operandi is deception? Oh so O'Brien was lying all along and it was all a trap?? Never saw that coming...shocked!!<br /><br />- How could O'Brien have possibly known that Winston had mentally considered not incinerating a newspaper article once? Can the thought police read minds also? Why no explanation given for this?<br /><br />- For a party that doesn't think twice about liquidating political enemies or dissenters, why go through the long, torturous process to brainwash Winston? Why not just get rid of him and render him another unperson?<br /><br />- So Julia and Winston broke down and betrayed each other. Wow, how could they..give in all that torture (described in excruciating detail, pun intended)? Winston loses, Big Brother wins. Story over! No deviation from the norm. No change to the status quo. No triumph of the underdog. Ok, I get it's a dystopian novel. How about at least a respectable struggle, perhaps just barely and tragically failing in the end after coming so close?  ANYTHING that makes the reader care about the protagonists, or makes them special, or distinguishes them from the throngs of other miserable souls in said dystopia? Nope!<br /><br />These are just a few of the most blatant ones. There is nothing redeeming about this novel...an insipid plot, nothing endearing or even remotely interesting about any of the characters, no build-up, no unexpected twists which you couldn't see coming from a mile away. In fact, the novel has nothing going for it other than pure shock value. Which it expertly cashed in upon by being released at a time when anti-communist sentiments were at their paranoid apex. In other words, it's the cold war era literary version of a B-rated slasher flick.

Its references to communism, capitalism and totalitarianism chill the body to the bone in an unimaginable way. The main chilling fact, is that the events in 1984 could possibly happen. Many of the reoccurring themes throughout the novel such as love, and freedom are quickly abolished almost in an instant, giving the reader insight on how important these ideas are, and how they should be cherished. Orwell also grants the reader insight into many different parts of the world where people are currently enslaved by their governments and how their lives differ from the free world. The book being written in a time where the world was consumed by fear and hatred of communism shows how a civilization can be easily manipulated by these feeling of hate and fear. It is true that in 1984 Winston's and Julia's final fates are quite possibly worse then death. They lose their hatred for the party, and the means to rebel and become lovers of big brother and of the party as well. To lose ones passion and love is a fate that could be seen as worse than death.

Well, imagine no further, just read 1984 by George Orwell, which follows the life of Winston Smith through the post-war, dystopian society of Oceania as he reminisces his childhood before World War II while struggling to live under the rule of the Party. Winston faces a society where no one is unaffected by the ever-changing of the Party and everyone lives in constant fear that Big Brother is watching over them.<br /><br /> Winston lives in the city of London, where he works for the Ministry of Truth as an editor for printed text, condensing words into the language of Newspeak. The constantly shrinking language of Newspeak was created to reduce the possibility of \\""thoughtcrime\\"" (the act of thinking outside the Party's beliefs) among its citizens and to eliminate any vocabulary deemed unnecessary. For example, the prefix \\""double\\"" can be added to the word \\""good\\"" to form \\""doublegood,\\"" which indicates that something is very good, and vice versa. This is one way that Orwell displays censorship in a communist society, eliminating as many radical ideas from society as possible.<br /><br /> Orwell created characters like Winston who made you sympathize for him, from the way he describes his childhood to the way he shows his secret disdain for the Party. Along the way, Winston meets with Julia, a woman from the Fiction department who is the exact opposite of the Party-supporting person she claims to be. From the way Orwell crafts his characters, you can see that he wanted a character that would entirely rebel against the Party to meet Winston, a man who only secretly disdains the Party, to bring out his dark side and do things that he would never have done by himself. With Julia, he secretly rebels from the Party by engaging in everything the Party is against, all the while trying to conceal himself from Big Brother.<br /><br /> As much as you'd like to think that Big Brother is nothing but a fantasy, 1984 was written about the communist countries after World War II like the USSR. Orwell makes this dystopic society parallel to communist society in that everyone is monitored, propaganda is displayed through all areas of media, and the government does its best to alter its ugly past and to sugarcoat current events to put the country in a more positive light. Some say that the novel is too dark; a possibility for this could be Orwell was suffering from tuberculosis during the time he wrote 1984, so his pain and suffering is paralleled in the dark descriptions of society. In the communist society and in Oceania, there are those that strongly support the government's propaganda, and there are those that disagree with the propaganda and long for the days before the government changed. North Korea almost accurately mirrors Oceania in that they're run by a communist government, the people live in poverty, and they live in constant fear of the police taking them away. The sad reality is, the fictional society of Oceania is very much alive in today's world.<br /><br /> \\""It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals: `War is peace; freedom is slavery; ignorance is strength.\\"" The scenery and the way Orwell tells the story made me feel like I was actually living Winston's life. The darkness of the novel only adds to the real feel of it. It is a bit slow in the beginning where Orwell describes Oceania, but once you get to the middle, you won't want to put it down. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading science fiction, or even to anyone who is looking for a good read. The only downside to reading this novel is that you might start thinking that the thoughtpolice are watching you through the television and listening to everything you say through the walls.",2011-10-17

I got all of a couple of pages into it before setting it down and never returning to it.  Fast forward a little more than a decade, and I finally picked it up again.  And you know what?  This is an excellent story!  I just needed to get in touch with my cynical side.  A high school senior has too much optimism to appreciate Nineteen Eighty-Four.<br /><br />I used to think (back when I hadn't actually read the story) that this was a book about a society where the government was watching its citizens' every move.  Well, there is that, but there is so much more to this book.  I was impressed by the scope of the ideas touched on here.  Most fascinating to me was the concept of thoughtcrime.  The idea that a government would seek to control and judge the very thoughts of its citizens is horrific, and yet it is one of the more plausible concepts in the book!  It's not enough to obey the government; you have to want what it wants, to give up your will to a shadowy, unknowable Authority.<br /><br />Then there is the concept of the State being able to watch you constantly.  It's like the whole populace is living in the Panopticon.  I loved the scene where the two main characters have to wait for a crowd to be able to meet each other.  In a society where you are always being monitored, the only place to hide is a crowd.<br /><br />The spookiest facet of this imaginary, horror-story society, is that it is conceived as being perpetual.

It is designed to last forever, to never become the victim of revolution.  And through advanced technology and psychological control, it is working.<br /><br />The last part of the book was a riveting, frightening scene.  The agents of this terrible society do their best, not to force our protagonist to conform, but to instill in him the desire to conform.  To make him love the forces that control him.  It is genuinely scary, and painful to watch.

It illustrates a world in which people are merely shells of themselves and only live to please their government in it's hunger for power. The protagonist, Wilson, refuses to settle for that existence. He analyzes his surroundings and hates the all knowing, totalitarian government.<br /><br />Wilson struggles to live such a life. He must hide his thoughts and feelings from the Thought Police. As a reader you can sympathize with Wilson and his struggle. It is quite difficult to imagine living in such a controlled state where one ceases to be human to become another senseless drone. He is not allowed to show emotion. He is not allowed to love in this empire that runs on hate. To love is a crime in Oceana. On the other hand, members of the Party are forced to attend the daily Two Minutes hate that forces extreme nationalism into people's thoughts and corrupts them to hate an invisible enemy.<br /><br />These practices that Wilson is subject to make the reader thankful for our world and hopeful that such an existence will not be the future of the human race. The novel exaggerates human behavior in a way that almost makes it seem as though this could be possible. George Orwell tries to convey a message of peace and togetherness through this harsh example of what may come to be. He urges the reader to prevent our world from being ruled by hateful warmongers. The moral of the story is to be aware of yourself and hold on to your humanity. Being your own person and showing compassion for your fellow man are the most important things you can do.

He's actually not sure what year it is, as the Ministry of Truth, the agency he works for as a minor member of the Party, keeps muddying up the records. The past is malleable, the nation is always at war, words are disappearing from the vernacular, everyone is monitored through telecasters, bad thoughts are a crime, and Big Brother is always watching...<br /><br />How have I not read this classic dystopian novel until now? I've poured through Brave New World, started but never finished We, watched THX-1138 and Brazil, and recently finished The Handmaid's Tale, but somehow 1984 has avoided being in my to-read library. Until I finally got my hands on an audiobook version.<br /><br />This book is eye-opening, a bleak picture of the future, a scary nightmarish world where nothing you do is ever private--and in this age of the internet, doesn't that seem even more likely than ever? Throughout the entire book, I couldn't help that feeling that someone was looking over my shoulder, that any moment someone was going to spot me.<br /><br />The characters aren't particularly brilliant, but they function for the exact purpose that Orwell created them: to explore and poke at this world. Winston Smith comes across as your typical 50's sci-fi hero: he is smarter than many of his peers, aware of his surroundings, and discontent. However, he is also incredibly paranoid and a somewhat weak-willed pathetic man (you see this ESPECIALLY at the ending). What I disliked most about him was how he related to Julia. He tended to treat her like she was a sex toy: a person he had sex with regularly but who had limited intelligence and had to be patiently told each detail that the hero can, of course, immediately understand. While this is not as prominent and annoying as, say, Ringworld, it was still present enough that it grated on my nerves.<br /><br />The only other prominent characters are Julia and O'Brien. Julia, as I mentioned above, tended to feel like only a sex bunny; however, she does in a way, incite Winston to embark on a journey that will change his life and is in control of her own world. For that reason, I do have more respect for her than many other females in books of this era. O'Brien is Winston's coworker and possible fellow dissenter. He's an incredibly complex character, mostly seen from Winston's (clouded and highly paranoid) perception.<br /><br />But what makes this novel isn't its characters, as I said above. It's the story, it's the world, it's the warning about what could happen if nothing happens. And this is what impressed me most. This world is startlingly real. The possibility of a diminishing language is scary...how many words am I currently using in this review would be banished by New Speak (kudos to Orwell for all his work on this language, btw)? How is that similar to the text speak that is occurring right now?<br /><br />What about the idea that your television could be recording you, sending your image to some guy, in some cubicle who is making sure you aren't doing anything wrong? That your neighbors could be spying on you, ready to report you at the drop of your hat? That wars are being faked (okay, so many people believe that is already happening...)? That the past can be changed with a pop into MS Word and Photoshop? How about the thought that your entire day is planned out for you, so that you have no alone time for your own thoughts? That writing in a book (or a review...) could be cause for arrest? If that sort of future doesn't scare you, you are much stronger than I am!<br /><br />I really have only two \\""criticisms\\"" about this book. The first is the characters/way that women are treated. The characters are fairly bland/stereotypical of the time. Women, similarly, end up on the short end. They are often described as easily led by the Party's idealsand wholeheartedly embracing them. And most of the women we see are sex bunnies or naggy wives.<br /><br />The other criticism is the long sections delving into Goldstein's book. In my opinion, Orwell did a fine job describing this world, so that I really didn't need the Book to explain how this society worked further. The torture scene also somewhat dragged (though this is somewhat more understandable).<br /><br />If you consider yourself a fan of dystopian novels, this needs to be at the top of your reading list.

Orwell's futuristic novel makes one contemplate a world in which various elements of humanity--memories, important events, identities, personalities, family experiences--are rendered obsolete and transparent. 1984's afterword poses a question that is at the core of the novel: \\""can human nature be changed in such a way that man will forget his longing for freedom, for dignity, for love--that is to say, can man forget that he is human?\\"", a question that the book's protagonist, Winston Smith, struggles with. Unlike some other dystopians (Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, The Giver, The Hunger Games), which share glimmers of hope for mankind, 1984 is a novel that leaves you shocked, upset, depressed and cold. Reading 1984 is a paranoid, hopeless kind of experience, particularly part three of the novel, but, to apply the oft used expression, it is a \\""cautionary tale\\"", a dark parable to what could happen in a society devoid of humanness and ruled by oppressive forces.<br /><br />Orwell uses his main character, Winston, as a scapegoat to this disillusioned society. A sort of everyman, Winston experiences a rush of revolt during early on in the novel during the Two Minutes Hate, where the people stop to decry and lash out against Goldstein, an individual who advocates free speech and liberty. Winston takes measures to silently rebel against The Party: he scribbles thoughts on paper; he ventures outside the district; he buys an \\""ancient\\"" relic, a glass piece, a link to the past. Despite his fatalistic attitude that he will eventually be caught and persecuted, he longs for information--and signs--- that will contradict the preachings of Big Brother; he ventures into a pub to engage an old man into a conversation about the world before the revolution, but is frustrated to find that the man only knows meaningless facts about the past. Winston later meets Julia, a woman who he distrusts initially, but comes to trust, as she despises everything about the Party. Winston enjoys the liaisons with Julia, and continues to try to understand more about the past and the possible existence of the Brotherhood. Instincts tell him that O'Brien, a man who works in the department, is the key.<br /><br />Orwell's 1984 is a work that epitomizes futuristic fears of a brainwashed society, evoking emotions on the part of the reader to root for the individual over civilization. As others have noted, 1984 depicts a pessimistic world view with a bleak message. It is, therefore, a bit of a downer to read. However, 1984 is powerful and has redeeming qualities, as evidenced in Winston's valiant struggle and attempt to retain his identity and his hatred for Big Brother; however, we see an inevitable, unalterable conclusion that still leaves us a little bit shaken.<br /><br />Similar to many of you, I was \\""forced\\"" to read 1984 in high school; after rereading in college, the book's message was so much more powerful.

I thought I'd give it another try now, to see if I'd view it in a different and wiser perspective. Given the rapidly expanding government of today along with the weak economic situation, I thought I would be able to draw some parallels from this book in relation to the modern world.<br />Having finished it, I feel thoroughly disappointed. While I grasp the ideas the author attempts to convey to the reader, I feel it is done in the poorest context ever. The story is so utterly mundane and boring that I found my mind drifting from the story to more interesting things - like my fingernails and shoe laces. The characters are so disconnected and the relationship between them and the reader so weak, that even at the end of the book I could not get myself to care about Winston (main character) enough to give a crap about whether he lived or died. The ideas and their implications in the book are deep but are presented so poorly that I would compare it to the reading of a dictionary, or a ceiling fan warranty manual, only less interesting.  It did not take long for me to remember why I hated reading this in school.<br />For the life of me I cannot understand why this book is so highly regarded in the world of literature.  Yes, it has ideas that could cause one to have complex thoughts on many levels, but I found that the actual reading of this book was so awfully boring that it totally negated anything positive that could be derived from this novel. The main character is subjected to a great deal of torture at the end of the book... and so is the reader - as I found that the only thing more painful than the torture was reading about it. George Orwell is no wordsmith and his style of writing stinks and flows like verbal diarrhea. It even leaves a bad aftertaste, as diarrhea should, preventing one from revisiting the ideas in the book due to the runny, turd-like substance that Orwell considers to be thestoryline.<br />The ideas in this book have seen many embodiments since its publication. From \\""Demolition Man\\"" to a certain episode of \\""The Outer Limits\\"", all of them FAR more interesting than Orwells' own writing, even if the ideology of the message being somewhat diluted when compared to the original. The moral of the story is hard to care about when the story itself sucks. I have to wonder, what kind of sad people chose this book to be mandatory reading in our public schools? What was going thru their minds? \\""I'm am so miserable and everyone should be too, so I will make them suffer by reading this!\\""<br />I remember dissecting the meaning of the novel in school, for over a week.

Orwell writes like Monet paints, in that his description of 1984 is opaque yet colorful, mysterious, and beautiful.<br /><br />Throughout 1984, the reader follows Winston Smith, who lives in Airstrip One.  The world is subdivided into three major super powers.  Winston lives in Oceana, which is run by Big Brother.  Three ministries govern Oceana: The Ministry of Truth, Ministry of Love, and Ministry of Peace.  Winston works for the Ministry of Truth, and it is there he meets Julia.<br /><br />Much like Orwell's description of the scenes themselves, he creates a world in which the reader feels they are looking at Oceana through a sheet.  Orwell never describes Oceana or 1984 in too much detail; though, in his descriptions of Winston's relationships to the world he lives in, Julia, and Big Brother, he writes with enough description that Orwell's vision of the future becomes more apparent with each page.<br /><br />The most striking scene is when a poet is thrown into prison because he refused to take out the word, \\""God\\"" from a poem he transcribed because no other word fit.

It's sad that so many people nowadays try to change this nation into communist or socialism ( same role, just different name) not really knowing the truth, just based on some political ideology that human history had repeatedly proved to be failed. In fact communism is the worst political system that ever presented on earth. Because of its brutality, I escaped from that regime. And I am happy to be in this country where human freedom is mostly respected, and protected. Communist lies saying every one shares equally: In fact only, those few comrades who caused the shift of power enjoy the wealth and power, but the rest of the general citizens have no equality nor basic human right. Any one speak against government---disappear next day to \\""concentration camp\\"" w/o fair trials nor justice. Communist shut down all religious freedom, or freedom of speech ( all medias are government controlled) Communists deny any form of gods but instead, they set the status of Stalin or Ma chiding, or Kimjung ill, and have to sing songs and salute for them, worship them. From elementary children to elders... Anyone dares to go against the government, ---labor camp! Several millions who stand for their freedom were killed brutally in early 20th century, during the communism overturn. Stalin communist government killed 90 millions including the vicinity nations that were turn into communism, Macho-tong communist killed 100 millions, 2 millions by North Korea, by Cambodia each, 2 millions in Africa, 200,000 latin America..so on . But most of all they all became terribly poor after communist regime,oppressing the free capitalism, except China, because they started to adapt the partial capitalism from 10 years ago after they realized the harsh economic state.

Why? men were not made to work for Common good. Maybe some aliens from different planet or maybe Jesus will do for  common good. But not men's nature. That's why communism make every one poorer and poorer. When men get prosperous by working hard, with their creativity, they help others if they are normal. because normal people appreciate God's wisdom of love and peace.But if the much power goes to God-haters, but seeking totalitarianistic government, you will see the corruption everywhere. Because they basically don't know, or appreciate God's wisdom of love and peace for all, they will fully manifest their selfishness and brutality. If USA turned into communism, the power will shift to only those who hate the existing American system. They secretly controlling medias ( I already see it happened ) and brainwashing the youth with distorted facts in textbooks last 20 years. They keep change their names, their activity, and theory.

They are not normal mind, full of hatred, and causing always divisions, manipulations  Men can't govern themselves.They are very selfish, greedy and evil by nature. If  any political party, government have too much power, they will certainly hurt others unless they truly know jesus who always teach love and peace.

Orwell, an extremely influential journalist and author who was known for his adroit ability to craft with the English language, his strong opinions on political issues such as totalitarianism, and his satirical novella Animal Farm (1945), sent the final copy of his sixth and final novel to his publisher on 4 December 1948. On 8 June 1949, the novel hit the shelves of bookstores, bearing the name Nineteen Eighty-Four. Seven months after his book was released, on 28 January 1950, Orwell passed away because of complications with tuberculosis. Over 60 years later, people still enjoy this grim, enigmatic tale of a futuristic society gone horribly wrong. The edition I am reviewing is a 328- page reprint by Signet Classics, complete with the story, an appendix with the principles of Newspeak, and an afterword by Erich Fromm.<br /><br /> In the futuristic super-state Oceania, which consists mainly of the Americas, the Atlantic islands, Australia, and the southern portion of Africa, the story takes place in what used to be called Britain, but is now known as \\""Airstrip One\\"". One could infer from the title that the story takes place in the year 1984 (although the government's falsification of history has created some uncertainty regarding what year the story really takes place in). Oceania itself is governed by a three-tiered totalitarian party, separated into an Inner Party, an Outer Party, and a large proletariat population, all of which are led by a mysterious dictator named Big Brother. Winston Smith, a member of the Outer Party who works in one of the ministries of the Party, takes the main role in this story. Because he possesses a mind unlike many of those within the Party, a mind full of resistance and hate towards the Party, Winston regularly does things that would be considered a crime in Oceanic society, a society in which the truth is censored, the actions of people are closely monitored, the thoughts of people are controlled and altered, and peoples' individuality has been removed.<br /><br /> At the opening of this story, we find that Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, a large governing ministry which is responsible for rewriting historical documents and media and changing facts to fit Party doctrine and make it seem like the Party is absolute and never wrong, in essence turning most news media, and even some books and some forms of art, into propagandist media (and also turning the name of the ministry into a lie). Normal Party members are oblivious to falsification because their minds have been trained to simultaneously accept two contradicting beliefs as correct (this is referred to in the story as doublethink). However, Winston is different. He begins to see through the party, their abuse of power, their lies, and their hate, and because of this, he seeks psychological freedom.<br /><br /> Winston seems to recall a time in his life when things were much better. However, he doesn't quite remember when that time was, or what it was really like. This mere feeling causes Winston to ponder whether or not there was a time before his where life was much better; a time without perpetual war, political unrest, or harsh living conditions. Because of this, he seeks a way to bring down Big Brother and the Party. He finds hope in rumors of an underground organization known as the Brotherhood, created for the purpose of overthrowing the party. He also finds hope in the proles, theorizing that with the size of their population, if they realized that their life could be much, much better (though how can you do that when this is how you have lived since the day you were born?), they might band together and overthrow the party.<br /><br /> He also finds hope in a fellow employee, Julia, who Winston at first believes is an agent of the Thought Police. However, an encounter at work changes his mind when she reveals to him that she loves him. They begin an affair, rendezvousing in remote locations to make love; not just because of love, but also for rebellion against the Party. They then make a home in an antique shop in a proletarian quarter of Airstrip One. Another fellow employee of Winston's, O'Brien, displays discontent for the party as well, and upon Winston and Julia meeting with him in his flat, he reveals that the Brotherhood really does exist, and he allows Winston and Julia to be a part of it, so long as they understand that the change they desire will not happen in their lifetime.<br /><br /> Winston had finally found paradise in a collectivist hell. Not only that, but he had also become part of the force that was going to bring down the Party! He knew he had people on his side! Although this seemed very, very promising, this proved to be nothing but a lie. Winston receives a book from O'Brien regarding oligarchical collectivism that was written by Emmanuel Goldstein, a co-founder of the Party who ended up betraying it and, because of this, becoming the primary object of hate in Oceania. Shortly after this, Winston and Julia are betrayed by the owner of the antique store they lived in, who turns out to be an agent of the Thought Police. Shortly after this, they are both taken away to the Ministry of Love.<br /><br /> During his captivity in the Ministry of Love, Winston is beaten, abused, neglected and periodically interrogated by members of the Inner Party (his treatment being indicative of yet another misnomer of a ministry that specializes in interrogation through torture). O'Brien, who revealed himself to be a member of the Inner Party, interrogates Winston several times, and at one point reveals to him that the Party wants more than just confessions from people who are considered \\""thoughtcriminals\\"". The Party needs to be certain of every citizen's love for Big Brother and the Party because they simply want everycitizen to believe in Big Brother and the Party. They don't want to exterminate those who do not believe. Rather, they want to go to the fullest extent to force them to believe. With this as their motive, what will happen to Winston? Will he continue to resist the Party? Will he end up just like every other brainwashed, orthodox citizen of Oceania? The conclusion of this story reveals all of this and more. What O'Brien revealed to Winston shows that in a totalitarian regime the top priority of the party is to control everything they can possibly control. Even your own mind. This book clearly illustrates for the reader the dangers of totalitarianism and how this political system dramatically affects the quality of life for the citizens held within it.<br /><br /> Late teens to adults of any age who have strong opinions on political issues or enjoy dystopic fiction or social science fiction will enjoy this book. However, people who are sensitive to sexual content or violence might not like certain aspects of this story, because there are points where topics like this are either hinted at, or sometimes even elaborated upon. Also, a recommended prerequisite to this book is to possess a rather advanced vocabulary, that is to say that if your reading level isn't quite at the college level, then you may have some difficulty getting through this book. I enjoyed this book. I actually enjoyed it a lot. The ending, however, I did not exactly enjoy because this book did not end the way I wanted it to or the way I thought it would.

First, it's on the ALA's list of top banned or challenged books, and second because it's really, really good.<br /><br />As with all the books I read, there's always a little part of me thinking about what I'm going to say about the book once I finally decide to write about it. Sometimes I start composing in my mind, coming up with the pithy words and phrases that have made me into the international book reviewing superstar that I am.<br /><br />This time, however, I could barely concentrate for the cacophony in my head. There's just so much going on in this novel that doing it any sort of justice would probably require writing a book that was longer than the book that it was analyzing. And as much as I love you guys, I'm not about to write a whole book about this. Probably because I reckon better minds than mine already have.<br /><br />Regardless, it's hard  to choose where exactly to go on this one. There are so many political, sociological, psychological and philosophical threads to pick up here that no matter what I write about, I'm pretty sure I'll get responses about how I didn't mention the solipistic nature of Ingsoc and its relationship to the philosophy behind modern cable news network reporting strategies. Don't worry, guys - I got that one.<br /><br />I suppose two big things came to mind while I was reading it this time, and the first of them was inspired by the previous book I read, To Kill a Mockingbird. In that book, Atticus Finch talks a lot about bravery. To teach his son about what it truly means to be brave, he gets him to take part in an old woman's struggle to free herself of a morphine addiction before she dies - an excruciating process that is more likely to fail than to succeed. But she does it anyway. Atticus says to his son about bravery, \\""It's when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.\\""<br /><br />The question in my mind, then, was \\""Is Winston Smith brave?\\""<br /><br />It's a hard question to answer, really. By Atticus' definition, you could say that he is. A member of the Outer Party that rules the superstate of Oceania, Winston Smith is a part of a greater machine. He works in the records department of the Ministry of Truth, diligently altering and \\""rectifying\\"" the data of the past to bring it into alignment with what the Party wants to be true. His is a world where there is no such thing as objective truth - the truth is what the Party says it is.<br /><br />A good member of the Party sublimates his will to that of the Party. What Big Brother wants, she wants. She has no love but love for the Party and no dreams but to do what the Party wants of her. A good Party member doesn't have plans or hopes or dreams. He doesn't ask questions or idly wonder if things could be different from what they are. A good Party member doesn't think. He is born, lives, consumes, and dies.<br /><br />Winston, however, cannot be a good Party member. He wonders why the world is the way it is, and begins down a road to assert his own identity as a human being. He knows full well that he will fail, that in the end he and the woman he loves will be delivered into the hands of the Thought Police, and he is appropriately terrified. But he goes through with it anyway. He keeps a diary of his thoughts and actively tries to join an underground movement that is determined to overthrow the Party and Big Brother. He declares himself willing to undertake acts of heinous treason, all in the name of resistance against the Party.<br /><br />And in the end, he fails, just as he knew he would. So does this make Winston, a man who is so far in character from Atticus Finch, a brave person? Well, yes and no.<br /><br />He does meet Atticus' definition of bravery - persisting in what you believe to be right,even in the knowledge that you will probably fail. Winston puts his own life on the line multiple times, committing Thoughtcrime of the highest order. But is he doing it for some higher ideal, or is he doing it for more selfish reasons? Flashbacks to his younger days suggest that Winston Smith was an unrepentantly selfish child, who was willing to disregard the dire straits of his own mother and baby sister in order to get what he wanted. Could we not say that the adult Winston does the same? That he is more interested in freedom for himself than for others? Is his rebellion against Big Brother political or personal? He claims that he wants to see the world changed and freedom brought to all people, but how far can we trust a mind that's been well-trained in Doublethink?<br /><br />This, of course, gets right back to the Big Question of why people do the right thing, when it might be so much easier and profitable to do otherwise. Atticus Finch could have let Tom Robinson swing, thus saving himself and his family a whole lot of trouble, just as Winston could have just given up and emulated his neighbor, Parsons, becoming as good a Party member as possible. Neither man could do that, though, because is was not in their nature to do so. It was impossible for Winston to continue to live the way the Party wanted to and, given time, he may have been able to reach beyond meeting his own personal needs and seen to the needs of his greater community.<br /><br />Unfortunately, we never get the chance to find out, as the Thought Police eventually get tired of watching him and take him in. To his credit, he does hold out to the last extreme before he betrays Julia in his heart, so perhaps he is brave after all.<br /><br />The other thing that came to mind while I read was the modern use of the word \\""Orwellian,\\"" and how it falls vastly short of what is depicted in this book. It gets thrown about any time a city puts up a few CCTV cameras downtown, or a business decides to put surveillance cameras in their store. It comes up when we put RFID chips in passports and credit cards, or when we think about how much data Google can hold about us. The word brings to mind a sense of constant surveillance, never being able to move or act without some government or corporation knowing what we're doing.<br /><br />While the concept of the two-way telescreens in this book certainly are a logical extension of surveillance culture, to call a customer database or red light cameras \\""Orwellian\\"" is like calling a Bronze-age chariot a Ferrari. It betrays an incredible lack of understanding of what exactly is going on in the world that Orwell has built. We may be watched by these people, but in comparison to the average citizen of Oceanea - prole or Party member - we are still remarkably free.<br /><br />There are still freedoms available to us that people like Winston never had, and couldn't understand even if they were offered. We can protest, we can voice our disagreements, we can channel our energies into whatever pursuit we choose, or not channel them at all. We have the freedom to decide who we want to be and how we want to live, at least within the limits of a well-ordered society. We do not live in daily terror that we might be abducted from our beds, our lives ended and our very existence erased from record and memory. Honestly, I think a few security cameras pale in comparison to the horror that is Oceanea and the world of Big Brother.<br /><br />There is so much more to talk about with this book. I find Newspeak fascinating, and its foundations both amazing and terrifying. The idea that a concept can only truly exist if there's a word for it brings to mind those \\""untranslatable\\"" words you find in every language. For example, there's no equivalent to the English \\""miss\\"" in Japanese, as in \\""I miss my mother.\\"" Does that mean that people in Japan are incapable of missing people? Of course not, but the underlying theory of Newspeak suggests otherwise. Oncethe party reduces the English language to a series of simple words with no nuance or subtlety of meaning, the idea goes, Thoughtcrime will be literally impossible. After all, how can one wish for freedom if the concept itself is impossible to articulate?<br /><br />Then there's the idea of the mutability of the past. The way the Party exerts its unbreakable control over the population is by virtue of the fact that they control all media - newspapers, radio, television, publishing of all sorts. If the Party wants to, say, claim that Big Brother invented the airplane, all they have to do is revise all relevant media to reflect their desired past, and then replace and destroy anything that disagrees with them. With no evidence that Big Brother didn't invent the airplane, all that's left is fallible human memory, and those who do think they remember the \\""right\\"" version of the past will eventually die anyway. Whoever controls the present, the Party says, controls the future. And whoever controls the past controls the present. By remaking the past, the Party guarantees that they can never be gainsaid or proven to have erred in any way.<br /><br />Fortunately for us, Big Brother never had the internet to contend with. As anyone who's been online for a while knows, nothing on the internet ever goes away. Ever. The words of any leader or influential person are all there, in multiple copies, all of which can themselves be copied and distributed in mere seconds. While it is possible to fake a photograph, the awareness of that possibility, as well as the technology to suss out the fakes, are just as available to anyone who wants them. Even in cases where there are disputes about the past, or re-interpretations of past events, it is impossible for one version to systematically replace all others. While this sometimes results in competing versions of the past, the one with the most evidence tends to prevail.<br /><br />Continuing in that vein, the understanding that the Party controls all information about itself leads to a very interesting question that's not addressed in the book - is anything that is not directly witnessed by Winston Smith true? We are led to believe, for example, that there are three world powers - Oceanea, Eastasia and Eurasia - which are locked in a state of perpetual war. The nature of this war and how it serves the interests of these three nations is laid out in Goldstein's Book, which is the text of the Revolution that Winston and Julia want to join. But here's the thing - Goldstein's Book is an admitted fiction, written by the Party as a kind of honeypot to bring suspects through the last stages of their Thoughtcrime. So we have no proof that the world of Nineteen Eighty-four actually is laid out the way it appears.<br /><br />The Party could in fact dominate the world, using the pretext of war to keep the world's citizens terrified, needy and compliant. On the other extreme, Oceanea could just be Britain, turned in on itself like some super-accelerated North Korea, its borders sealed and its citizens kept in utter ignorance of the world outside. We don't know. We have no way of knowing, and neither do any of the characters in the book. Even the Inner Party members might not know the truth of their world, and wouldn't care if they did.<br /><br />One more thing, and I'll keep this one short - Doublethink. The ability to hold two contradictory ideas in your mind, believing in both of them simultaneously and yet being unaware that there's any conflict at all. Knowing, for example, that last week chocolate rations were at thirty grams, and at the same time knowing that this week they had been raised to twenty. All I can say here is to look at the current health care debate in the United States. Here's a fun game: see how often someone says, \\""We have the best health care in the world,\\"" and then see how long it takes before they tell us that health care in the United States is irrevocably broken. Your average politician and pundit does this kind of thing all the time and, in accordance with the basic principles of Doublethink (also known as Reality Control), they immediately forget that they had done it.<br /><br />This game is much easier if you watch Glenn Beck for half an hour.<br /><br />There is just so much to be gleaned from this book. Probably the most important is this - the world depicted in Nineteen Eighty-four is certainly not an impossible one, but it is unlikely. The people of that world allowed the Party to take over for them in a time of crisis, and in that sense this book is a warning to us all. It is a warning to keep the power that we have, and to resist the temptation to let a government decide who we should be.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------<br />\\""I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.<br />- Winston Smith, Nineteen Eighty-four<br />-------------------------------------------",2011-01-01

It is a world that is at once dark, bleak, joyless, loveless and utterly without hope.  Human's are as humans have always been, divided into three classes, only in George Orwell's there is no hope of movement between the three; they are static, fixed, inexorably and utterly.<br /><br />Religion has been banished (not an altogether bad idea), but so too has intellectual, personal, and political freedoms; mankind has been reduced to a soulless conglomeration of empty husks who do as their told, and believe whatever they are told by Big Brother, the party.  Human intellectual, social, and cultural progress in any real sense has ceased for good or ill.  Music, science, art, literature, is no longer the province of self, the Party owns it all.<br /><br />In the world of \\""1984\\"", the world has only three nations, Oceania (North America, South America, Great Britain, and Southern Africa); Eurasia (Russian, Europe and Northern Africa); and Eastasia (China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, India, etc).

The Thought Police are never far from view.  Privacy is a thing of the past, personal pleasure and leisure are frown upon, sex is a dirty joyless affair tolerated only for procreation (now doesn't that sound familiar), and the Party has three over-riding slogans the masses are controlled with; War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength.  The Party has four principle ministries it uses to maintain control of the people; The Ministry of Truth, The Ministry of Love, The Ministry of Plenty, and The Ministry of Peace all of which are represented by four white monolithic building built in the heart of London where this tale unfolds.<br /><br />Most of the book centers on the life, and brief love of Winston Smith, an outer Party member, who live a life of quite misery.  He hates the Party and wants to rebel, but he knows Big Brother is watching, and listening, so he is forced to rebel only in his mind.  But little by little, step-by-step, Winston finds way to rebel, buying a diary in which he records his thoughts, and eventually he has a forbidden love affair with a fellow party member.

The readers of this review can be assured, though, that 1984 got just re-read before recommending now.<br /><br />This personal sequence turned out to be a good and lucky order of things. Reading 1984 as an older teen served as a good \\""memory bookmark\\"" for the work about how wildly different was the storyline, especially having been written in the late 1940s. Reading it again much later let the whole ugliness of the theme sink in. Thus the realization grew during the years from awe (\\""cool\\""?), through bleak horror, to appreciation of the comprehensiveness of its scientific terror or at least the understanding thereof.<br /><br />The \\""naughty\\"" parts of 1984 - the reader will be on his/her own finding these - are few and rather tame by today's averages. The truly overwhelming and blunt description of the terror-managed society-continent of Oceania (along with its equal counterparts, Eurasia and Eastasia) creates a fascination which is hard to stop reading about. Part II describes how Oceania (and the other two) came about in the 50s and 60s and its development, told ingeniously through a \\""smuggled\\"" anti-Oceania revolutionary handbook. The reader will not be able to put the book down here, nor fall asleep during its reading as did Julia, the main girlfriend in the book. Part III takes the reader through the imprisonment and interrogation of Winston Smith, the main character and victim. Further description here will only serve to ruin the story. The reader will almost certainly be infuriated at various places! Yes, the very recent - 1st half 2010 - unfortunate remark by a US government executive about a \\""boot on the neck\\"" of a certain oil company will find the phrase said much earlier by Winston Smith's interrogator, \\""... imagine a boot stamping on a human face, forever.\\"" In the paperback version, page 267.<br /><br />The reader will find littleproblem coming up with possible flaws with the functioning of Oceania.

As government takes more responsibility and more authority over the decisions for its citizens that they once made themselves, the populace loses a small bit of freedom.  Over time, as a socialist government takes more and more and more control over the people's lives, it becomes increasingly tyrannical, in which \\""Power is not a means, but an end.....The goal of Power is Power.\\""<br /><br />How successful can a citizen be in opposing such a govenment when it trains children to be members of The Spies and turn thei parents in for activities and words contrary to the will of the government?  How can a people continue the entrepreneurial system of economicds that made it great, when all efforts to do so are punished severely, when all the histories depicting that former glory are rewritten to make them appear oppressive, when the minor losses in productivity of production and monetary decline are reported as gains and more reason to maintain the status quo of the tyrannical leaders who wish only to control people and have power.<br /><br />One can not but marvel at how the evening news parallels the events of 1984 to a level that is alarming and frightening.  The USA is moving more and more toward socialism and farthr away from the lassez faire capitalism that built its wealth and prominance in the world.  Profit is declared evil;  capitalism is declared abusive and oppressive;  individual choices are subverted to the will of the government which has \\""the best interests of the people\\"" in mind.  Citizens absorb the slow strangulation of progressive socialism without realizing or rebelling to the idea that their breath of freedom is being slowly squeezed from them.<br /><br />This book is an eye opener as much today as it was in 1949 when it was first published.

Under the Ingsoc (English socialism) system, Smith is an Outer Party cadre, but what he really is as a writer.  He is neither a Alexander Solzhenitsyn nor a Noam Chomsky because there simply is no tolerance for any dissent whatsoever.  He is trapped not physically but mentally, and every second of his life is like torture to him.  As a writer he, like Orwell, believes that language permits thought which permits the self.  What Ingsoc enforces is the negation of language (Newspeak) and the negation of thought (doublethink) which equals the negation of self.<br /><br />Newspeak is the reduction of language ino meaningless absurdity, and thus Newspeak is the ultimate bureaucratic language -- it eliminates all the nuances and subtleties of the language, making it only functional.  Newspeak is the ultimate straitjacket for a writer.<br /><br />Doublethink is a mode of thinking that accepts contradictions, holding two opposing ideas to be both true.  Doublethink negates logic, and thus higher order mental processing.  More nefariously, it creates servility in most men, and duplicity in some:  most individuals cannot comprehend two competing ideas at once, and thus doublethink negates them into no-think; those geniuses who are capable of holding contradictions in their head automatically become deceptive and manipulative -- in holding two competing truths the person becomes the only truth.<br /><br />In \\""1984\\"" there are two individuals capable of doublethink:  Winston Smith and the book's antagonist O'Brien.  Smith refuses to submit to doublethink, and instead seeks the freedom to pursue truth.  He writes in a diary,a blatant crime, and he addresses his writings to O'Brien, who Smith correctly suspects can understand him.  They are doppelgangers of each other, and their difference is in their attitude towards doublethink.  If Smith is doublethink's greatest critic, then O'Brien is doublethink's greatest practitioner.  If Smith cannot stand to live another day under Ingsoc, O'Brien is in fact Ingsoc, Big Brother, and the Party, for he alone is the truth.  If O'Brien wishes to be Big Brother's greatest enemy he is the truth, and if he wishes to be Big Brother himself he is still the truth.<br /><br />Ingsoc is a system of slow banal torture, whereby individuals must voluntarily (under the threat of torture) surrender their selves to Big Brother.  They are not permitted to write, to think, and above all to be intimate:  the greatest act of rebellion by Winston Smith and Julia was to make love and to love each other.  It is not enough for Big Brother to demand your obedience -- he must also control your thoughts and your memories.<br /><br />O'Brien is clearly a psychopath, and Smith is his plaything; O'Brien does not fear and hate Smith -- he is just contemptuous.  For seven years, O'Brien had been watching Smith (\\""Big Brother is watching you\\""), and when Smith carelessly and faithfully went to O'Brien with his subversive thoughts then O'Brien's only thought could be:  he's always known.  Smith orchestrated his own sacrifice, but it was not a martyrdom:  it was in fact just an escape from his life.  If a writer cannot write, then that is a fate worse than death.",2010-06-23

I first read this book in 1968, when 1984 seemed far in the future.  Now it's 26 years in the past. The totalitarian regime of the Soviet Union which so much concerned Orwell is also long gone.  But the novel lives on for good reason.<br /><br />Orwell's book will be read for centuries -- when the totalitarian regimes of the 20th Century are as distant in the past as the 30 Years War is from us -- because Orwell is concerned about the nature of reality and the nature of power. Reality, after all, is a construct.  We must strive to superimpose some narrative on the events and data swirling around us.  This requires the use of language and the use of a context.  Therefore, if one controls language and one controls the historical record that gives everything a context, one can control and manipulate everyone's reality. One can, in short, achieve absolute power.<br /><br />In the future dystopia imagined by Orwell the state controls language and constantly rewrites the past.  Words are systmatically eliminated from the English language so that there are no longer any shades of gray.  Absolute control over information is achieved so that however ridiculous the latest message from the party, it must be believed -- and if it is not believed, one begins to question one's own sanity.<br /><br />Much of debate surrounding this book centers around whether the precise dystopia predicted by Orwell will ever actually occur, thereby missing the point.  Given the information revolution, the shrinking of the world, and the fall of the Soviet Union, we are less concerned today about the threat of a totalitarian regime than we are by resource limitations.  The dystopia we now imagine concerns a constant state of war over shrinking resources complicated by the ability of small fringe groups to use terror as an effective weapon against highly centralized and complex modern structures.<br /><br />But Orwell's vision is more fundamental.  Given the profound ability to manipulate and control the individual, what is to prevent humanity from ultimately degenerating over the next millenia into systems resembling the ant heap?  For Orwell, the individual's duty is to be constantly vigilant about manipulations of language, ideas, and history that occur in every society so that we don't take any steps toward the world of the ant heap.<br /><br />This is an absolutely brilliant book, written with great passion in 1948 by a dying man concerned about the human condition.

Orwell lived during the era of the great dictatorships of the 20th Century and was acutely aware of the brainwashing techniques such regimes used to control their populations. The concepts are clearly and horrifically articulated so they rattle the brain - ideas such as Thoughtcrime, the scrutiny of our innermost mental processes, and newspeak - the rewriting of the language to prevent any freedom of expression.<br /><br />Yet, more than this, Big Brother can also be read as a piece of English pastoral - scenes where Winston Smith conducts his love affair with Julia in the countryside, and his dreams and memories of the 'rabbit bitten pasture' evoke a lament for a pastoral Britain in danger of being submerged by out of town shopping centres and motorway culture. George Orwell, changing his name from Eric Blair to encompass both England's patron saint and one of its main rivers, was a true patriot in the best sense. His writing holds moral clarity towards the best of British freedom, and encourages us to think for ourselves as to how to carve out our own independence.<br /><br />No, we are not currently living in a dictatorial regime, and whatever the shortcomings of the present parliamentary system it would be intellectually lazy and insulting to those who are living under such regimes to claim that we are. but Orwell's novel alerts us to the preciousness of the human mind, and its vulnerability to systemic outside forces that destabilise us.

We may look at George Orwell's 1984 in two ways: first, his description of the terror of totalitarianism, which his generation witnessed firsthand in the form of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia. Orwell does a masterful job of presenting such a world in its day-to-day reality, the unspoken weight of oppression found in police states, the everpresent fear that becomes natural after a while, the ease with which that fear eventually makes you just go along with it all.<br /><br />But history has also shown us that totalitarianism eventually burns itself out, that it cannot be sustained in the long run. This is scant reassurance for its millions of victims, true, but maybe a bit of hope for the rest of us. The second point about 1984, and the thing that makes it a masterpiece, is the way that it has shaped our culture today, not through its description of totalitarianism itself but the way it describes the very real methods used by governments and ideologies to control us. Terms like \\""doublethink\\"" are now a part of our daily discourse, describing not the subjects of totalitarian states like North Korea but the modern, wealthy democracies that claim to be free. And this is the most chilling message of Orwell's novel: you don't need to be in a totalitarian regime to be controlled by clever propaganda. You don't need to have the police cameras in your home. You only need the fear of them, or the belief that war is peace or that torture is justice or that history is a thing that the powerful are entitled to rewrite for their own ends.

A better description in literary form is not thinkable! That`s all old hat? Not at all!<br />Orwell is about advising against mechanisms which lead to such slavery of people. And these mechanisms are still going, even with us. He wants that everybody develops a feeling in order to become able to stop such wrong developments. No wonder that this book was on the black list of many dictatorships. Why? A dog that is hit will bark! But we are all hit since in this time of a progressing media age the ideal presuppositions for the complete exertion of influence and control of people are given. In totalitarian regimes of today it is for example often practise to block websites, so that only certain information currents are available. Talking about opinion-forming. That is to say the advantages of linking ways of information in our days can be reversed at any time to a disadvantage.

Justify your answer with specific examples.<br /><br />The 20th century produced a plethora of literary masterpieces. Choosing, and then asserting which novel is the most significant is supremely difficult - almost as difficult a choice as Abraham had when the Lord asked him to sacrifice his only son, Isaac. I personally love the mental stimulation in works of fiction. In particular I love the human drama and savage social criticisms that are found within fictional dystopias. As such, I believe the most significant novel of last century was `1984' by George Orwell. The book addresses (and attacks) issues of authoritative governments, propaganda, sectorisation, thought control, social classes, as well as rebellion, and love and hate.<br /><br />As a novel, `1984' is so highly regarded that it has been reprinted into some 65 world languages. This fact alone speaks volumes about the importance of this particular piece of literature. Orwell writes his novels for anyone who can read, albeit some people may find a dictionary necessary at times. By writing simply, Orwell doesn't exclude anyone from his novels.<br /><br />`1984' is simply written, easily read and thoroughly brilliant. It is about government totalitarianism in Britain - but it could be about any country on the planet. The government in the book are a brutal regime that use lies, propaganda, and power to keep their citizens in a state of fear and subjugation. We have seen Orwell's sage words come true in various world governments; including Zimbabwe, and perhaps more poignantly, North Korea. In fact, the word `Orwellian' stems from `1984', and can be used to refer to any tyrannical government.<br /><br />Winston Smith is the main character in the book. He works for the government and his job is to write propaganda - including wiping out official facts, and embellishing government statistics. The world is broken down into three super-states, and theBritish government he is part of is in `Oceania'. Here we see more future events scribed before the fact. Oceania can be regarded as similar to the modern day European Union. Currently, sectorisation is in progress all over the world. APEC, OPEC, the G20 and a host of other blocs and conglomerates reinforce this point.<br /><br />This literary masterpiece has been studied rigorously in various high school English classes all over the world, and this is testament to its significance as a novel. My high school used both `1984' and Orwell's other classic, `Animal Farm' as texts for senior English lessons. It is somewhat ironic though; that in the 21st century the `Big Brother' concept has been turned into a smutty, distasteful television program.<br /><br />`1984' is a book filled with human drama. It is about us not letting go of our democratic values, and making sure that we, the citizens, keep our governments transparent and accountable. It is about the courage of one man to rebel against tyranny, but sadly it also finishes with tyranny winning in the end. The book foresees actual historical events, and lets us know that dystopia is a possibility anywhere, anytime. `1984' is used in many classrooms around the world - and some aspects of it are part of modern day popular culture. These facts, as well as the points already outlined make this book the most significant novel of the twentieth century.",2009-09-14

Perhaps the most important (and least discussed) element of the story of 1984 is the doublethink of its author: Orwell's ability to condemn an outcome, while advocating its cause. Even as Orwell portrayed the corruption of socialist government in Animal Farm and the cruelty of totalitarian government in 1984, he insisted that these are perversions of socialism, rather than the inevitable fruit of socialism.<br /><br />This is the same foolish idea as Marx had; that human nature is malleable and can be forced to adapt to a socialist zeitgeist. Sadly, many people suffer the same delusion today; believing that government has the right to mold human nature rather than the responsibility to yield to human nature and respect our natural rights. Socialists do not like that human nature opposes slavery (i.e. socialism) and insist that with enough socialist indoctrination and through the force of socialist government, human nature can be remade to love subjugation.<br /><br />When we look to the troubling conclusion, it appears to be a break from the tradition of a successful resolution for the hero of the novel. Just as Brave New World ended with the State purging its misfits from its midst, 1984 ends with the arrest and reeducation of its misfit. Could it be that this was a successful conclusion in the mind of a socialist? Could it be that socialists are so wedded to their ideology that they have lost the ability to sympathize with human rights to liberty and freedom of conscience and would rather sympathize with the State? What if the ending reveals that the hero of a socialist novel was never meant to be the individual; is the hero in fact the State?",2009-07-06

I was immediately fascinated by the title. There was nothing particularly spectacular about the book's appearance, merely the numbers 1984 in a font that was rather friendly looking with only the tiny black silhouette of a running man printed along the spine indicating only the vaguest hints of what was written within.<br /><br />I had recently discovered science fiction and my interest was piqued by a title set that far into the future (to a twelve year old boy anyway) and I reasoned that it must surely have been a science fiction novel and evidently a good one I reasoned since it was an assigned book in school.<br /><br />Those were the days before we had VCR's (never mind DVDs and playable computer files) and as a twelve year old growing up in the Big Apple in that era I was pretty much at the mercy of adults as to what movies I saw and the few TV stations we had back then in regards to what science fiction they saw fit to broadcast. Since Star Wars and Alien were three and five years into the future you can imagine that there was a dearth of science fiction, most especially good science fiction. At that time I had only caught glimpses of 2001: A Space Odyssey at very inconvenient moments.<br /><br />Anyway I could not wait for it to be assigned to me, if at all (that year I got Shane instead) so on one of my many visits to my aunt across town I went around the corner from her apartment to The Grand Concourse where there was a tiny mom and pop book store (this was before the rise of mega bookstores as well) that kept a pretty good selection of sci-fi. To my surprise there were a couple of copies of 1984 not in the Sci-fi section but in the literature section and a few more in the classics section. Well excuse me.<br /><br />Remember that this was before Star Wars so my view of science fiction was not limited to space operas, in fact I was completely unaware of that kind of science fiction with the possible exception, later on, of Dune. The first science fiction book I ever read was Philip K Dick's The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, a great book but quite possibly the worst book you could choose to introduce a 10 - 11 year old to sci-fi, but the point is that I was not naïve enough to have any expectation of ray guns and the like. Anyway I read the synopsis on the back and for a moment I almost considered not spending my allowance on it but I went ahead anyway.<br /><br />By the time I finished this book I was not the same person I was when I started it.<br /><br />To this day there is no doubt in my mind that the course I was on in life prior to reading 1984 was no longer the course I found myself on after reading it. I was still a twelve year old boy with all the concerns of all twelve year old boys at the time (toys, summer fun and increasingly girls, who started becoming more interesting to me) but suddenly all of the real world concerns that I was largely shielded from became part of my conscious landscape and I began to experience a burgeoning appreciation of the apprehension the adults around me felt during times of national or world crises.<br /><br />George Orwell painted a picture of a world so horrific, so utterly devoid of hope (unless you reckon differently by considering the appendix as part of the story) and yet so seemingly plausible that its impact in the world of politics as well as the inclusion of phrases such as \\""Orwellian\\"", \\""Big Brother\\"" and \\""Double Think\\"" into the lexicon should come as no surprise.<br /><br />While it is true that ideology of the state described in 1984 is labeled INGSOC \\""English Socialism\\"" one should keep in mind that George Orwell was a Social Democrat and references are made in 1984 to some past betrayal, via the incoherent ramblings of a background character, that may be taken asa suggestion by Orwell as the primary reason as to why the state exists as rendered in 1984. I mention this lest one may assume that George Orwell may have viewed Socialism as inherently flawed for I truly believe he made the adopted ideology of the state in 1984 his own so that readers could not construe it as an attack on any particular ideology.<br /><br />I make this case not as a socialist or communist for I am not either, but rather to assure those readers that may find themselves avoiding this book because they fear that it may be a distortion and attack on their own political ideology. Rest assured that this novel is less a treatise on the evils of any particular ideology and more of an expose on the extreme measures undertaken by a totalitarian state to subject its citizen to whatever means are necessary to totally bend them to its collective will, right up to the point of not just breaking an individual's will but to the point of inverting it as well.<br /><br />What is key here, in spite of the compelling main story of a doomed and forbidden sexual affair, is the exhibition of engineered and finely tuned misery via endless war deliberately waged, not for the purposes of destroying a factual or imagined enemy, but rather for the dual purpose of wasting resources to keep the population in abject poverty and also to instill (or at least to coerce the appearance of) strong feelings of patriotism via nationalism which of course makes a foreign enemy necessary.<br /><br />Orwell also deftly illustrates that a dystopia of this kind cannot rely solely on a foreign enemy to maintain its Iron grip on the populous as this does not allow sufficient reason for the state to wage war against those citizens who would question it and undermine its authority. A common domestic enemy is also necessary; one that may actually be in league with the various foreign and interchangeable enemies and who, by virtue of their proximity within the state, are also in a position to sabotage the country's war efforts by the use of terrorist's tactics or by fomenting the rot of rebellion from within.<br /><br />Some citizens might actually suppose that they could benefit from losing the war, surely life could not be worse than it already is and they may consider taking their chances with an enemy invader; enter Emmanuel Goldstein the big domestic terrorist boogeyman who is largely an invention of the state and therefore a tool to entrap \\""thought criminals\\"" as well as serving, along with his anonymous followers, as a focal point for patriotic rage the expression of which is mandated by a necessarily public ritual called the \\""two minutes hate\\"".<br /><br />Orwell creates (in his fictitious state of Oceana) an endless logic loop in which the state relies on notions of patriotism and in which all citizens without thinking feel the need to protect their now antiquated notions of the nationhood (as opposed to the state). This is in spite of the fact that the state has drifted far from when such patriotism or any sense of duty to country actually made sense. As it is there is no real escape, for Oceana's deadly \\""enemies\\"" Eurasia and Eastasia are similarly governed, indeed they cannot exist as is without each other.<br /><br />1984 is a world of near constant and near inescapable surveillance even within the confines of one's home. What is being attempted here however is not necessarily the documentation of any activity you or I would consider a crime for the purposes of prosecution but rather an attempt to discern any possible hint that the citizen may be committing a \\""thought crime\\"", that is harboring any negative feelings toward the state or its titular head \\""Big Brother\\"", for the purposes of \\""correcting\\"" the citizen as the state cannot allow dissidents or martyrs.<br /><br />It is a world in which parents fear their children who are the primary agents of the state responsible for the capture of more thought criminals than any state agency.<br /><br />Itis also a world in which there is an active state program laboring to narrow the range of thought by reducing the English language year by year to the final aim of a converting it to some sort of rudimentary drone-speak. Why have the word \\""bad\\"" when \\""good\\"" already implies its opposite and the word \\""un-good\\"" will suffice? Why stop there? There would eventually be no need for phrases such as \\""great\\"", \\""marvelous\\""  or \\""fantastic\\"" or  any variation of such when one can merely say \\""good\\"" \\""plus good\\"" and \\""double plus good\\"". The reasoning is that if you strip language down to its most elementary stage, stopping just short of interfering with society's ability to function you can do away with entire concepts such as freedom and civil rights.<br /><br />In Orwell's nightmare sex for pleasure is a punishable crime not for any of the usual reasons of morality but because the state wants you to channel all your energies toward being a productive citizen of the state for the sake of the state.<br /><br />In 1984 society has been dived into three classes.<br /><br />1.

This is in spite of the fact that the state has drifted far from when such patriotism or any sense of duty to country actually made sense. As it is there is no real escape, for Oceana's deadly \\""enemies\\"" Eurasia and Eastasia are similarly governed, indeed they cannot exist as is without each other.<br /><br />1984 is a world of near constant and near inescapable surveillance even within the confines of one's home. What is being attempted here however is not necessarily the documentation of any activity you or I would consider a crime for the purposes of prosecution but rather an attempt to discern any possible hint that the citizen may be committing a \\""thought crime\\"", that is harboring any negative feelings toward the state or its titular head \\""Big Brother\\"", for the purposes of \\""correcting\\"" the citizen as the state cannot allow dissidents or martyrs.<br /><br />It is a world in which parents fear their children who are the primary agents of the state responsible for the capture of more thought criminals than any state agency.<br /><br />It is also a world in which there is an active state program laboring to narrow the range of thought by reducing the English language year by year to the final aim of a converting it to some sort of rudimentary drone-speak. Why have the word \\""bad\\"" when \\""good\\"" already implies its opposite and the word \\""un-good\\"" will suffice? Why stop there? There would eventually be no need for phrases such as \\""great\\"", \\""marvelous\\""  or \\""fantastic\\"" or  any variation of such when one can merely say \\""good\\"" \\""plus good\\"" and \\""double plus good\\"". The reasoning is that if you strip language down to its most elementary stage, stopping just short of interfering with society's ability to function you can do away with entire concepts such as freedom and civil rights.<br /><br />In Orwell's nightmare sex for pleasure is a punishable crime not for any of the usual reasons of morality but because the state wants you to channel all your energies toward being a productive citizen of the state for the sake of the state.<br /><br />In 1984 society has been dived into three classes.<br /><br />1.

Perhaps the most important (and least discussed) element of the story of 1984 is the doublethink of its author: Orwell's ability to condemn an outcome, while advocating its cause. Even as Orwell portrayed the corruption of socialist government in Animal Farm and the cruelty of totalitarian government in 1984, he insisted that these are perversions of socialism, rather than the inevitable fruit of socialism.<br /><br />This is the same foolish idea as Marx had; that human nature is malleable and can be forced to adapt to a socialist zeitgeist. Sadly, many people suffer the same delusion today; believing that government has the right to mold human nature rather than the responsibility to yield to human nature and respect our natural rights. Socialists do not like that human nature opposes slavery (i.e. socialism) and insist that with enough socialist indoctrination and through the force of socialist government, human nature can be remade to love subjugation.<br /><br />When we look to the troubling conclusion in which the rebellion is crushed and minds are retrained by imprisonment and indoctrination, it appears to be a break from the tradition of a successful resolution for the hero of the novel. Could it be that this was a successful conclusion in the mind of a socialist? Just as Brave New World ended with society purging its misfits from its midst, 1984 ends with the arrest and reeducation of its misfit.<br /><br />Could it be that socialists are so wedded to their ideology that they have lost the ability to sympathize with human rights to liberty and freedom of conscience and would rather sympathize with the State? What if the ending reveals that the hero of a socialist novel was never meant to be the individual; is the hero in fact the State?",2009-06-09

It shows a government under which no one can trust anyone. Everyone has to watch what is said to everyone because there is always a chance that the other person they are talking to is a spy.<br /> It starts off with Winston questioning what is going on in the government. He is wanting to revolt against them. He realizes that all the people are changing the history everyday to go with what the government says.<br /> He isn't careful of what he does and he gets caught. That goes back to always watching what the characters say around other people because if they aren't careful, they will get caught. That leads to George Orwell's purpose of this novel.<br /> George Orwell was a very good writer. He had a reoccurring theme in this book and in Animal Farm, which was communism. In 1984, he showed his vision of how the world would be if communism took over. There would be no freedom, and one supreme ruler, or in the book, Big Brother.<br /> Orwell accomplished his goal in this book. He was warning people against the negative aspects of communism. It may have been a little dramatic, but still there is not much freedom in communist countries. He showed that the government would have a hand in everything, even what people said in private.<br /> This book has many strengths and a couple weaknesses in it. The first strength is that it is written very well. It is put together so that everything fits together perfectly. Another strength is that it is a very enticing book. Once the reader picks the book up he or she can't stop reading it until it's done. The one weakness it has is the ending. It somewhat just cuts the reader off at the ending. It basically says Winston gave up on loving Julia and he accepted the party. So, Orwell is saying that Winston gave up and accepted communism. Overall though, it was an excellent book.",2009-05-03

Dystopia literature owes it all to this classic of the genre. I managed to get through all my formal education without having read this text. However, picking it up now I am glad that I waited until I was a little older to read it.<br />The first thing one must marvel at is the brilliant construction of the novel. Orwell as an artist is at the top of his form and the structure of the novel is wound so tightly that readers would be wise to annotate the text as there is an almost cyclical nature to many of the themes and ideas presented. Orwell weaves the same ideas throughout the text, and each time he revisits them he shows them through the lenses of a different ideology or character and thus emphasizes for the reader how precarious (and precious) are the mores and ideals of the individual mind.<br /> The idea of governments who yearn for power for power's sake is not so foreign to our early 21st century world, and although the text ends on a nihilistic note, the reader walks away from \\""1984\\"" with the renewed impetus to revere and respect our individual thoughts, as these, and these alone, give us unique value. Read this text, not so you can fear \\""big brother\\"", but rather so you can be reminded to respect yourself enough  to think and form intellectual thoughts. It is Winston's loss of the self that should frighten the readers of \\""1984\\"", not the dreary world that Orwell creates. We don't need totalitarian governments to become Winston Smiths.

The main character is Winston Smith, a disgruntled middle class office worker who secretly harbors a hatred of The Party. The world in which Winston lives is divided into three super states: Oceana, Eurasia, and Eastasia. Winston lives in London, the capital of Oceana, which is ruled by a totalitarian regime known as The Party, and it's leader Big Brother. The Party does not allow any dissent against it and even thinking rebellious thoughts is a crime. They change history to their liking and falsify endless documents to be in their favor. Winston does not know what is true and what is lies. The Party is constantly watching Winston and he must be careful not to give himself away. He eventually starts a love affair with a woman named Julia, who also hates The Party and all that it stands for. They get in touch with an inner party member named O'Brien who claims to be part of a rebel organization known as the Brotherhood. He is actually a party spy and Winston and Julia are eventually arrested. Winston is interrogated and tortured to try and force him to accept the party ideals. Eventually he is subjected to his worst nightmare, having his face eaten by rats. He begs that they do it to Julia instead, breaking his most important promise not to betray her. His soul destroyed, Winston is released. He no longer loves Julia and has learned to love Big Brother and The Party. This book is a very bleak view of what George Orwell saw the world becoming in 1949. Although it is quite disturbing this book makes you think a lot and is very well written. I recommend this if you like other George Orwell books as well as depressing novels.",2008-06-15
US,15710600,R3QNN1DO2VK169,0452284236,337991686,"1984",Books,5,2,2,N,N,"my first Orwell, and I'm already hooked","I think this is my favorite novel about a dystopia.  So far, I have read \\""We\\"", \\""A Handmaid's Tale\\"", \\""Brave New World\\"", \\""Anthem\\"", and \\""A Clockwork Orange\\"", and though I have thoroughly enjoyed quite a few of the novels that I've listed, 1984 is my absolute favorite.  How is it different?  The main character, Winston, if not entirely likable, is very relatable.  What I like most about him is that he doesn't assume to be anything or know anything, but rather, he feels instinctively that something is wrong with how the world is set up.  He is not especially intelligent (although he's not exactly stupid either) or strong-willed or moral or handsome.  And as if to emphasize Winston's relatable mediocrity, Orwell gave him an exceedingly boring office job!  In some novels about dystopias, the protagonist can be overly heroic (as in Anthem) or tragic (as in a Handmaid's Tale), and thus more admirable but also a lot less relatable.<br /><br />Another thing that is different . . . this book gives you different perspectives.  Orwell's theme of government control over language is pretty common in this genre, but because he took his thesis a little farther than merely saying that government control is bad, the book is an interesting read.  He even gets a little into metaphysics.  As a reader, you also get the perspectives of different characters in the book, and thus, the perspectives of both the government and of rebels.  Often, books in this genre can be very straight-foward, but 1984, with its many twists, is a very worthwhile read.",2008-06-14

One-too-many references to Big Brother amid the post-911 proliferation of video cameras, wire-tapping, and concern about government intrusions into private life pushed me to question my own cultural literacy (thanks to author E.D. Hirsch, Jr. here).  My job also sent me to southern Sudan in 2007, during which a colleague noted that I would need to visit a rather remote \\""Orwellian province\\"".  It turns out that province is called Unity State.  After reading 1984, I get his drift.<br /><br />It also occurred to me that the TV phenomenon Big Brother was likely produced by staffers who found themselves in their teens or early adulthood during 1984, while the audience to whom it caters may largely have been born well after that year.  Given a generation who knows Big Brother not as the incarnation of thinly veiled government despotism but as the product of CBS Prime Time, there was reason to question more than my own cultural literacy.  But what, or whom, we really need to discuss is Winston Smith.<br /><br />Best I can tell, Winston Smith is me.  Modern man; modern society but faced with the reality that government had morphed into political, economic, sociological, technological, and intellectual fiat - its greatest coup perhaps being the subtle control of free thinking.  By changing content of archival media, limiting contact with others, or simply eliminating those who dare _remember_, all that matters is current perception, regardless of logical inconsistency.  And if this is achieved, then Smith's government (for lack of a better term) is, and always has been, right and just.  For if you never learned (or never remember learning) that 2 + 2 = 4, then 2 + 2 = 5 seems quite plausible.<br /><br />The problem is that Smith dares to remember - dares to become conscious that another manner of thinking exists beyond the required and ubiquitous application of Doublethink, which he describes as follows:  \\""Toknow and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget, whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself - that was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed.\\""<br /><br />As the book opens, Smith fails to \\""consciously induce unconsciousness\\"", the mere act of which is considered a crime - Thoughtcrime, to be precise.  The sort of awareness with which he is left can culminate in nothing other than action, and action which can culminate in nothing other than death.  \\""He was already dead, he reflected.  It seemed to him that it was only now, when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step.  The consequences of every act are included in the act itself.  He wrote, 'Thoughtcrime does not entail death: Thoughtcrime IS death.'  Now that he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible.\\""<br /><br />This book is compelling because of the pains Orwell has taken to conceptualize a world in which government has conquered thought life as the last bastion of liberty.  Once memory and perception is controlled, what better way to direct the mindless fervor of the masses than to create focal personifications for polarizing emotions:  one to love (Big Brother) and one to hate (Emmanuel Goldstein).  As such, manipulated thought can become concentrated action with the purpose of maintaining the entire regime in perpetuity.<br /><br />It almost seems as if Orwell is trying to answer the question, \\""How bad could it (government) get?\\"" to which it is tempting to reply, \\""How realistic is his answer?\\"" Because so many of us, so many Winston Smiths, have seen smatterings of Orwell's answer in recent developments, there is good reason to be guarded and better reason to be proactive in the defense of intellectual freedom.  Looking at the China, Burma, North Korea, and even western democracies of our day, it is easy to see hints of Doublethink and more overt evidence of a paralyzing fear of independent thought.  But there is little reason to suspect that government can achieve a more frightening end: that of transforming the essence of humankind. Yet this is precisely where Orwell takes the reader.  Smith's nemesis O'Brien notes, \\""The command of the totalitarians was 'Thou shalt.' Our command is 'Thou art.'\\""  While this book is an excellent call to political and intellectual vigilance, the day government controls our essence as humans is the day government merits consideration as deity.  Until then, I remain thankful for my ability to think otherwise.",2008-06-09

Psychopaths lack conscience and hunger for the darkness. They are sadistic in a way which, for us, is near impossible to fathom. The evil which they bring is not unintended, as when we realize only after the fact that our actions have caused another harm. Instead, their lives are spent feeding on the misery that they inflict on others. Whether the sexual sadism of serial rapist-torturer, or the subtle draining of a \\""toxic co-worker\\"" who uses you, abuses you, and wears you down until you lose all grip on reality. We may even ask in desperation, \\""What are you doing this to me?\\"" The psychopath simply smirks. And in a world ruled by psychopaths we ask, \\""Why are you doing this to us?\\""<br /><br />1984 frightens us because psychopathy frightens us. The key feature of a pathocracy is that psychopaths influence the economic, military, political, and cultural agenda of a nation. Like chameleons, they mask themselves in the features of their surroundings. Within those parameters they stage dramas, creating a new reality according to their desires. And this reality is one of deception, terror, ruthless expansion and complete heartlessness.<br /><br />In the corporate world a psychopath gets ahead by destroying the careers of those who stand in his way, exploiting the work of others, starting rumors, creating conflicts. He always benefits from these, of course. A competitor falls out of favor. The psychopath is credited with the work of another. The bosses take his word over another who sees that he is a snake. An \\""enemy\\"" finds herself without a job, blamed for something she didn't do. All the while the psychopath stage-manages. The man behind the curtain.<br /><br />In politics, the pawns are the people, the chessboard is the world stage. Strategic countries are invaded because of the \\""threat\\"" they pose. This threat is 0f course created by the psychopaths in charge using the vast resources of intelligence services. \\""Terrorist threats\\"" are fabricated.

US,50058656,R3I7TQWNUANLX4,0452284236,337991686,"1984",Books,5,11,13,N,N,"Big Brother Is Watching You.","_Nineteen Eighty Four_, first published in 1949 by George Orwell (pen name of Eric Blair), is a horrifying dystopian novel of a world in which the individual human being has been completely degraded and deprived of his fundamental humanity that reflects the totalitarianisms of the day, particularly communism and Stalinism.  George Orwell (1903 - 1950) was the pen name of the British author Eric Blair, who developed an early enmity towards those in power and their abuses of power.  Orwell was a socialist but came to witness the horrors of the Soviet state and the betrayal of his ideals by Stalinists.  As such, Orwell came to loathe totalitarianism in general and wrote novels showing the degrading effects such societies had on people.  Throughout this book, one can witness the underlying hatred of Orwell and those imprisoned by the system for the totalitarian state and bureaucracy which completely controls their lives and existences.  This book in particular shows that rage in the main character of Winston Smith, a mere pawn in a totalitarian society.  Orwell's books are indeed prophetic and show us a world in which the very life-force has been sapped out of mankind by those in power.  Orwell imagines a highly efficient totalitarian state, capable of enforcing political correctness at the highest levels, tampering with the memories of men, and maintaining a total disregard for the truth.  Orwell shows how under such regimes the very notion of truth becomes suspect and the individual can no longer distinguish between fact and state propaganda.  This particularly applies to the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin, which is the primary setting for Orwell's stories.  However, Orwell's books are also applicable to the West of today, where the constant menace of totalitarian ideology exists.<br /><br />_1984_ gives us a whole slew of new terminology to describe the situation as it exists in a totalitarian state in which political correctness is enforced.  The book introduces such terms as thought police, thought crime (and thought criminal), doublethink, memory hole, Ingsoc, and Newspeak.  Such terms reflect the complete disregard of the totalitarian state for the truth and the active promotion of propaganda within society.  They have also largely entered into our culture as expressions to describe the enforcement of political correctness.<br /><br />_1984_ focuses on the main character Winston Smith, a member of the Outer Party who lives in England and works for the Ministry of Truth.  As it turns out, the Ministry of Truth ironically is responsible for spreading propaganda, and as all ministries mentioned by Orwell has a purpose exactly opposite to its stated purpose.  The world of 1984 is a very bleak one indeed, run by a single party and its ruling leader \\""Big Brother\\"", in which all individuals are subject to surveillance by the state should they commit a \\""thought crime\\"".  All expressions of individuality in 1984 have been wiped out and the human being is totally degraded living a pathetic existence of total subservience to the party.  Sexuality has been suppressed as part of the \\""Anti-sex League\\"" as well as religion.  Truth itself is highly malleable and memory is constantly distorted, reflected in such ironical and oxymoronic sayings of the party as \\""War Is Peace\\"", \\""Freedom Is Slavery\\"", and \\""Ignorance Is Strength\\"".  Further, the nation of Oceania is constantly at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia, varying from day to day and reflected in the official propaganda of the state bureaucracy.  All party members revere their leader \\""Big Brother\\"" (perhaps reminiscent of Josef Stalin or other totalitarian dictators) and despise  the rebellious \\""Goldstein\\"" (perhaps reminiscent of the Soviet hatred for Leon Trotsky).  Further, the party exists in a caste system in which the \\""proles\\"" (the proletariat) live underneath the party members (who are divided into the Inner and Outer Party).  Winston Smith works for the Ministry of Truth but begins to keep a diary (which is strictly forbidden to party members) in which he reflects his hatred for \\""Big Brother\\"".  His work involves developing propaganda for the party.  At work he meets up with Julia, who he initially believes is a strict orthodox member of the party.  However, eventually he comes to realize that Julia is in love with him and they have a secret encounter in the countryside.  Eventually Julia expresses to Winston her complete loathing for the party, though she publicly maintains a persona of utter obeisance and orthodoxy and belongs to the \\""Anti-sex League\\"".  Together they find a new hiding place in a shop in a part of the city where the \\""proles\\"" live and attempt to re-discover the past of England.  Throughout this period, however, the two live in constant fear of the thought police, should they catch onto their affair.  Eventually, Winston meets up with O'Brien at work, a man who he believes is a member of the Resistance, and is given a copy of Goldstein's book which explains the rise of the party and the need for perpetual war.  Orwell quotes extensively from Goldstein's book which reflects much of the social thinking of the time, in particular the theory of managerial elites.  However, Winston and Julia are captured by the party and it turns out that O'Brien is in fact a member of the party.  While taken captive, both are tortured and made to recant their original beliefs about the party.  In a particularly disgusting scene, Winston is taken to Room 101 where he must face his worst fear.  There he ultimately betrays Julia (as she has already betrayed him) to save himself from being tortured by rats (the worst torture that he can imagine).  Eventually, Winston is completely re-educated and made to love \\""Big Brother\\"" while his relationship with Julia is forever changed after their mutual betrayals of each other.  Thus, ends in the most horrifying of manners Orwell's classic novel.  Orwell concludes with an appendix on \\""The Principles of Newspeak\\"" which effectively shows how even the language itself can be put to the purposes of propaganda within a totalitarian state.<br /><br />_1984_ remains a classic dystopia reflecting the darker side of human existence within the Twentieth Century as it played out in the totalitarian dictatorships of the age.  Throughout this novel, the very notion of truth remains problematic, as the party re-defines history to reflect its own agenda and thus even memory itself becomes distorted.  Orwell shows the sheer degradation that the human being undergoes within such a surveillance society, to the eventual point where a man can be tortured by the powers that be to such an extent that he will eventually even renounce his love and embrace the figure he hates the most.  While the novel is made to reflect Soviet society and Stalinism in particular, it also reflects the modern world in general, in which large-scale and efficient bureaucratic structures rob man of his humanity.  Orwell's novels prove particularly prescient warnings to mankind to avoid the dangers of totalitarianism.  As such, they should be read by all thinking individuals who seek to understand the horrors that can be inflicted upon the human being through totalistic societies.",2007-09-24

Winston is a 39-year-old man who works for the Party at the Ministry of Truth, which has an ironic name because Winston's job is actually to doctor reality so that the Party always appears infallible.  Winston sees that while the Party, under the leadership of Big Brother, claims surpluses of everything, no one can buy simple items like razor blades or shoelaces.  As he becomes disillusioned by the Party's rule, he and a young woman named Julia begin a torrid secret affair.  Then he is contacted by a man high up in the Party named O'Brien who works for a resistance group known as the Brotherhood.  But before he can help the Brotherhood, Winston is betrayed, arrested, and taken to the dungeons of the Ministry of Love, where he endures physical and psychological torment that threatens to break him and strip him of all humanity.<br /><br />As it is written, Big Brother and his Party would seem to represent the fascist or Communist movements of the 1940s.  Taken literally it would be easy to dismiss the book as an archaic remnant of Cold War hysteria.  But  the beauty of \\""1984\\"" is that because it focuses on the internal struggle for Winston Smith's soul, it can transcend all that.  For the warning in \\""1984\\"" isn't about communism or fascism, but the threat of letting anyone crush the human spirit through overbearing dogma.<br /><br />Much like faithful Christians of every generation have painted everyone from the Pope to Hitler as the Antichrist, every generation looks for its Big Brother.

I realize that the powers that be always have their own agenda, which invariably differs completely from the people's interests. It has led me to do my own research (now far easier on the internet than in the NYC libraries with their budget-slashed hours I could never coordinate with). It has led down some frightening paths that more people should be going down, for truly we are living in Nineteen Eighty-Four this very minute.<br />And as a bit of clarification, Orwell was not \\""predicting\\"" this dystopia for 1984, as some have written here.

It is a surveillance society in a nation always at war with an amorphous enemy. Fear is the Government's weapon of choice and the image of omniscience and omnipotence it projects upon its people is seemingly insurmountable. The society is deeply stratified and hierarchical with the privileged few at the core going out to the tentative citizens and the listless prolatariat (called proles) at the very bottom of the pile. The story surrounds a very common man and his struggle to be fully 'himself' in a society that frowns upon individualism and independent thought.<br /><br />The context of this book renders it somewhat prophetic of the past 8 or so years of the Western world. Orwell's insight is worthy of canonization because of how right he seems to be about the tools of societal control and influence. He includes the dubious 'tele-screens' eerily reminiscent of the broadcast media, numberless CC TV cameras employed by some cities and perhaps even the ubiquitous Internet and vulnerability it implies on our privacy. Then there is the growing power of Homeland Security laws.<br /><br />Orwell seems like he may be attacking autocrats and dictators but there may be another agenda. It is not Big Brother himself that is to be feared but the system which he represents. The Goverment is as faceless as their ceaseless enemy and Orwell depicts a society that slowly became what it was with time. Can he be saying that any society is prone to the evils of control?<br /><br />The fight of our hero is admirable and leaves us questioning the role of the individual in society.

Really, nothing could be farther from the truth. The world set up by Orwell, over seen by Big Brother and his invisible band of Thought Police, has people political prisoners within their own country. Winston, a worker in the Record Department of one of the three ministries (The Ministry of Truth, or Minitrue), finds his mind resisting the world he's given, not completely accepting the \\""news\\"" he's given, as well as doubting his contentment. He enters into a relationship, finds himself contacted by an underground resistance, and comes to discover some of the more dangerous traits of the Party. Orwell's \\""1984\\"" is an extremely well written political masterpiece, which traces societal trends in an innovative and pessimistic sort of way.<br /><br />From the beginning, Orwell introduces new touches of technology made from innovations in his time. Things such as telescreens (basically televisions with the capability to communicate with and spy on members of the outer party) and speakwrites (a microphone that transcribes dictations) give a modern sense to the novel, while keeping it somewhat futuristic, even in modern times. No extravagant inventions like space ships or teleporters are touched on, so there isn't a feeling of inaccuracy or over-optimism that seems to be common in more ambitious science fiction media. Honestly, I found myself wishing that something such as a speakwrite existed for homework assignments, or even writing this very review; however, I didn't get that overwhelming sense of \\""Yeah right, nothing like THAT existed in 1984\\"" from the position of being here in 2007.<br /><br />Orwell brings out the political message of the novel most obviously by using the supposed revolutionary Goldstein's book. The chapters from Goldstein's book are inserted into 1984 as Winston reads them. Although these excerpts read something like stereo instructions or college dissertations, it really affirms the politics behind Orwell's writing. The three political bodies, or countries, in this novel consist of Oceania, Eurasia and East Asia. Oceania includes the United Kingdom, Eurasia includes the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and East Asia includes China and Japan. The fact that Orwell had the foresight to predict a lot of specific traits of world politics (such as the takeover of one party regimes in China) and the escalation of current world politics (such as the arms race and the containment policy against the Soviet Union) absolutely floored me. There were times when I was reading through sections of Goldstein's history where I simply had to put it down, because some of the events supposedly taking place in the fifties and sixties I had just learned about in my history class as taking place around then. That in and of itself is not only brilliant, but very powerful; just knowing that the book predicted some of the things that happened gives more credibility to the more radical things Orwell predicted. That's what's so strong about \\""1984;\\"" there's this sense of \\""It could happen.\\""<br /><br />SPOILER WARNINGS!<br /><br />Another strength of the novel was the relationship between Winston and Julia. Although I personally didn't like Julia - (she struck me as a very odd sort of a rebel who didn't even seem to know what she wanted) - her character was perfect for the novel. Her quirky unpredictability and her complete disregard for authority showed how even the most seemingly active Party members harbored deep reservations about the life they were living. Also, her somewhat shallow and lukewarm interest in politics was a good portrayal of theway people would begin to act after living under an oppressively totalitarian regime. It was admittedly strange to me how Winston was impressed by how many men Julia had managed to sleep with, but their relationship was still believable. Both of them had the fundamental desire to rebel against the system, and they channeled that towards sex. Fortunately, I couldn't personally relate to that, but it did represent a form of rebellion on Orwell's part against people who want to turn sex into a utility and take all of the pleasure out of it.<br /><br />The ending, however, was the most potent part of the novel. When Julia and Winston are caught and tortured, and Orwell describes the nightmarish ordeal Winston is put through, the reader really comes to understand how Winston develops. Throughout the entire novel, Winston's progression from a nervous rebel, to a carefree rebel, to a penitent traitor was perfectly delineated by Orwell. After Winston suffers through his torture and decries everything- his distaste for Big Brother, his suspicion of changing information, his mental rejection of double speak- he becomes just another guy. Another drone under Big Brother, a man who loves and follows Big Brother and works for Big Brother. At first, I admit I was disappointed. I kind of hoped for some sort of upset, a little sense of rebellion or even a feeling that something might have changed because of what Winston did. That lack of closure in that sense, however, was actually really good for the book though. It just shows how hopeless, how drone-like, how terrible an existence under a complete ruler can be, and how there really isn't any hope of the dystopian society changing after it has come in full swing. It really drove home that people should actively keep their most basic rights, and never let them slip away.<br /><br />\\""1984\\"" was one of the most contemporary feeling books I have ever read that was written before the 80's. It's well written, engaging, exciting and interesting, and provides intellectual fodder as well as personal enjoyment. There is suspense, love, and introspective thought, and the entire novel is building up towards the big twists on the end. Personally, I think \\""1984\\"" is one of the best of its kind, and was a better political metaphor than Alduous Huxley's \\""Brave New World\\"" or even Orwell's own \\""Animal Farm.\\"" However, you'll never be able to look at your government the same again- Big Brother is watching you.",2007-05-21

In this vision of the future, the people exist to serve the purposes of \\""The Party\\"" and \\""Big Brother\\"" is the personification of the Party.  Big Brother not only spies on people and control their actions, he tries to read and control their thoughts and emotions.

One of the clearest incarnations of this control is Newspeak, the Party's new language, designed to limit the ability to think or express forbidden ideas or feelings.<br /><br />While the idea of \\""Big Brother\\"" is generally used to caution against government encroachments into privacy, this book is really more about the freedom of thought and emotion, and its importance in defining us as human.  It is only when we are free to think and feel and believe as we wish that we are truly free.  While the loss of privacy can threaten our ability to think freely, we must be on guard against other, more insidious attacks on free thought.  Perhaps the greater danger rests in blind belief, without critical thought.

In fact, Orwell was a socialist himself. During the Spanish Civil War, he fought for a revolutionary party called POUM, \\""the Workers Party for Marxist Unification\\"".

During this time, many intellectuals believed that Stalinism and capitalism would eventually merge, creating a new system, combining the worst aspects of both. This feared system of the future was often called \\""bureaucratic collectivism\\"". Rizzi, Schachtman and Burnham believed it could happen. Trotsky vacillated on the issue. Orwell must have believed in the grim possibility of \\""bureaucratic collectivism\\"" himself. That is what his novel is really all about.<br /><br />\\""1984\\"" is set in a futuristic society called Oceania. On the surface, Oceania is Stalinist. But on a closer look, it actually looks like a strange mixture of the Soviet Union and the British Empire. On the one hand, Oceania has a unproductive planned economy. On the other hand, it fights for colonial supremacy in Africa and Asia. Indeed, its main bases of power are the Anglo-Saxon nations.<br /><br />The ideology of Oceania is called \\""English Socialism\\"", an obvious combination of the British and the Soviet. Oceania is run by a party, divided into the Inner Party and the Outer Party. The underclass is called proles. This is both a reference to the hierarchic Stalinist party in the USSR, and to the traditional British class structure: upper class (Inner Party), middle class (Outer Party) and working class (the proles).

From \\""Thought Police\\"" to \\""Big Brother,\\"" Orwell has defined the potentiality of a future government gone mad. This novel is a classic with all the right aspects.<br /><br /> 1984 is based on a man's curiosity of change turning into an adventure through a power structure we come to know as Big Brother, and his obsession of rebellion, however silent, which later turns into a nightmare. George Orwell puts you into this man's shoes to experience what psychological and physical torment such oppression would bring. You read the text as though it were a history lesson in the future. In the story Orwell demonstrates what it would be like in a power-driven socialistic society. For example: Winston Smith (the subject) works at the Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and fine arts. His job was to correct, or retype, all the history books, or any literature of historical facts for that matter. This was because the Republic was trying to erase any history, and memory, of the past; the way things were before the rise of Big Brother. This demonstrates the ideas and intensions of the regime; to have complete control over the truths, freedoms, and thoughts of humanity.<br /><br /> That is really what this book is about; the regime, the power, the insanity and possibilities of an authoritarian rule. Now I'm not saying that you have to be a total anarchist in order to appreciate this book, it is, however, important to understand how power, or total control, can overcome and obliterate the freedoms and ideas that make us who we are. George Orwell has expressed this daunting initiative and should acquire the respect he deserves.",2006-03-11

George Orwell was to British socialism what Robert Higgs is to American conservatism.  Higgs can see through the propaganda and information warfare propagated by the British sleeper cell in Washington and he sees George W. Bush as the anti-American, anti-conservative monstrous tyrant that he is.<br /><br />Orwell, who worked for the BBC during World War II and was therefore quite familiar with the state's disinformation methods in support of information warfare, could see right through Stalin's disinformation as easily as Higgs can see through Bush's today.  Bothersome to Orwell was his fellow socialists refusal to see the truth on Stalin or that Soviet Communism was actually a betrayal of socialism.  Orwell wrote \\""Animal Farm\\"" just to make this point.  Yet too many socialists remained duped over Stalin just as too many conservatives remain duped today by George W. Bush and his army of word-pushers.<br /><br />So Orwell set out to write \\""1984\\"" to explain to us how people are duped by statist techniques of information warfare; how people can believe \\""WAR IS PEACE\\""; and how socialists were duped by Stalin.  He drew heavily upon his experiences at the BBC where he had signed the Official Secrets Act barring him from mentioning anything he had done.  So he set the novel in the future and maintained that any similarities were pure coincidence in order to cover himself from being charged with violating the Official Secrets Act.<br /><br />In 1984, there is a dreary monotony of provision in society rather than a vibrant free market; the heavy hand of the state has stunted everything. Food is bland and often rationed.  Technical innovations are controlled by the state; two-way wall-sized televisions spy on people; the Thought Police (a futuristic version of Homeland Security, or is it vice-versa?) monitors thoughtcrime.  Hidden microphones add to their NSA-like arsenal of state control and state terrorism.<br /><br />The novel's main character is Winston Smith - nearly forty and one of the few remaining humans that can remember having parents, who had sacrificed their lives to the state so that the youthful Winston may have a chance at life.  He works for the State as a wordpusher, rewriting current events and even history books - turning history into \\""his story\\"".  Yet, he is society's few remaining yet hidden libertarians - a person who thinks and feels for himself.  Watched always, he must remain on guard to never betray any emotion.<br /><br />The plot centers around Winston meeting a female supporter of the Party whose hidden agenda is much more hedonistic.  They have a relationship between them, at the risk of all.  In fact, they know their relationship is doomed and their actions to be suicidal.  The heavy weight of the state looming over their heads is tragic.  Like an Iraqi or Afghan today, they never know when the crushing weight of the state will descend.<br /><br />In the end, the state catches up with the two individualists.  They are arrested and sent to a type of Guantanamo Bay where Winston is finally broken by his fear of rats - \\""Do it to Julia!  Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don't care what you do to her. . . Not me! Julia! Not me!\\"". Winston lost his love for Julia - his ability to sacrifice himself on behalf of another. Yet through sacrifice lies our hope.<br /><br />Pynchon's Foreward is awesome: \\""This grouping of Britain and the United States into a single bloc, as prophecy, has turned to be dead-on\\"", he wrote.  Actually, Orwell probably knew something about the British sleeper cell dispatched to Washington to pull America back into the second part of the world war.  Orwell probably knew, too, that FDR provoked the Japanese to hit Pearl Harbor and sat on his hands while they did it, sothat the Yanks would become war crazy and provide the brawn to British empire (which they did).  Nicholas John Cull's \\""Selling War\\"" is a good review of the British sleeper cell.<br /><br />Today, Bush and Blair are doing American-powered British empire hand-in-hand.  An American can only wonder what George Washington would say?!!  But I wonder, too, what Orwell would say?

After Eton, Eric joined the Indian Imperial Police and he served five years in Burma. He resigned in 1927 as he disliked the political system which treated other races as inferior. He also wanted to concentrate on being a writer.<br /><br />Eric Blair decided to move away from the relatively privileged and pleasant life of the middle class and join the working class. He, therefore, changed his name to George Orwell. He then went to live with the poor in London and Paris, whom he considered to be victims of injustice.

Orwell's gloomy depiction of life in Oceania (his future version of London) is realistic and convincing.

Although we all know by now that our 1984 (dominated by the MTV/big-hair/yuppie culture) has occurred very differently and that the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s marked the final triumph of liberal-democracy over socialism/Marxism, Orwell's `1984' remains relevant today as a warning against a post-global age of resurging absolutism and religious fundamentalism.

He wrote the book in 1949, envisioning the future of man.  He believed that there would be dictatorship by the government by 1984.<br /><br /> The novel's main character is Winston Smith.  He doubts the system or the government, in which is Big Brother that's controls Oceania, one of the three super states.  Winston is older than most citizens of the super state.  He slightly remembers life before Big Brother.  Big Brother would prefer people not to know the past.  Though his memories are indistinct, he thinks that life must have been better before Big Brother's leadership.  As Winston's rebellion progresses, he meets Julia, who is also against Big Brother.  Winston and Julia become lovers and confess their rebelliousness to O'Brien, who is believed to be a member of a rebel group called Brotherhood.  Then comes the story's climax.  The reader will be introduced to what's behind 1984.  George Orwell brings suspense in the story when he shows us what is really behind Big Brother.  Big Brother uses mental manipulation to influence its citizens.  This book reminds us of political tragedies, how the government can control everything.  George Orwell reminds us of what went wrong, what can go wrong, and what will go wrong when the government becomes all-powerful.  I believe that this book opened my mind to politics.  1984 is one of the best books written.  Orwell writes about reality and bases its contents to the real world.",2005-10-22

Totalitarianism is a characteristic of a government or state in which one political party maintains complete control under a dictatorship and bans all others.<br /><br />This story, which takes place in London in 1984, follows one man (named Winston Smith) and his love interest (Julia) as they struggle against this totalitarian party (\\""The Party\\"") whose leader (actually dictator) is \\""Big Brother.\\""  The Party political orthodoxy rules the giant country of \\""Oceania\\"" (in which London is located).<br /><br />At the heart of this party's political orthodoxy is the process of controlling thought through the manipulation of language and information by the use of \\""Newspeak\\"" which utilizes what is called \\""doublethink.\\""<br /><br />Newspeak is the official language of Oceania (but is not the only language spoken).  It is a language that eliminates unnecessary words and is designed to diminish rather than help expressive thought.  For example, Newspeak states that there is no good and bad but only good and \\""ungood.\\""  Doublethink is the ability to simultaneously hold two opposing ideas in ones mind and believe in them both.  The three Party slogans that title this review are examples of doublethink.  Another good example is that (2+ 2 =4) and (2 + 2 = 5).<br /><br />The Party keeps everybody in line through Newspeak and doublethink.  But they also have other methods.  For example, they have the \\""Thought Police\\"" that investigate \\""thoughtcrimes.\\""  These are \\""crimes\\"" of just having negative thoughts about The Party.  Another example are telescreens that watch your every move even in bathroom stalls.  Thus, \\""Big Brother is watching you\\"" at all times.<br /><br />Winston and Julia are discovered to be guilty of thoughtcrimes by O'Brien (who is the personification of The Party).  O'Brien also represents those leaders who use cruelty and torture as their primary method of control (like Hitler and Stalin did).  He makes them pay for their \\""crimes.\\""<br /><br />This novel clearly shows how totalitarianism negatively affects the human spirit and how it's impossible to remain freethinking under such circumstances.<br /><br />This novel also contains an appendix written by Orwell.  Here he explains various aspects of Newspeak and to my surprise he states that by the year 2050, Newspeak will be the only language that anyone will understand.  Why does he state this?  He wanted to keep the fear of totalitarianism alive in his readers well past the year 1984.  (Thus, this novel is still quite relevant for today!)<br /><br />Finally, this novel in a word is fascinating!  It is well written and is filled with symbolism and imagination.  It begins slow but gradually picks up speed.  And the story is very interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, this novel is a masterpiece of political speculation that serves as a warning to us all.

I may have passed it by altogether had it not been for the fact that I needed to complete my three hundred pages for the second quarter of my junior year. Besides, I'd read this author's work before and knew that I enjoyed his writing fairly well. So, without realizing what I was plunging into, I picked up George Orwell's 1984; the most unceremonious beginning for a most extraordinary event.<br /><br />As I unconsciously flipped the pages, not realizing that I was still me and not Winston Smith, the story's protagonist, barely cognizant, in fact, that this was a book and not reality, I was dimly aware that this was something special; something far beyond what I had been expecting. If Animal Farm was a slightly humorous, if morbid, look at communism, then 1984 was a ghastly, apocalyptic vision of a demented future. After reading the first twenty pages, I determined that this was the single most quotable book of all time.<br /><br />The infamous Party slogans: \\""War is Peace,\\"" \\""Freedom is Slavery,\\"" \\""Ignorance is Strength.\\""<br /><br />\\""Thoughtcrime does not entail death; thoughtcrime IS death.\\""<br /><br />\\""I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.\\""<br /><br />\\""Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.\\""<br /><br />Chilling words from what could have been, from an averted catastrophe in which the human race subjugates itself through ignorance. Yet who's to say this could never come to pass? None can honestly look another straight in the eye and say, \\""That is not the future.\\"" To presume so is vanity manifest.<br /><br />The one enemy man need truly fear is himself. The notorious Big Brother, the faceless autocrat in charge of Orwell's nightmare world (incidentally, it is never established whether Big Brother is a single man or a surreptitious group superciliously dealing justice to the masses), mercilessly dominates life on Oceania, one of three nations in existence. These countries, Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia, are continually in a state of war with each other, in which Oceania and one of the others are allied against the last. Big Brother's control over his people is absolute, executed through a methodical censorship that keeps the façade of truth as a contorted mask. Big Brother has the power to efface any record of an event or person - to rewrite the past as he sees fit.<br /><br />Perhaps less relevant as a prophecy today (1984 has come and gone and no dictatorship has arisen to consolidate the Americas and the United Kingdom into a single communist entity), 1984 remains a very real piece of culture, with its own voice in the way it challenges one's preconceived notions and ideals. My English teacher perhaps said it best, when comparing 1984 to Animal Farm: \\""Animal Farm hits you with gloves on; 1984 just smacks you bare-fisted.\\"" And it's no slap, no half-hearted jab; it is an in-your-face, force of a moving train blow to the jaw from which the reader reels for weeks, even months after. It is an illustration, as well, of the need of consolidation and the hopelessness that such a government can be beaten: Winston, after waging a personal crusade for his secret freedom, winds up a brainwashed pawn of Big Brother.<br /><br />In the end, Orwell proves that, if the government so wills it, two and two really make five, not four, and no amount of protest is going to change that. This book was a life-changer for me in many ways, but mostly because it made me see a broader view of the world and made me appreciate life as I know it just that much more.<br /><br />\\""He gazed up at that enormous face.

Those who have read 1984, and those that should.  That's all the recommendation I'm going to give, as either you've heard of this book or there's no hope for you at all.  Buy it, borrow it, steal it ... whatever it takes, all thinking people owe it to themselves to experience Orwell's classic. <br /> <br />So I'm not going to summarize the book, it's that much of a classic.  If you don't have some dim idea of what Big Brother represents, my review isn't going to help you.  Instead, I want to talk about my impressions, my ideas, and my thoughts about this amazing vision. <br /> <br />I think that Orwell's book is gaining more relevance in the modern American world, and that's a really frightening thought.  We live in an age of the Patriot act, which allows the government to monitor its citizens in what they do, allowing unprecedented access to private information.  Yet, what is a patriot?  An individual who performs exempliary service to their govenment as an ideal ... yet, the first patriots were criminals.  They were hunted for rebellion or for spreading harmful propaganda against the British monarchy.  Now we have a government that could theoretically punish 'patriots', yet calls up images of protection and defense ...  I don't know about you, but that sounds like doublethink to me. <br /> <br />We live in the age of newspeak.  Police actions instead of wars, government jargon instead of truth ... decidedly, we have been so blindsided by the new language of the administration that it is hard to understand just what is meant by what they say.  And this has been the truth of all administrations since early in this century.  Not a new thing, but it is getting worse.  All jargon does is obscure the truth.  With the fog of langauge separating reality from speech, honesty becomes impossible.   <br /> <br />Autonomy is dead.  Individuals cannot operate in our society.  It has been set up that only groups and parties can exist, and individuals are drown out in the voices of larger parties.  People are given their say, and that say is to continue their slavery.  People as a society do not know how to shrug off the status quo.  Thus, democracy does not know how to shrug off the status quo.  The people don't know what's good for them, and that creates the situation of 1984.  There is a simple truth ... if people didn't want to be oppressed, they wouldn't be.  The public is too many, the oppressors too few, but democracy rules and we are oppressed because we allow ourselves to be.  The future is in the proles, but the situation is still the same, and they do nothing. <br /> <br />And what solution does Orwell give us?  A possible awakening of the proles years and years from now, maybe.  But other than that, there seems to be no end to the trap.  Indeed, I think the only freedom is that offered not by Orwell, but by Huxley in Brave New World.  But that's a story for another day ... <br /> <br />I urge you to read this book, and above all to think about it, and form your own opinions.  Because individualism is the only freedom we have left.  And to give it up is to become the enemy of all intelligence, freedom, and hope.   <br /> <br />",2005-09-14

I just finished listening to the audio version, and I now have a better appreciation for the true intent of the work. Orwell was not trying to predict the future.

It's a well-known manifesto of those playing at anti-government, anti-establishment, brandishing about their membership cards for the Society for Creative Anarchy. This isn't for the kids that read trashy romances or pulp novels: it's not for the Collins, Grisham, Crichton, or Clancy fans out there, and it's definitely not something a Harry Potter kid is going to pick up in a few years. 1984 is depressing, it's dark, and as most devotes will tell you, it's happening right now. After all, this is the book that defines what \\""Orwellian\\"" means-a word so specific in its meaning, even a spin doctor being interviewed on The Daily Show couldn't put it in a positive light.<br /><br />Considering my choices of literature, it probably comes as some surprise that this is only the second time I've read this book, and really I wouldn't have even been motivated to do so if I hadn't picked up a copy of the movie version of 1984 on DVD. I read the book back when I was a senior in high school-this and Metamorphosis were two works that the teachers at my otherwise fine high school just couldn't be assed having us read. I protested after reading both books myself between Junior and Senior year, and in the end talked the English literature teacher into allowing me to teach \\""The Hunger Artist\\"" but it was a rather one-sided compromise, especially when you look at recent statistics. According to one report, the majority of students do not understand or value the first amendment, think that freedom of speech is too unrestricted, that the press has too much say, and that in effect, Americans are too free.<br /><br />It is in this environment that 1984 is more relevant than ever. Look at the National ID cards passed last week without the main media outlets blinking an eye or raising a voice. (Dan Rather, oh distrustful ally of the anti-Bush liberals and libertarians, where are you now!?) In a world where we can go from being at war with Afghanistan to Iraq in the blink of an eye (Er, I mean, we were never at war with Afghanistan. We've always been at war with Iraq. We were never not at war with Iraq. Big Brother Bush says so) and where September 11th is brandished about like a giant banner to take away every freedom known to man, the only difference between the Republicans and Ingsoc is the extent of power and religiosity. While Bush follows a god only he can hear (and really, isn't that signs of a mental disorder, having an imaginary friend that only you can hear that tells you to do things and then acting on that friend's word?) he has yet to understand that to captivate all power, he needs to be God.<br /><br />Of course, the United States isn't the only country with gross miscarriages of justice and invasion of privacy. In addition to China's censorship of the internet, the uniting of England with the US against the unifying European Union (read: Eurasia), there's the almost-but-not-quite-telescreen announcement system in Japan known as \\""The Box\\"" to some residents and \\""Off Box\\"" to others. Technology was meant to make our lives easier, but as Orwell predicted, it is only being used to impose class systems more rigid than they were fifty-years ago.<br /><br />On the way home from work on Wednesday, David and I were walking past Hyde town hall when we heard the bell begin to chime. He mentioned to me that the bell was given to the town by Joshua Bradley, an Industrialist and self-made man who worked his way up from a mill worker to owner. Rags to riches, the kind of JP Morgan and Andrew Carnegie American dream where hard work pays off if you pull yourself up by the bootstraps and put your axe to the grindstone-it doesn't exist in twenty-first century America. Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Richard Branson: they were born into the world they've simply modified. There was never achance they'd be a factory worker somewhere, watching over robots as computers were assembled or working as a flight or train attendant. Donald Trump was never going to be a bartender in a casino. They were born into their class and remained there, entrenched in their wealth.<br /><br />In the past, this would have sent up a cry through the students and middle classes, charging the revolutionary-minded among us to action, to take our piece of the pie, to work harder. Instead, we see lawsuit after lawsuit as people who feel they deserve something for nothing become litigious instead of industrious while the rest go on with the drudgery of the world in which they live. We've become sedated by our technology, dependant on mass media and the Internet for our information. How many Americans first believed we were going to war with Iraq because of Weapons of Mass Destruction? How many people still believe that? More importantly, how many of those Americans still believe Saddam Hussain was responsible for 9/11? How many media outlets bother pointing this out?<br /><br />In the end, we have to look back at Orwell and realize that he knew this. He saw it all happening, saw where we were going, and gave us a picture of a world in the not-to-distant future that is depressing, bleak, and immanent. His book is more important than ever, and if you cannot believe it, take a look at the film version of the book. Admittedly, it was four years after reading the book for the first time that I happened upon the movie, so my memory of the book was foggy at best. So I picked it up and watched it with some skepticism. Surely, so much of that was changed to meet modern standards. Surely, as it is with Hollywood, the only thing it had in common with the book was the title and characters. It was for this reason I put 1984 on my list of books to read-to see how much had been changed. And to my surprise, not much is different at all, to the point that I could see scenes in my mind not becausethe movie colored my perception (as the film version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did, so that reading the book is nearly impossible) but because it was so accurate.<br /><br />In the end, there was no need for them to change, modernize, or update 1984 because it was spot-on. This is a book that is too important to change, and far to relevant to be relegated to dusty bookshelves in the unused school libraries of the United States, or anywhere else in the world for that matter. It is a book that needs to be read, not banned as it has been in some places. If you didn't read this in school, I urge-no, implore-you to read it now. Even if you did read it in school, a good re-read is always enjoyable and considering the way technology and government are evolving, there's no better or more pertinent time than now.",2005-05-15

The novel takes place in London, a large city in Oceania. The main character is Winston, and he is able to see the lies of The Party, which rules the nation.<br /><br /> Throughout history, Oceania has been at war with either Eastasia or Eurasia. The Party uses censorship to revise history to make look as if Oceania has been at war with Eurasia and allied with Eastasia, or vice versa. Winston is employed by The Party and his job is to change these past records.<br /><br /> Along with censorship, The Party uses techniques like newspeak and doublethink to control the masses. Newspeak is an effort by the government to create a very simple language that is dull and not descriptive. This `lean' language is designed to minimize the brain use of Oceanians. Doublethink is another effort of The Party to control Oceanians. Doublethink is a technique taught by The Party that requires people to believe things that they know are not true. For instance, a citizen may know for a fact that Oceania was at war with Eastasia only a few years ago, even though The Party insists that Oceania is an ally of Eastasia and always has been.<br /><br /> Winston begins to question the greatness of The Party when he sees how blindly some people can follow the party. This really struck Winston one day during the `two minutes hate', in which The Party shows enemies of Oceania on the telescreen, and all of the Oceanian citizens scream at the person on the screen. Winston is bothered by this, and gains a deep desire to `bring down Big Brother'.<br /><br /> This book is an excellent read for people of all ages, and can show the dangers of government intervention into personal life.",2004-11-29

But only a few of them have the same impact that George Orwell achieves in his book 1984.  It seems part paranoid fantasy, part tribute to the malleability of the human psyche, and part historical allegory.<br />The issues, even presented in the outdated means that they are, still ring true for our modern society.  The line between patriotism and nationalism is a thin one, and one that Americans look at each day.  But in Orwell's world that line was crossed, and the result was a totalitarian government beyond anything most of us can imagine.  With the government controlling all jobs, information, deeds, and actions, even to the smallest thought of their peoples, his world is stark and horrible to those of us used to a freedom.  But the steps into that world are not that far away from our modern media control.  In his world of 1984 the media serves the purpose of brainwashing the populace at large, and an ongoing war keeps the pressure on.  And while some may claim that the media in our own country has the same control over us, in his world, the media is the government, and has no other agenda than that which the government sets forth.<br />The strange part is that all of this occurs to us, through the eyes of the main character, Winston Smith, as he falls in love with a young woman named Julia.  In Oceania, the nation-state in which Smith lives, love is not allowed, and not tolerated.  Winston Smith is, in essence, an insurgent in his own nation.  He sleeps each night knowing that something is wrong, but not being able to say exactly what.  As a reader we can see exactly the horrors to which he is made to endure, and though they might make us scream and shout, he is unmoved.  But love draws him out of that sheltered reality, and into open insurgency against his own nation.<br />This is the beginning of the end for Wilson, as the romance, and the pleasures, are short lived.  Like a terrible wave the police of the world he inhabits come crashing down upon him to break his spirit.  The way they torture him is gruesome, and should offend anyone who values our human rights.  But in the end, Wilson himself comes to love \\""Big Brother\\"" the face of the state of Oceania.  He forgets his insurgency, through a conscious adaptation of his logic processes.  He has to know that whatever the nation does is right, even when it contradicts what he has experienced in the recent past.  In Orwell's words, Doublethink.<br />These are just the surface issues that come across in Orwell's vision world the deeper issues are buried.  As in, how could such a world come to exist?  Well, he explains that after World War 2, there came a mighty nuclear war that wiped out most of the population centers of the world.  And that out of the nuclear ash arose a political methodology that swept the nations, a kind of socialism that blended into totalitarianism.  This totalitarian regime took hold and great purges, on the scope of the great purges in the early communist USSR, ran across the world as we know it.  3 stable nations were born: Oceania (The Americas, the Pacific Islands, Australia, and England), Eastasia (China, Mongolia, The Indonesian Peninsula, and Japan), and Eurasia (All of Europe save England, and all of the Former USSR).  The rest of the world was in a constant state of conquest by one of these 3 super-nations, with the captured populations used as slaves.  The constant state of war between the nations served to keep control over the people within the nations.<br />This is a world devoid of hope. Indeed, devoid of any emotions except hatred, fanatical delight in the war effort, and the obedience to the governments of the nations.  This is the worst vision of what the Nazis in Germany hoped to accomplish in their conquests.  A world without any laws, but what the government states to be true at that moment.  A world where people disappear, but no one notices, or even cares, a world of total devotion to the state as a whole, without regard to creed, race, or social status.<br />It isn't often that the characters in a book become common usage in the world at large, but the phrase \\""Big Brother is watching you\\"" has become synonymous with the government watching over its citizens.  It shows up today in almost everyday speech.  Especially when people are talking right to privacy issues.  This seems apt, as privacy is one of the things that Wilson Smith never had, and will never have.  Big Brother (the government) watched his every move of his life, recorded his every word, and rifled through his belongings at their leisure.

Obedience is demanded, subjects are not even allowed the freedom of thought.

Written over 50 years ago, this book was to serve several purposes, one being a warning to the present that a future like this, however fantastic and unbelievable,  could be in the making should we allow for it to happen.<br />Winston leads the dull life of a worker, not encouraged to think, or dream, for feel for himself. His whole life must be driven to support the Party, which promulgates an apparent non-entity Big Brother as the supreme one.  Winston early on shows the spark of individuality that the Party so wants to extinguish; by daring to write a journal on his own, he seals his fate early in the story. Soon he meets Julia, another worker, who charms and dares him even further to enocurage having an affair.  Together they make a lethal pair, and some lethal decisions, which leads to the great climax in the Ministry of Love.<br />What lies in the story is an amazing prophecy of government gone mad. The Party believes in creating present truths by writing and rewriting the past on its whim.  The Party understands in order to control the people, it must control the language, thereby, creating \\""Newspeak\\"".  The Party makes people simply vanish, eradicating them from existance. The Party realizes the people who follow are merely plebians in society, and therefore, should be encouraged to not think for themselves.  In fact, the Party is able to directly lie to the people, using \\""doublethink\\"", where they say one thing but mean the other.<br />How much of Orwell's nightmare is something that can be true today? Do we have a government out of control, one that manipulates information for its own benefit, to justify war, ensure fear and terror reigns over the country; one that illegally detains people without trial, right to counsel, or even being charged with a crime; one that wants to extensively monitor our personal phone calls, e-mails, the books we check out of the library, the things we buy in stores. The dots are there to connect them; the challenge is, will you dare to do it, like Winston Smith dared?<br />I believe 1984 is ultimately a hopeful book.

All the ingredients are here -- we get the grim, joyless, totalitarian nation that is such a nightmare to the Western ideas of individuality and basic rights. Like in Fahrenheit, we get an obsessive control over language - though here it goes much farther, to the destruction of words. Like BNW, we get government controlled social structure and recreation time, even sexuality. Seems the main point of all of them is how shallow life can become if one obeys the authorities.  What's different here - and I hope I'm not giving too much away-is that the rebel doesn't win. That seriously disturbed me at first, but the more I think about it, the more I feel it makes this work stand above the others as a Dystopian picture and a call to fight Power in government and protect individualism and free thought. For if the rebel can beat the Man, then the Man's power is limited, and we need not worry too much about the Man - the rebel can always win, if he wants. But if Big Brother can become powerful enough that no rebel can survive, as is the case in 1984, then we must truly fear and fight the Man-now, before He has that kind of power.<br />In the end, I think I find this Dystopian work more well thought out, more complete, and scarier than Brave New World of Fahrenheit 451.

In the book 1984, by George Orwell, a  character named Winston Smith lived in a society very similar to this.  He  lived in the city called Oceania, during the year 1984.  The book centered  around Winston's life in this communist-like society.  His life and  everyone else's around him was controlled by someone or something only  known to them as \\""Big Brother.\\""  They were surrounded by signs constantly  reminding them that \\""Big Brother is Watching.\\""  Telescreens, or 2 way TV  screens were mounted in almost every room, and street.  Microphones were  everywhere, monitoring every step you took.  They lived their lives in  constant fear that they would do something wrong, which would surely  sentence them to the wrath of the Thoughtpolice, a task force organized by  the \\""Party,\\"" to keep order.  This \\""Party,\\"" supported, and represented Big  Brother.  A modified version of the English language called Newspeak was  developed which completely centered around \\""The Party\\"".  Its vocabulary was  limited to words that only supported the Party.  All other words were  eliminated.  I thought this was a very good book.  It was written  very well, with strong imagery, and an interesting plot.  It was a quick  read, despite it's 300 pages.  It touches on everyone's fears of communism,  and gives you a different look at government.",2000-03-24

The way people are told to believe in the Party (Christianity) even though they  have the intelligence to reason that it is totally illogical.  I can see  no difference between someone who has faith and someone who is prepared to  use doublethink to mentally condition themselves.  Both require the user to  operate at two levels - to apply scientific fact for instance to construct  televisions and rocket engines, and then to be able to switch into  illogical rambling and decide that they believe an obscure doctrine that  has no basis in fact.<br />That is why Orwells ideas cannot be dismissed as  &quot;far-fetched&quot; and irrelevant.  If the faithful ever gain the whip  hand of society we may well see ourselves being repressed into acceptance  of ignorance and the worship of Big Brother (God).

It is rather a combination of denigrations against most of the common held social, political, and religious beliefs. Socialism,  fascism, communism, Christianity, Zenism, and many other beliefs beyond the  tether of my knowledge. All these harsh criticisms are made clear in the  chapter about THE BOOK and part 3 of the whole novel. The denounciation  against Christianity, for example, can be clearly seen in the later section  of the book, when Winston is being tortured in Miniluv by O'Brien. The  purging of the old self through repentance and a renewal of the mind and  emotions, which are the ways to get in God's kingdom, are also the cores of  the lessons given by O'Brien to get Winston to become a part of  the Party.  O'Brien also mentioned that one can not change by himself, by can with the  help of the Party, or in Christianity, Jesus. These clear remarks relating  to Christianity, as well as to other beliefs, are implicit throughout the  novel. At the end, a conclusion is made, only democracy works.

After two generations, the common view was that 1984 was on-target for its time but was now dated as the Communist regimes evolved into ordinary authoritarian ones.  Today techno-enthusiasts like Peter Huber say 1984 was based on fallacies, because the spread of information technology aids freedom, not oppression.  And to today's teenagers, the totalitarian experience seems to be ancient history.  Why should anyone still read 1984?<br />  Partly, of course, they should read it for the same reason they should read Wiesel, Milosz, Solzhenytsin, and many others-- because we ought to remember the evils of this century for memory's sake.  But the autobiographies and histories written by those who lived under these most evil of regimes-- important as they are-- necessarily offer a bottom-up view of them.<br />  1984, among many other things, offers insight into the psychology and mindset of the rulers, the torturers, the propagandists.  Through reading a (possibly forged) samizdat manifesto, through his conversations with O'Brien, and through his knowledge of the workings of the Party's rewrites of history and language, Smith learns-- and through him, we learn even more-- about the tight links among cruelty, terror, and power over the body and the mind.<br />  At the moment we are mostly free of the specific kinds of regimes Orwell attacked, though we should not lightly assume that they will never return.  We are not and probably will never be free of those who seek power for power's sake, of those who use torture and terror, of cruel and evil rulers and would-be rulers.  We are not free of the corruption of history and language by politics.  1984 is in that greatest of categories of fiction-- the literature that allows its readers to understand reality better.",1998-04-13

Few stories have so firmly entrenched themselves into the fabric of our society like Orwell's masterpiece. From the concept of Big Brother to those of &quot;newspeak&quot; and &quot;thought crime,&quot; this book has filled several voids in our language. Perhaps the book has frightened us into paying it homage. It hits us at home by addressing issues such as our right to privacy, the extent of control a government should wield over its people, the boundaries of patriotism, the value of love. This novel runs deep in my veins for these reasons and more.  In case you hadn't noticed the 6 movies, 15 albums and 3,645 features on 1984, it is the story about life in a hypothetical future. At the time Orwell wrote the novel, the year 1984 was a far-off place in the future. Now it belongs to an era with which we associate opulence and injurious Presidents. For the sake of argument, however, 1984 represents a hypothetical future in any era whereby government has reached too far down our pants.  We follow the life of poor Winston, smoking his Victory cigarettes and drinking his Victory coffee, who has the unfortunate affliction of thinking for himself. We follow Winston through the dim corridors of his housing facility hoping that he remembers, BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING. Big Brother is watching Winston and the rest of the community to make sure they stick to the law. After all, they must keep up in their perpetual war with Eurasia and Oceania, the ENEMIES. Of course, Winston has the misfortune of falling in love with a woman, which has no place in the effort to win the war. You'll have to read the book to find out what they do with Winston...

The book is about Winston Smith, living in a future world (1984 WAS the future in 1949 when the book was written) which is dominated by an all-present and all-powerful government which is partly based on Stalin's Russia, Hitler's Germany, and (gasp!) England and America.  But the government which is symbolized by 'big brother' not only dominates the professional and personal world of Winston Smith, it also controls his thoughts, using constant brainwashing through media and imagery.<br /> Smith begins to assert his individualism, starts a love affair with a similar thinking woman and joins the resistance, which may only exist in his own mind.  But Smith is doomed, there is no happy ending...only a warning to us all about trends in society.  1984 may have come and gone on the calendar, but IngSoc and Big Brother live on and continues to gain.<br /> This book has become the classic metaphor for the evils and failures of collectivist societies, and will haunt your ideas of political solutions to society's problems.",1998-04-07

But unlike Orwell's other famous political satire, Animal Farm, this novel is filled with bleak cynicism and grim pessimism about the human race.  When it was written, 1984 stood as a warning against the dangerous probabilities of communism.  And now today, after communism has crumbled with the Berlin Wall; 1984 has come back to tell us a tale of mass media, data mining, and their harrowing consequences.<br />  It's 1984 in London, a city in the new &uuml;berstate of Oceania, which contains what was once England, Western Europe and North America.  Our hero, Winston Smith works in the Ministry of Truth altering documents that contradict current government statements and opinions.  Winston begins to remember the past that he has worked so hard to destroy, and turns against The Party.  Even Winston's quiet, practically undetectable form of anarchism is dangerous in a world filled with thought police and the omnipresent two-way telescreen.  He fears his inevitable capture and punishment, but feels no compulsion to change his ways.<br />  Winston's dismal observations about human nature are accompanied by the hope that good will triumph over evil; a hope that Orwell does not appear to share.  The people of Oceania are in the process of stripping down the English language to its bones.  Creating Newspeak, which Orwell uses only for examples and ideas which exist only in the novel.  The integration of Newspeak into the conversation of the book.  One of the new words created is doublethink, the act of believing that two conflicting realities exist.  Such as when Winston sees a photograph of a non-person, but must reason that that person does not, nor ever has, existed.<br /><br /> The inspiration for Winston's work ,may have come from Russia.  Where Stalin's right-hand man, Trotzky was erased from all tangible records after his dissention from the party.  And the fear of telescreens harks back to the days when Stasi bugs were hooked to every bedpost, phone line and light bulb in Eastern Europe.<br /><br /> His reference to Hitler Youth, the Junior Spies, which trains children to keep an eye out for thought criminals- even if they are their parents; provides evidence for Orwell's continuing presence in pop culture.  &quot;Where men can't walk, or freely talk, And sons turn their fathers in.&quot; is a line from U2's 1993 song titled &quot;The Wanderer&quot;.<br /><br />Orwell assumes that we will pick up on these political allusions. But the average grade 11 student will probably only have a vague understanding of these due to lack of knowledge.  It is even less likely that they will pick up on the universality of these happenings, like the fact that people still &quot;disappear&quot; without a trace every day in Latin America.<br /><br />Overall, however, the book could not have been better written.  Orwell has created characters and events that are scarily realistic.  Winston's narration brings the reader inside his head, and sympathetic with the cause of the would-be-rebels.  There are no clear answers in the book, and it's often the reader who has to decide what to believe.  But despite a slightly unresolved plot, the book serves its purpose.  Orwell wrote this book to raise questions; and the sort of questions he raised have no easy answer.  This aspect can make the novel somewhat of a disappointment for someone in search of a light read.  But anyone prepared to not just read, but think about a novel, will get a lot out of 1984.<br /><br />1984, is not a novel for the faint of heart, it is a gruesome, saddening portrait of humanity, with it's pitfalls garishly highlighted.  Its historic importance has never been underestimated; and it's reemergence as a political warning for the 21st century makes it deserving of a second look.  Winston's world of paranoia and inconsistent realities is  an eloquently worded account of a future we thought we buried in our past; but in truth may be waiting just around the corner.",1998-03-03

Anyway, I come from a country with a totalitarian regime, and 1984 was like a slap on the face and a wake-up call: I suddenly realized why my country is in constant war, why we see the portrait of our own Big Brother everywhere, why my countrymen never taste the revenues of oil and how it is all achieved.

No one can deny this novel's power, its hold on the imagination of whole generatins,or the power of its admonitions-a power that seems to grow not lessen, with the passage of time.<br /><br />It is the story of a man by the name of Winston Smith he lives in a time when love of a woman is illeagal not just the act but the nature and feelings to one.

Orwell offers us a negative Utopia, a world where evil thrives and the word &quot;Communism&quot; is never actually uttered, for the simple reason that it does not need to be...he offers us Winston Smith, a tortured man who's struggle for his own thoughts, ideas, and lover is doomed to failure from the beginnning.  The undertones of hopelessness, poverty, evil, and senselessness are ever present in this terrifying novel that I believe will outlive us all.  One can only wonder why this novel was not put on the blacklist of Joseph McCarthy, who dubbed so many classics as &quot;Unamerican&quot;.

Through out the centuries, men have preached equality and hipocrosy.  They were Big Brother.  Through out the centuries, men have preached non-thought and conformity.  They were Big Brother.  Through out history, a long line of men have stood, begining with Plato, continuing with Stalin, and propagated today by every man, woman, and child who believes that 2+2=5, that A is not A.<br />These men have stood for Big Brother, have stood for Ingsoc, have stood for evil, and have stood for 1984.  George Orwell's masterpiece stood for all that which conflicted with those ideals: for love, for happiness, for individualism, for ego.  On the surface, Orwell paints a picture more sickening, and more chilling to any person who believes that they are, that they are not a group, not a consortium, but exist in and for their own right.<br />This is not a Utopia; this is what could happen, not what has happened.  It is a testament to those who will not take the easy way out, will not conform.  It is instead a tribute to those who rage against the dying of the light, for those who think, and those who know that 1984 can be stopped, by those who have stopped it through out the centuries: those who will not sanctify the punishment of virtue.  The hero of this book is not Winston; it is the old prole' hanging out laundry, and making the song written by a machine a thing of beauty.  In the end, the proletariat must rise; for they are not the lowest class, but the highest.  The party members consider themselves higher because they have force, and therefor, by their reckoning, power.  But they do not; they have nothing; everything is the Party's.  But they are not the party; Big Brother is the Party.

In the novel, Orwell pessimistically predicted the most bleak, depressing future possible given the frightening post-WWII political climate.<br /><br />The world of 1984 is controlled by totalitarian communist regimes. In the fictional mega-country of Oceania, this quasi-government is called &#34;The Party.&#34; The goal of the Party is to subjugate individual human impulses, thoughts, and desires to the will of the whole. This is maintained by an endless series of rules, monitoring, and ceaseless propaganda.<br /><br />Winston, the protagonist, feels that life isn't as it should be, despite the endless propaganda. He finds small and large ways to rebel against the system without getting caught. But 1984 is far, far darker, bleaker, and more pessimistic than similar books in the genre, like Ayn Rand's Anthem or Lois Lowry's The Giver. Orwell doesn't allow any cliches in his book. Winston hates totalitarianism, but he is far from virtuous. And, without going into further detail--do not expect a happy ending.<br /><br />Orwell paints such a complete picture of a totalitarian triumph that the reader is left with little to no hope. 1984 is a cautionary tale, and Orwell was sending a clear message to society--&#34;Don't let it get to this point.&#34;",2015-08-30

The scarcities and rationing, the war frenzy, the propaganda and paranoia required no imagination to describe. They were right in front of him. Critics use Orwell’s merciless reportorial skill as a brief against his imagination. His grim fantasy is all too realistic. It fails both as fantasy and prophesy. The titular date has come and gone, they point out. The world is not divided into three super powers perpetually at war; no telescreens invade our privacy. No all-powerful totalitarian state controls our lives, which are in fact more free and prosperous than anyone could have imagined at the bleak and dreary end of the Second World War. Of the computer and the internet, plausibly the most significant new developments since that time, Orwell had not an inkling.<br /> But this superficial reading of the book, whereby we comfort ourselves with the fact that we drink Bombay Sapphire rather than Victory Gin, is tragically naive and misguided. In fact every basic concept, every philosophical and political development Orwell addressed in his book has come to pass almost exactly as described.<br />Orwell analyzed the way people driven by the need for power actually think. This is the most useful insight in his book, delivered by the Grand Inquisitor O’Brien:<br />“The Party seeks power entirely for it’s own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury, or long life or happiness: only power, pure power … We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship to safeguard a revolution; one makes a revolution to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture … How does one man assert his power over another? … By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering how can you be sure he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face – forever.”<br />To this bleak vision the battered and terrified Winston Smith has one reply: “Somehow you will fail. Something will defeat you. Life will defeat you.”<br />Of course in the novel it is Winston Smith who is defeated and obliterated, after learning to love Big Brother. The story is unrelenting, a harsh tragedy in which the human spirit is crushed, and the future is too horrible to contemplate. The good guys lose. They are forced to betray their deepest beliefs and emotions, gutted of their souls and left to wander the streets like hollow eyed ghosts. Evil wins, over and over again, with a shriek of glee and blare of military music. The book ought to be profoundly depressing<br /> And yet it isn’t.  Just the opposite: it’s uplifting, thrilling. It’s a form of meta-text: the fact that you are reading the book at all, the fact that the book was written and published, confounds the darkness of its message. Winston Smith knows no one will ever read his journal … but people will be reading the novel that contains it for as long as books exist. The authors of the Newspeak dictionary exult in the destruction of language; the mandarins of the inner Party continuously dismantle all passion and morality and truth.  But the novel itself, with its vivid prose and ferocious probity creates an exhilaration, a giddy hope  in the reader that its characters can never share. A masterpiece. Read it.

I decided to read it on my own this summer, and boy am I glad I did.<br /><br />1984 tells the story of Winston Smith, a man who lives in THE totalitarian government, wants to fight back, and isn't entirely sure how. He is watched almost all the time, must be constantly on guard against showing dissent from the party, or else he will be disappeared. While he and similar characters aren't exactly brimming with personality, they don't need to be to make this book good.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this book is the government itself. A common saying in this book is [paraphrased] 'he who controls the past controls the future, and he who controls the present controls the past'. Orwell goes into detail on how to accomplish this, and delivers on all of the horror, both stated and unstated, that goes along with it. The even more classic line 'War is Peace' is brought up, and explained in such a way that I even found it plausible in a severely twisted sort of way. And the worst part? All of this misery, terror, and oppresion? It's entirely believable that it could happen to us. The government doesn't need any sci-fi tech to take absolute control, and they don't need it. Heck, North Korea is doing something similar right now!<br /><br />One minor thing I have to say I like is the prose. A lot the book I've read that are sixty years have a lot of archaic grammar and word choice. 1984 doesn't for the most part.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in classic literature, second only to 'Catch-22' in my list of books you should read.

The point I got all those years ago was about socialism and the suppression of individuality for the sake of happiness. This time I walked away with quite a different impression, name,t that conformity in all aspects of human existence IS necessary for a society to function, as a well oiled machine. The constant war, keeps the sheep in their place and is eerily like the sputum the neo-conservative world view keeps trying to foist upon American society. The illusion of freedom of thought is buttressed through the real masters namely the faceless boards that control the multinational corporations that are slowly creating their own newspeak and suppressing the individual in all walks of life. There is more to this book though, than prescient telling of Power for the sake Power.<br />The lesson in this dated fable was not what the world had become, it was the systemic stripping of the ability and desire to think, question and arrive at conclusions through the examination of past. The past has always been rewritten by the winners and Orwell took that axiom and stretched it to its most logical conclusion.<br />More to the point, I found the plot line and characters engaging and at no time did I stray out of the structure Orwell so artfully constructed. His world is complete and the motivations of each and every character is consistent throughout the tale. His language is terse and resembles newspeak its  staccato cadence and rhythm. Very few words are wasted on setting the scene and the darkness and dreariness of the life Winston Smith lives is echoed in the grey world in which he lives.<br />Anyhow, an engrossing read that I will be thinking about for many days to come.",2015-05-25

After all,  Orwell joined the Communists during the Spanish Civil War.  But after I matured, and read Animal Farm, and knew from my other readings that Soviets first left Spain, joined the  Nazi's, and asked for help from our decadent West to help them defeat the Nazi's and with that victory grabbed all of Eastern Europe and East Berlin.

With that said let me tell you why it is a book everyone must read. It is the benchmark for dystopian novels and one of the greatest English-language novels of all time. It is the story of a totalitarian socialist society (“Oligarchical Collectivism”) where the party is superior to any individual or group. I read it in High School and again in college then again as a middle aged adult. Now, I have read it again as a senior adult. Each time I read it I can see our society becoming closer to the reality of 1984. For instance, the Snowden revelations have come to pass since the last time I read the book. (Can you say Big Brother is watching?) While Orwell may have missed the mark in the prediction of time he was dead on target with the policies of the progressive movement. Consider the following passage: “That it sought power because men in the mass were frail, cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves. That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better.” That sounds a lot like the current ruling elite from both parties. Orwell’s creations such as, “Doublethink”, “Newspeak”, “Thoughtcrimes” are all examples of the modern political propaganda scene. Re-education camps where they “cure” people of their “insanity” are probably not far away. If you read this book and do not see the parallels with the direction of modern government , then you are probably a “prole” or a staunch “inner party” member.",2015-04-06

The phrase &#34;Orwellian&#34; was defined for me.  After hearing so many interesting reviews of this book by friends and family I took the plunge.  Having read Animal Farm some 45 years ago, 1984 seemed a good bet.  Funny how things come back to you.  Didn't take long for 1984 to remind me of Animal Farm in many ways.  Orwell's style sure came back even after so many years reminding me of Animal Farm in many ways.  In all honesty fiction of this type really isn't my thing, so that being said it's easy to understand how Orwell is viewed so positively by many.  As a story it dragged me along enough to finish fairly quickly but left me with a very hollow feeling.  There's certainly enough thought provocation to keep one thinking long and hard about how something like this could come to be?  If in fact it already hasn't?<br /><br />Don't like reviews which give too much away so with that I'll stop.  If you like to read the (classics) I suppose 1984 is good for that purpose.  One thing I did enjoy was the twist on language and words used with skill to describe the story.

There is a movie version of this book starring John Hurt which is great, but I suggest seeing it after reading the book.

It takes the reader on  a displeasing trip into a horrifying future.  All things that make mankind human are in the process of being banned by an immoral totalitarian government.  All thought not in agreement with government  decrees is considered criminal.  The government sees all, controls all and  destroys all that impedes the fulfilment of its will.  It is a nightmare world.  Winston Smith thinks he can recover  something of what it means to be human if he is clever enough and cautious enough.  That is what kept me reading.

They do track our shopping habits, our use of social media and they have powerful weapons to undermine democracy, including radio and television, and now blogs that spread misinformation and brainwash the public.  The doublespeak language is spoken today by hawks and neocons who claim that invading and destroying countries will bless them with &#34;democracy&#34;, which is not practiced in most places anyway.  The politicians who &#34;close the government&#34;  and then go on sites closed by the closing of the government to protest the closing (Senator Cruz and Sarah Palin in public parks), or who fight the Affordable Care Act and then sue the president for delaying implementation of part of the plan are vivid examples of this kind of doublespeak.

I decided to read it on my own this summer, and boy am I glad I did.<br /><br />1984 tells the story of Winston Smith, a man who lives in THE totalitarian government, wants to fight back, and isn't entirely sure how. He is watched almost all the time, must be constantly on guard against showing dissent from the party, or else he will be disappeared. While he and similar characters aren't exactly brimming with personality, they don't need to be to make this book good.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this book is the government itself. A common saying in this book is [paraphrased] 'he who controls the past controls the future, and he who controls the present controls the past'. Orwell goes into detail on how to accomplish this, and delivers on all of the horror, both stated and unstated, that goes along with it. The even more classic line 'War is Peace' is brought up, and explained in such a way that I even found it plausible in a severely twisted sort of way. And the worst part? All of this misery, terror, and oppresion? It's entirely believable that it could happen to us. The government doesn't need any sci-fi tech to take absolute control, and they don't need it. Heck, North Korea is doing something similar right now!<br /><br />One minor thing I have to say I like is the prose. A lot the book I've read that are sixty years have a lot of archaic grammar and word choice. 1984 doesn't for the most part.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in classic literature, second only to 'Catch-22' in my list of books you should read.

It still works.<br /><br />About totalitarianism, it's still a good account, but you can see the frayed edges in his tapestry.  Not surprisingly, Orwell's fictional technology of surveillance does not match the real-world technology of modern times.  And, typically of practically all futuristic literature, the economic plausibility of the depiction is lacking.  (The number of people tracking the attitudes of Winston and Julia, and the time invested in that project, would quickly bankrupt any economy, no matter how finely tuned, were it applied to everyone in similar circumstances.)<br /><br />But Orwell's relentless description of thought control is uncannily contemporary.  The project to continually remake memories, to literally eradicate the past by constantly recreating history, looks terribly like our world of manipulable records.  Michael Chrichton's &#34;Rising Sun&#34; (1992) worried about how digital photography could be modified to the point that the original was impossible to identify.  More recently, a New Yorker magazine article by Michael Specter (&#34;Partial Recall&#34;) told about clinical progress toward excising painful memories and replacing them with different, constructed memories.  The aim is clinical, to repair mental trauma.  But you ought to compare this new technology to the methods of the thought police in &#34;1984.&#34;  It's disconcerting, to say the least.",2014-06-07

All the elements of an Orwellian society are in place-the Ministry of Peace (requires just the right force to not win the war, but keeps the country in a state of equipoise) is the Department of Defense, the Ministry of Love (enforces loyalty to Big Brother) is the Department of Justice, and the Ministry of Truth (dedicated to rewriting history) is the Department of Education.

He quickly finds himself in a downward spiral. He’s disappointed when he notices that the Party alters the truth. As the story progresses, Winston meets a younger girl named Julia. Winston and Julia become close and develop an intimate relationship together. They discover that they both endure hate towards the Party and Big Brother. The comrades start to rebel against the Party and become members of the Brotherhood. Towards the end of the novel, Winston and Julia are arrested for thoughtcrime. They are brought to the Ministry of Truth. Winston is tortured and interrogated by O’Brien until he learns, accepts, and understands his love for the Party and Big Brother. After being reintegrated into society, Winston is brought back to the Ministry of Truth and is killed.<br /> This novel isn’t a modern-day literature. It’s told at a time where there is technology but not our average computer and phone. There are telescreens and memory holes. The telescreens are used to watch over the people who live in Oceania. The memory holes are used to erase data that is no longer true. Oceania is a dictated state. The story is revealed through Winston who often writes in a diary. It’s not a thriller, romance, or adventure story. Instead, it’s a dystopian novel. It’s more like a grim view of the future with less technology. However, there’s a great deal of irony. Although, there isn’t a lot of humor or entertainment. 1984 is very challenging to read and can sometimes become tedious. Furthermore, 1984 isn’t a part of a series so don’t look for any upcoming releases for a new book.<br /> Overall, I would recommend this novel to someone else. There are many different meanings to interpret which will keep you interested. This literature sheds light into the nature of inhumanity. The intense plot will keep you at the edge of your seat. Lastly, 1984 will make you think about how the world will be in the near future. Reading 1984 made me question if our world would gradually change into a world like Oceania. What if the Golden Country was a reflection of modern day today? Without a doubt, I enjoyed reading 1984 by George Orwell.",2014-06-05

The king of the forbidden future. The first and foremost fallen future. 1984 by George Orwell.<br /><br />I almost feel like the “Miss America” theme song should be playing. Or the overzealous Hunger Games announcer should be bubbling about the beauty of the book. Either way, 1984 is kind of a big deal.<br /><br />So why did I need an extra shove to begin the book? Why did it take me so long to muster the courage to write its review?<br /><br />Well, I have a secret. I didn’t like it.<br /><br />It was only a matter of time before I read this famous book and became acquainted with the infamous Big Brother. I continually told myself I’d read it eventually, so when 1984 made itself a spot on my book club list, I knew it was time to stop procrastinating.<br /><br />I read and read and read. It took me about two weeks to finish the book; I was fooled by the thin spine. Upon opening the books, I realized you practically need a magnifying glass to read the words and the margins were nonexistent.  Even so, I powered through.<br /><br />The real problem I had were the characters. I’m big on characters I can connect with. In 1984, I didn’t care about them at all. During their torture and their happiness, I felt nothing towards Winston and Julia. Not one thing. Since I wasn’t fond of the people, I didn’t care about their story.<br /><br />Also, I didn’t think the world was all that original. I know, I know, put it in perspective. Back in Orwell’s day, this plot concept was unread of. And all those other dystopian novels I’ve read are really just based off of 1984. Since this is the case, I don’t see why we still hold the book to such high regard. I’m sure it has tons of literary value, but just because it was the first doesn’t mean it’s the best.<br /><br />If you don’t know what 1984 is about: Winston is an average guy with an ordinary office job. He lives in the year 1984, or so he thinks. The world has changed since 1949 when Orwell wrote the book. And not for the better. 1984 holds no freedom of any kind for the people. Big Brother, the government, keeps a keen eye on all; they even patrol your thoughts. No one is safe, and all rebellion is blown to smithereens for fear of torture, or worse.<br /><br /> What the heck was Orwell thinking when he wrote this book!? The entire globe has dismissed the old way of thinking and has embraced total ignorance and essentially slavery. How did he think in 35 years the world would end up like that? During book club, someone brought up the point that technology was accelerating at an alarming pace due to the Cold Ware and WWII, so Orwell may have assumed the innovations would keep coming.

I didn't like it much when I read it...I still don't like the outcome, but you have to admire any book that haunts you like this one does. Orwell's ability to make me think about this story so consistently for such a long period of time is a credit to his greatness. It has become the book I love to hate and for that it gets another star.<br /><br />Update<br />So I have had a month to consider this book. I find myself thinking about it a fair amount. I now think the point of this book was to make people become outraged at the story. To use this story as a way to incite people to fight against Government control. To not let things get close to becoming this way. Since it was written around the time of war, Orwell may have sensed that the Government might consider using the war as an excuse to tighten the reigns on the population. Anyhow, if a book keeps me thinking like this book has, it gets an extra star.<br /><br />Original Review<br />To put it bluntly, and probably much to the dismay of many, I did not like this book. It was monotonous for the first few chapters - which I think was probably the point. The rest was OK until I got to the end. I'm not sure what the author was trying to say. Perhaps \\""Just give up, you can't beat the Government\\"" or \\""Give up on striving for anything, it won't happen in the end\\"" or even \\""Every person is so insignificant that they might as well end it all now\\"". One might think the Government itself paid the author to put that out to make a point. In the end, to me, it doesn't matter. I didn't like the message that I read in it.",2013-08-30

I first read this book in the early 1960's and did not think too much of it at the time.  I am a law abiding, responsible person who loves the USA and am not part of any conspiracy group or movement.<br />The book was published in 1949 and was required reading for a college level Political Science course I took in the early 1960's.  Although we knew it was a work of fiction, our instructor likened it to life in a \\""totalitarian communist or socialists\\"" country. The life described in the book was totally foreign to life in a free republic like the U.S. Now, fast-forward fifty years to current political realities of life in the U.S. and one must conclude that Orwell was a prophet of the Moses class. Were we told in 1960 that our government would one day own or control major U.S. industries such as; banking, mortgage, insurance, automotive, health care and energy we would think the person making such a claim was totally uninformed or in need of psychiatric care.  On top of outright ownership or control is the added influence exerted on private businesses by government rules and regulations and it becomes easy to see that \\""1984\\"" is now more fact than fiction.<br />The traditional \\""free enterprise, capitalists\\"" system seems to have given way to the concept of \\""redistribution of wealth\\"".  Even salaries paid within private corporations, in some instances, is controlled by government.<br />As if that wasn't enough, within the past year, our trust in government has been further undermined by learning that government agencies trusted with our most private and sensitive personal information (think IRS) have punished people for their political views as well as shared private information with other governmental and private organizations in violation of established law and regulations.<br />The most recent cause for a healthy skepticism about our government follows the disclosure that the National SecurityAgency has been collecting untold amounts of phone, email and other electronic data on the communications of law abiding citizens without warrants or justification.  This coupled with the GPS tracking system causes one to wonder; just how much surveillance is really necessary?<br />Like Orwell's 1984, our government officially makes promises it does not or cannot keep.  What was once the truth, now by virtue of political correctness, becomes hate speech.  Religious thought is criticized and demeaned and is being forced from the public square.  Government redefines or excludes certain traditional words from public discourse.<br />Although I encourage anyone who desires to know about our founding principles to read any number of good books by our founding fathers, I believe it would do us all good to read Orwell's 1984.  Although a work of fiction it unfortunately rings very true.",2013-08-24

George Orwell's haunting examination of the natural inclination to resist regimented control by all-powerful authority figures, the desire to experience closeness and intimacy with another human (an act forbidden in this controlled society) with the recognition of the inevitable discovery and destruction by the state is a disturbing look at the inside of a totalitarian society.  Unfortunately, it appears that this is the direction in which Western, so-called democratic and free countries are heading.  The real eye-opener is the admission by the state rulers (and torturers) that perpetuating this living hell of a society was solely to accumulate and maintain ever-increasing amounts of power.  This is a clear-eyed view of the psychopaths (like Stalin, Hitler and, quite possibly, our current governments in the West) who gain power and manipulate the system in every way possible to strive for ultimate power, with no recognition of the cost to other's lives.

To be sure, Atlas Shrugged is the worst if for no other reason than it is painfully long.  But all make a sort of attempt to build a plot and sooner or later digress into some sort of manifesto.  In the case of 1984, the main character finds a banned book from the leader of the resistance and several chapters of the real book are from the fictional book.<br /><br />One thing I do recall from learning to write in high school and college is: show, don't tell.  All of these books, in particular 1984 are pretty thin using the fiction and plot as a thin veneer over their views.  In each case, they fall into long monologs or sections that suggest the author is bored of trying to present their dystopian worlds as a canvas.  I would have gotten a C+ at best for any of these had I turned them in.<br /><br />What's interesting to me why these books are so different now.  In the case of 1984, I read it when that year was still in the future and it wasn't quite so dated.  But I was also 16 and perhaps not as critical a reader as I am now.  Or perhaps the end of the cold war and all that has happened since has just changed the way the world is.  Or maybe in my youth or ignorance I was more tolerant of these black-and-white views of the world.<br /><br />So in a way, it's worth re-reading as a way of reflection on ones past.

TV cameras are everywhere and your communications are intercepted.<br /><br />The good and bad things in life are given new names. Good = bad & Bad = good<br /><br />Some speech becomes PC (politically correct) and other speech is deleted from the language.<br /><br />Orwell was certainly concerned about fascism and communism. But he was also concerned with tendencies in democracies towards suppression of minorities and their aspirations.<br /><br />Orwell was not the first or the last political writer who foresaw oppression by majority rule. Alexis de Tocqueville commented on the tendency in America to conformism and to \\""majoritarianism\\"", intolerance for other cultural traditions.<br /><br />Virtually all political commentators saw the threat of \\""bolshevism\\"", which was the Russian term for the \\""majority\\"" party in the legislative assembly. Under the Communists, \\""Bolshevism\\"" stood for the \\""dictatorship of the majority\\"", another term for the dictatorship of the proletariat. Majoritarianism. Totalitarian democracy.<br /><br />Both De Tocqueville and Orwell saw the risk of \\""democracy\\"" becoming \\""majoritarianism\\"" and then evolving into \\""totalitarian democracy\\"".<br /><br />The framers of the US Bill of Rights saw this danger too and added to the Constitution the safeguards that once served to make America a beacon for the rest of the world.<br /><br />1984 is a book worth reading because it shows how everything can go wrong when people place too much trust in Big Brother.<br /><br />Terrorism? Big Brother says that's what the bad guys do. We bomb people in far off places to make the world safe for democracy. The old and sick and women and children die when we sent in the drones. They just happened to sit down to dinner in the wrong place at the wrong time. Some \\""collateral damage\\"" happens.<br /><br />Spying? Big Brother says we spy only on foreign bad guys who contact local bad guys. If you are innocent, you don't have to worry.<br /><br />Orwell knew his history.<br /><br />When they came for the gypsies, I didn't protest because I'm not a gypsy.<br />When they came for the anarchists, I didn't protest because I'm not an anarchist.<br />When they came for the Jews, I didn't protest because I'm not a Jew.<br />But when they came for me, I saw there was nobody left in my street to protest.

It is ridiculous for people to constantly be comparing this or that aspect of society with 1984.

The book describes a society where the only information comes from the Ministry of &#34;Truth&#34; and where the past is readily changed to so that past predictions fit with the present.<br /><br />Today, we can get information from the government, corporate news, independent news, the countless citizen journalists, not to mention through our own social networks.  It may have been easy in Orwell's Oceania to put such a limit on information on a society that never emerged from the censorship and tight control over news that existed during WWII.  However, I think that it would not be possible for the government to expect or to exert that level of control over society now.<br /><br />It makes me tend to think that people who throw around &#34;Big Brother&#34; nowadays are being more melodramatic than furthering the political discourse.",2013-05-27

Before the novel 1984, Orwell was mainly known for his allegorical novel Animal Farm. These two novels, 1984 and Animal Farm sold more copies than any other two novels from a single author in the 20th century. 1984 is a novel that depicts the horrors of a totalitarian government and society. He wrote the novel at the beginning of the spread of Communist and totalitarian governments. This was a key issue in society and a main source of inspiration for Orwell, who was obsessed with social injustice, and warning of the dangers of totalitarianism. 1984 gives Orwell's description or warning of totalitarian regimes is so intense that it includes enough detail and pessimism to make even idealistic supporters of Communism and Socialism to think twice.<br />In 1984 the Earth has been separated into three separate super-states, Eastasia, Eurasia, and the state in which the novel takes place, Oceania. Oceania, the main setting, consists of modern day Great Britain and modern day United States. The totalitarian regime is under an entity call \\""Big Brother\\"" and the \\""Party.\\"" In Oceania English is still the common language. However, \\""Big Brother\\"" is transforming English into a new language called \\""Newspeak.\\"" \\""Newspeak\\"" is a language based on removing any thoughts against \\""Big Brother\\"" or any individual thought.<br />The plot of the novel is not able to be briefly summarized and still do it justice. 1984 is not a novel with a story; it is a novel with a warning. Orwell beautifully composes a warning against totalitarianism and politically apathy, but in the focus of Winston Smith, a small insignificant Party member. Orwell creates a story that intertwines both the political and economic structure of Oceania along with Winston's quest for knowledge and freedom.<br />Orwell's novel'senduring impression with 1984 is not in the description of the political or economic structure of Oceania, but with the dull minuet details of the story. The dreariness of life under a totalitarian regime is the main issue Orwell addresses silently. He creates a lifeless society that would strike fear in anyone in support of a totalitarian government.  Orwell connects the situation in Oceania to the real world by including principles such as \\""doublethink\\"" that can be found in our society today. \\""Doublethink\\"" principles are dominant in society. Principles such as people must \\""fit into social norms\\"" but also be an \\""individual,\\"" follow your dreams, but you must find a secure job, and even affirmative action are all examples of \\""doublethink.\\"" Affirmative action is a perfect example of \\""doublethink\\"" in our society. It is used in hopes of ending discrimination by practicing it. To require a certain number of minorities attend school or are employed in a workplace is creating discrimination against non-minorities. This only continues the cycle of discrimination, and thus society supports something it says it is clearly opposed to.  This is how 1984 strikes home and how Orwell creates his timeless warning to society.<br />George Orwell's 1984 was written in 1948 as a warning against the totalitarianism rising in the post-war political climate, but the warning is a timeless one. The novel is brilliantly written and tells a crucially important message to society. It is a must read story, if not for the plot for the message.",2013-05-21

All my life I have heard references to this book and had a vague idea what it was about but it's only now that I'm in my 30s that I finally decided to go ahead and read it.  Now when I hear terms like &#34;thought police&#34;, &#34;thought crime&#34; or &#34;big brother&#34; I will know exactly what is being referred to instead of just making inferences about it.<br /><br />Certainly it's not the most pleasant book to read.  It's about the most totalitarian regime possible.  However I think it is an important book because it's so far from the reality those of us in the western world live with.  However there is at least one country in the world that could be compared surprisingly well with the regime in &#34;1984&#34;:  that is North Korea.  The real reason I got interested in reading this book now was because I've had a recent interest in learning about North Korea and as I discussed what I was learning with those around me, they kept making comments like, &#34;wow, that sure sounds a lot like that book '1984'&#34;.  As I read &#34;1984&#34;, I was thinking the very same thing:  that these people were dead on, that it was just like North Korea.  I therefore recommend reading this book along with books like &#34;Escape from Camp 14&#34; by Blaine Harden and &#34;The Aquariums of Pyongyang&#34; by Chol-hwan Kang and Pierre Rigoulot.  Both of these are biographies of people who have escaped North Korea and both are very eye opening.  I think that we can all learn a bit from studying these kinds of regimes so that we can hopefully avoid a similar situation in our own country, and also so that we can be aware and possibly able to help people who have had to live in regimes like this.",2013-05-18

This time I wanted to see the movie but a review of the movie said to be sure to read the book first.  However, it had been so long since I read 1984 that I decided to read it again.  First of all, I was really glad that I purchased the audio as well as the e-book, the narration was so well done and vivid and made it possible to read in the car when I wanted to get to the ending quicker.  But as far as the story, this book is still a good read and maybe even better as an adult than when I was a kid.  I found myself comparing it to even modern day politics and realizing that Orwelle's wasn't just a hypothetical / prophetic peek into the future of his time, but a peek in to the future of any power hungry totalitarian form of government.  It's still a cautionary tale and now I can't wait to see the movie to see how well they did.<br /><br />One little caveat that I've been thinking about since I first posted this review.  I heard awhile back that people couldn't get 1984 as an e-book and then that there were complaints that section(s) were missing.  I don't know if that's true but it sure could be and how 1984 of them if it is.  So as much as I like the e-books because they save the clutter and keep all of my books handy all the time - I started wondering if someday the books that we love so much will be gone (or even worse, altered) and maybe we really should keep a hard copy handy.  I haven't replaced this one in hard copy, but just a thought - especially if you see how possible 1984 is becoming even in our lifetime...remember the telescreens watching them?

It was always referred to by teachers, but references were never enough to make my realize what the book was exactly about.  The idea in my mind had been that the book was about an ideal look at the future of the world (America?) in 1984 (the book being written in the 1940's).<br /><br />Well, the idea wasn't exactly wrong, but it wasn't nearly the happy and bright world of the future I was expecting (lamely I was thinking Jetson's... go figure).<br /><br />So with a Kindle in hand, I decided I'd take it upon myself to explore many of the classics I never had to read as a student in school or even those I dismissed in the way the typical student with a narrow view of the world might.<br /><br />To start at the end of it all, the book was good.  It was much better than I expected.  Of course the idealized view of the world presented isn't the ideal we all want.  It's a utopian world that is to the extreme of being dystopian because the requirements to idealize everything requires a type of world control that isn't as far fetched as it may seem.<br /><br />I don't want to go into many details except to say that the book is disturbing yet enlightening.  If you have any awareness of the world around you, especially the world of the early 21st century, you'll see that many of the ideals aren't so far-fetched with our current world governments.  Many of the catch phrases such as Big-Brother come from this book, and it becomes very clear what these ideas refer to.  Of course the world isn't nearly so extreme, and I do think Orwell was exaggerating a viewpoint of what the world can be like. But in presenting the concepts in this manner, Orwell was hopefully making us aware of the slippery slope we may (now do) find ourselves in with respect to the perfect society.<br /><br />How close we are to what Orwell presented will depend on the reader.  I can see parallels with our US government of the last 10 years, but then again I realize that to be as close as suggested would be quite pessimistic.  Regardless of how close we may be, any reader should keep and open mind and awareness of what they learn from this book.  This isn't the happy world I expected, and ultimately I found it a bit of a depressing world to think of.<br /><br />Yet, in the end this one book makes me really understand the importance of this book as a classic.  This book does has its entertainment value, but its influence on the way we think and the awareness that comes out of the book is one that can't be dismissed.  It's not a difficult read, and the more people that read it and become aware of it, the better off we'll all be, and the less likely the society ruling this fictional world will ever become real if we are in fact headed that way.
