The writing is certainly good and Ford knows how to make believable characters, but where is the real source of interest in the story?  Maybe I'm just not the kind of reader who goes for novels that are entirely character-based.  I do like a good story with some surprises to keep me interested and this book just started to bore me about halfway through.",2011-11-12

All the way through, though, I could feel ambition and Big Ideas squirming under the story's surface.  I could almost smell Ford's sweat as he plotted parallels to great American classics like Walker Percy's THE MOVIEGOER (bemused Everyman stumbles on a kind of resigned grace) and even to Ralph Ellison's INVISIBLE MAN.  The last parallel (if intended) is especially specious, given that the underlying theme of THE SPORTSWRITER is: It's a hard row to hoe, being an upper-middle-class suburban white male these days.  I like that the character of Frank Bascomb is so unfabulous, and that he (and the book) explore the beauty and the limitations of middle ground (aka mediocrity).  But Frank is such a narrow person--thinking homosexuality a tragic mistake; obsessed with women but never allowing them their full humanity or a place in the larger world; calling Blacks \\""coloreds \\"" and Pole \\""Polacks\\""--that the reader keeps expecting the author to lead his character towards some major comeuppance.  But ole Frank gets off easy, and even gets the male mid-life crisis rewards of a fresh young woman, a bachelor pad in Florida, and an acceptance of his lot that looks suspiciously like resignation. That said, I would still recommend The SPORTSWRITER to certain people, for its occasional wisdom, but with this caveat: read it as you would a book from a less-enlightened time, when the author doesn't seem to know any better than to value only his own narrow ilk.  Far-reaching it ain't.  This type of old-school Everyman doesn't stand for much anymore, if he ever did.  But that the book is considered a new American classic tells us that the influential critics still think he does.",2001-02-01

And boring, too.","Richard Ford is a classic example of a writer who is writes for reviewers and award panels, not readers.  His book is a self-conscious literary exercise featuring a whiny lead character who cannot find any significant  meaning in his life, has no friends, and makes no commitments.  But for  some strange reason he does not simply commit suicide.  Of course, it is  easy (and likely to get you literary awards) to write about despair,  confusion and nihilism.  Literary critics like that kind of thing.  For a  book to be critically praised, it must feature ambiguity, irony, and a  certain self-conscious narrowness of the imagination.  Maybe it makes them  feel somehow superior.  Maybe it provides a temporary relief from the  loathing they feel about themselves and their society, their inability to  create anything of lasting merit.<br />Richard Ford succeeds at writing this  type of book.  But he writes it in a derivative connect-the-dots style.   It's been done many times in the past 50 years.  And been done better than  this. <br />The far more difficult, and far less trendy, thing is write about  how to get into the future, how to create values that will allow man to  find meaning in his life and evolve into a higher form of being.  But  Richard Ford does not attempt this.  The writing in The Sportswriter is  technically adequate, but morally quite played out.  Don't waste your time.",1999-01-16

It must be a literary current, because many others american writers - Franzen, and even De Lillo - are doing the same thing, and in the movies it happens the same (one for all: &#34;August: Osage County&#34;).
